        "body": "Chinese scientists say the novel coronavirus will not be eradicated, adding to a growing consensus around the world that the pathogen will likely return in waves like the flu.\n\nIt's unlikely the new virus will disappear the way its close cousin SARS did 17 years ago, as it infects some people without causing obvious symptoms like fever. This group of so-called asymptomatic carriers makes it hard to fully contain transmission as they can spread the virus undetected, a group of Chinese viral and medical researchers told reporters in Beijing at a briefing Monday.\n\nWith SARS, those infected became seriously ill. Once they were quarantined from others, the virus stopped spreading. In contrast, China is still finding dozens of asymptomatic cases of the coronavirus every day despite bringing its epidemic under control.\n\n\"This is very likely to be an epidemic that co-exists with humans for a long time, becomes seasonal and is sustained within human bodies,\" said Jin Qi, director of the Institute of Pathogen Biology at China's top medial research institute, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\nA consensus is forming among top researchers and governments worldwide that the virus is unlikely to be eliminated, despite costly lockdowns that have brought much of the global economy to a halt. Some public health experts are calling for the virus to be allowed to spread in a controlled way through younger populations like India's, while countries like Sweden have opted out of strict lockdowns.\n\nRead more on how herd immunity could work for poor countries\n\nAnthony Fauci, the director of U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said last month that Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, could become a seasonal ailment. He cited as evidence cases now showing up in countries across the southern hemisphere as they enter their winter seasons.\n\nMore than 3 million people have been sickened and over 210,000 killed in the global pandemic.\n\nWhile some, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have expressed hope that the virus's spread will slow as the temperature in northern hemisphere countries rises in the summer, Chinese experts on Monday said that they found no evidence for this.\n\n\"The virus is heat sensitive, but that's when it's exposed to 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes and the weather is never going to get that hot,\" said Wang Guiqiang, head of the infectious diseases department of Peking University First Hospital. \"So globally, even during the summer, the chance of cases going down significantly is small.\"",

Sign up here for our daily newsletter on what you need to know.\n\nIt had been over a month since Mirabai Nicholson-McKellar was infected with the coronavirus, and the 35-year-old filmmaker thought she was on her way to recovery. Then the shortness of breath came back, followed by chest pains.\n\nA visit to the emergency room and a second test for Covid-19 gave another positive result. Just three days earlier, she'd been cleared by health authorities in Australia's New South Wales state, and was allowed to end her home quarantine after going 72 hours without symptoms.\n\n\"When is this going to end? I think about that constantly,\" she said of the twists and turns in her health. \"Am I still contagious? How do I know if I'm not contagious?\"\n\nHer experience adds to a growing number of reports of patients appearing to have a reactivation of symptoms, testing positive again, or even potentially being reinfected. Such incidents don't align with the generally accepted understanding of how virus infections work and spread.\n\nThis so-called false-dawn phenomenon is puzzling health experts as they try to come to grips with the mysterious pathogen that emerged only five months ago. Solving the puzzle will inform a broad range of challenges, from the development of an effective vaccine to how soon governments may be able to safely end lockdowns and allow normal life to resume.\n\nMore immediately, the situation is taking a personal toll, making the journey of recovery a complex and frustrating ordeal for some of the more than 1 million survivors of the pandemic.\n\nSo far, there hasn't been enough research to conclude why symptoms seem to re-emerge in some people, and whether they experience reinfection or if the virus persists for weeks. One possibility is that Covid-19 causes blood clots that may cause potentially dangerous complications unless treated with anticoagulant medications, said Edwin J.R. van Beek, chair of clinical radiology at the University of Edinburgh's Queens Medical Research Institute.\n\nSouth Korean researchers also offered some clues this week when they reported that so-called nucleic acid tests might be positive based on the detection of dead viral particles that could give the false impression that a patient is still infectious when they're not.\n\nDead Coronavirus Particles Muddy the Outcome of Test Results\n\n\"Everyone's trying to figure this out,\" said Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious diseases professor at Stanford Medical School. \"What happens when people have been sick and infected -- are we going to consider them immune and, therefore, not susceptible at all? Or are they immune and serve as potential points of infection for other people?\"\n\nOfficials in countries that managed to suppress an initial wave of the pandemic are dreading the possibility that the virus may have a seasonal pattern and could return in the fall and repeat the nightmare scenario.\n\nHospitals already strained beyond their limits could see further demand if patients return. It also poses long-term implications for social safety nets and insurers as some struggle with the lingering effects of the coronavirus on their day-to-day life and health. Severe cases that require ventilators and ICU stays would need continued follow-up care as they recover from the ordeal, further pressuring health-care systems.\n\nLife After Ventilators Can Be Hell for Coronavirus Survivors\n\nThere can also be a growing psychological cost. Governments may try to isolate survivors for longer in fear that they are still infectious, adding more anxiety to patients already suffering from the uncertainty of when they will be deemed healthy again.\n\n\"A lot of patients will suffer mental health issues,\" said Michelle Biehl, a critical-care pulmonary doctor at Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. \"They'll have anxiety, depression, PTSD.\"\n\nAs the number of recovered patients expand, the burden will begin to shift down the medical practice chain, Biehl said. More primary care doctors, mental health specialists and physical therapists will be seeing survivors.\n\n\"You send them home and what happens then?\" asked Maldonado. \"From the outpatient side, we're just starting to get to that point where we're seeing people in the longer term.\"\n\nThere's consensus that so-called herd immunity is key to ending the pandemic, but with a vaccine unlikely to be widely available this year, it will depend on factors such as how long people who've recovered have immunity and what percentage of people must be immune to protect the \"herd.\"\n\nCatching Covid-19 May Not Protect You Against New Infection\n\nThere's \"a lot of unknowns and uncertainty in the development of individual immunity,\" said Kentaro Iwata, a professor of infectious diseases at Japan's Kobe University. \"Development of antibody inside the body is not necessarily development of immunity against this disease.\"\n\nThe unknowns concerning infectiousness, immunity and lingering symptoms create frustrating dilemmas for patients like Daniela Alves. The London resident paid 200 pounds ($251) for a private test that told her she was positive. Like Nicholson-McKellar, she was never hospitalized but had coughs, shortness of breath and aches that came and went for weeks, never in a straight path toward recuperating, leaving her uncertain of the state of her health.\n\n\"I don't know when I'm going to be negative so I can go outside,\" she said. \"Do I have to pay another 200 pounds so I know I'm safe to others?\"",

        "body": "Forcing meat-processing plants to reopen could cause long-term food supply disruptions that make current closures look trivial.\n\nOn Tuesday night, President Trump signed an executive order that could shield meat producers from lawsuits waged by workers who've contracted Covid-19. The order also pressures meat-processing plants to remain open \"to ensure a continued supply of protein to Americans\" and to reverse \"unnecessary closures.\" This is a reckless and uninformed move. Even as threats to the global food supply increase, along with the costs of plant closures, the lives of thousands of workers could be imperiled if these facilities rush to reopen. The plan could also backfire -- causing large-scale, long-term, global food supply disruptions that make the current plant closures look trivial.\n\nSixteen major poultry, pork and beef processing centers in the U.S. closed in recent weeks after they became Covid-19 hotbeds, including the Smithfield Foods pork plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, the Tyson Foods chicken-processing center in Waterloo, Iowa and the Cargill meat plant in Hazleton, Pennsylvania. As of Tuesday, there were more than 4,135 reported Covid-19 cases tied to 75 meat-processing plants in 25 states, according to the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting. Among the infected workers, 18 have died across nine states.\n\nPork production has been hit the hardest. Nearly half of all hog processing in the U.S. is currently offline, whereas poultry and beef production have barely dipped. The story of the Smithfield facility in Sioux Falls, which processes 5% of the pork produced in the United Sates, is a cautionary tale about the risks of operating a processing plant with sickened employees -- and it bears out key criteria for safe reopening.\n\nUnder normal conditions at the Sioux Falls plant, 20,000 hogs a day -- 1,300 per hour -- are slaughtered and rendered into chops, strips, loins and ground meat. The workers here do fast-paced, shoulder-to-shoulder work, often in warm, wet conditions -- the kind of environment that increases the risk of communicable diseases. Until the facility was shuttered on April 11, it was the number one Covid-19 hotspot in the United States. Even now, as the plant lays dormant, it remains in the country's top hotspots. Nearly a quarter of the plant's workers -- about 900 of 3,700 -- have contracted the virus, as have hundreds of the employees' family members.\n\nRead more: The Coronavirus Won't Bring the End of Big Meat\n\nLabor leaders who represent the workers at the Sioux Falls plant are balking at President Trump's executive order and condemning a statement made Monday by South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem on Fox News that she wants to reopen the Smithfield plant \"in a matter of days.\"\n\nMustafa Kolombo, a longtime line-worker for Smithfield, who represents the plant's employees at the local labor union, United Food and Commercial Workers, says the governor is showing little regard for the lives of workers. \"We would like to come to work, but, how will we, if it's not safe for us?\" he told me in an interview. Kolombo wants Governor Noem and President Trump \"to put the lives of workers and our families into consideration before they rush out to force the company to reopen.\"\n\nTrump's executive order may also encourage plant operators to cut corners on the CDC's safety recommendations. Last week, the CDC conducted an inspection of the Sioux Falls plant and produced a 15-page report with recommendations for Smithfield management and the South Dakota Department of Health. The report underscores the importance of testing workers before they return to facility, of providing proper PPE for every employee and of reforming plant operations to allow for social distancing.\n\nYet, Kolombo said, \"We have gotten no guarantee that any of these recommendations will be met.\"\n\nKolombo applauds Smithfield for inviting the CDC to conduct its inspection and for agreeing to give its employees two weeks of full wages and benefits through May 1. But he estimates that it will take \"at least 4 to 5 weeks\" to implement the CDC recommendations before the plant is reopened, during which time the workers and their families should remain in quarantine and continue to receive company support.\n\nThere's good reason to believe that it will take weeks, not days, before the plant operators can fully meet safety recommendations -- if they can be met at all.\n\nThe CDC recommendations are, to begin with, voluntary. Kooper Caraway, the president of the Sioux Falls AFL-CIO, told me that the report \"goes out of its way to say that its recommendations are not enforceable\" by law. And on Sunday, April 26, the CDC quietly announced on its website that \"critical infrastructure workers\" -- who include meat and poultry processors -- \"may be permitted to continue work following potential exposure to COVID-19, provided they remain asymptomatic.\"\n\nThe statement is confounding given that the CDC has acknowledged that Covid-19 can be transmitted by carriers who show no symptoms. Comprehensive testing is the only way to ensure that workers with Covid-19 don't spread the disease. But it's highly unlikely that thousands of tests can be obtained, let alone administered, in a matter of days if Smithfield rushes to reopen the plant.\n\nIt's also unlikely that the plant will get adequate PPE. The Food Safety and Inspection Service has already tried to place large orders for PPE and hand sanitizer for federal food inspectors, yet the delivery date keeps getting pushed back.\n\nInternally, plant workers had been asking for increased PPE and social distancing measures since early March, to no avail. Smithfield mishandled the early stages of the outbreak, says Kolombo, and, as a result, \"there is now so much fear and hurt among our workers and so little trust.\"\n\nThe Sioux Falls plant is known to be one of the most diverse in the nation. The employees speak 40 different languages -- mostly Spanish, Nepalese, Swahili and Amharic -- and a hundred different dialects. They had been getting early-warning calls from their families in Asia, Europe and across the African continent as the pandemic spread overseas. Union leaders pushed management to do temperature checks, increase sanitizer stations, implement social distancing and schedule breaks.\n\n\"Management drug its feet. They didn't think it was necessary,\" says Caraway, adding that Smithfield offered a $500 \"responsibility bonus\" to any worker who didn't call in sick during the month of April. \"It was a very tone-deaf way of addressing a pandemic,\" he says. Now, Trump's executive order further disempowers the 900 Smithfield employees and their family members who have contracted Covid-19, by limiting their ability to recoup the costs of their illness via lawsuits.\n\nSmithfield, as well as South Dakota Governor Noem, blamed the spread of the disease not on what was happening inside the plant, but rather on employees' close-knit lifestyles -- a notion Kolombo found disrespectful and discriminatory. \"Blaming employees who are essential to your organization is ungrateful. We invest our lives, our time, our energy, our everything [in our jobs]. The governor of our state and the company we work for have insulted our dignity,\" he says.\n\nThere's no question that Governor Noem, who has not implemented a stay-at-home order, nor a temporary ban on evictions and foreclosures in her state, is motivated by fears of economic freefall. The Smithfield plant is one of the largest engines of GDP in the region, producing 18 million servings of pork a day, and it hemorrhages revenue every hour it's offline.\n\nAnd Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken says disruption is rippling up and down the supply chain, especially among the 550 hog farmers who sell their animals to the Smithfield plant. \"I bet I got two dozen calls to my office yesterday from hog farmers. One said, 'Mayor, I had to shoot and kill three thousand hogs today because there's no market for them right now.'\" TenHaken added that the Sioux Falls city landfill is now \"having to alter our operations to accept euthanized pork.\"\n\nPork farmers face the terrible specter of having to euthanize their animals by the tens of thousands in the coming weeks. This is a food crisis in its own right, and there must be a coordinated effort at the local, state and national level to help these producers redirect their animals to local meat lockers, food banks and the many processing facilities nationwide that are still safely operating.\n\nBut we need to be wary of claims by meat industry executives that a global food security crisis is nigh. \"The food supply chain is breaking,\" wrote Tyson Foods chairman, John Tyson, in a full-page ad on Sunday. He cautioned that \"millions of pounds of meat\" will vanish from groceries and \"millions of animals -- chickens, pigs and cattle -- will be depopulated because of the closure of our processing facilities.\"\n\nLet's be clear: U.S. consumers will not be forced to go vegan anytime soon. The threats to protein production are real, but meat companies have large reserves of product in cold storage that can temporarily fulfill consumer demand while the plants remain offline. Forcing coronavirus-affected meat plants to stay open is hardly the solution to an emerging crisis -- instead, it will only deepen it.\n\nSmithfield did not grant my requests for an interview, but in a public statement, the company's CEO, Ken Sullivan, stressed his \"obligation to help feed the country, now more than ever. We have a stark choice as a nation: we are either going to produce food or not, even in the face of COVID-19.\" This is shortsighted. Sullivan's primary responsibility is not to his consumers, but rather to the health and wellbeing of his employees, without whom none of his food can be produced.\n\nTrump's executive order empowers his Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, and meat companies to carry out his directives. In the coming weeks, the decisions made by Perdue, Ken Sullivan, John Tyson and other industry leaders will define the future of their industry. They must proceed with great care and caution. They must ask bacon-loving consumers like me to adapt to the near-term reality of lower volumes and higher costs of meat. Chances are good that most of us, especially those in higher income brackets, can survive with fewer hot dogs and sausages patties for a few months (we might even be better for it).\n\nIf, instead, the President and meat industry leaders panic -- if they force plant workers to operate in unsafe conditions so that huge volumes of low-cost meat can continue to flow to global consumers -- we'll be looking at future waves of plant shutdowns far more economically devastating than the cost of getting it right, right now.",

    "A Post-Lockdown Preview of the Future of High-End Restaurants": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "When guests are seated at Michelin-starred Arcane in Hong Kong's Central business district, they will find discreet envelopes on their table into which they can insert their face masks. They must be wearing masks upon showing up at the front desk, which will use a non-contact, infrared thermometer to take their temperatures. And they'll have had to answer these three questions: 1. Have you traveled in the past 14 days? 2. Have you come into contact with anyone who has shown symptoms of coronavirus? 3. Have you experienced any symptoms yourself?\n\nIf everything in order, the customers can set down their mobile phones and personal hand sanitizers on the white tablecloth and begin enjoying carpaccio of Hokkaido scallop, lamb with Jerusalem artichokes, toasted peanut ice cream (with a chocolate chip cookie) and other dishes from chef Shane Osborn's kitchen. As masked waiters whisk out the elegant plates, the customers can be confident that they are separated by the city-regulated 1.5 meters (about 5 feet) from other visitors in the dining room. If they've chosen to eat at the counter of the open kitchen, each diner will be separated from neighboring customers by plexiglass panels as masked cooks hand out the beautifully plated food.\n\nIs this the post-lockdown future of the world's fine-dining restaurants?\n\nArcane is dealing with Hong Kong's new requirements. Similar rules are being contemplated in London, New York and other cities with food cultures just as intense as Hong Kong's -- with much hand-wringing about how masks and temperature guns will alter the high-toned atmosphere that is intrinsic to the appeal of these restaurants. \"Servers with face masks? I just don't see that is what we are all about,\" says Clare Smyth, chef-owner of Core in London's Notting Hill. Similarly, in New York, legendary restaurateur (and Shake Shack founder) Danny Meyer says he isn't even contemplating reopening the renowned Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe. \"There is no interest or excitement to having half of our dining rooms full while everyone is taking temperatures, wearing masks for not much money,\" he says.\n\nArcane isn't making the money it did before the crisis. It is, however, seeing its tables filling up at lunch and dinner, albeit at a seating capacity brought down by more than 40% to comply with Hong Kong's new rules (which were relaxed from a much more punishing 50%). The sense of safety is key for customers, says the Australian-born Osborn, who won two Michelin stars for London's Pied a Terre before he left for Asia. \"You need to show you are being very proactive just to let them relax.\" He says that even regulars were anxious when they walked into the restaurant \"but they are more comfortable now because they can see how much we care about safety and hygiene. When they go to the washroom, we sanitize the door handles when they come in and again whey they go out.\" There are hand sanitizer stations in every corner of Arcane. And Osborn says, \"some customers spray the cutlery and the wine glasses with their own sanitizer.\"\n\nOf course, restaurants in Hong Kong have an advantage. People there -- like much of Asia -- are used to masks. \"If you have a cold or anything, you wear one to protect other people,\" says Rainer Becker, the owner of Zuma, the plush and posh Japanese restaurant also in Central. \"It's not a problem and you get used to it.\" At Zuma, the entire staff wears masks. \"We check the temperatures of guests as they arrive. We haven't put in screens but we have spaced our tables and comply with all the regulations.\" Becker says the business is down 30% compared to the same time last year.\n\nYet there's another attraction that restaurants everywhere still possess -- their ability to satisfy the need for people to get out and enjoy good food and good company. Enrique Olvera, chef of Pujol in Mexico City, concedes that, to reopen, restaurants will have to comply with new health regulations. But, he says, \"most of us realize the joy that a good meal brings to our life. Socializing is not only necessary, but healthy. Fine dining should become a refuge for people that crave those things. Good food and good conversation will always have a central space in our societies.\"\n\nThe desire for conviviality may be just the thing to keep restaurants going. Many well-regarded, foodie-meccas in London and New York have kept up a measure of lock-down commerce by resorting to takeaway and delivery to satisfy their fans. In Manhattan, chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske Valtierra have combined their popular but shuttered Contra and Wildair restaurants into a delivery service called Contrair. In London, chef Jeremy Chan of the African-inspired Ikoyi is thinking of a hybrid operation once the city allows restaurants to reopen: sit-down dining in a room with fewer tables plus takeaway that preserve the nature of his cuisine. \"We would most likely only do two seatings for dinner and at least half our regular capacity,\" says Chan. \"In this way we can still offer ambitious cooking in a safe format.\"\n\nStill, it won't be easy, as Osborn realizes as he runs Arcane and his more casual Cornerstone (which does have plexiglass panels separating tables). \"In March, our business at Arcane was down 65%. In April, it was 45%. Those are huge losses. We had to let a couple of staff go and all the staff had to take unpaid leave in March and April to see us through. We are talking now to our landlords about rent.\"\n\nAnd he's had to change business hours to deal with what his customers need. \"People still want to go out to eat but it's harder to get reservations,\" he says, because the regulations have cut down the number of tables dramatically and because it takes longer to clean up after each table is vacated. \"So people are willing to eat earlier. We are opening earlier now at Arcane, 6 p.m. instead of 6:30 p.m.\" For lunch, customers are also willing to eat later, at 2 or 2:30 pm. In the meantime, he says, \"we've reduced down our menus, with fewer dishes. Hong Kong imports 95% of produce, so prices have gone up massively. It is much harder to get produce in. We used to offer six starters and six mains, but now that is five and five. We used to run three or four specials and it's now one or two. We are trying to run on a skeleton staff.\"\n\nBut Osborn -- who's competed in Netflix's The Final Table -- isn't giving up, despite the changes in the market and the limits placed on the restaurants by new regulations. \"We are certainly planning on operating under these restrictions at least until August or September,\" he says when they might be further eased. And, he adds, \"We are in for the long haul on this.\"",

        "body": "An Abbott Laboratories Covid-19 test has potential accuracy issues, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned, citing a number of studies that have raised doubts about the product's precision when used to quickly diagnose patients.\n\nThe FDA issued a public alert Thursday evening, saying that it had become aware of several scientific studies that raised questions about the device, a printer-sized machine called ID Now that can take a sample from a nasal swab and diagnose a coronavirus infection in less than 15 minutes. The agency said that it was particularly concerned about false-negative results, in which an infected person is told by the test that they don't have the disease.\n\n\"We are still evaluating the information about inaccurate results and are in direct communications with Abbott about this important issue,\" Tim Stenzel, director of the FDA's Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health, said in a statement.\n\nAbbott shares fell 2.3% to $89.65 at 12:09 p.m. in New York. The stock is up 3.3% this year to date, in part because the company quickly introduced diagnostic products to help combat the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 85,000 people in the U.S.\n\nThere have been 15 reports of adverse events tied to the tests, said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, out of more than 1.8 million that have been run. The agency and the company are studying those cases, which could have stemmed from something as simple as a user error, he said.\n\n\"We gotta get to where the evidence is, we gotta get to the bottom of it, but we still have confidence in the test or we wouldn't have it on the market,\" Azar said during an interview on Fox Business Friday.\n\nThe company said it's working with the FDA and health care providers to make sure they understand that negative results should be considered just one part of a person's health history, along with recent exposure to the virus and signs and symptoms of Covid-19. It is also re-emphasizing the proper way to collect and handle samples, as some tests are being run in ways the device wasn't intended to be used, the Abbott Park, Illinois-based company said in a statement.\n\nAccurate test results are important for understanding and controlling the outbreak, particularly since they are used to help guide personal behavior. Someone who is erroneously told they aren't infected may have a false sense of security and could infect others if they don't take precautions. False-negative results can also impede efforts to identify patients and trace their contacts, a key part of expanding efforts by states to track and contain the virus as they reopen businesses and lift social distancing rules.\n\nThe FDA said that the Abbott test, which has been used at the White House, can still be used to diagnose positive results, often within minutes. But it warned that a negative result might need to be confirmed with a high sensitivity test to be certain the person doesn't have the virus.\n\nThe FDA's alert comes as research is raising more questions about tests used around the U.S. to diagnose Covid-19 patients. One study released this week from researchers at New York University examining the Abbott machine indicated it may miss as many as half of positive cases.\n\nAbbott acknowledged in its statement that some studies have raised questions about how accurate the test is, though it previously said users have reported false-negative rates of only around 0.02%. It is continuing to improve on the test as the world learns more about the virus, the company said.\n\n\"While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors,\" Abbott said in the statement. The company said that sample handling, storage and transportation could all affect performance, as well as other features.",

    "After Four Antibody Tests, I'm Still Not Sure I've Had Covid-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Central London was deserted when I arrived at the clinic for my first test for antibodies to the novel coronavirus. After more than a month stuck at home under lockdown, I'd anxiously donned a mask and ventured into the city's financial district, where a doctor was offering a test.\n\nLike many struggling through the pandemic, I suspected that I might have been infected with Covid-19 a while back and was eager to find out for sure. The doctor took a small lancet, pricked my finger and pipetted a drop of blood into a plastic cassette. As the weak control line began forming in the results window, I nervously waited to see if I'd had it.\n\nIt was the first of what turned into a series of maddening, discomfiting, nerve-wracking tests with conflicting results that left me even more anxious -- and with more questions than at the start. Countless people such as me have been having \"I think I might have had it\" conversations around virtual watercoolers during the lockdown. Antibody testing has been trumpeted by U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson and other world leaders as a potential game changer to reopen economies and lift lockdowns. Officials around the world have floated the idea of immunity passports for those who have recovered from Covid-19.\n\nBut scientists have cast doubt on the accuracy of rapid antibody test kits available on the market. If the tests aren't accurate, they can't be used to let people safely go back to their workplaces. So I plunged myself into the world of antibody testing to figure out if these kits are reliable or not.\n\nSurely if I took enough tests, I'd figure out if I'd most likely had it. Finding the tests wasn't easy. I tracked down a clinic that was offering one for \u00a3195 ($242). I bought other tests for just \u00a36.80 directly from the company after telling them I was doing a story and promising I would have a medical professional oversee the process. But my limited, unscientific experiment confirmed what experts have been cautioning: The tests that many hope might get us back to some sense of normalcy seem to be alarmingly contradictory.\n\nI thought I might have picked up Covid-19 during a mid-February family vacation in the French Alps. We'd spent a day skiing in Courmayeur just over the Italian border. At the time, Covid-19 was mushrooming in northern Italy, though the Aosta region around Courmayeur reported its first cases much later.\n\nBack in London, I started feeling unwell: headaches, chills, mild fever, a minor upset stomach, and extreme exhaustion. Still, a doctor from the U.K.'s National Health Service refused to test me because I didn't have a cough, telling me it couldn't be Covid-19. I recovered fairly quickly, and no one else in my family got ill, but as infections surged across Europe, especially among skiers returning home, my hunch that I'd had Covid-19 grew stronger.\n\nMy suspicions couldn't be confirmed with a standard test for the virus, which works only when people have the pathogen active in their bodies. To determine if you've ever been infected in the past, you need a test for the antibodies that persist long after the virus is gone, standing ready to repel it if it returns.\n\nScientists say lab-based antibody testing can be more sensitive than the rapid test kits and can also measure your levels of the antibody. (Lab tests can also sometimes produce varying results, depending on what antibodies they're targeting.) But dozens of companies around the world have started making rapid Covid-19 antibody tests that can give yes or no answers in as little as 10 minutes. The tests are simple to use, though they need to be administered by a medical professional. They resemble pregnancy tests but use blood instead of urine. None has been authorized for home use.\n\nIn the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration has given emergency use authorizations to about a dozen companies to market Covid-19 antibody tests, but it's also allowing dozens of additional companies to distribute tests without the agency itself having reviewed them. Roche Holding AG became the latest to win emergency use authorization for its antibody test, which it says is more accurate than the rapid kits because it uses an intravenous blood draw instead of a finger-prick sample.\n\nCritics say the FDA should be doing more to police the tests that are flooding the market. That hasn't stopped employers around the world from talking about testing staff as a way of getting people back to work, even though we don't know for certain whether having antibodies makes you immune for months or years -- if at all.\n\nWidespread antibody testing on populations could produce false positive results and lead some people to unwittingly spread the virus thinking they're immune, says Rosanna Peeling, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. That's because it isn't easy to make sure that tests are specific to the novel coronavirus and not to coronaviruses that cause the common cold, she says. \"The false positives could lead you to believe the population is more immune than the reality,\" she says.\n\nIt didn't take long for me to find out what she meant. At the London clinic for my first test, I impatiently watched for lines to appear on the testing device window. One line, next to IgM for immunoglobulin M, would tell whether I had the first wave of antibodies the body makes after an infection. The other, for IgG, indicates longer-lasting antibodies generated in the weeks following recovery.\n\nTen minutes later, nothing had appeared. I was negative. I should have felt happy that I'd escaped the virus that's killing hundreds of thousands worldwide, but I wasn't. I just wished I'd had it.\n\nI looked into the test, made by Germany's Nal Von Minden GmbH, which sells diagnostic kits for everything from influenza to sexually transmitted diseases. Its Covid-19 test is 99.2% specific, meaning it can reliably detect antibodies to Covid-19, rather than coronaviruses that cause the common cold. But its sensitivity to antibodies produced to fight the virus is just 91.8%. Almost 1 in 10 negative tests is wrong. And I'd had a negative test.\n\nTo complicate matters, the company altered the test to improve its accuracy after I'd taken mine, Thomas Zander, Nal Von Minden's chief executive officer, tells me. My negative test was likely correct, he says, but \"there's always a chance it's wrong. It's possible.\"\n\nLater that day, I took another test with the help of two London surgeons: Evangelos Efthimiou and his wife, Romana Kuchai, arriving at their home in west London with my mask and gloves at the ready. Efthimiou had suffered from Covid-19 symptoms at the beginning of April -- a mild fever, exhaustion, sore throat, chills, and anosmia (the loss of smell and taste that has been identified as Covid-19's calling card). He never got a swab test to confirm Covid-19 but stayed home for two weeks and later tested positive for coronavirus antibodies at his hospital.\n\nI brought with me a box of tests from Biopanda Reagents Ltd., a maker of rapid kits that's based in Belfast. The company has sold more than 300,000 Covid-19 antibody tests to countries including Bahrain and the Czech and Slovak republics, and it's allowed to sell them in the U.K. for use by medical professionals. Sitting at their kitchen table, Efthimiou and Kuchai helped me take the Biopanda test, squeezing blood out of my finger onto the cassette, just as I had done in central London. A pair of lines appeared beside the IgG and IgM. Now I was positive. How could that be?\n\nI asked the two doctors to take the Biopanda test as a kind of unscientific cross-check. It showed that Efthimiou had antibodies, but his lines were a bit darker than mine -- likely meaning he had a more recent infection or a stronger immune response. His wife, who never had symptoms, was negative, even though they were living in the same house when he was ill. \"I know quite a few people where one of the couple was negative and they weren't isolating from each other in their home,\" Kuchai says. \"We still don't fully understand this virus.\"\n\nThere's a reason why Biopanda's test might be more sensitive. When the immune system discovers an invader, it makes antibodies against a variety of the pathogen's proteins. The German kit tests only for antibodies to one protein, the so-called spike that enables the virus to enter cells. Biopanda also tests for antibodies to the nucleocapsid, a kind of viral shell, which is more abundant and easier to detect. (Roche's much vaunted new antibody test only targets nucleocapsid protein.) Biopanda says its test has a 98.3% specificity for IgG, the long-lasting antibodies, indicating a high accuracy for detecting Covid-19 antibodies without any cross-reactivity with the common cold coronaviruses. It says its studies have shown sensitivity to IgG at 99.9% as long as the blood sample is taken more than 21 days after the onset of symptoms.\n\nThat same day, I took a test by a Chinese company called Beijing Kewei Clinical Diagnostic Reagent Inc., which says it has validated its test and has notified the FDA of its intention to distribute kits in the U.S. I was also positive on that test and felt relieved. I figured the German test was an outlier.\n\nThree of the votes had been counted, and I was feeling good: I had a simple majority in the positive column. After suspecting for weeks that I'd had Covid-19, I was starting to believe it. But another test arrived a few days later. It was made by Hangzhou Realy Tech Co., a Chinese company that has also notified the FDA of its intention to distribute tests in the U.S. I thought I would again test positive, but no lines appeared. I was negative -- and totally frustrated.\n\nThe conflicting results could come down to companies sometimes using different targets to test. Some target specifically the spike protein, the nucleocapsid protein, or both, Peeling says. \"And whether they use the whole of the spiked protein or parts of the protein, we don't know,\" she says. \"When you have a positive result for Covid-19, it could be that there's a cross reaction with common coronaviruses that may be circulating now\" -- that is, I merely had a cold -- \"or you had it in the past.\"\n\nOn the final leg of my unscientific experiment, I tracked down a pediatric intensive care nurse, Deborah Lees, who lives around the corner from me. A mother of three, Lees had relatively mild symptoms -- a cough, fatigue, and low-grade fever -- and took a positive swab test for Covid-19 on March 24. More than two weeks later, her hospital performed a lab-based test that showed she had IgG antibodies but no IgM.\n\nSitting on her sofa, she pricked her finger to drop blood into the Biopanda test cassette -- the one in which I'd tested positive. Her results were negative. We were baffled. \"It's very confusing,\" she said. \"I thought I had antibodies, which takes away at least some of the fear, that at least you're protected to some extent.\"\n\nA representative of Biopanda, Han Yan, says: \"She may have had a weak antibody response, and our test wasn't sensitive enough to detect it.\"\n\nAfter four tests and conflicting cross-checks, I'm still not sure if I've had Covid-19. I'd like to think the Biopanda test is right, but if it couldn't pick up the nurse's antibodies, I wonder why it picked up mine. I worry that many of the tests on the market might give people a false sense that they have some immunity. Until we know more about this virus -- how it's transmitted and why some people are dodging it, despite being exposed -- I will continue to work from home, wear my mask and gloves in the supermarket, and try to stay 6 feet away from people when I venture outdoors.",

        "body": "Taking passenger temperatures seen as possible safety layer\n\nWe're tracking the latest on the coronavirus outbreak and the global response. Sign up here for our daily newsletter on what you need to know.\n\nAn airline trade group is in discussions with the U.S. Transportation Security Administration about using airport security screeners to perform temperature checks on passengers before they board aircraft.\n\nEnsuring that people with fevers aren't allowed to fly is seen as a possible safety layer that could reduce the risks of spreading the virus causing Covid-19 as well as boosting the confidence of customers. Airlines are losing billions of dollars as more than 90% of their passengers have stopped flying.\n\n\"I think it's fair to say that the Airlines for America trade association is leading the effort to advocate for some kind of health screening at the security checkpoint,\" Southwest Airlines Co. Chief Executive Officer Gary Kelly said on an earnings call Tuesday.\n\n\"The screening is there,\" Kelly said. \"So it seems very natural to be done at that point.\"\n\nThe talks between the TSA and airlines are still preliminary and it remains to be seen whether such a plan would be feasible and would actually make a difference in reducing infections, two people familiar with the discussions said. They asked not to be identified because the talks are sensitive and ongoing.\n\nTalk about temperature checks or other health-screening measures at airports -- measures that have been taken in some Asian countries -- comes as the large airlines in recent days all adopted policies requiring that passengers wear face masks during flights.\n\nIn spite of the recent actions, unions representing airline workers and TSA agents are seeking more protections.\n\nTSA said in a statement it has been discussing health-related issues with its parent agency, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"At this time, no decision has been made regarding specific health screening measures at airports,\" TSA said in the statement.\n\nRead more: Airline Passenger Counts Rebound Slightly -- to 1956 Levels\n\nAirlines for America, which represents the large airlines that sell the vast majority of tickets in the U.S., said in a statement that screening remains the responsibility of the government.\n\n\"This continues to be a rapidly evolving situation and U.S. carriers remain in close contact with multiple federal agencies, the administration, Congress, and public health experts as we prepare for a relaunch of our industry,\" the group said.\n\nAirline passenger levels have fallen to unprecedented lows as much of the nation is under stay-at-home directives and the U.S. death toll from Covid-19 surpassed 64,000.\n\nOn Thursday, 154,695 passengers went through TSA screening portals in the U.S., the most since March 29. But the levels remain just a fraction of last year. Thursday's total, for example, was 6% of the 2.5 million people who flew on the equivalent day in 2019.\n\nImplementing a requirement for temperature screening or other such measures would involve several controversial issues, say people familiar it. There are no clear rules for whether people prohibited from boarding a plane because of a fever would be able to get reimbursed for their tickets, for example.\n\nAlso, with protests erupting in states against lockdowns and other anti-virus protections, would the government endorse the mandatory screening?\n\nHealth checks also wouldn't be foolproof because people with the virus can be contagious without showing symptoms.",

    "All the Covid-19 Symptoms You Didn't Know About": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As the pandemic spreads around the world, doctors are beginning to scope the coronavirus's damage. Seen initially as a cause of viral pneumonia during the chaos of an explosion of cases in China, it's now emerging as an enigmatic pathogen capable of harming the body in a myriad of unexpected, and sometimes lethal, ways. Clinical manifestations range from common cold-like symptoms and bronchitis to more severe disease such as pneumonia, severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, multi-organ failure and even death. The illness may occur as a direct result of viral infection, as well as the body's response to it. Here's a snapshot of some of the symptoms Covid-19 causes, including some you might not have heard about.\n\nBlood -- fever and inflammation may disrupt blood vessels, rendering blood cells more prone to clumping while interfering with the body's ability to dissolve clots. That may trigger a clotting cascade that can lead to blood-vessel blockages in tissues and organs throughout the body. Life-threatening clots in the arteries of the lung, known as pulmonary emboli, may occur even after symptoms of the infection have resolved. Damaged blood vessels may become leaky and prone to bleeding. In children, inflammation of veins and arteries triggered by excessive immune activation may cause an illness similar to Kawasaki disease, an inflammatory disorder.\n\nBrain -- dysfunction in the lining of blood vessels and associated bleeding and clotting disorders may cause strokes and bleeding in the brain. Patients may also experience headache, dizziness, confusion, impaired consciousness, poor motor control, delirium and hallucinations.\n\nEyes -- red, puffy eyes, sometimes referred to as pink eye, may result from infection in the conjunctiva, the tissue that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye.\n\nGastrointestinal tract -- infection of cells lining the digestive tract may cause diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain. Blood-vessel blockages caused by abnormal clotting have been found to damage the bowel, requiring emergency surgery and resection.\n\nHands -- prickling or burning sensation in the hands and limbs may indicate Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare nervous-system disorder that may be triggered by aberrant immune responses to viral infection. Other symptoms of the syndrome include poor coordination, muscle weakness and temporary paralysis.\n\nHeart -- cardiac injury, sometimes leading to irregular heartbeat, heart failure, and cardiac arrest, may occur as a result of excess strain, inflammation of the heart muscle and coronary artery, blood clots, and overwhelming multi-organ illness. Infection, fever, and inflammation in people with existing heart-vessel blockages may cause their fatty plaques to break off, blocking or stopping blood flow in organs and tissues.\n\nLimbs -- obstructions in large blood vessels may cause insufficient flow, or acute ischemia, in the limbs. Severe vascular complications can be lethal. At least one reported cases resulted in lower limb amputation.\n\nLiver -- liver dysfunction may occur as a direct result of the viral infection, or more likely because of immune-mediated, systemic inflammation and circulatory blockages cutting blood flow to the organ.\n\nLungs -- the virus targets the epithelial cells that line and protect the respiratory tract as well as the walls of the tiny grape-like air sacs, or alveoli, through which gas exchange occurs to oxygenate the blood. Damage to alveoli and inflammation in the lungs can cause pneumonia, characterized by chest pain and shortness of breath. In severe cases, the lack of oxygen can trigger acute respiratory distress syndrome, leading to multi-organ-system failure.\n\nKidneys -- acute kidney injury may result from clots and impaired blood supply, or as a direct result of infection.\n\nNose and tongue -- while the virus can cause the sneezing and runny nose typical of a common cold, it can also disrupt the olfactory system, causing an abrupt full or partial loss of the sense of smell known as anosmia. Taste may also become distorted in a condition known as dyguesia.\n\nSkin -- hive-like rashes, small red dots and purplish discolorations on the legs and abdomen are part of a complex category of so-called paraviral dermatoses that may result from the body's immune response to the virus or from benign, superficial blood-vessel damage beneath the skin.\n\nToes -- purple rashes that resemble chickenpox, measles or chilblains may appear on the feet, especially of children and younger adults.",

        "body": "Privacy concerns, government squabbling are other obstacles\n\nApple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google earlier this month unveiled an ambitious plan to jury-rig billions of smartphones into coronavirus-tracking beacons, hoping to help public-health authorities fight the disease and pave the way to end lockdowns that have crippled the global economy.\n\nNow, just weeks after the announcement, the program is already facing serious challenges and it's unclear whether the system will ever be used at a large scale. Persistent concerns about privacy, weak consumer adoption, and the lack of a coordinated government effort on testing could all pose obstacles to the companies' push. Some governments have already struck out on their own, building systems used by millions without needing Apple and Google's help.\n\nThe tech giants' plan involves updating the software on billions of phones so consumers can use wireless technology to track who they come into contact with. If a person notifies the system that they have Covid-19, people who have been near them -- based on their device's proximity to others -- would get an alert saying they may be at risk. The plan removes technical problems around interoperability and battery life that were plaguing efforts to build such apps before.\n\nThe World Embraces Contact-Tracing Technology to Fight Covid-19\n\nIt's one of the most ambitious approaches yet to what's known as digital contact tracing, a way of using technology to supplement existing systems, which involve health workers manually tracking the disease's spread. Doctors and other health professionals say that a robust system for keeping tabs on exposure to infected individuals is essential to prevent a resurgence of the pandemic.\n\nOn Wednesday, the two companies launched updates that will let select developers begin building apps using the tools. A second phase of the project, to be released in the coming months, will have deeper integration with Apple's iOS and Google's Android operating systems to rely less on apps.\n\nThe partnership is unprecedented. Apple and Google are bitter business rivals, and have fought for years to outmaneuver each other in the industries they compete directly in, such as phones and internet browsers, as well as in areas that will unlock the technology of the future, like artificial intelligence. Together, the companies' phones are used by about a third of the world's population.\n\nAmazon Has a Europe Problem: Unions and Regulators Are Circling\n\nIn addition to coming together on this project, both companies have donated money and put resources toward other coronavirus-combating initiatives. But the problem may be too big even for the vaunted leaders of the tech industry to conquer.\n\n\"App-based contact tracing is something that has never worked,\" said Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge computer science department in the U.K. \"It's a straw that some people are grasping at out of do-something-itis.\"\n\nAnderson likens the rush to work on contact tracing as similar to other hype-induced tech trends, like artificial intelligence or Bitcoin. It's worth pointing out that Apple and Google have been eyeing the health-care industry for years, slowly experimenting with ways to push deeper into the lucrative field. Often, they've been met with skepticism and questions about privacy safeguards. Winning goodwill with coronavirus projects could help the companies sell health software or devices down the road.\n\nBut even if you take a less cynical view, there's only so much Apple and Google can do to help solve the problem. Contact tracing can only ever be part of a broader system that demands intensive and regular testing, something the U.S. so far hasn't been able to accomplish.\n\nTesting for Covid-19 needs to become much more accessible so people can know whether they have contracted the disease before they can consider telling an app they've got the virus. Even if the Apple-Google system preserves privacy, works accurately and is adopted by enough people, it has to be combined with frequent and widespread testing, as well as expensive manual contact tracing, said Daniel Kahn Gillmor, a senior staff technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, who focuses on privacy and technology.\n\nAnd many countries are far behind on testing. In the U.S., testing ramped up from essentially zero at the beginning of March to 150,000 a day in the first week of April, but it's since plateaued at around 200,000. Earlier this week, drug retailers such as CVS Health Corp., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Walmart Inc. said they would ramp up testing in store parking lots, potentially adding millions of new tests a month. Still, these testing operations are at an early stage, and so far have been confusing to patients and other customers.\n\nExperts say at least 500,000 tests will need to be done every day to make it safe to allow people to return to work and get the economy moving again. Some say the number is even higher, in the millions.\n\nTesting efforts are still beset by supply shortages and coordination issues, and governors including New York's Andrew Cuomo have accused the federal government of dragging its feet. (Michael Bloomberg, owner of Bloomberg LP, is leading a push in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut to expand testing and contact tracing.)\n\nThe potential of contact-tracing apps has been overestimated in an atmosphere where people are desperate for solutions, a trio of tech, legal and disease experts wrote in an article for the Brookings Institution think tank on Monday.\n\n\"We have serious doubts that voluntary, anonymous contact tracing through smartphone apps -- as Apple, Google, and faculty at a number of academic institutions all propose -- can free Americans of the terrible choice between staying home or risking exposure,\" the researchers said.\n\nAnother hurdle is trust -- convincing people that their data won't be hacked or used for other purposes if they opt into the system. Google, Apple and the other tech giants have faced intense scrutiny in recent years over how they use the data they collect. Health data is especially sensitive, given how personal it is.\n\nApple and Google have gone to great lengths to stress that their proposed contact-tracing technology, which last week they dubbed Exposure Notification, is secure. Privacy experts generally support the method, which uses constantly-changing ID codes and stores information on each individual's phone instead of a centralized cloud that could be hacked. Still, many consumers are wary of sharing information with tech companies after high-profile data breaches in the last several years. In an update to their original announcement, the companies said they'd made the system even more secure, encrypting the Bluetooth signals that emanate from each person's phone.\n\nBut some governments are saying Apple and Google's plan is too private to be useful. The U.K., which initially said it would work with \"the world's leading tech companies\" to build a contact-tracing app, has now rejected Apple and Google. Storing the information centrally helps health authorities track the virus' spread and move proactively to contain it. The tech giants' system doesn't allow for centralization, and only serves to tell individual people whether they've come into contact with someone who has the disease. That's not as useful for officials who want a big-picture idea of what's happening with the pandemic.\n\nBeyond the British system, there are a variety of other apps being deployed without Apple and Google's help. The French government wants to launch its own app in early May, and is asking Apple to remove a privacy restriction that would hamper the government's ability to pull Bluetooth data to its own server.\n\nIn Australia, more than 2 million people have downloaded the country's app for tracking, according to the country's government. That's still short of the 40% of Australia's 26 million citizens who will need to use it for it to be effective. India's government said 50 million people were using its own app just 13 days after launch.\n\nRegardless of who's building the app, getting enough people to participate is a challenge of its own. In Singapore, where a similar local system was in place before Apple and Google announced theirs, too few people downloaded the app to make it effective, and the city-state had to impose a lockdown instead.\n\nA month after Singapore's app went live, only about a fifth of the country had downloaded it. On April 21, the country's prime minister urged citizens to get with the program. \"There will be some privacy concerns, but we will have to weigh these against the benefits,\" he said in a televised address. If Singapore -- where residents' technology usage is among the highest in the world and citizens are accustomed to directives from the government -- can't ensure participation, it's hard to imagine widespread usage happening in the U.S.\n\nMaking the app mandatory could solve the adoption problem and ensure a large enough network of users to have a meaningful impact, but doing so might foment resistance or undermine trust in the system itself. In order for people to use it, it has to be voluntary, said the ACLU's Gillmor.\n\n\"The moment the systems appear to be punitive or enforced on people, people will move away from them,\" Gillmor said.\n\nThough most Americans seem to be following government guidelines on the virus so far, some are already bristling at the restrictions on movement and rules about wearing masks in public. Small protests have cropped up across the country and conservative media outlets and some politicians have demanded that governments \"open up\" their economies immediately.\n\nEven a compulsory system that used information from contact tracing to give certain people -- those who already had the virus, for example, or those whom the app showed hadn't been in contact with anyone positive -- more freedom to move around while limiting others would also be unfair, because it would be biased toward people with access to phones with a working Bluetooth signal. Those who couldn't participate might be left behind completely, Gillmor said.\n\n\"If the system is mandatory, that's going to potentially lock people out who are already fundamentally disadvantaged and already more at risk for Covid-19,\" he said.\n\nThere are also questions about whether Bluetooth, the wireless technology that picks up on other phones that come nearby, is accurate enough to ensure meaningful measurements. If there are too many false positives and people are warned to self-quarantine repeatedly but never develop symptoms, they may begin to believe the system isn't working.\n\nThe technological issues, at the least, can be addressed, said Micha Benoliel, co-founder of Nodle, a wireless-tech startup that has developed a contact-tracing app used in the city of Berkeley, California, and run by a nonprofit. Bluetooth is very accurate within distances of 6 feet, Benoliel said, which is exactly the range such an app would want for this purpose.\n\n\"The world is changing -- it will never be like it used to be,\" Benoliel said. \"If we want to have something close to a normal life, we need to have this kind of tool.\"",

        "body": "A survey of San Francisco's Mission District gives this virus lab its best chance yet at understanding coronavirus.\n\nA series of dispatches from America in the age of Covid-19.\n\nWord got out here that nasal swabs were the only thing standing between Northern California and a lot of coronavirus testing, and people with a talent for figuring out things began to figure things out. Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, flew a plane full of medical supplies from China to the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center, and some functional though less-than-ideal nasal swabs were happily among them.\n\nChris Kawaja, the owner of a chemical company with dealings in China, found another off-brand Chinese nasal swab supplier, and messaged them. \"I said, 'Hey, do you have these things?'\" says Kawaja. \"And this woman came right back and said, 'Yeah, I have 250,000.'\" These swabs were the real deal, but before Kawaja could nab them the Chinese woman sent another message to say, \"Some guy in Houston just took 200,000 of them.\" Kawaja charged the rest to his credit card -- at 70 cents a pop, triple the old market price -- and had them shipped to San Francisco in small batches, to evade the notice of Chinese customs officials. \"It did occur to me: Why did I need to find this stuff?\" says Kawaja. \"Why did some random dude in Marin need to read some random newspaper article about how Joe DeRisi needed swabs, and go and find the swabs?\"\n\nDeRisi is an infectious disease specialist and co-president of the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub in San Francisco. I've been following his work and have already written about how, in the first three weeks of March, he used a volunteer labor force of 200 graduate students to build the fastest big coronavirus testing lab in the country from scratch -- only to find that an absence of nasal swabs left him little to test. The swabs are no longer a problem, and the Biohub suddenly has a magic flashlight, with the power to see both where the virus hides and how it moves.\n\nThere's now the question of where to point it. Not, DeRisi thought, at people turning up at hospitals with coughs and fevers: Their tests didn't tell you much that you didn't already know about where the disease might next travel. Random sampling of some community, obvious as it sounds, might not be the best idea either. \"Just testing anyone may not be the right strategy,\" says DeRisi. \"You want to get the most bang for your buck. You want to go out and find the virus, so you can isolate it. We've been playing defense. Now we can start playing offense.\"\n\nThe first swabs the Biohub received that hinted at any sort of strategy came, oddly enough, from the weird and remote beach town of Bolinas, just north of San Francisco. The bookstore in Bolinas has no cash register but a sign telling customers to take whatever book they want and to stick however much they think it is worth into a collection box. The whole town is like that. A local entrepreneur named Cyrus Harmon, frustrated by his inability to get himself and his family tested, had gotten in touch with UCSF researchers and offered to pay to test all the town's 1,400 residents. He'd read the story of Vo, a village in Northern Italy, that has escaped the worst of the pandemic by testing all its residents and isolating the infected. It took Harmon and a venture capitalist also living in Bolinas three weeks to do for 1,400 California communists what the U.S. government and the big lab testing companies say they still can't do for 100 U.S. senators: Test everyone, fast.\n\nThere were some glitches. The first batch of Bolinas samples arrived at the Biohub in a garbage bag. \"Ten percent of the tubes had leaked,\" says DeRisi. \"Because they'd used shitty swabs that didn't fit inside the tubes.\" Even then it took DeRisi's graduate students less than two days to hand the entire town of Bolinas its results: No one had the virus.\n\nBolinas had never struck DeRisi, or anyone else, as the best place to go virus hunting. Rich people with lots of space and a preference for isolation were not the most likely hosts. But the idea of testing everyone in some town or neighborhood struck DeRisi as a good one, maybe even a great one. You just needed to go looking in places the virus was more likely to be hiding. One of them happened to be right around the corner.\n\n*****\n\nLast Sunday, my college sophomore daughter and I marched up and down every street in four square blocks in San Francisco's Mission District. These four square blocks constituted just another tract in the U.S. Census but were of special interest to a virus hunter: Less a typical American community than a place with aspects of many different American communities. It was as if someone had thrown the pieces to seven different jigsaw puzzles into one box. It has charming Victorian houses, less charming housing developments, and brutalist, densely packed apartment buildings. It has people living on the streets. It has upper middle class and really poor people. It has teleworkers and construction workers. It has four churches, a street of retail shops and a park. It holds a big working-class Latino population but also, like chips in a cookie, hipsters and tech bros -- though when I told my daughter this she said, \"Hipsters would never live anywhere near tech bros.\"\n\nWell, now they did and they had something else in common: They'd all been tested for the coronavirus. Or, at any rate, most of them. Over the previous week a team of 450 volunteers, supervised by a UCSF medical researcher named Diane Havlir, had drawn blood and swabbed the noses and throats of several thousand Mission residents, then sent the samples to DeRisi. In three days they'd taken nearly a third of the test samples collected in the greater San Francisco area since the pandemic's start.\n\nHavlir, an AIDS researcher, had earned the trust of the locals over many years of working with them to control that disease. Walking around you got a sense of the wariness she'd had to overcome. The lower floor windows of most every building had bars, like jail cells. Signs everywhere told strangers to keep out, and murals and graffiti had unkind words for ICE. Men without masks walked dogs without collars and both eyed you a bit as you passed them on the street. Even the sweet aspects of street life felt vaguely threatening: children, clearly from different households, playing together in the street; a card game in the park; seven men without masks, seated along a wall beside the park, too close to each other. What once seemed commonplace now left you wondering if you should call the department of public health.\n\nThe researchers announced the initial results of the Mission study on Monday. Just the positives and the negatives, not what is likely to be the more revealing data from the genetic analysis. But even those crude results paint a picture of how the virus might be getting around -- one that is clearer than just about any that the city, or for that matter, the country has had until now. \"The departments of public health are operating in a permanent mindset of scarcity,\" says DeRisi. \"They aren't doing any of this sort of sampling.\" Which is a great pity as it is amazing what it can reveal. Slightly more than 2% of the people tested in the four square blocks currently have the coronavirus, for instance. Only 1 in 10 of them has a fever and most have no symptoms at all -- which is to say that, absent the testing, they'd probably still be walking around and infecting people without knowing it.\n\nThere was more. Of the 981 white people tested, zero have the virus. Latinos are only 44% of the study but 95% of the positives. Men are a bit more than half of the sample but 75% of the positives. Just over half of the people tested say they're unable to work from home -- but that group registers 90% positive. Being in a crowded house appears to be a problem: nearly 30% of the positives come from households of more than five people, though those households make up only 15% of the population. Being poor is a bigger problem: people earning less than $50,000 a year are 89% of the positives, though only 39% of the group studied. Only a quarter of the people with the virus have a primary care doctor. Six of the people with the virus still haven't been located by the researchers, and informed that they're ill.\n\nThe data you get when you go out and test people without symptoms is different from the data you get when you only test those who show up in a hospital. You learn some of the same things -- for instance that the people most susceptible to the virus, and maybe also most likely to spread it, are the people who can't afford to isolate themselves. But the outside data might also tell us a whole bunch of stuff that the hospital data won't.\n\nJoe DeRisi and his volunteer army of grad students are now busy in their labs studying the genetic markings of the viruses they've found. And asking the questions that need to be answered, to reopen the society without lots more sickness and death. For example: How's this virus moving through society? \"There are all kinds of rumors,\" says DeRisi. \"Are kids the hidden vector? Or can you get it from a handrail? Those guys sitting along the wall beside the park -- are they the problem? Or is it the guys playing cards in the park?\" By studying the genomes of the samples, he may be able to answer those questions, and others. He'll be able to see, for instance, if parents are infecting their children or if it's the children infecting their parents. \"There's so much we don't know,\" says DeRisi. \"We honestly don't know what we're going to find. That's what's cool about it. It's science!\"",

Results from the treated patients were compared with those of 16 similarly severely ill patients who didn't get the drug.\n\nThose who got anakinra had a 72% lower chance of exhibiting signs of cytokine storm.

Roche has already ramped up production of the medicine, which has been adopted in some countries' treatment guidelines.\n\nThe trial of Kevzara suggested it might help only critically ill people, prompting Sanofi and Regeneron to push forward with a bigger study focused on dire cases.\n\nExperimental anti-inflammatory drugs are also being studied. GlaxoSmithKline Plc plans to start a trial by the end of May as to whether otilimab, under development for rheumatoid arthritis, could treat patients facing complications with Covid-19.",

        "body": "Lifting of social-distancing restrictions may come at a cost\n\nFor a fresh perspective on the stories that matter for Australian business and politics, sign up for our new weekly newsletter.\n\nSix weeks after shutting down swathes of the economy to contain the coronavirus, Australia is preparing to relax its lockdown on Friday. There could be a cost -- new clusters of infections just as the southern hemisphere heads into winter.\n\nClosing restaurants, cinemas and pubs and urging people to largely stay at home have seen the daily rate of new infections plunge to less than 0.5% from 20% about a month ago. Along with extensive testing and contact tracing, the restrictions have bought Australia's health system time to prepare for new outbreaks, as Prime Minister Scott Morrison looks to reboot the crippled economy.\n\nThe country of 25.7 million people, which had recorded 6,875 cases and 97 deaths as of Wednesday, will be among the first developed nations to test the resilience of its health system by lifting restrictions just as the weather turns colder. Morrison, who's heralded his government's success in flattening the curve, says the health system is in a good position to cope as he now turns to resuscitating the economy.\n\n\"When we move and start to ease some of these restrictions, of course you will see numbers increase in some areas, you will see outbreaks occur in other places,\" Morrison told reporters this week. \"What matters is how you deal with it, and how you respond to it.\"\n\nWill Warm Weather Curb Coronavirus? What Experts Say: QuickTake\n\nWhile seasonal flu often flares in winter in temperate climates, scientists are still investigating whether temperature plays a role in the coronavirus outbreak. Australia's experience may offer clues to what may happen a few months from now in the northern winter.\n\nAustralia has so far avoided the scale of sickness and death that's ravaged countries including the U.K., U.S. and Italy. Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and professor at the Australian National University Medical School, says Australia's handling of the outbreak has put it in \"probably the best position in the world.\"\n\n\"We closed borders very early, have had strong quarantine measures, traced just about every case and convinced the vast majority of Australians to adhere to social-distancing restrictions,\" Collignon said. \"Of course, the virus hasn't been eliminated, so we need to avoid thinking things will quickly return to business as usual.\"\n\nIn late January, Morrison announced the first of a string of border controls and enforced quarantine measures to limit and test arrivals from virus hotspots. He closed the nation to non-residents on March 19. Most Australian states and territories also imposed their own border restrictions.\n\nHealth authorities have ramped up testing and contact tracing. According to World Economic Forum data, as of April 26 the nation had conducted 19.9 diagnostic tests for Covid-19 per 1,000 people, compared with 15.6 tests in the U.S., 9.9 tests in the U.K and 1.8 in Japan. Some 5 million people have downloaded mobile-phone software designed to help trace coronavirus infections, though the government says that's still not enough for it to be effective.\n\nIn the past six weeks, Australia has also ramped up the number of intensive-care unit beds, most of which are currently idle. Initial shortfalls of personal protection and medical equipment have, in the main, been identified and alleviated.\n\nAccording to Collignon, the island continent has also benefited from its geographic isolation and the fact that its population mainly lives in suburban or regional areas, rather than in crowded cities. Still, he's urging the government to not wind back social-distancing restrictions, particularly for mass gatherings, until after winter.\n\n\"There's some basic principles that we can't compromise too much, particularly as winter is coming, because there's a risk that this will jump up and bite us again,\" he said.\n\nAt the heart of Australia's early success has been the cooperation between Morrison's federal government and the eight state and territory governments, which have put aside political rivalries to largely work in unison. Some states, which have seen days without new infections, have already started to relax social-distancing measures -- allowing picnics, water sports, hiking in national parks and reopening schools.\n\nBut there have been missteps. The most populous state of New South Wales and federal authorities fell into a blame game over why thousands of passengers were allowed to disembark the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney in March, even through 13 people on board suffered flu-like symptoms. Hundreds of cases across the nation and at least 20 deaths have been linked to the cruise ship.\n\nThe lockdown has taken a heavy economic toll: unemployment is poised to double by July to about 10% and the nation is veering toward its first recession in almost three decades. With restrictions costing the economy an estimated A$4 billion ($2.4 billion) a week, Morrison is keen to relax measures and has been drafting \"Covid-safe\" guidelines to help businesses return to work.\n\nBut the risks are clear. A cluster of almost 50 cases at a meat processing plant in Victoria state is a reminder of how outbreaks can emerge and potentially get out of hand, particularly with winter approaching.\n\n\"It's a very sobering reminder that if the government and the private sector want to get the economy back to some kind of normality, it will probably come at a cost,\" said Mary-Louise McLaws, an infectious diseases expert at the University of New South Wales.",

        "body": "Covid testing extended, tracing phone app misses launch target\n\nPressure mounted on Boris Johnson to be more open about his coronavirus strategy as a panel of lawmakers called on his government to publish the scientific advice behind Britain's response to the pandemic.\n\nThe prime minister also faced calls for transparency from thousands of teachers who joined an online meeting to demand clarity over plans to reopen schools in England next month.\n\nGreater openness will help maintain public support as the U.K. eases its lockdown, the House of Commons science committee said in a letter to the prime minister Tuesday. So far only 28 of 120 papers consulted by the U.K.'s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies has been published, they said.\n\n\"The strength of British science and the prominent role that scientific advice has played during the pandemic can be an important source of public confidence,\" Greg Clark, chairman of the committee and a member of Johnson's Conservative Party, wrote in the letter. \"Without visibility of the scientific advice, it will be difficult to corroborate the Government's assertion that it always follows the scientific advice.\"\n\nPolls show support slipping for Johnson's response to the virus, which has seen the U.K. record the second-highest number of deaths in the world, after a week of confused messages over the relaxation of the lockdown. Alongside other easing measures, the government wants schools to reopen to some pupils June 1, but teaching unions say they have yet to be shown evidence such a move would be safe.\n\nThe National Education Union said 20,000 members joined a zoom call with its general secretaries Mary Bousted and Kevin Courtney on Monday evening during which they answered questions about the union's demands for more details on safety provision and scientific evidence before they will back plans to restart classes.\n\nThe government argues reopening schools is vital to supporting the poorest children and protecting vulnerable pupils who are locked down in unsafe homes. Ministers say the risk of transmission from children to adults is low, but Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said his 31,000 members want to see the evidence.\n\n\"It's been asserted by the Government publicly over the weekend that there isn't the level of risk that we fear,\" Whiteman told BBC Radio on Monday. \"However, we haven't yet seen the scientific underpinning of that.\"\n\nThe devolved administrations in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales have been slower to lift restrictions on their populations as divisions grow between the strategies of London and regional capitals. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she will publish a \"route map\" Thursday, while Northern Ireland said it will allow small socially-distanced gatherings outside and the reopening of places of worship for individual prayer. Schools will stay closed.\n\nThe science committee also criticized Johnson's government for failing to learn from the experience of other countries as it attempted to increase testing capacity in the early stages of the outbreak in the U.K.\n\n\"Capacity was not increased early enough or boldly enough,\" Clark wrote. \"Capacity drove strategy, rather than strategy driving capacity.\"\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday that testing will be extended to anyone over 5 years old showing symptoms and told Parliament the U.K. is ready to start a national tracing program to control the disease.\n\nBut while 21,000 contact tracers have been recruited, including 7,500 health-care professionals who will give clinical advice to call handlers, the national launch of a contact-tracing mobile phone app has been delayed, in a setback to the tracing effort.\n\nA major expansion of the U.K.'s testing and tracing program is a key feature of its strategy to relax the virus lockdown, as the government seeks to emulate countries like South Korea and Germany in identifying where the virus is spreading so it can impose targeted restrictions. Virus tests were previously only available to certain groups of people, such as workers deemed 'essential' and the over-65s.\n\nA mobile phone app, which would form a crucial part of the tracing program, was supposed to be ready in mid-May. It is now planned to be released nationally within \"weeks,\" Johnson's spokesman James Slack told reporters on Monday.\n\nThe app, which is still being tested on the Isle of Wight, informs users when they've come into close contact with someone who may have had the virus. Ministers previously said it would be a key component of the U.K.'s strategy to relax lockdown measures.\n\n\"We are learning all the way as we go through this pandemic, not just on the scientific side but on the innovation that we need to get a grip on it,\" First Secretary of State Dominic Raab said at the daily Coronavirus briefing on Monday. \"We are making good progress on the testing and on the tracing and on the pilot in the Isle of Wight.\"",

        "body": "The angry resignation of Justice Minister Sergio Moro promises to mire the country deeper in political crisis and economic misery.\n\nWhen a congressional back-bencher with fringe right-wing ideas took office last year, many Brazilians held their breath. Some hoped and prayed that Jair Bolsonaro might rise to the occasion, moderate his rhetoric and compensate for his lack of executive experience by delegating to a first-rate cabinet. Leave it to the adults in the room -- Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, Vice President Hamilton Mourao, and Justice Minister Sergio Moro -- and all would turn out well. We know now that was a fever dream. Moro's acrimonious resignation on Friday, after accusing Bolsonaro of meddling in the justice system, is only the latest symptom.\n\nLess than a year and half on, the former army captain has clearly neither risen to the task nor delegated to the able. Instead Bolsonaro governs by trial and error, second-guessing his ministers in favor of a bilious claque of kin and confidants. The result: Brazil's presidency has shrunk even as the country's challenges grow larger than ever.\n\nIn a way, Moro's exit was a collision foretold. If Guedes was Bolsonaro's \"one-stop shop\" for righting Latin America's biggest market, he has gone conspicuously silent as the coronavirus pandemic roils the economy: When a government panel announced a national rescue plan, he was nowhere to be found. After Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta drew plaudits for choosing science over faith-based policies to confront the coronavirus pandemic, Bolsonaro fired him. When uncontrolled fires in the Amazon brought global criticism, Bolsonaro sacked the respected head of the space agency monitoring the rain forest and blamed the fires on partisan saboteurs.\n\nAfter presiding as a federal judge over the storied Carwash anti-corruption trials, Moro was hired as Bolsonaro's Mr. Clean in a government pledged to bury the \"old politics\" of cronyism and payola. To hear it from Bolsonaro, Moro left Brasilia a self-centered liar.\n\nTrue, Moro is no saint. His integrity took a beating last year, when hacked text messages leaked to the press showed that he had overreached, apparently coaching prosecutors in the storied Carwash case he presided over. And of course, ministers in any democracy serve at the chief executive's pleasure -- even super-ministers may fall.\n\nYet Moro's parting shot against Bolsonaro had the whiff of an unfinished row, not a rout. \"I am always at the country's disposal,\" Moro concluded in his provocative exit message. Despite his questionable Carwash actions, Moro was by far Bolsonaro's most popular minister. Judging by the markets, he will be missed. Stock prices slumped at one point by nearly 10% on Friday and the real tanked against the dollar, forcing the central bank to intervene four times in the foreign exchange market.\n\nAmong his motives for resigning, Moro cited Bolsonaro's alleged attempts to interfere in criminal investigations, pressure cops and stack the police with friends. Tellingly, Bolsonaro's reshuffling of the federal police comes as investigators close in on his eldest son Flavio for allegedly commanding a kickback scheme and second eldest son Carlos for allegedly ginning up fake news against members of the Supreme Court. The federal police chief who was sacked against Moro's will was \"tired of being harassed\" by Bolsonaro to step down, Moro later tweeted.\n\nBolsonaro denied any wrongdoing. In a long, rambling statement on Friday, he defended his honor \"as a man, a soldier and a Christian.\" He went on to rebut charges that he'd meddled in police work, although he admitted to demanding government intel on some pending investigations and to soliciting, \"almost imploring,\" the federal police to probe certain cases involving his family, including the man who stabbed him on the campaign trail in 2018 and was later found to be mentally impaired.\n\nDespite Bolsonaro's denials, Moro last night released text messages showing that he had recommended swapping out several federal police investigators who were probing wrongdoing by several legislators loyal to his government. If the charges hold up in congress, the only court where sitting politicians may be judged, they could be grist for impeachment. Brazil has been there before. Two of Brazil's last four popularly elected presidents were removed by impeachment, the last one less than four years ago, with a push from then federal congressman Bolsonaro.\n\nTellingly, Bolsonaro is bleeding allies and credibility. After an internal row, he abandoned the political party he rode to office 16 months ago, and his new party has yet to pass the eligibility bar by electoral authorities. With no solid legislative base, he has lost control of the congressional agenda. His response? Turn adversaries into enemies, starting with influential congressional speaker Rodrigo Maia, and wave on the loyal Bolsonaristas who clamor for closing the congress and the Supreme Court.\n\nMoro's departure amid an unprecedented health emergency and the worst economic slump since the Great Depression drops a full-blown political crisis onto Brazil's miseries. Adding yet another long and surely acrimonious impeachment process will do the country little good.\n\nA statesman in such a corner might see as much and spare his compatriots the pain. Regrettably, Bolsonaro likes a cage fight. Bolsonaro \"is digging his own grave,\" former President Fernando Henrique Cardoso tweeted. \"Better he renounces than be renounced.\"",

Sign up here to get it in your inbox every weekday morning.\n\nSomething has snapped in Italy. Resentment at the EU's response to the pandemic now runs deep in the very heart of Italy's government, John Follain and Alessandra Migliaccio report from Rome. Cabinet members and senior figures in the premier's office, ministries and the central bank see -- and often feel -- a surging wave of bad blood and frustration. Investors have noticed the spike in euroskepticism, which, together with a lack of credibility in the EU response to the looming recession, are pushing Italian borrowing costs up and exacerbating the misery. Meanwhile, Thursday's e-summit of leaders to come up up with a plan to cushion the blow from the crisis may disappoint again. But with Italy simmering, kicking the can may not be an option for much longer.\n\nVirus Update | France became the fourth country to report more than 20,000 fatalities from the coronavirus, while Spain's new cases and deaths leveled off and the U.K. reported the lowest death toll since April 6. Denmark is now expanding its testing to people with mild symptoms. Here's the latest from Italy and around the world.\n\nMerkel Rebuke | Chancellor Angela Merkel urged caution amid calls for a further easing of Germany's containment measures, warning that moving too quickly could risk a relapse to an unsustainable rate of infections. Boris Johnson is also resisting calls to lift U.K. measures too soon. Here's an overview of lockdowns currently in force.\n\nBad Bank | A push by some euro area officials to free lenders of their bad debts faces resistance from countries worried that they will bear the costs. Many of the issues that stopped the plan for a European bad bank from getting off the ground three years ago persist. Read more here.\n\nFood Wars | The virus has restarted a discussion about self-sufficiency tinged with nationalism. At least 10 countries, including EU member Romania, have introduced restrictions on exports of grains or rice since mid-March, and while many of those actions might not stick, such threats serve as a wake-up call to governments.\n\nMacron's Chances | The French welfare state rarely lacks for anything, yet the country has suffered the same supply shortages seen around the world. The public's faith in President Emmanuel Macron hangs by a mask thread, our columnist Lionel Laurent writes.\n\nState Support | Austria urged the EU to temporarily abandon its strict state-aid rule book to avoid bureaucratic delays in government support for companies facing the worst slump since World War II. EU regulators relaxed those rules in March, but ditching the rule book altogether is probably too much to ask.\n\nCure Hopes| In the absence of a vaccine, sophisticated antibody treatments are our best chance to fight the virus. This drug cocktail could be tested on humans by the summer, and be saving lives by fall.\n\nGerman Resilience | Data showing that German energy demand remains surprisingly resilient could mean that the country's economy may weather the downturn better than other corners of Europe. For more clues, check out what's happening in a single German chemical plant that devours about as much electricity each year as London.\n\nSpain's economy could contract by more than 12% in a worst-case-scenario forecast by the country's central bank, the first official figures that spell out the potential toll of the coronavirus on the EU's fourth-largest economy. Over-reliance on precarious, temporary contracts and an economy that depends heavily on tourism means Spain's labor market is particularly vulnerable.",

See this week's top stories from QuickTake here.\n\nThe country's two most populous states, responsible for 65% of the nation's coronavirus cases, are edging toward easing social-distancing restrictions after Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged them to start reopening the crippled economy.\n\nNew South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney on Sunday that the state would ease its lockdown from May 15.\n\nTo read the story, click here.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will be upgraded to the Disease Control and Prevention Administration to strengthen its expertise and independence, President Moon Jae-in said in an address to the nation. It will be staffed with more professionals, and a local epidemic response system will be established to make up for any insufficient provincial capabilities.\n\nSouth Korea will also push to establish hospitals specialized in treating infectious diseases.\n\nOn Sunday, South Korea reported 34 new cases, after an infection at a Seoul nightclub last week raised concerns of a second wave. Among the newly reported cases, 14 are from Seoul and eight are imported. The country's total tally stands at 256 deaths with a total of 10,874 cases.\n\nMexico will give details about plans to reopen the economy in the coming week, most likely on Wednesday, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said. Mexico has likely lost about 500,000 jobs in April, which is better than expected, he said.\n\nThe heads of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are entering quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for the virus.\n\nFDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, 60, told staff about his self-isolation plans in a note on Friday, according to an emailed agency statement. CDC Director Robert Redfield, 68, will also go into quarantine, and will telework for two weeks. The pair are on the White House Coronavirus Task Force.\n\nOne of the highest-profile task force members, Anthony Fauci, will not quarantine. Fauci is doing a \"modified quarantine,\" where he will primarily work from home and wear a mask continually for 14 days. If he's called to the White House or Capitol Hill, he will take every precaution on those trips, CNN reported.\n\nAirlines for America, the trade group representing large airlines, said it would support fever checks for passengers and employees carried out by the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nThe TSA and airlines have been in talks about starting fever checks, though no decision has been announced by the agency.\n\nMusk lashed out at the California county blocking Tesla Inc. from reopening its only U.S. car plant, threatening to relocate to other states and cease manufacturing at the factory.\n\nThe electric-car maker filed a complaint at U.S. District Court in San Francisco, saying Alameda County's order keeping the 10,000-worker factory closed violates due process and \"puts businesses deemed critical to the nation's well-being by the federal and state governments between a rock and a hard place.\"\n\nMusk, the chief executive officer who has called shutdown orders fascist, said Tesla will decide whether to keep producing cars in Fremont, California, based on how it's treated going forward.\n\nVenezuela reported 14 new cases, President Nicolas Maduro said on state television, bringing the total to 402. The death toll of 10 is unchanged. Of those infected, 46 are from Colombia, 30 from Spain, and 12 from Brazil.\n\nBrazil reported total deaths rose to 10,627 from 9,897 on Friday, the Health Ministry said on its website. The nation registered 10,611 new cases in the past 24 hours, raising the total to 155,939.\n\nLos Angeles County, the epicenter of the outbreak in California, reported 44 new deaths, bringing the total to 1,512. The county added 1,011 new cases, for a total of 31,197.\n\nThe area of 10 million people is planning to lift restrictions on most retailers, manufacturers and recreational facilities later next week after letting florists and some shops offer curbside pickup. Car showrooms, trails and golf courses are also able to reopen with safety measures in place.\n\nBoris Johnson will unveil a virus alert system, similar to the color-coded terror-threat scale, in a Sunday address to Britain that will set out some conditions for removing restrictions on the economy.\n\nThe five-level alerts range from one (green), which would enable life to return to normal, to five (red). England is on the verge of improving from level four to three, which indicates the infection rate isn't increasing significantly, Johnson is expected to say. A new motto is also to debut: \"Stay alert, control the virus and save lives.\"\n\nJohnson will urge workers and businesses to stay alert by following social distancing rules, potentially angering some in his Conservative Party who want a swift end to the lockdown that has scarred the economy.\n\nTravelers arriving in the U.K., including Britons returning from abroad, will be told to self-isolate for 14 days as part of the government's plans to try to avoid a second wave of the coronavirus.\n\nThe rules, set to start next month, will force travelers to declare where they will stay in isolation, said a person familiar with the plans. Violators face fines as high as 1,000 pounds ($1,145) or deportation.\n\nThe measures may heighten criticism that Johnson's government was slow to contain the pandemic.\n\nU.S. cases increased 2.1% from the same time Friday to reach 1.3 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That matches the average daily increase over the past week. U.S. deaths reached 78,320.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama excoriated Donald Trump's handing of the pandemic as he urged members of his administration to rally behind presumed Democratic nominee Joe Biden.\n\nWhile \"it would have been bad even with the best of governments,\" Obama said, \"it has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset -- of 'what's in it for me' and 'to heck with everybody else' -- when that mindset is operationalized in our government.\"\n\nObama, in Friday's remarks reported by Yahoo News, said the response is an outgrowth of a trend where \"being selfish, being tribal, being divided and seeing others as an enemy\" have emerged as a stronger impulse in America.\n\nRead the story here.\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo reported 226 new deaths in New York, while new hospitalizations, based on a three-day rolling average, dropped to the lowest since March. Daily deaths have remained \"infuriatingly constant,\" Cuomo said, in the 200s for more than a week.\n\nCuomo also raised a warning that children are becoming seriously ill, and three young patients have died, after developing unconventional and dangerous symptoms.\n\nNew York reported another 2,715 virus cases, for a total of 333,122.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nCanada is securing large amounts of personal protective equipment on daily flights of goods from China and elsewhere, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. So far, about 23 flights from China have brought millions of PPE items. In order to gradually restart the economy, Canada needs enough equipment to ensure people can work in safe environments, he said. Equipment arriving from other countries will be tested before being sent out to front-line workers.\n\nAfrican nations need a two-year debt standstill to give governments the fiscal space to fight the pandemic, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said. A $100 billion injection of emergency economic stimulus is also required to combat the impact of the disease and almost half of that could come from waiving interest payments, according to the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa.\n\nItaly registered 1,083 new cases on Saturday -- the fewest since May 5 -- compared with 1,327 a day earlier. Confirmed cases now total 218,268. Daily fatalities fell to 194 from 243 on Friday, with a total of 30,395.\n\nWith the government cautious on easing measures after an initial relaxation on Monday, an Ipsos survey published in newspaper Corriere della Sera on Saturday showed 58% of Italians want all economic sectors to restart as soon as possible.\n\nThe U.K., the European country hardest hit by the outbreak, plans to spend 2 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) to encourage people to cycle and walk to work and help relieve pressure on transport systems.\n\nPrime Minister Johnson has said that the U.K. has passed the peak of the outbreak, and limiting travel on public transit will help curb the risk of a second wave of infections, said Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. The government will also spend more on electric-car charging points and extend trials of e-scooters and permit their rentals.\n\nDaily deaths rose by 346, Shapps said Saturday, down from 626 on Friday and the lowest since May 4. Total deaths reached 31,587, surpassed only by the U.S., with total infections at 215,260.\n\nCarlyle Group Inc. and Singapore sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. are backing out of a deal to buy a stake in American Express Global Business Travel, hit hard by the pandemic. The parties were in talks on terms of the deal, which was set to close this week, but couldn't reach an agreement, people familiar with the matter said. The deal valued the American Express Co. unit at $5 billion with debt.",

        "body": "With schools closed and health systems overwhelmed, the pandemic may impose high costs on vulnerable kids.\n\nMany parents felt a profound sense of relief when analyses of the coronavirus found that kids rarely show symptoms and usually aren't at much risk. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean they're safe from the global pandemic.\n\nEvery parent is familiar with the day-to-day perils of the Covid-19 outbreak, with playgrounds closed, social interaction limited and screen time all too tempting. But the most consequential effects of this crisis are likely to come from two areas: health and education.\n\nNatural disasters tend to be especially harmful for children's health. They disrupt the basic medical services that mothers and young kids rely on, and usually divert crucial resources to more immediate needs. Measures meant to protect health-care workers and the broader population may also mean that clinicians are unable or unwilling to have contact with patients, whether to give a physical exam or administer a shot.\n\nFor kids, that can have long-lasting consequences. At the height of the West African Ebola epidemic, in 2014, institutional deliveries of children -- a crucial means of reducing maternal mortality -- decreased by 37% compared to the previous year. Prenatal consultations, which have been shown to improve children's long-term physical and mental health, decreased by 40%.\n\nWorse, vaccination rates declined sharply. In 2013, before the outbreak, a still-too-low 73% of Liberian children under age one were fully vaccinated. From July to September of 2014 that number dropped to 36%. Measles vaccination rates alone declined by 45%. This drop-off created a large \"immunity gap\" that allowed the disease to spread more easily. The consequences lingered: From 2016 to 2017, 49% of Liberia's 2,954 suspected measles cases were detected in children under the age of five.\n\nIn all likelihood, the current outbreak will have similar effects. In late March, the World Health Organization called for preventative mass-vaccination programs to be suspended worldwide to allow for social-distancing measures. Although this was probably the right call, even public-health experts who supported the decision acknowledged that it will contribute to a surge of diseases that might last for years.\n\nAnother serious worry -- for parents and for the world -- is that some 1.4 billion children currently live in areas where schools have been fully or partially closed, from Southern California to rural India. Most of those kids have no idea when they'll be able to return. When schools in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone were closed to curtail the spread of Ebola, students lost as many as 1,848 hours of education.\n\nA significant body of research suggests that such a prolonged absence from school can be detrimental educationally and developmentally, and especially harmful for low-income students. As plenty of frustrated parents are now finding, distance-learning programs can be ineffective even under ideal circumstances. In poorer households, where parents are less likely to be able to work from home, the challenges can be severe. Especially in developing regions, girls are at particular risk of not resuming their education due to increased poverty, domestic responsibilities and pregnancy rates during the pandemic. Even when schools do reopen, the virus may pose a threat for months or years into the future.\n\nMitigating all of these harmful effects will be an immense challenge. After the Ebola epidemic, agencies and governments around the world contributed to a new vaccination program as soon as it was safe to do so. That won't be cheap or easy on a global basis. Nevertheless, the World Health Organization, despite its recent problems, remains the appropriate organization to coordinate such a campaign, and planning and funding should get underway immediately. Governments should also prioritize maternal and prenatal services during the pandemic, and look to carefully reopened schools as places where child health can be monitored and basic care delivered.\n\nFor their part, schools should strive to maintain as much continuity with students as possible. Step one should be a concerted effort to pay and retain teachers during the crisis. They'll be key to reopening schools quickly, and could provide some much-needed stability for students who have lost their sense of routine or even safety. Finally, planning needs to start now on assessments and accelerated curriculums designed to help students catch up and review what they were learning before the pandemic.\n\nModest steps like these won't lead to cures or treatments for the coronavirus. But they might help ensure that its effect on future generations isn't needlessly destructive.",

        "body": "Drug is controversial for failed clinical trials, side effects\n\nWith coronavirus cases setting record after record in Brazil, an 86-year-old anti-malarial drug with an unproven track record against Covid-19 is taking center stage in the country's political debate and public life.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro is poised to loosen protocols later this week for the use of chloroquine for mild coronavirus cases despite dangerous side effects, experts' warnings and no demonstrated success in clinical trials.\n\nUndeterred, the president has ordered the military to ramp up production of the drug as he makes it a key element in the anti-virus fight, losing two health ministers in the process due in part to their objections to his strategy.\n\nThe controversy is just the latest twist in Brazil's erratic strategy to tackle the virus, with Bolsonaro pushing to restart the economy while local authorities try to enforce lockdowns and restrict activities to control it. In the past few days, Brazil has overtaken Spain, Italy and the U.K. and now trails only Russia and the U.S. in confirmed Covid-19 infections, with more than a quarter million people testing positive and almost 18,000 deaths.\n\nOn Tuesday, Brazil reported 17,408 new confirmed cases and 1,179 deaths registered over the past 24 hours -- both records.\n\nRead More: Soaring Cases, Lost Ventilators Show Chaos of Brazil Virus Fight\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, Bolsonaro has often touted the anti-malarial medication. In small, yet frequent weekend demonstrations against social distancing, his supporters often carry signs asking for it to be authorized for use in the public health system. Even U.S. President Donald Trump has backed the practice, saying on Monday that he's been taking hydroxychloroquine, a sister drug, as a precautionary measure.\n\nWith the new guidelines, Brazil will allow for expanded use of chloroquine to include less serious cases and for patients in the early stages of infection.\n\nBolsonaro rarely misses a chance to talk up the drug to the press and on his social media accounts, helping fuel a fierce debate within the ranks of Brazil's medical profession. Several doctors who contracted the virus in Brazil have been encouraged to talk about their recovery, disclose if they took the drug and would they recommend it. Ligia Kogos, a celebrity dermatologist, said in an interview last month that she has prescribed it to her entire staff.\n\nClinical trials have failed to prove chloroquine's efficacy in combating Covid-19. French research found the drug didn't reduce the likelihood that a Covid-19 patient would die. Other trials were halted when patients developed potentially fatal irregular heart rates. Brazil has several ongoing trials involving hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, including one that was partially suspended after patients taking a higher dosage showed \"a trend toward higher lethality.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization \"cautions against physicians and medical associations recommending or administering these unproven treatments to patients with COVED-19 or people self-medicating with them,\" according to the organization's website.\n\nRead More: 'Little Flu' Can't Hurt Him: Why Bolsonaro Still Shuns Lockdowns\n\nWith demand for chloroquine going up, a Brazilian health insurance firm created a drive-through to distribute it to clients who can provide a prescription -- with no need to have tested positive for the disease. Unimed Belem is giving out a kit containing the drug, plus the antibiotics azithromycin and ivermectin, in the Amazonian state of Para. The state, one of Brazil's poorest, has implemented lockdowns to counter the spread of the pandemic.\n\nPrevent Senior, another health insurance plan focused on the elderly, has been providing chloroquine to patients presenting symptoms consistent with a mild stage of the virus.\n\n\"Of all the patients who started the medication on the second day, only a very small percentage had to be hospitalized and intubated,\" said Fernando Parrillo, CEO of Prevent, during a debate organized for a private bank last week.\n\nLast month, Bolsonaro ordered military labs to expand production of chloroquine, which is usually given out to troops operating in the Amazon and other malaria-ridden locations. The military produces about 125,000 pills a year, according to its press office, but for April alone, the numbers topped 1.2 million.",

    "Cold, Crowded, Deadly: How U.S. Meat Plants Became a Virus Breeding Ground": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "With thousands of workers sick, plants are closing and the food supply is faltering.\n\nBy late March, Rafael Benjamin's family was pleading with him to stay home from work even if it cost him his job. He promised he would, but not until after April 10. That would be his work anniversary, his 17th at Cargill Inc.'s pork and beef processing plant in Hazleton, Pa. -- a milestone for topping up his pension when he retired in October.\n\nSo Benjamin, 64, soldiered on, a second-shift worker earning $15.35 an hour. Around him, colleagues were falling ill; on the employee grapevine, people said it was the coronavirus. Supervisors said that wasn't true and told workers not to discuss who might be infected. But before long, Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus, ran through entire departments. By April 7, 130 of the plant's 900 employees had tested positive, according to the workers' union, United Food & Commercial Workers International, but neither Cargill nor local officials were disclosing any numbers. Amid the information void, Benjamin kept working, with growing unease.\n\nMarch was a time of spreading disease and denial across the U.S. meat and poultry industry. Laborers in the immense slaughterhouses and packing houses passed the contagion on processing lines and in locker rooms, then in their homes. Plants began to slow or to go idle. The toll on workers and the nation's food supply is only now becoming clear.\n\nBy mid-March there were reports of panic buying, and President Trump and other federal officials sought to reassure the public that the food supply was sound. \"You don't have to buy so much,\" he told Americans on March 15. \"Take it easy. Relax.\" Plants were running overtime to meet the surge in demand. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue weighed in on April 15: \"In the United States, we have plenty of food for all of our citizens.\"\n\nAnd yet, each time he arrived at work, Benjamin saw a different reality emerging. A quiet, powerfully built man, he wasn't the sort to open up about his fears, but during daily calls with his three adult children, he confided that he was afraid of getting sick. On March 25 one of his daughters gave him a face mask to wear at the plant, where he operated boxing and loading equipment near the entrance and was often the first person to greet arriving co-workers. \"He was always so respectful,\" a shiftmate says. Two days later, Benjamin told his kids a supervisor had ordered him to remove the mask because it was creating unnecessary fears among plant employees.\n\nOn Saturday, April 4, Benjamin called in sick. So few workers had shown up the day before that he'd had to do the work of three people, he told his family. By Monday his cough and fever were much worse. The next morning he could barely move. An ambulance took him to the hospital.\n\nWhile he was in the emergency room, Cargill shut down the Hazleton plant to disinfect everything, install barriers between workstations, and give employees time to heal. Later that week, the union said 164 workers had been infected. The local testing center, running low on supplies, was refusing to test most Cargill employees. If you work at the meatpacking plant, they were told, assume you're positive.\n\nBenjamin was admitted to the intensive care unit and spent his work anniversary on a ventilator. He died on April 19. The next day the plant reopened after a two-week cleaning.\n\nThe meat industry's failure to protect its employees from the coronavirus has triggered the most serious threat to U.S. meat supplies since World War II. In recent weeks, 115 meat and poultry plants have reported Covid-19 infections in the U.S., and about 5,000 workers, 1% of the industry's workforce, have been confirmed sick, with 20 deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Outbreaks were so severe that at least 18 plants shut down. U.S. beef and pork production capacity shrank 40% in April, says Will Sawyer, lead economist at agricultural lender CoBank. U.S. consumers, Sawyer predicts, could see 30% less meat in grocery stores by Memorial Day, at prices 20% higher than last year.\n\nOn April 26, Tyson Foods Inc., the biggest U.S. meat processor, which has had its share of infections and deaths and closed at least six major plants, ran national newspaper ads that declared, \"The food supply chain is breaking.\" Two days later, Trump formally classified U.S. meat plants as critical infrastructure, preventing state and local health agencies from closing them down regardless of illness and death. The government pledged to provide additional protective gear for employees.\n\nThe edict was followed by a statement from the U.S. Department of Labor that it would consider supporting employers sued by workers for coronavirus exposure, if the companies abide by federal pandemic standards. Processors, through their trade association, the North American Meat Institute, thanked the president for intervening. Labor advocates say the situation for meat workers could get worse under Trump's executive order.\n\nNow it's up to the meatpacking companies, with even less accountability than before, to adapt to the coronavirus while sustaining production and worker health. \"It remains to be seen how we're going to manage that dynamic between the health and emotional safety, and physical safety, of the workers in the plants and the executive order,\" David MacLennan, Cargill's chairman and chief executive officer, told Bloomberg TV on April 28.\n\nTrust among meatpacking workers and their communities, never high, has been shattered. \"Until we got to the hospital, we had no idea how bad things were,\" says Benjamin's son, Larry, a soldier stationed at the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence at Fort Gordon, Ga. \"If we would have known, for $400 a week after taxes, I can assure you he would have never been there.\"\n\nThe cold, damp conditions and crowded workstations in meatpacking plants make infectious diseases particularly hard to control. But not impossible. In Europe, where labor protections are stronger and most plants are smaller and more automated than in the U.S., the industry has avoided disabling outbreaks. Danish Crown A/S, a huge pork producer, has had employees contract Covid-19 but has prevented plantwide spikes by employing strict hygiene practices, a spokesman says. Goikoa, of Spain, the nation with the most coronavirus cases after the U.S., says its plants have operated at full capacity throughout the pandemic. Britain, with the world's fourth-most infections and second-most deaths, has minimized plant shutdowns through rigid social distancing, says Nick Allen, CEO of the British Meat Processors Association. Police showed up outside plants to lecture workers on keeping their distance, he says.\n\nThere are exceptions in the U.S., too. Sanderson Farms Inc., America's third-largest poultry producer, has had about 100 workers test positive for Covid-19 out of 17,000 employees in its 13 plants across the South. In late March, Sanderson became aware of a coronavirus outbreak in Dougherty County, Ga., near its 1,400-worker plant in the city of Moultrie. It sent more than 400 workers home, with pay, to quarantine for two weeks whether or not they were showing symptoms. The plant had to slow its line speed by 15%, but it averted a spike in infection, a closure, and possibly worse. None of the Dougherty County workers tested positive, and there have been no reports of deaths among Sanderson workers.\n\nMike Cockrell, the company's chief financial officer, says Sanderson expects its chicken production will be 4% less this fiscal year than it estimated before the pandemic. But \"no one even asks how much it costs to protect workers,\" he says. \"We'll add it up when this is all over.\"\n\nThe health and well-being of meatpacking workers has always been a socioeconomic problem at root, says Matthew Wadiak, founder and CEO of Cooks Venture, a small Arkansas-based producer that sells pasture-raised chickens directly to consumers. The company hasn't had a Covid-19 case among the 200 employees at its processing plant in Oklahoma. One reason is that from the start of the pandemic, Cooks Venture provided lots of protective gear and reconfigured the plant to spread out workers. But the bigger reason, Wadiak argues, is that the company pays better. His entry-level employees earn 20% more than other poultry workers in Oklahoma, enough for them to afford housing that's not overcrowded. When you're jammed into a group house, as so many meat workers are, social distancing is almost impossible.\n\n\"Americans' desire to buy cheaper and cheaper food has a price in people's lives,\" Wadiak says. \"If we as a country were willing to pay 25\u00a2 to 50\u00a2 more for a pound for meat, wouldn't it be worth it to know a worker can make a living wage?\"\n\nThat's not a question usually asked by this industry, whose workers are injured at twice the rate of other U.S. manufacturing employees and get sick on the job at 15 times the national average. Meat workers at plants throughout North America say managers treat them like disposable parts. At Cargill's High River slaughterhouse outside Calgary, where more than 900 of the beef plant's 2,200 workers contracted Covid-19 and one died, supervisors began trolling the plant in N95 masks and plastic face shields. Workers say it was weeks before they were given paper and cloth face covers. Cargill spokesman Dan Sullivan says masks were provided to all employees once supplies were procured.\n\nAt JBS-USA's beef plant in the Texas Panhandle town of Cactus, the company didn't inform its 3,000 employees that a co-worker had gone home sick with suspected symptoms until nine days later, when the test for Covid-19 came back positive, according to three plant employees. By that time, multiple workers were falling sick, yet for at least a week longer, managers continued to deny the plant had a serious outbreak and told sick workers not to discuss their diagnoses.\n\nOn April 5 the wife of Anthony Germain fell ill with a fever, he says. (Germain, who doesn't work for JBS, insisted on anonymity for his wife to protect her and other family members from losing their jobs at the plant.) She was still vomiting a few days later, but her fever was gone, so a JBS nurse told her to come back to work, he says. She tested positive for the virus on April 10. A plant superintendent followed up with a phone call and instructed Germain's wife not to tell anyone she had Covid-19, according to Germain, who says he listened to the call and was outraged by the breach of pandemic protocol.\n\n\"Hell no, I'm not keeping my mouth shut,\" he says. \"They don't want to cause fear and panic in the plant, but that's already there. This is something that should not be kept in the dark.\" Nikki Richardson, a JBS spokeswoman, says no employee is asked to keep quiet about having Covid-19 and JBS informs workers when one tests positive. Employees with virus symptoms are sent home and no one is pressured to work sick, she says.\n\nThe Texas health department has linked 243 Covid-19 cases to the Cactus plant, making rural Moore County a state hot spot. On Easter Sunday, April 12, 28-year-old Juan Manuel Jaime died of Covid-19 complications, one of two deaths among the plant's workers. Jaime had worked sick at the JBS plant for almost two weeks because his supervisors wouldn't excuse him to see a doctor and insisted he keep working, says his aunt, Sandra Guzman. After Jaime worked on Good Friday, his parents found him incoherent in his bed on Saturday evening. He died four hours later while being transported to an ICU in Amarillo, Texas. Following his death, both parents got Covid-19, and his father spent a week in the hospital. Richardson says JBS did not know Jaime had Covid-19 until he died, and the plant has been adding fever screenings, more social distancing, and extra protective gear to protect workers.\n\nThe city of Hazleton, with more than 1,000 Covid-19 cases in a population of about 30,000, has one of the highest per capita infection rates anywhere -- twice New York City's rate and more than 11 times the rate in Pennsylvania as a whole. Cargill wasn't solely responsible for Hazleton's surge. Several nearby warehouses and processing facilities, including a Mission Foods tortilla factory and an Amazon.com Inc. fulfillment center, have also had virus outbreaks.\n\nAfter a long economic decline, Hazleton, located 130 miles west of New York in anthracite coal country, lured Cargill in 2000 with generous tax breaks. Based in Minneapolis, Cargill is the world's largest agricultural commodities trader and the biggest privately held company in the U.S. It reported $2.6 billion of net profit in 2019 on $113.5 billion of revenue. Its Cargill Meat Solutions division employs 28,000 workers at more than 36 facilities in the U.S. and Canada. The Hazleton plant butchers beef and pork carcasses for consumer-ready packages that are trucked to Walmarts and other East Coast stores.\n\nThe meat plant quickly became the area's biggest private employer, drawing its low-skilled labor largely from Dominican families like the Benjamins. Many of them moved to Hazleton from New York and New Jersey. The Latino population jumped sevenfold from 2000 to 2010, to 37% of the city's inhabitants, and has risen to more than 60% today. Unionized workers can make $500 to $700 a week at the plant -- about the industry average -- plus overtime, and enjoy health and vacation benefits. It's enough for a decent living in Hazleton.\n\nCargill said nothing as the virus rampaged through the plant and Hazleton after mid-March, even as panic was rising in the city. The company's silence added to people's worries and led more and more healthy employees to stay home from work.\n\n\"How do you have 130 cases in the plant before telling anyone? Who made that decision?\" asks Robert Curry, co-founder of the Hazleton Integration Project, which runs a local community center funded by Joe Maddon, a Hazleton native and manager of the Los Angeles Angels baseball team. \"Where's the moral responsibility?\"\n\nCargill was open and honest with local health officials and regulators about the virus in the plant, says Sullivan. Having gained experience with coronavirus in China, he says, the company was early to implement fever screening and other \"best practices\" across North America to protect workers. In Hazleton, Cargill started educating workers and staff on social distancing and took other precautions starting on March 3, says Aaron Humes, the plant's general manager. According to interviews with 32 workers, however, supervisors and nurses downplayed the virus after that, telling symptomatic employees without fevers to take acetaminophen and keep working, and ordering workers not to discuss why colleagues were disappearing from the line.\n\nAt least 10 workers say their supervisors or infirmary staff sent them back to the line feeling sick. One eight-year Cargill veteran, who calls herself Anabel, says she worked the entire week of March 16 while sick. She says her supervisor in the beef division ignored her health complaints, and a plant nurse gave her acetaminophen and told her to keep working because her temperature was less than 100.4F, the CDC-directed threshold for coronavirus concern. At one point, Anabel says, she overheard her supervisor telling the nurse he was \"tired\" of so many workers getting sick. Anabel got so weak she could hardly stand up, but she didn't leave because she didn't want points on her record from unexcused absences. \"Every time I coughed, there was someone in front of me and next to me,\" says Anabel, who tested positive for Covid-19 on March 24. \"All my co-workers got sick.\"\n\nThe plant began screening workers for symptoms on March 25, two days after its first announced case, Humes says. When Benjamin arrived for what would be his last day of work on April 3, he told a nurse at the entrance that he had a dry cough and wasn't feeling well, his son says. But his temperature was below 100.4, so she waved him in. Benjamin wasn't the only person forbidden to wear his own mask. Three other workers said they heard supervisors say masks were forbidden. The reasons given varied -- from only sick people should wear them, to the short supply was needed for health-care workers, to the explanation given to Benjamin a week before his fatal illness: No reason to scare people.\n\nCargill has made it \"very clear\" to employees not to come to work if they're sick or have had contact with Covid-19 patients, Sullivan says. The company isn't penalizing unexcused absences and is offering up to 80 hours of paid leave to employees who miss work because of Covid-19 impacts. Humes says he can't confirm if Benjamin or anyone else was told not to wear a mask. \"I don't know who would have told him that,\" he says. The facility followed safety directives from Cargill, which were based on guidance from the CDC, Humes says.\n\nThe CDC didn't issue specific advice on masks for food and other critical infrastructure companies before April. The pandemic guidance for employers from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has been the same since the swine flu in 2009 and was reissued on March 9 for the new coronavirus: Employers should provide masks to their workers \"to limit spread of the respiratory secretions of a person who may have Covid-19.\" Cargill began distributing masks in Hazleton on April 3, Humes says, 12 days before Pennsylvania's department of health mandated that workers wear masks. \"We were ahead of the curve.\"\n\nA second worker died recently, having apparently been infected before the shutdown of the plant. Since the reopening on April 20, workers wear masks and are separated by plexiglass screens on the line. Cargill takes temperatures twice a day, and nurses follow up with health questions for anyone with a fever of more than 100F.\n\nThe Hazleton plant hasn't had a government inspection since before the pandemic. There were rumors of problems -- as was the case with other facilities nearby -- and the plant's employees were flooding the local hospital. So after a month of waiting for federal or state inspectors to show, local officials formed a regional task force to do the job. Local inspectors made 138 visits in April -- but not to Cargill, which was closed half the month. Local officials were caught off guard when the plant reopened April 20, says Dan Guydish, executive director of the Mountain Council of Governments, an affiliate of the Greater Hazleton Chamber of Commerce. No complaints have come in against Cargill since the plant reopened, Guydish says. Sullivan says Cargill is working with state and local officials and the business community to keep workers and all of Hazleton safe.\n\nAmericans eat more meat per capita than the people of any other developed country except Argentina -- almost 50% more than Canadians and more than double what people consume in the European Union. One reason is that, because of industrial agriculture, meat and poultry cost at least 20% less in the U.S. than in most European countries. \"Big companies are competing with each other for the cheapest meat down to the pennies,\" says Wadiak of Cooks Venture.\n\nPlant closures have sent prices soaring. Wholesale prices for beef hit an all-time high on May 4, double the recent low in February. Pork prices are the highest they've been since 2014, when a piglet-killing virus struck U.S. herds. Bob Brown, an independent market consultant in Edmond, Okla., estimates U.S. meat supplies have fallen 28% over seven weeks, equivalent to more than 500 million pounds. Some hog and poultry farmers are euthanizing pigs and chickens rather than holding and feeding them for slaughterhouses that may not open soon. \"Protein markets are unequivocally the most volatile and least predictable I have ever witnessed,\" says equity analyst Heather Jones of Heather Jones Research.\n\nTrump's executive order may keep plants open, but it can't force sick and scared workers back to the line. The shortfall in output could continue to run as high as 15% even after plants reopen, Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said on April 30. Slaughterhouses, after years of lobbying to run their lines faster -- resisted by labor advocates as too dangerous and by some food safety experts as likely to allow more unhealthy animals to be processed -- may be forced to slow down for months and possibly years to adjust to fewer workers with more space between them. Livestock farmers may have to keep culling their herds, prolonging higher meat prices.\n\nFor now, hewing to enhanced safety standards makes sense for meat companies to keep plants open. But if you're a worker, you have to wonder if the precautions will outlast the pandemic, when your health is no longer a threat to the broader community. Then what?\n\nMaybe robots. Industry experts say meat companies are likely to emerge from this crisis determined to solve their labor problem once and for all with automation. \"The old adage was that the machine doesn't take a coffee break,\" says economist Steve Meyer of Kerns & Associates in Ames, Iowa. \"I guess the new adage is that the machine doesn't get coronavirus.\" -- With Isis Almeida, Megan Durisin, Greg Ritchie, and Jen Skerritt\n\nRead more: Instacart's Frantic Dash From Grocery App to Essential Service",

        "body": "Clotting risk and symptoms may persist after infection clears\n\nAnother threat from the lung virus that causes Covid-19 has emerged that may cause swift, sometimes fatal damage: blood clots.\n\nDoctors around the world are noting a raft of clotting-related disorders -- from benign skin lesions on the feet sometimes called \"Covid toe\" to life-threatening strokes and blood-vessel blockages. Ominously, if dangerous clots go untreated, they may manifest days to months after respiratory symptoms have resolved.\n\nThe clotting phenomenon is \"probably the most important thing that's emerged over the last perhaps month or two,\" said Mitchell Levy, chief of pulmonary critical care and sleep medicine at the Warren Albert School of Medicine at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nIt's not unusual for infections to raise the risk of clotting. The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, caused by a novel strain of influenza that killed some 50 million people worldwide, was also linked to downstream damage from clots that could end lives dramatically.\n\nViruses including HIV, dengue and Ebola are all known to make blood cells prone to clumping. The pro-clotting effect may be even more pronounced in patients with the coronavirus.\n\n\"There's something about this virus that's exaggerated that to the nth degree,\" said Levy, who is also medical director of the medical intensive care unit at Rhode Island Hospital. \"We're seeing clotting in a way in this illness that we have not seen in the past.\"\n\nThe problem is visible in clots -- doctors call them thrombi -- that form in patients' arterial catheters and filters used to support failing kidneys. More pernicious are the clots that impede blood flow in the lungs, causing difficulty breathing.\n\nThese are probably what's causing patients who otherwise appear well to suddenly \"fall off the ledge\" and develop severe blood-oxygen deficiency, said Margaret Pisani, an associate professor of medicine at the Yale University School of Medicine in New Haven, Connecticut.\n\nClotting disorders in Covid-19 patients were noted by researchers in China in February, but their gravity has since become clearer. While doctors had thought the vast majority of lung damage was due to viral pneumonia, they're now looking more closely at clotting.\n\n\"When you look at autopsies now, we are seeing things that we didn't expect,\" said Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases who's at the forefront of the U.S. pandemic response. Clumps of platelets inside blood vessels, or microthrombi, are probably why Covid patients can \"rapidly and dramatically deteriorate,\" he said in an interview with CNN last week.\n\nSeparate studies from France and the Netherlands found that as many as 30% of severely ill Covid-19 patients suffered a so-called pulmonary embolism -- a potentially deadly blockage in one of the arteries of the lungs. These often occur when bits of blood clots from veins deep in the legs travel to the lungs. By comparison, the prevalence of pulmonary embolism was 1.3% in critically ill patients without Covid-19, one study found.\n\nIf untreated, large arterial lung clots can put overwhelming strain on the heart, causing cardiac arrest. Even tiny clots in the capillaries of lung tissue may interrupt blood flow, undermining attempts to help oxygenate patients with ventilators, said Edwin van Beek, chair of clinical radiology at the University of Edinburgh's Queen's Medical Research Institute.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Van Beek helped develop the D-dimer blood test that's used around the world to monitor clot formation in patients, including those with Covid-19, and to dose them with heparin and other anticoagulant medications.\n\nUntreated pulmonary embolism is lethal in one in three cases, and will recur in another third, he said. In 3% to 7% of patients, it will cause pulmonary hypertension, another dangerous complication that can cause fatigue and shortness of breath.\n\nScarred lungs and clotting-related problems may be a lingering legacy of the pandemic, Van Beek said. Covid-19 survivors who have subsequent difficulty breathing, especially on exertion, might mistakenly believe it's a recurrence of coronavirus infection, when it may actually be a \"reactivation of the whole clotting problem.\"\n\n'False Dawn' Recovery Haunts Virus Survivors Who Fall Sick Again\n\n\"I expect to see more of this as we come out of the pandemic,\" he said. Patients and doctors alike may not be aware of the risks or the potential need for treatment.\n\nCoagulation may occur because of damage to cells lining blood vessels that results from both the viral infection and the immune system's inflammation-causing response, said Jean Connors, a Harvard Medical School hematologist.\n\n\"The outcome isn't affected if you're treated appropriately,\" she said. But \"it's possible that people are dying from undiagnosed pulmonary emboli.\"\n\nClots may form in other parts of the body, potentially damaging vital organs including the heart, kidneys, liver, bowel, and other tissues.\n\nFive cases of stroke were treated in Manhattan's Mount Sinai Health System over a two-week period through early April, doctors reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last week. The patients, who all had the coronavirus and were younger than 50, were treated for large-vessel blockages.\n\nIt's a rare complication amplified by the \"sheer numbers of infected patients,\" Connors said. New York City has reported about 170,000 Covid-19 cases, including roughly 43,000 hospitalizations.\n\nSuch findings are \"puzzling\" on one hand, \"but on the other hand are enlightening\" because they can inform better ways to treat patients, said Fauci, the NIAID leader.\n\nIn Italy, the first European country gripped by the pandemic, it was after Covid-19 patients died from acute pulmonary emboli and other clotting-related events that doctors moved to inflammation-blocking treatments, such as tocilizumab, sold by Roche Holding AG as Actemra, said Frank Rasulo, a head of neuro critical care at Spedali Civili University Hospital in Brescia.\n\nSome doctors are starting to see Covid as less of a typical respiratory disease, and more of one that involves dangerous clotting, said Rasulo, who is also an associate professor of anesthesia and intensive care. \"That's quite frightening when you think of it, because we didn't know what we're up against until we were in a later stage.\"",

People may actually be at their most infectious before symptoms appear, according to the report.\n\nAfter locking down billions of people around the world to minimize its spread through countries, governments are now cautiously allowing businesses and public places to reopen.

While large amounts of vaccine against the 2009-2010 flu pandemic didn't become available until after the outbreak peaked in the U.S., one study has estimated that the shots prevented as many as 1.5 million cases and 500 deaths in that country alone, the report said.\n\nThe report was written by CIDRAP director Michael Osterholm and medical director Kristen Moore, Tulane University public health historian John Barry, and Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health.",

        "body": "Pandemic virus seen causing rare blood vessel inflammation\n\nThe coronavirus may have triggered a 30-fold jump in cases of a serious but rare pediatric inflammatory disease, according to an Italian study that provides an ominous warning to other pandemic-affected nations about the risk to children.\n\nA detailed analysis from Bergamo, the epicenter of the Italian Covid-19 outbreak, found 10 cases of a Kawasaki disease-like illness in children, adding to reports of about 90 similar cases from New York and England.\n\nNew Fears About Kids Getting Sick (Podcast)\n\nKawasaki disease is a rare condition that typically affects children younger than 5. It causes blood vessels to become inflamed and swollen. Typical symptoms include fever and rash, red eyes, dry or cracked lips or mouth, redness on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, and swollen glands.\n\nWhile children remain at lower risk than older adults of developing severe complications after being infected with the Covid-19-causing SARS-CoV-2 virus, the research published Thursday in the Lancet medical journal shows that their risk isn't zero. Cases may occur in the other countries affected by the pandemic, a risk that should be taken into consideration in formulating guidance on when and how children should be allowed to mingle.\n\n\"In our experience, only a very small proportion of children infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop symptoms of Kawasaki disease,\" said Annalisa Gervasoni, a pediatrician at Bergamo's Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII and one of the study's authors, in an emailed statement. \"However, it is important to understand the consequences of the virus in children, particularly as countries around the world grapple with plans to start relaxing social distancing policies.\"\n\nTypically, about a quarter of children affected experience cardiac complications, but the condition is rarely fatal if treated appropriately. It's not known what triggers the condition, but it's thought to be an abnormal immune overreaction to an infection.\n\nAll the Covid-19 Symptoms You Didn't Know About\n\nThe Covid-related cases should be classified as \"Kawasaki-like disease,\" the authors said, as the symptoms in the 10 patients with the inflammatory condition they diagnosed during the pandemic were different and more severe compared with the 19 Kawasaki disease cases they'd observed in the previous five years.\n\nAlso, the patients treated during the pandemic didn't respond as well to the standard therapy -- intravenous immunoglobulin -- requiring additional steroid medication to counter an aberrant immune response or \"cytokine storm\" most likely triggered by the coronavirus.\n\nWhile the incidence of cases during the pandemic appeared about 30 times higher than usual, the Kawasaki-like ailment probably afflicts no more than 1 in 1,000 children exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus, the authors said.\n\n\"We are starting to see case reports of children presenting at hospitals with signs of Kawasaki disease in other areas hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic,\" said Lorenzo D'Antiga, a co-author of the study. \"Our study provides the first clear evidence of a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this inflammatory condition, and we hope it will help doctors around the world as we try to get to grips with this unknown virus.\"",

        "body": "A West Palm Beach spa that normally offers Botox and collagen treatments touts tests on Instagram. A New York City urgent-care chain emails patients that the tests are available, though \"not 100% accurate.\" A chiropractic clinic in Minnesota promises its tests will provide \"fast and accurate peace of mind.\"\n\nAntibody tests, which look for markers in the blood that indicate exposure to the novel coronavirus, have become widely available in the U.S. in the past month, even as a debate rages about their medical value and how best to interpret the results. For policy makers and health experts, the tests could offer insights into the virus's prevalence and spread the country currently lacks. But for individuals concerned about their own health, the benefits are less clear.\n\nExperts believe antibodies probably convey some level of protection against the virus, but they don't have any solid proof yet. Nor do they know how long any immunity may last. Even so, thanks to an initially permissive stance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, hundreds of new tests are now on the market. And the proliferation has led to questions about their accuracy.\n\n\"The problem with the tests is it's not clear who needs them or how to feel about the results,\" said George Liakeas, a physician who serves as medical director of Lexington Medical Associates in New York City. But patients are asking for them anyway, posing \"a unique predicament.\"\n\nLabs that offer antibody tests say they can offer valuable validation to people who suspect they may have had Covid-19, eventually got better but were never tested. The tests also can identify donors of plasma to help severely ill patients. Yet they also carry risks, including exposure to the virus itself while out of the house, as well as false-positive readings. Experts worry these could prompt people to take fewer public-health precautions, including social distancing and mask-wearing.\n\nThe risks haven't stopped people from taking the tests. Some businesses that stayed open the past two months, such as factories and banks, are encouraging employees to get them as a tool to screen those with antibodies and thus deemed safer to be at work. Commercial lab giant Quest Diagnostics Inc. has performed about 620,000 antibody tests since it introduced them on April 21, the company said.\n\nJuanita Mora, an allergist-immunologist who practices in Chicago and treats many patients in the Latino community, which has been particularly affected by the virus. Mora sais she has seen a number of local employers, from banks and car dealerships to a hot-dog manufacturer and tortilla factory, use antibody testing to screen employees returning to work. Mora herself uses the results in conjunction with a patient's medical history to make decisions about infection risk, including whether to go back to their job, and for patients who were exposed or sick and have been self-isolating from their families.\n\nAntibody testing \"will help us walk people back into a new normal,\" Mora said. \"I think it's actually going to be a key test in controlling this pandemic.\"\n\nWithin an hour of emailing patients in late April about test availability, Lexington Medical Associates was \"overwhelmed\" with inquiries, Liakeas said. About 200 have participated so far, about a quarter of whom tested positive for antibodies. Liakeas, who was hospitalized with Covid-19 in March and is still recovering, recenly took the test and got a positive result.\n\nIn New York City, the commercial BioReference Laboratories Inc. will begin providing free antibody tests to the general public on May 13 as part of a partnership with New York City Health and Hospital Corp. aimed at testing several hundred thousand individuals, said Jon Cohen, a physician who serves as BioReference's executive chairman.\n\nDespite the questions about what test findings mean for the future, Cohen says he believes the results carry a psychological impact for people who take them. He himself got tested last week, as part of a free offering for BioReference employees, and the result came back negative.\n\nIn announcing stronger oversight over antibody tests last week, the Food and Drug Administration said it is taking action against kit makers with allegedly false or inaccurate claims. These include a \"concerning number\" of commercially sold antibody tests being \"inappropriately\" promoted, including as a diagnostic test, according to the FDA.\n\nQuest has begun contacting almost two dozen partners that resell its testing services, asking them to discontinue offering the tests after seeing information on the partners' websites that \"may not have met our bar for quality,\" spokeswoman Wendy Bost said in an interview.\n\n\"We have concerns about making sure that the patients have access to a provider consult and making sure that the information for how the tests can be used is aligned with our understanding of the value of these tests,\" Bost said. \"Covid is a new world, and it's creating new scenarios for us to address.\"\n\nPositive antibody-test results didn't give Binita Riffat, a 22-year-old urgent-care worker in New York City, all the answers she was looking for. Following weeks of dealing with patients who had Covid-like symptoms, she now worries she may have inadvertently brought the virus home to her parents and brothers.\n\nAfter hearing Georgia Governor Brian Kemp say antibody testing was available, Hayden Barnes, a developer at a tech company who lives in Columbus, got tested on May 8. He hoped it could reveal whether an illness he and his daughter had in March was Covid-19.\n\nHe also didn't get the result he had wanted. \"Knowing that I was exposed and didn't die would be a bit of a relief,\" he said. Two days later, though, the test came back negative.",

Sign up here for our daily newsletter on what you need to know.\n\nThe U.K. hopes to develop a new weapon in the global war against the coronavirus pandemic: Covid-19 sniffer dogs.\n\nA 500,000-pound ($605,000) government program to find new ways of fighting the pandemic that's gripped the nation since March will back clinical trials to train dogs to see if they can spot coronavirus before symptoms even appear, the Department for Health and Social Care said Saturday. Researchers at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and Durham University, and the charity Medical Detection Dogs will conduct the trials.\n\nThe plan isn't totally crazy: dogs have already been trained to detect certain cancers, and if they could be used to detect the virus in asymptomatic people, they could serve as an \"early warning measure,\" the department said. The dogs used will be a mixture of Labradors and Cocker Spaniels.\n\n\"Bio-detection dogs already detect specific cancers and we believe this innovation might provide speedy results as part of our wider testing strategy,\" Minister for Innovation James Bethell said in an emailed statement. \"Accuracy is essential so this trial will tell us whether 'Covid dogs' can reliably detect the virus and stop it spreading.\"\n\nFor the initial phase of the trial, National Health Service staff in London hospitals will collect odor samples from people who are infected with coronavirus and those who are uninfected, and six dogs will be trained to recognize the virus from the samples.\n\nIn theory, the animals could each screen as many as 250 people per hour, according to the department. It said that dogs can be trained to detect the odor of disease at the equivalent dilution of one teaspoon of sugar in two Olympic-sized swimming pools of water.",

        "body": "A \"Romware Covid Radius bracelet\" beeps every time a Tata Steel Ltd. worker in the U.K. or a docker at Belgium's Antwerp port is within virus-catching distance of someone. At Bouygues SA construction sites and in Sanofi and Schneider Electric SE offices in France employees enter after thermal cameras check their temperatures. Invisible lasers will manage crowds at shopping malls and transport hubs in Spain and France, and some firms will use infection-tracing lanyard devices.\n\nAs Europeans head back to work, they're entering a world very different from the one they left. Workplaces from banks and offices to e-commerce warehouses, factories, sports clubs and airports are trying out or installing fever-testing thermal cameras, mask-detection systems and tracking software to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus that has claimed more than 167,000 lives in the region.\n\nThe virus has opened the doors to surveillance and monitoring technologies that many fear are here to stay. While such systems have been creeping into people's lives across the globe -- particularly in Asia, with China's facial-recognition points system and South Korea's invasive infection-tracking software -- the trend runs up against Europe's much-vaunted privacy culture. Europeans trading in privacy for safety now may find the longer-term consequences unacceptable.\n\n\"The use of mass surveillance infrastructures can lead to a normalization of these highly intrusive tools, and the hasty introduction of apps, devices and cameras will, in the long term, lead to a dissolution of trust between employers and employees,\" said Ella Jakubowska, a researcher at internet rights association Edri.\n\nBusinesses are walking a fine line between keeping people safe and protecting their privacy. The absence of clear guidance from European regulators is forcing companies -- who could also be on the hook if they don't sufficiently protect workers -- to make \"extremely difficult decisions,\" according to Daniel Cooper, a partner at law firm Covington and Burling, who advises clients on tech regulation.\n\n\"The exposure of companies collecting that information goes up because it's sensitive,\" Cooper said. \"They also have to balance the privacy rights of the people whose data they're collecting and get that balance right and not break the law.\"\n\nAbout 23% of companies surveyed globally are considering workplace tracking or contact tracing to transition back to on-site work, according to a study published this month by tax and consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which is testing its own contact tracing tool in its Shanghai office.\n\n\"As lockdown is lifted, the turn to contact tracing may add a whole new layer of data being accumulated about where we go and what we do,\" Andrew Pakes, research director at U.K. Trade union Prospect, wrote in a blog post Tuesday, adding that \"the worry in many quarters is that we could be sleepwalking into further surveillance without safeguards in place.\"\n\nProviders of such monitoring technologies tout them as a safe way to get people back to work and revive economies crushed by lockdowns. While many acknowledge the systems aren't foolproof, they say infection risk can be capped.\n\n\"Our bracelets are tools to keep workers safe and to increase performance,\" said John Baekelmans, the chief executive officer of Rombit, the Belgian company whose bracelets will add a tracing feature in June to allow Antwerp port doctors to keep track of a possible spread in the virus.\n\nRombit sees the bracelets outlasting the virus as companies use them to track employees' health and performance. The company says it will supply such devices to 300 companies in the coming weeks.\n\nLike Rombit, Krakow, Poland-based Estimote Inc. is selling social-distancing devices to factories, research centers and hospitals, which also let them trace contacts made by any infected staffer.\n\nThe devices, attached to lanyards, buzz when workers have spent too much time near a colleague. Employees developing symptoms or testing positive can press a button on the gadget to notify the company, allowing it to trace all the people they've been in contact with.\n\n\"It's in our DNA to come close\" to other people, said Estimote CEO Jakub Krzych, adding that the devices alert users to those habits, keeping the spread of the virus in check.\n\nHerta Security in Barcelona is developing both mask-detection technology and facial recognition for touch-less access in workplaces, including for a global retail company that's considering using it in its offices in Europe and Latin America, according to Laura Blanc Pedregal, Herta's Chief Marketing Officer.\n\nShopping malls and major transport hubs in Spain, France, Israel and the U.S. will be using Paris-based Outsight's laser technology to ensure social distancing, its president and co-founder Raul Bravo said. Aeroports de Paris, which manages the French capital's airports, is testing Outsight lasers to monitor passenger flows.\n\nFever-checking thermal cameras are also starting to become ubiquitous. In Madrid, University Camilo Jose Cela is setting up a Chinese camera system that simultaneously measures students' temperatures and checks if they're wearing masks. Airports including London's Heathrow and Paris's Charles de Gaulle are testing thermal cameras.\n\n\"We sell more cameras every week,\" said Guenther Mull, CEO of German biometrics company Dermalog Identification Systems GmbH, which offers mask detection as an add-on to its software. \"The demand is currently very high.\"\n\nPrivacy advocates are alarmed. Thermal cameras could be seen as an invasion of privacy, said Rob van Eijk, managing director for Europe at the Future of Privacy Forum, a nonprofit think tank.\n\n\"It would pressure individuals with relatively higher body temperatures to disclose or divulge, likely against their will, their personal health information that might be unrelated to Covid-19 or other respiratory viral infections,\" he said.\n\nIn Europe, where breaching data protection laws can result in a fine of as much as 4% of annual global revenue, companies typically wouldn't link temperature readings to names or store the information. Still, fever readings wouldn't be difficult to trace back to an individual, said Covington and Burling's Cooper.\n\nFor now, the checks are being taken in stride. Consider the employees of Bayer 04 Leverkusen, the German soccer club, which invested in five Dermalog thermal cameras. When the Bundesliga became the first major soccer league to resume playing last weekend, the club was ready. It had been scanning its players when they came in for training.\n\nIn late April, while much of Germany was sheltering in place, professional soccer player Leon Bailey stood at the entrance of the club's training facilities to have his temperature taken. The camera zeroed in on his forehead to read a temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. No fever. He passed through the arena's gates and joined his teammates for practice.\n\n\"They see it's for their own safety,\" said Dr. Karl-Heinrich Dittmar, Bayer Leverkusen's medical director, in an interview. \"Nobody wants to become ill.\"\n\nRead More:\n\nBoxed Lunches and Cubicles Aplenty for Post-Virus Silicon Valley\n\nParis Tests Face-Mask Recognition Software on Metro Riders",

He said two more regions in the state are now qualified to reopen, and he expanded who is qualified for testing: those in the sectors returning to work first, in construction, manufacturing and curbside retail.\n\nUntil now, those permitted to get tests included anyone with Covid-19 symptoms, medical and emergency personnel and essential workers.\n\n\"The more tests, the better for the state,\" he said, saying New York is testing at a rate double that of the nation as a whole.\n\nThe state reported 1,889 new virus cases on Sunday, for a total of 350,121. New and total hospitalizations continue to fall, the governor said.\n\nNew York -- the center of the outbreak in the U.S., which has suffered almost 25,000 deaths -- has moved to reopen more cautiously than other states, and especially in hard-hit New York City.\n\nBut Cuomo has steadily announced more measures: He said Sunday two more regions, in western New York and near the capital of Albany, would begin reopening shortly, joining five others that began after the state's nearly two-month \"pause\" expired on May 15. The state has 10 regions.\n\nOn Saturday, he said some horse and car racing could open in June, though without fans, and the day before that the state's beaches would be open, at half capacity, for Memorial Day. New York City and surrounding areas remain on lockdown for at least two more weeks, though the warmer weather has brought more people to parks and the streets, some masked and socially distanced, others not.\n\nHe said the trajectory of the death rate in New York underscored the importance of avoiding a new surge in cases - which he said means a slow reopening and monitoring with testing and tracing of cases.\n\nSunday was the seventh day in a row that the number of new fatalities was under 200, while the number rocketed up quickly as the virus took hold in New York to a peak of 799 on April 9.\n\n\"That's why those spikes are dangerous,\" he said. \"Once you have the spike, coming down from the spike, there's a prolonged period of time.\"\n\nAs the state considers whether to allow summer camps and when to reopen schools in the fall, he said that the number of children being investigated for a rare condition and potentially fatal condition has risen to 120 -- a number he said he believed would rise.\n\nAt least three children have died in New York from what is being called pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome, in which victims develop not the usual respiratory symptoms of Covid-19 but dangerous internal inflammations, including to the heart.\n\nHe said 16 states and five countries are also looking at cases. \"We were told children were not affected,\" he said, saying the condition underscored how little is still understood about the coronavirus.\n\n\"There is an assumption that someone always knows the answer and they're just not telling us,\" he said. \"I'm telling you, nobody knows.\"",

Daily deaths have remained steady for over a week, in the 200s. Total deaths exceed 21,000.\n\n\"That number has been infuriatingly constant,\" Cuomo said. \"We would like to see that number dropping at a far faster rate.\"\n\nCuomo highlighted the risk to children, which has been reported more frequently in recent days.

President Donald Trump said on Friday he was in \"no rush\" to produce a new aid package that would help states.\n\nThe Democratic governor said the toll has been high, economically as well as emotionally, with mental health issues, domestic violence, substance abuse all rising.\n\n\"If it works the way it should, Washington and the federal government actually do the right thing,\" he said. \"How could they possibly ignore state governments, working families, working Americans? As bizarre as the federal government is at times, I cannot believe they would turn their back on working Americans at this time.\"\n\nThe state reported another 2,715 virus cases on Saturday, for a total of 333,122.\n\nThe state remains officially in lockdown until Friday, when Cuomo has said a phased-in reopening of economic activity will begin with construction and manufacturing in areas that have been less hard hit by illness -- chiefly upstate. On Saturday, he gave no indication when restrictions might be loosened in New York City or surrounding areas.",

        "body": "It's odd that central bankers aren't talking much about price movement, in either direction.\n\nThe economic contraction wrought by efforts to contain the coronavirus is shredding inflation. Now deflation, a prolonged period of falling prices, is stalking the globe. The collapsing oil market is both a symptom of weaker demand and cause for a deepening slump.\n\nHuge levels of stimulus are likely to be required long after the pandemic subsides. Yet concerns about prices moving up -- or even down, for that matter -- are starting to feel like an afterthought.\n\nThat's a mistake. For decades, inflation was the most-preferred way to assess economic health; whatever its flaws, targets in the vicinity of 2% gave global central banks a quantifiable guidepost. If there are alternatives, they haven't been proposed.\n\nFew, if any, central banks have a measurable employment target; same goes for gross domestic product. They have estimates and projections, but not fixed goals. Repairing labor markets and supporting the overall economy could very well become the new rationale, but let's say so and add some numbers to anchor policy going forward.\n\nIt's understandable that the human tragedy of climbing unemployment and the nosedive in the broader economy is taking precedence for policy makers. Inflation targets seem arcane, even churlish, in times of existential crisis. Certainly, there's little prospect of a meaningful spike, if history is anything to go by. A decade ago, conservative economists wrote an open letter to then-Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke warning that the Fed's quantitative easing would provoke runaway inflation and dollar debasement. Didn't happen.\n\nEven allowing for decent bounces in growth later this year and in 2021, it's likely to be a long time before anything resembling normal price increases reappear. Remember that policy makers were fretting about anemic inflation even before the pandemic struck. In its wake, global inflation may slip below zero, reckons Oxford Economics, a consulting firm. Consumer prices in advanced economies will rise just 0.5%, down from 1.5% in 2019, according to the International Monetary Fund. In Japan and South Korea, inflation will be much closer to zero; in Singapore and Thailand it will likely be negative. Even Australia and New Zealand, where levels were relatively close to target before the pandemic, are reviewing their forecasts.\n\nIf central bankers are worried about these figures, it's not the first thing that flows from their lips. In Japan, inflation has curiously faded from prominence in recent communication from the central bank, as Toru Fujioka and Sumio Ito of Bloomberg News reported. Elsewhere, policy makers are pursuing inflationary programs without devoting a ton of attention to the consequences. New Zealand, which used to trumpet its role as a pioneer of such targets, may start buying bonds directly from the government. Aimed at adding to fiscal firepower, the concept was sacrilege not long ago. Such measures are already under way in Indonesia and the Philippines.\n\nIn Australia, the Reserve Bank recently reviewed the first month of zero rates and efforts to cap bond yields. Governor Philip Lowe emphasized a rout in employment and the severity of the decline in gross domestic product. Prospects of deflation and prolonged low inflation took a backseat in a question-and-answer session after his April 21 speech.\n\nAs the coronavirus spreads, unemployment will surge and special monetary operations will continue. But when the shock of the lockdown wears off and the extent of the slump becomes apparent, it will be easy to forget how these expansive policies started in the first place. They will need to be justified, especially if -- or more likely, when -- central bank excursions into fiscal policy become contentious. At that point, monetary authorities need to be armed for the inevitable backlash.\n\nIf the direction of prices remains the sun around which policy evolves, better hope that inflation (or deflation) reenters the vocabulary soon. The emerging risk is that we occupy a halfway house of elevating jobs and growth, without a formal metric that defines success. In that case, policy could easily spin out of orbit.",

        "body": "If you're old enough to remember the 1970s in the U.S., or if you've ever lived in a country with runaway prices, you know the corrosive impact of high inflation and that awful feeling that your pay will never quite keep pace with the rising cost of everything else. Against that, it sounds odd to say inflation can ever be too low. But many economists had begun to worry about just that in recent years. And that was before the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWith demand for many goods and services wiped out by efforts to contain the deadly outbreak, there's a new concern that the economy's sudden and severe stumble could lead to a dangerous phenomenon known as deflation, when overall prices drop. \"The risk is definitely toward deflation,\" says Julia Coronado, president of Macropolicy Perspectives LLC. \"We're not quite forecasting it, but that's where the risk lies, and that would contribute to rising business failures in a negative feedback loop.\"\n\nAmericans are already getting the first taste of it. Food prices jumped in April, but overall inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, fell 0.8% from March. Another important measure, prices paid to U.S. producers, dropped 1.3%, the most in data going back to 2009.\n\nIf falling prices sound like an attractive scenario, think again. A few such months can be easily weathered -- the U.S. had eight straight months of year-over-year deflation in 2009. But an extended run can wreak considerable havoc. It's a sign that \"something else is royally screwed up in the economy,\" says Jeffrey Fuhrer, a senior fellow at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. The last time the U.S. dealt with a deep and extended period of deflation was 1930-33 during the Great Depression, when prices tumbled almost 25% over four years.\n\nDeflation can become more than just a symptom of deep dysfunction. It can be its own destructive force that makes a bad situation worse. Once it takes hold, consumers become ever more hesitant to make big-ticket purchases because that refrigerator, car, or addition to your house will all cost less if you wait a year. Even if this occurs only at the margin of every household budget, the accumulated impact can be damaging, slowing an already faltering economy.\n\nThe key, says Robert Rich, director of the Center for Inflation Research at the Cleveland Federal Reserve, is where people think prices are going. \"If, somehow, these initial periods start to become ingrained in people's expectations, then we can get into a very bad situation and a possible deflationary spiral,\" he says.\n\nDeflation is also tough on borrowers. In a healthy environment of largely steady 2% to 3% annual inflation, if your income merely keeps pace with prices, payments on your fixed-rate mortgage or car loan become more affordable with every passing year. That benefit disappears amid very low inflation and can go into reverse if prices and pay decline. In that case, your mortgage grows as a proportion of your income.\n\nThen there's the factor that troubles central bankers most about deflation: It's hard to solve. When inflation is running hot, the cure is painful but plain enough: Jack up rates as high as it takes to put the brakes on economic activity. That forces prices back down as the resulting unemployment trims wages and spending by individuals and businesses.\n\nWith deflation, it's hard to do the reverse and get rates low enough to provide the stimulus that will drive an economy out of the ditch. Japan, which has struggled through repeated bouts of deflation since the 1990s, has seen only limited success with negative rates. Over the past 25 years, its economy has averaged growth of less than 1% a year. \"From a central bank's perspective, we understand what needs to be done to bring down inflation,\" Rich says. \"But a deflationary episode represents a much greater challenge. Once expectations change and become more in tune with that environment, it becomes much more difficult to achieve an inflation objective.\"\n\nMost economists see extended deflation as still avoidable. Prices don't have to recover to pre-crisis levels; they simply need to stop falling. That should occur with even a very modest level of growth in the second half of this year.\n\nMore than one scenario might disrupt a second-half recovery, however. An obvious one involves a resurgence of the virus should business reopenings prove premature. Even without that, the damage done since March could mount should too many companies fail to make it to the other side of the shutdown. In the view of many economists, that puts the onus on Congress to pass another stimulus package to prevent a wave of business bankruptcies and stave off severe budget cuts by state and local governments. \"Right now, the odds of avoiding deflation are the odds of Congress and the administration being willing to approve additional support for the economy,\" says Bloomberg chief U.S. economist Carl Riccadonna.\n\nSo far, Republicans have balked at the Democrats' proposal for another massive relief bill, which would add $3 trillion in spending to $2.2 trillion already approved. Debate over a compromise is likely to continue for weeks.\n\nEscaping the deflationary spiral, however, will still leave the U.S. economy in a vulnerable, Japan-like spot. Pre-pandemic, annual CPI inflation in the U.S. over the past decade averaged just 1.8%. By the Fed's preferred inflation measure, it was even lower, at 1.5% -- half a point below the central bank's 2% target.\n\nThat's part of the reason interest rates never got very high after the last recession, and partly why the Fed had little room to cut them when Covid-19 came along. With a tepid recovery on the horizon, that will leave inflation even lower for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis is just the trap the Fed hoped to avoid when, in 2019, it conducted a yearlong review of its policy framework, hoping to settle on a strategy for getting inflation and rates to move higher. \"The concerns that motivated the framework review seem kind of quaint today,\" says Harvard's Fuhrer, who until this year served as a senior policy adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. \"I would wager, if not predict, that problem comes back in worse shape than it was before the crisis.\"\n\nRead next: U.S. Equity Markets Stubbornly Ignore Coronavirus Doom Everywhere",

The number was published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association and made headlines across the country.\n\nTwo days later, the journal issued a clarification amid a flurry of harsh criticism from scientists on Twitter. The abstract replaced the frightening 88% figure with a far more reassuring metric: Only 24.5% of coronavirus patients on ventilators at Northwell Health had died so far, the new version said. Yet none of the underlying mortality data in the study had changed.\n\nWhat happened? And which number is right? As it turns out, both are. The higher percentage is based on a tiny number of patients who either died or recovered within days. The lower percentage adjusts the death figures to include everyone on ventilators who was still alive and battling the virus at the time the study ended. Many of them may not survive, but some may.\n\n\"The numbers in the article were accurate,\" says Karina Davidson, senior vice president of research at Northwell Health, referring to the original mortality calculations. \"There was so much misinterpretation\" of the 88% mortality rate that Northwell opted for clarification.\n\nThe Northwell experience demonstrates how early research released in the middle of a health crisis can result in more confusion than clarification. In the push for medical answers, even top researchers and journals are having trouble getting the balance right. Their usually cautious and codified world of scientific research has suddenly morphed into a dizzying race to the finish line in the age of Covid-19. Medical studies are being pumped out faster than ever before. And public officials are struggling to interpret this gusher of data to make quick decisions that could affect the health and lives of billions of people around the world.\n\nThe Northwell Health study is one of the latest in a dramatic streak of confusing reports. Just days after JAMA clarified Northwell's ventilator death rate, drug maker Gilead Sciences Inc. issued a press release stoking excitement that it was nearing a breakthrough with its experimental treatment remdesivir, a drug seen as holding great promise for an early Covid-19 treatment. Hours after the company announced preliminary test results, Anthony Fauci, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director, touted a U.S. government study at a White House event, saying the drug had met its targets.\n\nFauci's comments buoyed a stock-market rally propelled earlier by Gilead's press release. But there was just one problem: On the very same day, The Lancet, a prestigious journal, published results from a small Chinese study that showed very different and less-promising results.\n\n\"It's not just a single trial that's going to hold the truth here,\" said John Norrie, a professor of medical statistics and trial methodology at the University of Edinburgh. \"The bottom line is, you can't rely on press releases,\" he said, which often contain a fraction of the information that's in a full study.\n\nSigns of the medical-data frenzy are everywhere. In recent weeks, numerous studies screening for antibodies -- a sign of past illnes -- found widely varying rates of infection in the population. The studies have been criticized by other scientists for their methodologies, including placing too much confidence in tests that may produce false positives.\n\nRead more: The debate over who has been infected by the virus\n\nStanford University researchers, who conducted one of the studies, also were questioned by doctors and scientists for relying on Facebook to seek volunteers, which may have skewed the findings by attracting people who previously had symptoms. On April 30, the authors posted an updated paper, more clearly laying out the study limitations and including more data on control samples, presenting a more-conservative estimate for infection prevalence rather than a range.\n\nOn March 18, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention put out early data suggesting Covid-19 hits younger people more often than had been previously believed. Deep in the report it became clear the data were incomplete and researchers didn't know the ages of 42% of those infected.\n\nAnd then there was the worldwide firestorm over hydroxychloroquine, fanned by President Donald Trump's tweets and public backing. It was ignited, in large part, by a small French study whose methods, including the lack of a good control group, have since been widely criticized by the medical and research community. The publisher and medical society that run the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents have commissioned an independent review to determine whether concerns about the study have merit, according to an April 11 statement.\n\n\"There are hundreds of articles out there, but the quality is quite poor\" in many, said Lauren Westafer, an emergency-room doctor and assistant professor at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Baystate, speaking broadly about falling standards during the pandemic. \"It's problematic to make conclusions based on that kind of data,\" added Westafer, who has a podcast about dissecting medical science. \"The methods and quality are so deeply flawed.\"\n\nThe acceleration of medical data is partly thanks to the rise of preprint services such as bioRxiv and medRxiv. The two sites often post drafts that haven't been reviewed by other scientists or published in medical journals.\n\nMedRxiv, launched less than a year ago, has been particularly inundated with coronavirus reports. While 225 papers were posted in January, when the virus was just emerging in China, the April total hit 1,500 -- 1,000 of which are related to the virus, said John Inglis, executive director of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, which started and manages the two archives.\n\nThe websites were developed originally to help researchers share their preliminary work and help refine it before publication. But since the coronavirus, the general public is increasingly digesting the information, often after it is tweeted out on social media or highlighted in media reports.\n\n\"We are acutely aware of the fact that there are many kinds of audiences now for what is appearing on our preprint services, and that is a new phenomenon,\" Inglis said. \"Most of the time, the audience for this preprint is a professional one, but the epidemic has opened them up to the public gaze.\"\n\nThe organization has tried to emphasize that the findings are preliminary and shouldn't be considered a guide to any type of medical care. Still, it's impossible to know what impact they are having.\n\n\"What we haven't yet developed is an infrastructure that is equipped to deal with this volume,\" Inglis said. \"Here is this massive information, and people need guidance on what is important and reliable and what is well done and what isn't well done,\" he said. \"Everyone is struggling to handle the volume.\"\n\nEven when research is careful and well vetted, the frenzy to get out new results can trip up researchers. Before it ran in the Journal of the American Medical Association, Northwell Health's patient study went through multiple revisions prior to publication. One goal of the study was to report a series of unusual symptoms that could help other hospitals better identity Covid-19 cases. The Northwell researchers worked tirelessly, in some cases holding conference calls at 2 a.m, the only time overworked doctors were available. One key finding: Only 31% of its Covid-19 patients had a fever at the time they were admitted.\n\n\"We were motivated to get information and results out as quickly as we could to help others manage these patients,\" Davidson said.\n\nAt some point during the review process, JAMA asked Northwell to add the mortality-rate figures, Davidson said. After the report was published, though, the journal said in a statement that its editors asked the Northwell authors to clarify the data, resulting in the revision. Davidson said Northwell initiated the clarification.\n\nTypically, researchers would wait for more-complete data before putting out mortality rates in such a study. But in this case, with the need to publish Covid-19 data quickly, Northwell researchers didn't yet know the fate of most patients. Of the 1,151 put on ventilators as of April 4, the outcome for only 320 was known at the time of publication: 38 were discharged alive and 282 died -- that's an 88% death rate.\n\nThe rate was more or less consistent with some reports from China and elsewhere among Covid-19 patients requiring ventilation. Still, the release sparked backlash.\n\n\"It's irresponsible to publish this kind of misleading mortality data prematurely,\" Robert Dickson, a critical-care doctor at the University of Michigan's medical center wrote in a tweet the day after the study was released. \"The take-away: '88% mortality among ventilated patients!' -- is absolutely going to inform goals-of-care discussions around the world. This sloppiness has consequences. It's maddening.\"\n\nNorthwell authors published their clarification the next day. They removed the 88% figure from the paper's abstract and added new language to the conclusion that noted doctors expect the ventilator mortality rate to decline as more complete results roll in.\n\nNorthwell said it expects to have 30-day-follow-up data providing a clearer picture on all the ventilated patients in the study sometime in May.",

Meanwhile, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Colorado, Nevada, Oregon, Washington and others are allowing curbside pickup.\n\n\"These are important changes,\" Kelly Fair, U.S. general counsel for Canopy Growth Corp., said in a May 5 media briefing hosted by the Cannabis Information Project. \"As related to Covid, we don't see curbside or delivery going away anytime soon.\"\n\nWhile the measures were put in place as a direct response to the pandemic, they're beneficial under any circumstances for medical marijuana users, particularly those who have limited mobility, said Heather Allman, who uses cannabis to alleviate symptoms of multiple sclerosis.\n\n\"Speaking as a patient, I would like to say all these changes made by the dispensaries have effectively and efficiently worked,\" Allman said. \"My wait times have been shorter and I've gotten more notifications about my orders.\"\n\nThe fact that the measures were implemented quickly and successfully will hopefully prompt regulators to keep them in place after Covid-19 has passed, said Nick Etten, vice president of government affairs for Acreage Holdings Inc.\n\n\"We definitely expect to see a lot of the provisions we've gotten over the last two months to continue,\" Etten said. \"We've shown we can operate in an environment whereby some of these restrictive regulations have been removed and we believe it's important to keep them in place.\"\n\nCannabis companies have also invested in new technologies to facilitate delivery and pickup, and allowing those services to continue \"would make these investments more sustainable,\" said Susanna Short, government affairs and public policy associate for iAnthus Capital Holdings Inc.\n\n\"Cannabis policy is relatively nascent, so there is always a bit of building the plane while we are flying it about these things,\" Short said. \"We are grateful for the rapid response around these particular types of improved access, and we will continue to push for permanency.\"\n\nPandemic Disrupting Illegal Drug Trade as Supply Chain Upended\n\nFlorida Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Recreational Marijuana",

        "body": "Bizarre symptoms make this virus different from other respiratory illnesses.\n\nUntil early April, the world thought of Covid-19 as a respiratory virus that would be understood once we knew how contagious it was and how deadly. Now, doctors are starting to recognize that this novel coronavirus is a disease unlike anything they've treated before.\n\nThe virus can disable the kidneys, inflame the GI tract, damage the heart and creep into the central nervous system. It can lead to blood clots. And it has surprised doctors around the world by causing blood oxygen to plunge to dangerous levels in patients who are still chatting on the phone rather than gasping for breath.\n\nThe prestigious journal \"Science\" calls it a \"rampage through the body from the brain to the toes.\"\n\nDealing with this disease cries out for new scientific methods -- ones that quickly glean information from patient data. Clinical trials are still the gold standard, but they take time. In a pandemic, doctors need to do the best they can with the information available. Likewise, medical privacy still matters, but many patients could accelerate scientific progress by choosing to allow temporary sharing of their data beyond what current regulations allow.\n\nThere are some encouraging signs that this process is underway. Hospitals are becoming \"living laboratories\" says Isaac Kohan, a professor and chair of biomedical informatics at Harvard Medical School. Doctors continue to update their understanding of ventilator use, which saves lives in some cases but may damage the lungs in others. Some patients but not others may benefit from antiviral medications, which have shown promise in some preliminary trials.\n\nAnd still others may be benefitting from powerful anti-inflammatory drugs, such as Actemra, an arthritis drug which doctors in New Jersey used to treat a 47-year-old marathon-running urologist who had been near death, according to a case history in STATnews. His severe illness appears tied to an extreme over-reaction of his immune system, called a cytokine storm.\n\nIt's not clear that his case is typical -- as the man's age and physical fitness are not typical of the severely ill. Some doctors worry that in other patients, suppressing the immune system will give the virus an advantage. But typical or not, the case provided useful data that might help others, taking some of the guesswork out of future cases.\n\nThe problem with all of these datapoints is coordinating them. People might think there's some big control center where scientists collect data to advance their understanding of Covid-19, says Kohane. There isn't, yet.\n\nIn fact, only 5.8% of cases reported to CDC have included clinical details. We need to do much better than that.\n\nThe electronic health record system could help. In an expanding data-collection project, Kohane and his colleagues have coordinated electronic records from more than 27,000 patients in 96 hospitals across five countries. So far, they've seen several patterns - changes in a measure called D-dimer, which predicts blood clots, for example, and in creatinine, which signals problems with kidney function.\n\nThese positive developments show an upside to electronic health records, which are notorious among doctors for taking up time they should be spending with patients, and functioning mostly to justify billing, says Kohane. It also shows how sharing data across proprietary health records systems -- anathema to their business models -- can improve public health outcomes.\n\n\"The hope is this will usher in a different era,\" says Yale University medical professor Harlan Krumholz, in which doctors make use of pooled data to leverage each other's insights. \"In a moment like this every second counts. We want to get smarter for every patient that comes in.\"\n\nSifting through carefully collected data is very different from trusting anecdotes. The right sifting of data would have revealed the deadly side-effects of the painkiller Vioxx, Kohane says, long before thousands of people died. Likewise, better data science might have picked up a signal of Covid-19 spread in the United States in February, by noting a spike in influenza cases or an unusual number of flu patients needing respirators. Instead, it was only this week that scientists realized that some deaths had already occurred in California by February 6, long before the first recognized outbreak in Washington State.\n\nThe data Kohane's group is using has been aggregated to protect patient privacy. And privacy protections do limit how much information doctors can share. It's hard to know how any patient's individual story ends, for example -- whether lab measurements stopped because a patient recovered, or because that patient died. Despite the regulations that inhibit sharing patient information, many patients have been keen to share their data and their stories. Their collective will to help is another powerful weapon in this new mode of science.\n\nThe \"true\" death rate of Covid-19 -- whatever it may be -- is not a law of nature, but in part a function of how doctors treat the disease. The more they learn, the lower that fatality rate will fall. And to learn faster, they need better ways to collect patient data and share it with each other.",

That is to conduct so-called human-challenge studies, in which volunteers treated with experimental vaccines are then deliberately infected with the novel coronavirus. This would enable researchers to observe in a matter of weeks whether the vaccine candidate is protective -- rather than wait months for subjects in a standard clinical trial to randomly catch the disease.\n\nThe idea of infecting healthy subjects with Covid-19 might strike you as repellent. And yet many scientists and policy makers say it's worth thinking about.\n\nThe downside is significant. The strategy calls to mind horrendous experiments in which Nazi prisoners were injected with tuberculosis bacteria, or those in which New York City children with mental disabilities were infected with hepatitis A. It contradicts the maxim to first do no harm. But deliberately infecting well-informed volunteers is in fact an accepted way of investigating vaccines for infectious diseases, and has been used in trials involving malaria, typhoid and cholera. Medical ethicists say that when such research is done with all due medical care and with the full consent of adult subjects who demonstrably understand the risks, then the potential to save lives can justify it.\n\nThe catch with Covid-19 is that, unlike malaria, typhoid and cholera, it has no proven treatment. What's more, the risk to volunteers is very hard to assess, given how much about the disease remains mysterious, including why some people are more vulnerable than others. The risk of death in people age 20 to 44 appears to be less than 0.2%, but doctors do not yet know why certain young people suffer strokes or otherwise become gravely ill from the new coronavirus. On the other hand, Covid-19 is under intense and widespread scientific scrutiny. Some of its mysteries might be cleared up in the weeks and months ahead, and effective treatments could come into view -- as remdesivir has in a preliminary way. Research published just last week has revealed biomarkers that can identify individuals who are especially vulnerable.\n\nSo it makes sense, even as ethicists, vaccine developers and the larger scientific community examine the pros and cons, to begin the lengthy process of laying the groundwork, just in case.\n\nIt could take six months or more to prepare. Researchers would need time to select a specific strain of the virus to use (either a natural one or a weakened version), purify it and determine the precise dose to be used in a trial. (The lowest possible dose is desirable, but it must be enough to cause the disease.) Also, volunteers would need to be isolated for at least a couple of weeks and then, if necessary, receive state-of-the-art medical treatment. Volunteers would have to be screened to ensure that they fully understand what they're in for -- for example, by taking tests designed to measure their comprehension of the risks.\n\nAlready, more than 22,000 people have volunteered to participate in human challenge studies for vaccines. Not all of them would qualify as being minimally at-risk -- young adults with no underlying health conditions -- and appropriately aware of the dangers. But it would take only 50 to 150 of them to conduct a vaccine trial that involved deliberate infection with Covid-19. Any vaccine candidate that passed such a challenge trial could then be tested in a field study lasting a few months in which some 3,000 subjects would be given the drug to ensure that it triggers an adequate immune response in people of all ages and causes no unacceptable side effects.\n\nThe alternative is to conduct a phase III clinical trial to test whether the vaccine candidate offers greater protection than a placebo against Covid-19. This takes many months, because a significant number of subjects need to become infected accidentally -- in an environment where people are trying hard to avoid infection by wearing masks and keeping their distance from others.\n\nGiven how quickly some vaccine developers are moving their candidates along, it's conceivable that at least one will succeed before a human challenge trial could be arranged. That would be good news. But it's likely that more than one vaccine will be needed, and challenge trials could be useful in screening other possibilities. (More than 100 are in the pipeline.)\n\nChallenge trials could also teach scientists much about the details of human infection by the new coronavirus. Because subjects would be followed from the moment of exposure, it would be possible to measure exactly how long it takes before symptoms appear, how long the body needs to clear the virus and how long people are contagious.\n\nIt's difficult to be entirely comfortable with the idea of deliberate Covid-19 infection. As National Institutes of Health leaders Francis Collins and Anthony Fauci have said, the strategy would first need to be thoroughly evaluated by vaccine scientists and ethicists. It would be crucial to ensure that such studies were carefully carried out, and that they really had the potential to yield an effective vaccine faster. Given the enormous cost of delay, the idea should not be dismissed.\n\n--Editors: Mary Duenwald, Clive Crook\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinion's editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net .",

        "body": "Abbott device in use at White House had false negatives: study\n\nNew research is raising more questions about tests used around the U.S. to diagnose Covid-19 patients, with some of the tests producing a surprisingly high rate of false negatives that incorrectly show a person isn't infected.\n\nOne study released Wednesday examining an Abbott Laboratories test that's used at the White House to get rapid diagnoses indicated it may miss as many as half of positive cases. A second peer-reviewed study released hours later suggested that results for another type of widely used diagnostic test are particularly unreliable early on in an infection.\n\nThe first study found that Abbott's ID NOW machine missed at least one-third of positive cases detected with a rival test, and as many as 48% when using the currently recommended dry nasal swabs, according to the report on BioRxiv, a server where researchers post early work before it has been reviewed by other scientists.\n\nAbbott immediately disputed the results, which came from researchers at New York University, and said that they didn't use the test as intended. The company said its data showed a false-negative rate of 0.02%.\n\nThe second analysis, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine and authored by Johns Hopkins researchers, analyzed seven previously-published studies evaluating 1,330 patient samples and focused on a group of widely-used Covid-19 diagnostic tests known as \"polymerase chain reaction\" tests. It suggested that false negatives are especially likely before the onset of symptoms, such as when a patient is tested soon after exposure to the virus.\n\nWhen patients were tested immediately after infection, typically before symptoms occur, the false-negative rate was 100%. On the first day of symptoms, the false-negative rate was 38%. After three days of symptoms, false-negatives dropped to 20%. The rate began getting worse after five days, suggesting a narrow window for the most accurate results.\n\nAccurate diagnosis of coronavirus infections is considered a crucial tool to help identify and control infections. But the technology used by the tests can depend on getting an adequate sample from the patient, often with a swab that reaches deep into the nasal passages. If the sample collected doesn't have enough viral material on it, either because of how it was collected or because of how far along the infection is, it can affect the result. Low accuracy from the tests could diminish their usefulness as a catch-all screening tool for public-health workers and medical personnel treating patients.\n\nThe White House is frequently testing staff, governors, lawmakers, reporters and others who come in close contact with the president using Abbott's ID Now. The testing machine, which is roughly the size of a toaster, is portable and doesn't require deep nasal swabs, about which President Donald Trump once said there is \"nothing pleasant.\"\n\nTrump touted the Abbott machine with great fanfare in the White House Rose Garden after the Food and Drug Administration approved it for emergency use, saying it could be a godsend for hospitals and workplaces because it \"delivers lightning-fast results in as little as five minutes.\"\n\n\"That's a whole new ballgame,\" the president said at the March 30 event.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the study, referring questions to the Food and Drug Administration. The agency is \"reviewing the information in this non-peer-reviewed study,\" a spokeswoman said Wednesday.\n\nShares of Abbott fell 1.8% to $92.16 in New York on Wednesday. They are up 6.1% this year.\n\nThe results of the NYU study of Abbott's machine, if confirmed, indicate the test may still suffer from high false-negative rates despite changes recommended by the company to avoid such a problem. In April, after other academic researchers raised concerns about the issue, Abbott told clinicians to avoid storing samples in so-called transport media, a liquid used to hold the sample, as that might dilute the test and lead to false negatives.\n\nBut when the NYU authors attempted to account for changes and avoid false negatives by using dry swabs, the performance was even worse. It missed the virus in 48% of the samples that were positive using Cepheid GeneXpert, a standard reference test sold by Danaher Corp. The NYU study hasn't yet been reviewed by outside experts or published in a scientific journal.\n\nAbbott said its scientists are still reviewing the 12-page paper. It has distributed about 1.8 million ID NOW tests and said it hasn't found the problem identified by the NYU report.\n\n\"It's unclear if the samples were tested correctly, and we're further evaluating the results,\" said Darcy Ross, an Abbott spokeswoman. \"The test is performing as expected when it's used correctly.\"\n\nThe researchers, who tracked infections among 101 patients treated in the emergency department at NYU Langone Tisch Hospital, said they stand by their findings and the conclusion that the technology is unacceptable for use in a clinical setting.\n\nThey also acknowledged the limitations of the study in a statement, including its small size and the testing of the samples in a laboratory rather than at the point of care. They declined interview requests.\n\nAbbott's ID NOW is a point-of-care test that can be done quickly in a health-care setting. Other tests require a sample to be shipped to a lab, with results available after several days. The rapid approach has been widely viewed as a key to ramping up hamstrung U.S. testing efforts, giving answers more efficiently and directing resources to those who are truly sick.\n\nConcerns about false negatives, though, call into question whether the Abbott test will be able to alleviate the strain on U.S. testing efforts as intended.\n\nScientists have developed a variety of tests to detect the novel coronavirus,\n\nand some haven't been vetted with the usual rigor by federal health regulators. It is also still unclear at what point in the incubation period of the virus any test is most likely to produce an accurate result. Enough information about the virus is simply not yet known.\n\nSeveral tests have sparked concern about false negatives. Doctors have reported patients with obvious signs of the disease testing negative. While the scale of the problem hasn't yet been determined, experts agree that it is prevalent.\n\nFalse negatives can hinder diagnosis of disease, obscure the full scope of an outbreak and raise the potential that sick people could unknowingly spread a pathogen.\n\nDoctors at hospitals around the country have reported patients testing negative sometimes multiple times before eventually testing positive. Some doctors have instead at times turned to other methods of diagnosis, such as chest X-rays or CT scans.",

        "body": "More than any economic data, the waning sense of immediate threat from the coronavirus has driven gains.\n\nTo get John Authers' newsletter delivered directly to your inbox, sign up here.\n\nWe had a slight interruption in the mood of optimism Tuesday, as U.S. stock markets took a step back. The main decliners were the tech stocks that had led the advance, and whose rally looked overstretched. There wasn't necessarily much to worry about in this. This was one of those rare \"healthy corrections\" that was actually healthy and went some way toward correcting something.\n\nHowever, the ex-post explanations for an unremarkable negative day centered on disappointing economic data. There is a lot more data to come this week that may prove disappointing. But I saw little in the Tuesday data that would have disconcerted anyone enough to prompt them to sell stocks. This was the Conference Board's consumer confidence index, which was the worst outcome since 2014 -- though barely below the average for the last 20 years:\n\nGiven the horrors that roiled U.S. consumers last month, it's impressive that they remain more confident than they were at any point in a six-year period starting early in 2008. I see no reason for anyone who hadn't already sold stocks to do so on the basis of this data.\n\nThat leads to another issue, which is to try to understand just why the market has rallied as much as it has since its nadir last month. An ex-post justification is taking force that this was down to the external factor of the coronavirus. The markets calmed as evidence multiplied that the virus had peaked. The following chart is from Torsten Slok, chief U.S. economist of Deutsche Bank AG, and it shows that the rise and fall of the VIX volatility index overlapped neatly with the rise and the fall in the number of countries with a daily growth rate of cases of 5% or more:\n\nThis probably does capture some kind of truth. While we can all argue about the economic impact of the measures to contain the pandemic, Slok's chart captures a realization that took place a little bit more than a month ago: that social distancing would be effective in stopping the most catastrophic outcomes. As this became clear, stock market volatility reduced. It certainly helps to have removed one disaster scenario.\n\nThere is more going on than this, however. We have almost unlimited help from the Federal Reserve. The experience of the last decade shows how this could power the stock market forward. Action by the Fed and others didn't just juice up stocks for the future -- it also averted a credit collapse. This has a lot to do with recovering stocks and reducing volatility.\n\nThen there is the fact that Slok and his team obviously had to work quite hard to find a measure of the pandemic that matched the VIX so closely. It does look like fitting data to a pre-existing hypothesis. There are other Covid-19-related factors that also seem to influence the VIX. The following chart comes from Peter Atwater of Financial Insyghts, and compares Google Trends searches for \"coronavirus symptoms\" -- something you typically look up when you're worried that you or a loved one might have Covid-19 -- to Slok's chart of the VIX and the global progress of the pandemic:\n\nJudging by Google, people's fears that they themselves had the coronavirus peaked at about the point that volatility did , and have since declined. Atwater's point is that at least in the initial \"panic\" stage, much of the selling was driven by personal immediacy or a \"me, here, now\" mentality. Consciously or unconsciously, the more scared you are that you have Covid-19 yourself, the more this will affect your actions.\n\nSince then, we have all learned a lot more about the disease. Viewing it from the \"epicenter\" of New York City, it looks to me as though a lot of what we have learned is negative. It may be \"mild\" for 80% of cases, but \"mild\" for adults still means feeling horribly ill for a week or so, even if it doesn't mean hospitalization. There are far more people with underlying conditions that could make Covid-19 dangerous than had initially been thought. There's really no way we're going to be truly back to normal until someone can vaccinate us. And the impact on health workers is heart-wrenching.\n\nI direct readers to the tragic story of Lorna Breen, the physician who headed our neighborhood emergency room, which I and my family have used on several occasions. Her life ended by suicide last week. She had witnessed what must have been atrocious scenes at a hospital that served one of the most severely affected areas of the city, and had contracted the disease herself. As her father told the New York Times, she was a hero, who did great work to serve her community.\n\nI raise this partly because it has deeply moved me. But also because the issue of immediacy matters greatly to any explanation of the market. I am inclined to agree with Atwater that fear intensified into March, when the threat seemed very immediate to many, and then declined as it began to seem less proximate -- people got the message that they were unlikely to die themselves, and grew to understand that social distancing was working. Add this basic, almost subliminal human sentiment to the rational reasons to buy the market provided by the Fed, and you have your rally. Those who feel more immediately and personally exposed to the human impact of the virus -- such as all of us who live in New York -- are likely to feel more bearish. Possibly excessively so.\n\nWhere does this leave us? The rest of the week will have plenty of earnings announcements and central bank meetings to give rational reasons to buy or sell the market. Beyond that, the reduction in personal fear of the virus, and the unquestionable successes in holding it back, may have led to an irrational reduction in estimates of the economic damage.\n\nScientists in China suggest that Covid-19 could become a recurring seasonal disease; Singapore has been hit by a second wave of infections after apparently fighting off a first successfully; Germany has started to reopen its economy and already faces concerns that it has done so too soon. Production might be able to return to normal reasonably swiftly over the next few months -- but surely consumption cannot be anywhere close to normal again until there is a vaccine. Or maybe I am just saying that because I live in a community where the problem is still severe.\n\nI fear that the market rally has been driven by people for whom the virus seems less immediate and close, and who have moved from excessive fear to over-optimistic forecasts that the disease will now disappear. That at least is the view from Washington Heights, Manhattan.\n\nAnd rest in peace, Lorna Breen.\n\nSometimes, the claustrophobia of social distancing makes us bottle everything up inside. This is unhealthy. Much of the time it's better just to let it all out. I therefore strongly recommend this video to show how you how one music teacher is helping her students to express their feelings.\n\nLet's hope we don't all have the same feelings about Jerome Powell's press conference on the morrow.",

        "body": "Oil plunges again, another big day for corporate earnings, and we may be stuck with the virus for a long time. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today.\n\nWest Texas Intermediate for June delivery traded close to $10 a barrel this morning, extending losses as exchange-traded funds and indexes reduce their exposure to the front-month contract in the wake of last week's drop into negative territory. The United States Oil Fund LP unexpectedly started selling its holdings of the most actively trading WTI futures contract yesterday, and S&P Global Inc. told clients to roll all their exposure into July with immediate effect. The rush for storage continues, with U.S. oil companies leasing space in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, while South Korea has run out of capacity for third-party companies.\n\nAnalysts will be looking to get a health check on the economy today when a raft of companies report results. Before the bell, Caterpillar Inc. and Southwest Airlines Co. will update investors. Tech earnings season kicks off later, with Alphabet Inc.'s results expected to show strong cloud growth, while spending on advertising will have been hit hard in the first quarter. Ford Motor Co. and Starbucks Corp. also report later.\n\nWhile much of the world is looking to reopen, Chinese scientists are warning that the virus may return in waves like the flu. The high number of people who carry the coronavirus without having any symptoms means it is very hard to fully contain transmission. In the shorter term, the White House issued a strategy to expand testing in cooperation with retailers including Walmart Inc. and CVS Health Corp. with President Donald Trump saying he is confident there is enough testing to begin \"the reopening process.\" Spain and France will spell out their plans to ease lockdowns, while Germany saw the number of new infections fall below 1,000 for the first time in more than five weeks.\n\nGlobal equities are posting another day of gains after the S&P 500 Index ended yesterday's session at the highest level since March 10. Overnight the MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.7% while Japan's Topix index closed 0.1% higher. After getting the session off to a slow start, Europe's Stoxx 600 Index had risen 1.5% by 5:50 a.m. Eastern Time. S&P 500 futures were pointing to more green at the open, the 10-year Treasury yield was at 0.662% and gold slipped.\n\nThe advance-goods trade balance and wholesale inventories data for March is published at 8:30 a.m. There is unlikely to be much useful information in pre-lockdown February house price numbers at 9:00 a.m. Conference Board Confidence and Richmond Fed Manufacturing data, both for April, is at 10:00 a.m. The two-day Federal Reserve meeting begins. In politics, the Ohio primary ends today, Joe Biden holds a virtual town hall, and President Trump is scheduled to speak on the small business paycheck protection program.",

Munoz and other family members called the facility daily to check on the couple, but they weren't alerted to any concerns until Munoz's 97-year-old grandfather, Jesus, had been ill for a week and was too frail to talk on the phone. On April 11, as Jesus got sicker, the staff moved his wife, Basila, out of the room. On April 12, he died alone -- and Basila, 96, still hasn't been told her husband of seven decades is dead.\n\nJesus was never tested for the virus, but it was rampant in the home, and Basila was confirmed positive a day after his death. \"Everything was so confusing, you feel helpless,\" Munoz said. \"They tell us she doesn't have symptoms, but we don't believe anything they say anymore. I've talked to her just once, and she asked when we might visit. I didn't know what to say.\"\n\nEven as Europe's leaders slowly begin to chart a course out of coronavirus lockdown, the grim extent of mortality in the region's retirement homes is just beginning to emerge. As many as half the people killed by the coronavirus in Europe were residents in long-term care facilities, the World Health Organization said on Thursday.\n\nThe data show a \"deeply troubling\" picture of the vulnerability of older people in care, said Hans Kluge, regional director for WHO Europe. He said even the oldest patients have a good chance of recovery from the virus if they're well cared for, but procedures at some facilities have helped spread the virus. \"This is an unimaginable human tragedy,\" Kluge said.\n\nContaining the virus in care homes will be key to weathering the pandemic in the coming months in Europe and places such as the U.S. as the outbreak spreads. Almost 4 million Europeans live in nursing homes, both privately owned and state-operated, and with populations aging, their numbers jumped more than a fifth in the decade to 2017, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nAs governments move to ease restrictions and get their economies moving again, they'll need to ensure the safety of people in homes. Based on the alarming numbers, Europe's health officials are preparing a surveillance system to monitor virus deaths at facilities for the elderly -- both to improve the standards of care and to alert authorities if \"a second wave is coming, which we expect,\" said Agoritsa Baka, a senior expert at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nRetirement homes \"need to be much more alert to what is happening, both to staff and residents, to prevent this thing from happening again,\" Baka said.\n\nAccounts from workers and families show that as Europe's nursing homes struggled to address the virus, policies on protective gear and quarantining positive cases were sometimes implemented too late to save lives. In some countries, a shortage of tests made it difficult to track the spread. And families-themselves confined at home-struggled to get basic information about their relatives' health.\n\nIn Mougins, a village surrounded by pine and olive forests in the hills above Cannes in southern France, families remained in the dark as the virus killed more than a third of the 109 residents in La Riviera, a private facility run by Korian SA, according to Fabien Arakelian, a lawyer representing families of people at the home. One client heard about her father's death via a text message from undertakers, he said. With visitors barred from French nursing homes until this week, none were able to see their relatives before they died.\n\n\"It's the law of silence,\" Arakelian said, adding that residents weren't screened for the virus until April 6, several days after some caregivers had tested positive.\n\nThe prosecutor in the nearby city of Grasse has opened an investigation. Emmanuel Daoud, a lawyer working for Korian, Europe's biggest operator of nursing homes, says staff followed regulations and exhibited no negligence in their care.\n\nSome facilities spared thus far are struggling with a lack of tests. After a staffer was confirmed to have the virus at Les 3 Moulins, a 72-resident home in Sainte-Gemmes-sur-Loire, in western France, testing all patients and staff wasn't an option, according to director Delphine Lecomte. So the staffer was given a three-week sick leave, \"and we're monitoring other people for symptoms,\" Lecomte said.\n\nAssessing the true toll has been a struggle across Europe. France initially didn't count nursing-home deaths in its official virus tally, and when it started including them in early April, daily fatalities more than doubled. In Spain, an unpublished government report cited by RTVE public television on April 23 estimated that retirement-home patients accounted for two-thirds of overall coronavirus deaths -- almost 14,000 people. And while the U.K. is struggling to determine how many virus-related deaths have occurred in care homes, the National Care Forum estimated that they doubled in just one week in April.\n\n\"It's unbelievable that it's taken so long to get the data sorted out,\" said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"Without good data, I can't actually understand how you can even start thinking about opening up.\"\n\nIn Milan, the epicenter of the Italian epidemic, police last week raided the 1,000-resident Pio Albergo Trivulzio in a criminal probe into more than 200 virus deaths in the nursing home, according to people familiar with the matter. Managers at the publicly owned facility, the country's biggest, are suspected of hiding virus-positive patients, said the people, who asked not to be named because the investigation isn't public.\n\n\"I saw tears and fear in my colleagues' eyes,\" said Stefania Martini, a technician at the home who is now in quarantine. Management warned staff against wearing masks \"because we might scare patients, creating a false sense of emergency,\" Martini said. A spokeswoman for the facility declined to comment.\n\nEven in Germany, where the virus took longer to spread into facilities for the elderly, between one-third and one-half of all virus deaths have been linked to care homes of some kind. Once below 1%, the German fatality rate for the virus has crept above 3% as it spreads through nursing homes, according to the Robert Koch Institute, the country's public-health authority.\n\nGermany's lower death rate may be because relatively few elderly Germans live with their families, said Jennifer Dowd, an associate professor at the University of Oxford. In southern Europe, by contrast, there's greater cross-generational contact, with grandma or grandpa more likely to bunk in a spare room.\n\n\"In countries where the older population is more physically and socially separated from working-age people, it might actually take longer to reach those vulnerable populations,\" Dowd said. \"Once it's in, it's obviously a disaster.\"",

This approach is good for clinical purposes, but less so for population surveillance, according to William Aldis, formerly the World Health Organization's representative in Thailand.\n\nThe country needs to pick representative groups, ideally province-by-province, and test them recurringly to get a sense of the incidence of the virus within the population over time, said Aldis. This is a \"paradigm shift\" to so-called sentinel surveillance from the current approach of \"more or less what we call opportunistic sampling,\" he added.\n\n\"You need systematic collection of data,\" said Aldis, now an adjunct assistant professor at Thammasat University's Faculty of Public Health in Thailand. \"You get a better decision if you're taking this approach. It certainly gives it a level of validity we don't have now.\"\n\nCountries around the world are trying to improve testing to track the disease. While Thailand plans to do some sentinel surveillance of patients with influenza-like illnesses, testing remains focused on those at high risk of novel coronavirus infection, according to Tanarak Plipat, deputy head of the disease control department.\n\nConfirmed daily new cases have declined during a state of emergency and partial lockdown that's due to expire at the end of April. Officials are working on a plan for restarting the economy -- which is headed for a deep contraction -- while stressing such moves would be gradual and preserve social distancing.\n\nThailand reported 32 new coronavirus cases Sunday, taking the total to 2,765. The rate of new cases has declined from more than 100 each day in late March and early April.\n\nSome businesses are gearing up for the lockdown to end. Central Department Store Co., a unit of the country's biggest mall operator, sent a letter telling tenants and employees to prepare for reopening on May 1, though \"the date will be based on the government's official announcement.\"\n\nThe Thai government is due to meet this week to deliberate relaxing of measures and state-of-emergency rules that have been in place since late March.",

Doctors found he had Covid-19 by retroactively testing his respiratory samples along with those from a handful of hospitalized patients, describing their work in a case report.\n\nThe finding contradicts official statistics, which show the first Covid-19 cases in France occurred in people who returned from Wuhan, China, at the end of January. They also raise questions about how the patient was infected. Virologists who studied the main strains of the virus circulating in France last month concluded that they probably didn't come directly from China or Italy, and had been spreading undocumented for some time.\n\n\"Identifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge regarding Sars-CoV-2 and its spreading in the country,\" Yves Cohen, the head of intensive care at two large hospitals northeast of Paris, and colleagues wrote in the report. \"Moreover, the absence of a link with China and the lack of recent travel suggest that the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December.\"\n\nThe researchers said official numbers, which peg Covid-19 cases at 203,253 in France, probably underestimate the disease's impact, and that their findings could \"change our understanding of the dynamic of the epidemic.\"\n\nA spokesman for the World Health Organization said other countries may make similar discoveries by running new tests on samples from patients who were sick in December and January.\n\n\"It's the old story of the deeper you look, the more you find,\" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said at a press briefing Tuesday.\n\nCohen and his team reviewed medical records of patients admitted from early December to mid-January. The researchers selected 14 frozen respiratory samples from people with Covid-19-like symptoms who hadn't tested positive for other coronaviruses or the flu. When one came up positive for Sars-CoV-2, they confirmed the result with another more powerful test that checked the quality of the sample.\n\nThe patient, a man born in Algeria who hadn't traveled there since August, had a medical history of asthma and type 2 diabetes.\n\nHe came to the emergency ward on Dec. 27 with a blood-stained cough, headache and a fever that had developed over the previous four days. A CT scan of his lungs was opaque, a sign of tissue damage and abnormalities. He was admitted to intensive care, treated with antibiotics and discharged on Dec. 29 after getting better.\n\nOne of the man's children reportedly had flu-like symptoms before his developed. It's likely that \"many asymptomatic patients were not diagnosed during January 2020 and contributed to the spread of this epidemic,\" the authors wrote.",

The number of patients in hospitals and intensive care continued to decline.\n\nDeaths linked to the virus rose by 544 to 21,340 fatalities, Director General for Health Jerome Salomon said at a briefing in Paris on Wednesday. The number of deaths has been largely stable in the past three days.\n\nThe country has been on lockdown since March 17 in a bid to slow the outbreak, and confinement measures have been extended to May. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has said the government will unveil plans to progressively lift the restrictions.\n\n\"We're in a preparation phase for the second stage -- I'm not talking about going back to normal life -- we don't know how long it will last for after May 11,\" President Emmanuel Macron said on a visit to a supermarket in western France, where he sought to thank staff who have continued to work amid the lockdown. \"The share of population that's immunized, even in affected regions, is small. We need to lower the number of daily cases in the country for the situation to be manageable.\"\n\nBased on the situation in France mid-March, confinement was the only possible strategy, according to Macron. Lifting the measures might happen faster in places where the virus hasn't spread, \"that's part of the strategy the government is working on,\" he said.\n\nThe number of patients in intensive care, which Salomon has said is an indicator of the outbreak's impact on France's hospital system, has been falling for two weeks, dropping on Wednesday by 215 to 5,218. The overall number of hospitalized patients fell for an eighth day day to 29,741, the lowest since April 6.\n\nEven as the overall number of patients in hospitals and intensive care declines, Salomon repeated that the virus continues to circulate at a high level in France, with hundreds of people newly hospitalized every day.\n\n\"This epidemic is massive; it's severe,\" Salomon said. \"We must all comply with confinement and social distancing.\"\n\nFrance's public-health service on Tuesday revised down the number of reported coronavirus cases in nursing homes, putting total cases in the country at 178,172 infections, lower than the total reported a day earlier. France's daily coronavirus figures have fluctuated amid inconsistent reporting from nursing homes, which were first included in the tally this month, and which includes probable cases based on symptoms.",

        "body": "Poorly paid yet essential food workers at risk of coronavirus\n\nFor weeks, Gloria Carrera wrestled with a question millions of food workers face: Should she go to work and risk getting infected, or stay home and risk going broke?\n\n\"Both decisions feel the same -- and feel hard,\" said the 43-year-old tomato picker in Florida. In the end, she decided she needs the paycheck too much to sit out the pandemic.\n\nBy now, the Covid-19 outbreaks pulsing through the U.S. meatpacking industry have been widely reported, but across continents and product lines, similar stories are playing out on a smaller scale. In South Africa, a bread factory shut after 12 staffers tested positive. In Holland, five Kraft Heinz Co. plant workers reportedly caught the bug. In Brazil, coffee growers worry they can't keep their employees safe and, in Honduras, a fruit export giant has been accused of downplaying the risks.\n\nThe flareups highlight how a combination of close working quarters and unforgiving attendance policies can turn the front lines of the global food supply chain into the perfect breeding ground for the coronavirus. Food workers, poorly paid yet essential, often feel they have no choice but to keep clocking in.\n\n\"Meat plant workers are not soldiers called to sacrifice health and life for the benefit of all,\" said Lincoln Cordeiro, a labor prosecutor in Brazil investigating reports of outbreaks at some slaughterhouses.\n\nIn the U.S., where harvests are already underway but will peak as the weather gets warmer, advocates worry that farmhands who work and sleep in groups are particularly susceptible. There are about 2.5 million to 3 million workers on farms of all sizes, with about three-quarters estimated to be foreign born.\n\nIn East Wenatchee, Washington, Stemilt Growers tested 71 orchard workers, who were housed in the same complex, after some co-workers started feeling sick. Thirty-six tested positive, although they showed no symptoms, according to the company.\n\n\"It makes you wonder about the prevalence of the virus in the essential workforce,\" said Erik Nicholson, vice president for the United Farm Workers union. Stemilt acted responsibly in testing workers at the first sign of trouble, but throughout the industry, there's a \"woeful lack of testing,\" he said.\n\nGrowers from Brazil to the U.S. and Europe say they are taking the measures they can. Advocates say they aren't enough.\n\nBusinesses have touted improved communication with employees, newly installed hand-washing stations in fields, and social distancing measures to the extent possible. Personal protective equipment like masks and gloves are being supplied to workers when available, they say. Other growers are separating crews into teams so if one member gets sick, it won't take out the entire workforce.\n\n\"You hope the measures you're taking will protect you,\" says Charles Hall, executive director of the Georgia Fruit & Vegetable Growers Association. Still, he concedes, it's not a perfect system. \"On a farm, it's hard to be 100% at six feet apart.\"\n\nBruce Goldstein at Farmworker Justice and Edgar Franks of Familias Unidas por la Justicia say their members haven't seen many of the steps implemented. Instead, they say, the facts aren't reaching workers and, in some cases, misinformation is. Some employers have told farmhands the pandemic doesn't exist or that it's fake news, the Washington D.C.-based Centro de los Derechos del Migrante told reporters earlier this month.\n\n\"We're living and working as if everything were normal,\" said Maria Cisneros, who picks fruit at an orchard in Washington state. She said no gloves, masks or disinfectant have been offered to workers, who still gather tightly for meetings. Some use bleach or soap and water to try to disinfect things on their own, while others avoid bathrooms for fear of getting infected. \"We're really, really scared.\"\n\nIn Honduras, a manager at the fruit export company Fyffes told workers that locals \"are protected because we've eaten dirt since we were young,\" according to two employees and the non-profit watchdog group International Labor Rights Forum.\n\nFyffes corporate affairs director Caoimhe Buckley said in an email, \"We firmly refute the allegations.\" The Dublin-based company hired additional medical staff, provided masks and hand sanitizer, and instituted temperature testing and social distancing, she said. \"We are putting the health and safety of our employees first.\"\n\nBoth growers and advocate groups agree that housing makes farmworkers particularly vulnerable, with Driscoll's of the Americas President Soren Bjorn calling it the \"single biggest risk.\"\n\nIn produce-growing regions of California, for example, workers often live in densely populated communities, where the virus could take hold quickly and spread to various food-growing operations, Bjorn said. For migrant workers on H-2A visas, housing is employer provided and can vary from dormitory-style, with bunk beds and as many as eight people in a room, to barracks housing as many as 40 people.\n\n\"You really can't create more space,\" says Jason Resnick, general counsel for the Western Growers Association, which represents 2,500 businesses in California, Arizona, New Mexico and Colorado.\n\nThe threat of coronavirus infections goes beyond individual workers and businesses; it could upset global supply chains as well. A spate of sick workers has roiled meat operations globally, with North American operations particularly hard hit. That's fueling concern over possible shortages.\n\nRead More: Americans on Cusp of Meat Shortage With Food Chain Breaking Down\n\nIn Brazil, labor inspectors on Friday ordered JBS SA to close a chicken plant, with about 48 cases detected among employees, according to a prosecutor. Three facilities owned by BRF SA registered 28 cases. Covid-19 has also swept through Canada's meatpacking industry.\n\n\"Because these giant multinational corporations didn't make the investment to protect workers, their plants are being forced to close,\" said David Michaels, a George Washington University public health professor who ran the Occupational Safety and Health Administration under President Barack Obama.\n\nCarrera, the tomato picker in Immokalee, Florida, said it's hard to imagine how her job could get done without staff working close together. Employees are \"basically face-to-face, with a tomato plant in between,\" said the Mexico native, who wears a bandanna over her face while working.\n\nAfter staying away from the fields for a few weeks, she's now trying to find new work as her company's operations wind down for the season. While she'd like to stay home out of fear of catching the coronavirus, she can't afford to. Carrera lives in a trailer with her partner, two kids and another family, splitting the $350 per week rent.\n\n\"That fear is still very present,\" she said. \"But we have to find work wherever we can.\"",

Employees will also be screened, the airline said.\n\nFrontier's temperature checks raise the ante for airlines trying to assure customers that it's safe to fly in the age of Covid-19. Carriers have already stepped up cleaning procedures, adopted policies to ensure physical distance between passengers and announced requirements for masks or other face coverings.\n\n\"Temperature screenings add an additional layer of protection for everyone onboard,\" said Frontier Chief Executive Officer Barry Biffle. \"This new step during the boarding process, coupled with face coverings and elevated disinfection procedures, will serve to provide Frontier customers an assurance that their well-being is our foremost priority.\"\n\nSuch a measure would be helpful in removing passengers who are contagious but isn't foolproof, Hilary Godwin, dean of the University of Washington's School of Public Health, told a Senate hearing this week. People who aren't exhibiting symptoms of disease or a fever can still transmit the virus, Godwin said.\n\nFrontier abandoned a plan late Wednesday to charge extra for passengers who want to guarantee a spot next to an unoccupied middle seat, backtracking after several members of Congress accused the discounter of seeking to profit from the coronavirus pandemic. The company said it wanted to provide customers with an option for more space.\n\nFrontier said the government should screen passengers for fevers when they enter airports, \"and the Transportation Security Administration and airport authorities may be working to lay that groundwork.\" Meanwhile, the Denver-based company will perform its own checks using touchless thermometers.\n\nThe measure drew praise from the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, which represents 50,000 people from 19 airlines including Frontier.\n\n\"Increased safety measures like temperature checks are needed to keep passengers and crews safe and restore the public's confidence in air travel,\" Sara Nelson, the labor union's president, said in an emailed statement. \"These types of safety measures should be led by the federal government to ensure procedures are based on public health guidance and consistent across the industry.\"",

She said the stock may \"overshoot its mark near-term\" because the revenue proposition is cloudy.\n\nAnalysts have recently warned about Gilead's stock market valuation, with at least three dropping their ratings in the past few weeks.\n\n\"Patients treated within 10 days of symptom onset did better and observed clinical improvements appear positive in both arms, though we need to see proper natural history to better understand magnitude of effect.\"\n\n\"Regardless, we view the 7% mortality rate observed in the trial outside of Italy positively based on natural history we have collected.\"\n\nRegulators are likely combing through the data now, and \"remdesivir could receive approval - at least in severe patients - very soon.\"\n\nRates overweight, $90 price target\n\n\"The stock could overshoot its mark near-term, because we don't know the revenue proposition or how long the pandemic will last.\" Karnauskas has said in the past she doesn't see Gilead making a profit from the drug and doesn't include it in her model.\n\n\"An exploratory analysis suggesting earlier treatment has better benefit\" offers a positive read-through to Gilead's placebo-controlled study in moderate patients.\n\nMaintains hold rating, price target $70.\n\nThe lack of a comparator arm in the company-sponsored study \"makes it difficult to draw a definitive conclusion.\"\n\nFor the study from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), the analyst said he was waiting on the full details \"to be able to assess the magnitude of benefit,\" as well as more results from a second ongoing Gilead-sponsored study in moderate patients expected next month.\n\n\"Any clinical benefit for remdesivir with an acceptable safety profile could leave it well positioned for potential FDA approval.\"\n\nMaintained at sell, price target $58 (Street low, per Bloomberg data).\n\n\"We still don't know the details around the NIAID trial's results, and this will be the next key question,\" but the pair of announcements offer the \"most reliable data thus far.\"\n\n\"From the headline itself it seems like remdesivir is active and has a favorable impact in Covid-19. We remind investors, from a stock perspective, Gilead is positioning remdesivir more as a government stockpiling drug, and while the stock may trade higher today on headlines,\" he values the impact to be $1 to $4 per share.\n\nMaintains buy rating, $81 price target\n\nThe NIAID announcement is \"important because it's in a broader population (not just severe) and timing was early. We expect GILD to trade up given recently lowered expectations and this is good news for Covid-19\" patients.\n\n\"We anticipate the FDA will probably accelerate some sort of approval or expanded use for the drug given the overall risk/benefit in a randomized study.\"\n\nWhile data are positive there are a handful of unknown factors that are needed, including how effective the drug is and how long it took for patients to recover. Yee would also like more color on whether the drug worked better in patients with more moderate disease or those in critical condition because he thinks it works better in less-sick patients.",

        "body": "Hong Kong is sending returnees from five countries to camps City says its list is based on low test rates in these areas\n\nSeveral Hong Kong residents who returned from South Africa this week lashed out at the government's decision to put them in quarantine camps, saying the move is unfair given South Africa's low rate of confirmed Covid-19 cases.\n\nAbout 10 returnees were sent to a government-run center after they landed Thursday and weren't allowed to self-isolate at home. They are being charged HK$200 ($26) a head per day in an apartment complex with no hot water or fridges, and given food they say is \"unedible.\"\n\n\"I would go as far as to suggest that the ignorance and prejudice in the decision has now resulted in a direct threat to our health and even our lives,\" said Colin Embree, a managing director at NBC Financial Markets Asia Ltd., a unit of National Bank of Canada. He is staying in a camp in the Yuen Long area with his family.\n\nHong Kong is requiring residents returning from South Africa, India and three other countries to remain in these camps for 14 days, arguing that the testing rate per capita in these areas is relatively low. Residents arriving from countries like the U.S. and the U.K., which have many more deaths and confirmed cases, are allowed to isolate at home.\n\n\"The government stresses that the quarantine arrangement targets the risk of infection but not the ethnicity of the returnees,\" it said in a statement Saturday. \"We will closely monitor the situation locally and overseas, and will review the arrangement as we gain more understanding about the test findings of recent returnees from South Africa.\"\n\nWhen asked about the living conditions, the health department said the quarantine centers are operated in compliance with infection control measures.\n\n\"Cleaning, disinfection and waste disposal will be carried out in accordance with the established procedures,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe authority noted that the number of tests performed is about 6,800 per million population in South Africa, compared with about 32,000 in both the U.K. and the U.S. South Africa has recorded just 247 deaths, well below the more than 87,000 fatalities in the U.S. and 34,000 in the U.K., data from Johns Hopkins University show.\n\nThe South African consul general in Hong Kong has said the decision is discriminatory and urged the government to remove it from the quarantine list given the country's success in containing the virus, the South China Morning Post reported Friday. Other countries on the list include Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal. The South African consulate didn't return an email seeking comment outside of business hours Saturday.\n\nEmbree said his family is under a lot of stress, especially after a seven-week lock down in South Africa. The apartment they're staying in lacks basic appliances like a fridge and microwave, and is full of dust and mold, he said in a phone interview. He and his family were tested for the virus at the airport and the results were negative.\n\nOther returnees from South Africa share similar frustrations. Delphine Yip-Horsfield, an architect, who came back to Hong Kong on the same flight as the Embree family via Doha, questions the government's decision.\n\n\"Why do returnees from the U.S., U.K. and Europe get to do home quarantines and do not need to go to government quarantine facilities when, without a doubt, they are clearly the highest risk groups?\" Yip-Horsfield said in a text message. \"We would gladly accept our fate if the numbers and facts correlate to the policy.\"\n\nHong Kong's 23-day streak without a case of local coronavirus transmission came to an end last week, reflecting the challenge of eradicating a virus that can spread undetected through carriers with no symptoms.\n\nThe case of a 66-year-old woman with no recent travel history dashed hopes that the city had successfully contained the virus after nearly four months of school closures and social distancing measures. The city has recorded just four deaths from the virus.",

The discovery of larger numbers of so-called asymptomatic cases, initially thought to be rare, underscores a key challenge in stopping the pandemic: If people don't know they're infected, they're probably not taking steps to prevent transmitting it.\n\nPeak concentration of the coronavirus in the upper airway seems to occur around the time an infected person develops symptoms. That's usually when a person is most contagious -- coughing, sneezing or otherwise shedding virus. With this virus, however, a carrier is also capable of transmitting it even before getting the tell-tale signs of infection, as some early studies from China, Germany and Singapore indicated. And some people with the virus never feel ill, yet have been implicated in its spread. The extent to which these \"silent carriers\" may also be \"silent spreaders\" isn't clear. It's difficult to pinpoint the source of an individual infection, especially as the virus becomes entrenched in communities. Researchers at the University of Oxford estimated in March that a third to a half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic people.\n\nThe number is \"significant,\" U.K. doctors wrote in a letter to the Lancet medical journal published April 16. A lack of resources for testing in many places, at least in the initial weeks of the pandemic, meant screening has focused on sick people displaying classical symptoms of Covid-19, as the disease is called. When health authorities have widened their testing, they typically find many more positive results than they had assumed. A study of cases aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which docked in Japan, found that 328 of the 634, or 52%, of people who tested positive had no obvious symptoms at the time of testing. A retrospective analysis found that 10 of 43 of those asymptomatic cases did develop symptoms over a 15-day period. Testing in China, the Netherlands and Iceland, on board a U.S. aircraft carrier and among obstetric patients in New York City, found anywhere from 43% to 88% of people testing positive were asymptomatic at the time.\n\nNo. Data from China indicate that at least a fifth of patients who have no signs of Covid-19 at the time of testing positive are incubating the disease and do develop symptoms days later. Some people with the coronavirus develop atypical symptoms -- ones that don't meet the definitions health authorities use to identify likely cases. These signs include diarrhea and the abrupt loss of smell and taste. That's a big change from back in February when a joint World Health Organization-China mission concluded that asymptomatic infection \"appears to be relatively rare.\" The WHO said in April that the risk of catching Covid-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is \"very low,\" though it's possible it could be caught from the mild cough of someone who doesn't feel ill.\n\nSome researchers have suggested that unrecognized carriers may be a reason why this coronavirus has spread extremely quickly relative to others, such as the one responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, almost 20 years ago. Current containment measures are predicated on early detection and isolation, but patients with mild, non-specific, or no symptoms are more difficult to identify. Such cases can also increase the risk to health-care workers if a patient undergoes certain high-risk medical or surgical procedures, such as a colonoscopy. Fourteen hospital staff were infected after a patient in China tested positive days after surgery, and they had failed to take necessary infection-control precautions.\n\nFirstly, more community testing, especially of people known to have been in contact with a confirmed case. Where tests aren't widely available, X-rays may help. Italian researchers found chest images can be used to identify probable cases among people displaying mild or no symptoms. Secondly, some health officials recommend wearing face masks or cloth barriers covering the nose and mouth to minimize both the projection of virus-carrying respiratory secretions from an infected person and the risk of a non-infected person inhaling virus particles. Thirdly, practice social distancing and avoid congregating in large groups.",

    "How Covid-19 Became the Last War for Elderly Veterans": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Rena Haber lost her husband of 65 years when the coronavirus tore through his veterans' nursing home in Paramus, New Jersey.\n\nArnold Haber beat colon cancer and survived a massive heart attack. He later lost the use of both legs after a severe infection. But even when confined to a wheelchair, the 230-pound U.S. Army veteran managed to stay active, his children said. They called him the \"Bionic Man,\" because nothing could stop him.\n\nIn 2017, Haber moved into the New Jersey Veterans Home at Paramus, part of a national network of elder-care facilities for veterans and their families. When the novel coronavirus arrived this year, it ripped the place apart. Of the 281 residents there in early April, at least 189 have tested positive and 65 have died -- the most of any nursing home in the hard-hit state.\n\nAmong the 670 licensed long-term care facilities in New Jersey, at least 508 have witnessed outbreaks, with 3,733 deaths, close to half of all Covid-19 deaths in the state. Nationally, about one-fifth of all Americans who have died from the virus had been in nursing homes. Elected officials have vowed to get to the bottom of what went wrong, to shed light on how months of delays and mistakes allowed the contagion to cut short the lives of America's most vulnerable.\n\nAt veterans' nursing facilities, there is an additional layer of sorrow. These homes are the last post for American servicemen and women who are no longer able to care for themselves. Willing to die for their country, many of these former soldiers, sailors and marines are meeting their end bereft not only of the comfort of loved ones, but the dignity and timely military funeral rites that are their due. Haber, an Army corporal who served in Germany during the Korean War, was one of them. He died last month at the age of 91, a victim of the coronavirus.\n\n\"My father was very proud to be an American and fight for his country,\" said Mitchell Haber, 60, a day after his father was buried in a small, short service, with no bugler to play taps or the flag ceremony his family had planned years ago. \"This is not the way my father deserved to go.\"\n\nThe U.S. Veterans Health Administration calls itself the \"largest integrated health-care system\" in the nation. It provides nursing-home care in three settings: VA-owned homes known as community living centers, often part of VA medical centers; facilities owned and operated by the states but regulated by the VA; and through contracts with more than 1,700 public and private locations, known as community nursing homes.\n\nState-run veterans' homes date to the end of the Civil War, when America was overwhelmed by hundreds of thousands of men who had been injured or maimed in the bloody defeat of the slave states. Today, every state has at least one, for a total of 157, while the VA runs 134, with a subsidy program for veterans in general-population nursing homes.\n\nVeterans who move into these facilities often do so because they lack the financial resources to afford privately run homes. If veterans need nursing home care because of a military service-connected disability, the VA pays the full cost; otherwise, it pays only part of the expense. About two-thirds of state-run homes participate in Medicare or Medicaid.\n\nThe VA system, which includes hospitals, reported 6,672 Covid-19 cases and 413 deaths as of April 25. It doesn't report data for specific homes; neither does the National Association of State Veterans Homes, an advocacy group. Only some states publicly disclose such information, and they differ in whether they report only fatalities at the facility or those that occur at hospitals.\n\nEven before the pandemic, the system was under stress. The Government Accountability Office, which had been asked by Congress to examine the program amid concern about quality of care, reported last year that between 2012 and 2017, there were 576 deficiencies at 126 VA-run homes, including infection control, and 192 deficiencies at 148 state-run homes, with problems spanning safety, health assessments and quality of care.\n\nThe near-apocalyptic scale of death wrought by the virus on these homes may illustrate the GAO's call for increased oversight. \"In the week where we will acknowledge the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II, to lose some of these veterans to this thing, after all that they did for our country, is just particularly wrenching,\" New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said on May 2.\n\nAcross America, the coronavirus has been detected among residents or staff in veterans' homes run by at least 17 states. Alabama officials said they are assessing procedures at a veterans' home in Alexander City after 64 residents and 23 employees tested positive and eight residents died. In New York, where 59 residents at the Long Island State Veterans' Home died, Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered an investigation of all nursing homes in the state. In Pennsylvania, Maine and Louisiana, the story has been the same.\n\nWhile veterans' homes appear equally susceptible to Covid-19 as other elder-care facilities, it was in Massachusetts, at the Soldiers' Home in Holyoke, where the nation first learned of the horrendous toll the pathogen has taken on them. At least 80 residents died, while 160 residents and staff have been infected. Federal and state officials announced investigations of the facility, including for potential civil rights violations.\n\n\"There wasn't enough personal-protection equipment,\" said Cory Bombredi, internal organizer for SEIU Local 888, a union that represents 270 nurses and staff at the Holyoke home. He said they were told: \"You don't need a mask. This is like the flu. If you leave, you might as well leave your ID at the door.\"\n\nMassachusetts officials have boosted staffing and assembled a clinical team, according to Brooke Karanovich, a spokesperson for the state's Executive Office of Health and Human Services. Val Liptak, the new acting administrator of the Holyoke Soldiers' Home, declined to comment on the status of the facility or its staff, though her predecessor has pushed back against criticism by state officials.\n\nIn New Jersey, there are three veterans' homes with a combined 900 beds. In normal times, they run at full capacity and have waiting lists, according to Kryn Westhoven, spokesman for the state's Division of Military and Veteran Affairs. The Paramus home where Arnold Haber lived is in Bergen County, a densely populated suburb of New York City -- itself ground zero for the pandemic in America.\n\nWith close to 16,185 cases and 1,210 deaths of it own, the county has the most cases in New Jersey. A second state veterans' home located in Edison, also near New York City, has had 163 cases and 61 deaths. The third facility, on the southern end of the state in rural Cumberland County, has reported only six infections.\n\nArnold Haber and his wife Rena raised their family in Paramus. In the years after World War II, he worked in New York City's lingerie industry, starting out as a shipping clerk. After the Korean War, he would eventually buy his own store, Lea's Corset Shop on Broadway. His children would follow in his footsteps a few decades later, opening their own lingerie stores in New Jersey.\n\nWhen three years ago Haber began to fall and his wife could no longer care for him, he moved into the Paramus veterans' home. Rena Haber, 87, visited him every day, and his kids dropped by several times a week, chatting with other families in the day room. \"They had never been apart a day in their life,\" Loren Haber said of her parents.\n\nThat changed on March 12. The home, like so many others, sealed itself off to prevent the spread of the virus. The family said Arnold Haber shared a room with a resident who had tested positive for Covid-19, and that staff waited several days before testing their father, even though he was coughing and lethargic. The family's only contact with him was through a caring aide.\n\nOn April 18, the aide called from Arnold Haber's bedside. Their father was unconscious and on his deathbed. \"He's on the way out,\" Rena Haber said that night. Early the next morning, Arnold was gone.\n\nWesthoven, the New Jersey state spokesman, said Paramus veterans' home chief executive Matt Schottlander wasn't available for comment. Westhoven said the facility was following U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services guidance issued April 2, which stated that confirmed Covid-19 patients aren't to be placed with patients who haven't tested positive.\n\nSteve Mastropietro's father, 91-year-old Thomas Mastropietro, arrived at the Paramus home in February. He also died of the coronavirus last month.\n\nSteve said a nurse told him his father was recovering from the virus, only to call back and say he had in fact died hours earlier. Mastropietro said he received another call later that day: Not only had his father died, but there had been a mixup of identification bracelets, and his body was sent to the wrong funeral home.\n\nLike Haber, the elder Mastropietro served in the Army during the Korean War. Steve Mastropietro said the last time he saw his father was shortly before the March 12 decision by Paramus to bar visitors. At the time, a ward had been sealed off because some residents were having respiratory issues. Over the next few weeks, Steve Mastropietro said he was told there were only a few Covid-19 cases among the residents.\n\nEach time he asked about his father, he was told his symptoms were mild. Then, a few days before his father's death, he saw on the news that more than 40 people at Paramus had the virus, and that several had died.\n\n\"If I knew how bad it was, I could have taken him home,\" said Mastropietro, 60, of Hasbrouck Heights. \"It's so unfortunate that I put him in there.\"\n\nDuring the first two weeks of April, the New Jersey Army National Guard sent 40 combat medics to the Paramus home. On April 14, Governor Murphy said he had spoken to VA Secretary Robert Wilkie, who agreed to send 90 nurses to assist at all three state veterans' homes.\n\nMitchell Haber and Steve Mastropietro said that, before the outbreak, the Paramus veterans' home was clean, the nurses were cordial and their parents seemed happy. In a statement last month, Representative Josh Gottheimer (whose district includes Paramus) said he was \"deeply concerned about the recent performance of the facility and a departure from its regular health and safety standards.''\n\nMark Piterski, 54, a state deputy commissioner who oversaw the three state veterans' homes before he quit last week, said that after he made a plea to Gottheimer for more nurses, the Democratic congressman instead called for a federal probe of the Paramus home.\n\n\"I asked him for nurses; I got an investigation,\" said Piterski, a retired brigadier general who spent 30 years with the New Jersey Army National Guard. Piterski said he quit his post to run as an independent against Gottheimer in the November election.\n\nNationwide, people age 75 or older make up 58% of all Covid-19 deaths, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data as of April 24. Those in nursing homes or other long-term care facilities make up 18% of all deaths -- with almost half having occurred in New York and New Jersey -- the two worst-hit states.\n\nThe Paramus facility, located on 23 acres across the street from the Bergen New Bridge Medical Center, says its mission is \"to honor and serve the military veteran, their spouses and Gold Star Parents by consistently providing the highest quality of resident-directed long term care.\"\n\nThe Trump administration announced last month that it's requiring nursing homes to report to patients and their families if there are Covid-19 cases in their facility. As states begin to reopen, federal surveillance around the virus is to begin in nursing homes. Westhoven, the state spokesman, said New Jersey will be doing its own review, and evaluating \"how we can be better prepared in the event of another public health crisis.\"\n\nClaire Hovsepian, 96, who currently lives at the Paramus home, was \"one of the lucky ones,\" said her daughter, Kim Deas. Hovsepian moved into the home less than a year ago and has recovered from Covid-19 -- her husband, a World War II Army veteran who received two purple hearts, lived there until his death in 2015.\n\nDeas, 54, said her mother wasn't eating or drinking very much while she was sick, and was very tired and confused. Deas believes her relentless calling and pushing led to her mother being tested for the virus. \"She's on the right track at this point,\" Deas said.\n\nAccording to Gottheimer, one of the biggest problems at the Paramus facility was its failure to properly communicate with families. In an April 3 letter from Schottlander, the home's CEO, family members were advised that daily communication with relatives wasn't practical. \"If there is an immediate concern or development with your loved one, rest assured, you will be contacted,\" Schottlander wrote.\n\n\"Every day, we were waiting and hoping someone was going to call,\" Loren Haber, 56, said. \"Nobody had the time there.\" The Paramus facility's lockdown, she said, left her father \"and so many others to die alone.\"\n\n\"Did we have a lack of communication? Yes we did,\" Piterski said. \"Because I had the CEO making beds. I had all hands on deck.''\n\nOver the past week, the Paramus veterans' home has regained its footing and arrested the spread of the disease, according to New Jersey officials. But Joe Bosotina, a veteran who lives in Morris County, said the quality of veterans' homes has been declining for some time.\n\nBosotina, 47, comes from a family of World War II and Vietnam War veterans. He retired from the Army after 25 years, and now works as a sales director for a health services company in New York. He's also an advocate for veterans' services and a member of the Disabled American Veterans. Bosotina said services at the Paramus veterans' home, where his grandfather used to seek medical attention, had slipped over the years.\n\n\"The county, the state, the federal government -- they've all fallen short in providing services to our nation's heroes during their time of need,\" he said. \"On the surface, America says how much we love our veterans. Then we put them in the corner and leave them alone.\"",

        "body": "Workers soothe fears, then painstakingly retrace daily lives\n\nInfections were never Joachim Lazarek's specialty. People are. But when the new coronavirus swept into W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, in early March, the 39-year-old social worker found himself on the front lines fighting it as one of the city's scores of contact tracers.\n\nIt's like detective work: When someone in W\u00fcrzburg tests positive for the virus, Lazarek conducts interviews to follow any trail of illness the person might have left in their wake, getting in touch with their contacts to advise them to quarantine and keep a diary of their health and anyone they meet.\n\n\"We try to understand the person at the other end of the line and get a picture of their whole lives,\" Lazarek says. \"Did you talk over the fence with someone? Were you at the doctor? Were you walking with your partner?\"\n\nUnlike the U.S., the U.K., and most other countries, Germany never gave up on contact tracing even as infections ballooned. Thanks to some of the world's toughest privacy laws, the country's 375 local health authorities couldn't rely on digital surveillance for help. Instead, they recruited teams ranging from medical students to firefighters, who work via e-mail, telephone, and sometimes even fax. Their success is a key reason Germany has about a third the number of coronavirus deaths per capita as the U.S.\n\nGermany's tracing and testing put it in a good position to suppress any new infection clusters that pop up as it emerges from lockdown, according to Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's emergencies program. \"Shutting your eyes and trying to drive through this blind is about as silly an equation as I've seen,\" Ryan said in a May 11 briefing. \"Certain countries are setting themselves up for some seriously blind driving over the next few months.\"\n\nAs the U.S. boosts efforts to follow the infection's path through communities, it will need more than 100,000 people like Lazarek to man the phones and hit the pavement -- at a total cost in the billions. New York City says it plans to hire as many as 10,000. In Massachusetts, more than 45,000 people applied for some 1,400 jobs as contact tracers. New Jersey plans to hire at least 1,000 to supplement the work of 900 local health officials. All three states have cited Germany as a model.\n\nGermany has been \"very aggressive in their contact tracing,\" New Jersey Commissioner of Health Judith Persichilli told reporters last month. \"Their experience can inform our efforts as we look ahead, to ease some of our social distancing restrictions.\"\n\nW\u00fcrzburg, a city of 130,000 about an hour east of Frankfurt by car, offers a case study in the effectiveness of low-tech contact tracing. The first two virus infections emerged on March 4, in people who had just returned from Italy. Before testing positive, they visited local relatives -- and by March 5, three more family members were infected. The health authority staff started making calls.\n\nWhile they had some experience with pandemic response from swine flu, it quickly became clear this would be on a different scale. New cases kept emerging: a young couple, a student and teacher who had been in the Alps, a handful of other schoolchildren, and a university employee who commuted into the city. Most worryingly, the virus emerged in the Ehehaltenhaus-St. Nikolaus nursing home. On March 12, an 83-year-old resident of the facility became the first person in Bavaria to die from the virus.\n\nThe health authority for W\u00fcrzburg and the surrounding region soon realized there were too many cases for its staff to track, so the group started pulling in people from other departments. Lazarek, who worked with mentally ill adults, joined the team on March 9. \"Covid-19 patients became everybody's main job,\" he recalls.\n\nIt was a Sisyphean endeavor. Lazarek and the other contact tracers -- some 20 people initially -- report to work every morning for a meeting at which the day's cases are handed out. When Lazarek calls someone who has tested positive, he first must gently break the news that the person has Covid-19. \"It's about taking away people's fears and informing them very clearly what they can do,\" he says.\n\nOnce he's established a rapport, he tells the patient how to quarantine. Then he begins the laborious process of making a list of everyone the infected person had face-to-face contact with for more than 15 minutes starting two days before their symptoms began.\n\nPatients are given the opportunity to call their contacts themselves first, to give them a heads-up about what's coming. But Lazarek and the other tracers must also get on the phone to explain that each person has to quarantine at home for two weeks. These people are instructed to track their health and note any encounters -- even as fleeting as a package delivery person at the door. If they develop symptoms, they're tested, and for those who test positive, a tracker goes back to the beginning to investigate that person's contact chain.\n\nIn the early weeks, the cases piled up. On March 20, when Bavarian premier Markus S\u00f6der put the state into lockdown, the W\u00fcrzburg area had 54 new infections. \"We worked six or seven days straight, sometimes 10 to 14 hours a day,\" Lazarek says. \"We barely even looked at the clock. It was just important to get to the bottom of a case.\"\n\nThe health authority started recruiting outsiders to double the contact-tracing team, to about 40 people, signing up students, youth welfare officers, and administrators from other agencies. They added people to manage the tide of paperwork, and they soon outgrew their clunky Excel spreadsheets, shifting instead to a more powerful database program. Counting back-office staff, contact tracers, and doctors who oversee quarantines, the team swelled to more than 100 people.\n\nBy late April, Lazarek -- who had become a team leader and then a trainer -- slowly began to see the effects of his work. On April 24, for the first time, there were no new virus cases to distribute at the morning meeting. By May 15, the team had released some 2,500 people from quarantine, 728 of the area's 869 virus cases had recovered, and 59 people had died.\n\nW\u00fcrzburg is just one small cog in the German contact tracing machine. The Bavarian state government has promised 3,000 more personnel for health authorities to fight the virus, and across Germany the federal government says it's aiming for a team of five tracers per 20,000 inhabitants -- almost 21,000 people nationwide.\n\nAs Germany slowly eases restrictions on public life, the work of Lazarek and other contact tracers is far from over. The number of cases in Germany has ticked up slightly, driven by local outbreaks in meatpacking plants and nursing homes. On May 11, Chancellor Angela Merkel praised the work of health authorities, and said they remain the key to tracking and shutting down new chains of infection. \"Committed people are working there,\" she said. \"They will manage this task, and we'll provide the backup they need.\"",

        "body": "Sign up here for our daily coronavirus newsletter on what you need to know, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis.\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, Singapore was a global standard bearer for taming the deadly illness. Now it's home to Southeast Asia's largest recorded outbreak and is racing to regain control.\n\nOne reason behind this reversal can likely be traced back to six days in February, when the earliest sign of what would become an explosion in cases among migrant laborers first appeared. It's a cautionary tale of how even countries experienced in handling epidemics can be wrong-footed by this elusive disease, particularly when it takes root in disadvantaged communities.\n\nIn early February, Singapore had a low-level outbreak that it was containing effectively without disruptive measures like closing schools. It was being globally lauded for its calm, measured approach to the virus. Around the same time, a 39-year-old Bangladeshi national, one of an army of almost 1 million foreign laborers in Singapore, developed symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nIn the days after he fell ill, the laborer visited a clinic and a hospital for help, only to be sent home each time. Home for the worker was a dormitory where men sleep about 10 to a room, sharing toilets and cooking facilities. He also visited the Mustafa Centre, a 24-hour shopping mall popular with migrant laborers and locals alike. It wasn't until Feb. 7 that he was admitted to hospital and a day later, tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe Bangladeshi was Singapore's patient number 42, and the first apparent case among low-wage foreign workers in the city's dormitories. Infections among migrant laborers now account for more than 70% of the country's 9,125 infections, and Singapore is seeing record daily increases in its tally, with new cases exceeding 1,000 on Monday and Tuesday.\n\nThe country didn't record its first deaths until late March, but fatalities now stand at 11, and its less socially restrictive strategy has been replaced by a partial lockdown that's being tightened and extended until June 1.\n\nMany governments have been caught out by the unexpectedly infectious pathogen, with opportunities for early containment lost as patients were sent home instead of being immediately tested and quarantined.\n\nBut unlike other Asian nations such as South Korea, some health experts say Singapore was slow to revise a response plan honed during its experience in 2003 with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. That strategy saw the nation focus on hunting down people who had come into contact with an infected person, a classic public health approach known as contact tracing.\n\nCovid-19 -- highly contagious and manifesting in some with little or very mild symptoms -- has turned out to be \"nothing like SARS,\" said Jeremy Lim, an adjunct associate professor at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.\n\n\"The old playbook has to be thrown out and a new one written,\" he said. \"The difficulty for countries including Singapore is that one needs to write the playbook as they execute measures. It's like the metaphor -- fixing an aeroplane's engine while mid-flight.\"\n\nThe case of Singapore's Patient 42 shares similarities with that of a patient in South Korea who triggered a turning point in that country's epidemic, which has exceeded more than 10,000 cases.\n\nTen days passed between South Korea's Patient 31 going to a hospital with symptoms, and when she was finally quarantined. In the days between, the woman, a member of a religious sect, attended services where people worshiped sitting on the floor, elbow-to-elbow for two hours at a time.\n\nUntil then, South Korea was -- just like Singapore -- testing people found through contact tracing. But faced with an explosive outbreak within a group that has more than 200,000 worshipers, Korean officials rapidly pivoted to a strategy known as community testing: it compelled church leaders to hand over a list of its members and began testing them all, regardless of whether they showed symptoms or had had contact with an infected person.\n\nHow One Patient Turned Korea's Virus Outbreak Into an Epidemic\n\nBecause of its rapid pivot to community testing, South Korea's epidemic spiked quickly but also ebbed rapidly. It managed to slow the growth of infection by early March and never had to institute a lockdown. Hong Kong also widened its virus response beyond contract tracing to include community testing as it became apparent the coronavirus was different to SARS, where those infected fell seriously -- and obviously -- ill.\n\nAfter the emergence of Patient 42, Singapore didn't appear to immediately undertake large-scale community testing within the foreign labor community, despite their living conditions being favorable to the spread of infectious disease and calls from worker advocacy groups. The country tested and quarantined 19 people who were in contact with the worker and asked companies that operate the often cramped dormitories to undertake more cleaning and take residents' temperatures.\n\nVirus Testing Blitz Appears to Keep Korea Death Rate Low\n\nSingapore's Ministry of Health didn't respond to questions on how many foreign laborers were tested in the weeks after Patient 42, but officials' comments indicate that large-scale community testing didn't start until much later.\n\nDuring a briefing on April 14 -- by which time hundreds of infected workers were being discovered almost daily -- the health ministry's director of medical services, Kenneth Mak, said some 1,500 workers had been tested and there were plans to test 5,000 more. More than 200,000 of the laborers, many of whom toil on Singapore's construction sites, live in the dormitories.\n\nSingapore's early public rhetoric indicated a reluctance to test widely, with a focus on those with symptoms to avoid wasting tests. On March 10, Mak said that \"community testing for all people, irrespective of whether they have symptoms or not, will generate a lot of activity\" but have a low yield.\n\nLow-wage foreign workers comprise a fifth of the overall population in Singapore, but largely live separate from the local community. The dormitories -- where clogged toilets and overflowing rubbish chutes have been reported -- are a far cry from the country's glitzy skyline showcased in Hollywood blockbusters like \"Crazy Rich Asians.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that an infectious disease has hit Singapore's foreign workers, who earn as little as $18 a day.\n\nIn 2008, some were infected in an outbreak of chikungunya, a disease carried by mosquitoes that triggers debilitating joint pain. Their dormitories lacked ventilation and insect screens. In the same year, a worker who subsequently died from chicken pox spread it to 10 others and the dormitory director was eventually sentenced to jail. Singapore has dozens of worker dormitories, which are operated by private companies like Keppel Corp. and Centurion Corp.\n\n\"It's hard to explain why the authorities did not up the ante in terms of infection controls at the dorms -- perhaps there was a policy blind spot with the focus being on Singaporeans,\" said Eugene Tan, a political commentator and law professor at the Singapore Management University. But \"in public health, the migrant workers are very much a part of the community, and the early vigilance against community spread did not embrace the foreign workers.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that most migrant worker infections being discovered are mild cases and vowed that the government would look after their health, welfare and livelihoods.\n\nSingapore is now entering the third week of a partial lockdown it calls a circuit breaker. Social gatherings are banned and only essential businesses are allowed to operate. Schools are now shut, as well. The implementation has been unusually bumpy for a country used to being lauded as being efficiently run and whose citizens are known to be law-abiding. The penalty for flouting new social-distancing rules on the first offense went from a warning to a $300 fine within days, and just before the lockdown started, the government banned all personal gatherings after earlier only prohibiting those of more than 10 people.\n\n\"The many changing instructions -- sometimes a few times a day -- doesn't give confidence that we're indeed gold standard,\" said Inderjit Singh, a former Member of Parliament with the ruling People's Action Party.\n\nNational Development Minister Lawrence Wong told reporters April 14 that Singapore adjusts its measures based on the circumstances: \"Our posture has not changed, our strategies, our approach has not changed,\" said Wong, who co-chairs a ministerial task force to tackle the virus.\n\nHong Kong Edge Over Singapore Shows Early Social Distance Works\n\nSingapore says it's now aggressively testing in the foreign laborer community. It is also accelerating the construction of some worker dormitories and has shifted thousands of healthy laborers working in essential industries to temporary housing facilities that offer more space. These include vacant military camps, public housing units and lodgings built out at sea commonly used in the marine industry.\n\nManpower Minister Josephine Teo has said that the standard of living in dormitories should be bolstered. Doing so over the objection of employers who must bear the higher costs is \"not only the right thing to do but also in our own interests,\" she wrote in a Facebook post on April 6.\n\nAs for Patient 42, his condition is now stable after two months in intensive care on a ventilator, but he missed the birth of his first child while in the hospital, the advocacy group Migrant Workers Centre said on April 16 in a Facebook post. \"He is able to breathe on his own and will require speech therapy moving forward as part of his recovery process.\"",

        "body": "The Red Cross has implemented new protocols to limit human contact when aiding the victims of tornadoes, hurricanes and other emergencies.\n\nSign up to receive the Green Daily newsletter in your inbox every weekday.\n\nOn March 5, Tennessee governor Bill Lee announced the state's first confirmed case of Covid-19. Three weeks later on Easter Sunday, tornadoes touched down outside of Chattanooga, killing four people and flattening 2,000 structures.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, highly-taxed emergency management agencies have scrambled to make plans for handling a major natural disaster in addition to the virus. A confluence of disasters in Tennessee give insight to how agencies can manage responses to both.\n\nTrevor Riggen, senior vice president of Disaster Cycle Services at the Red Cross, explains that the foundation had started training to respond to disasters during the pandemic well before the twisters in Chattanooga. \"We've been working since late January to adjust our protocols on the day-to-day events like house fires,\" he says.\n\nAfter the tornadoes touched down, the Red Cross had more than 175 people volunteer to help out locally, but 70% were organized to work virtually. Health service workers who help people get new glasses, medicine and mental health services made contact over the phone rather than in person. Additionally, administrative and management tasks that would have taken place at a local headquarters instead utilized video conferencing.\n\nNormally, the Red Cross builds a shelter in a school gym or community center and asks the displaced to share common areas including bathrooms and sleeping areas. This time the Red Cross contracted with local hotels for shelter to get each family their own room. The Red Cross left it to local emergency service personnel like police and firemen as well as social media to tell impacted families how to find shelter.\n\nBy reducing the number of points of contact, the Red Cross had enough protective gear for front-line staff that needed to have close interactions. The volunteers who drop off mobile phones in person to people left without electronics or deliver restaurant meals to families in hotels could count on face masks and other protective clothing.\n\nAlthough this year has been the deadliest tornado season since 2011, Riggen says the fallout has been manageable. As of April 16, the Red Cross had 1,479 clients in 528 hotel rooms across the country, but they could handle up to 8,000 displaced persons.\n\nBut Riggen says that he and his colleagues know that if a disaster is big enough -- like a multi-state hurricane -- local hotels won't be the answer. They will be damaged or they will be occupied by people who can afford to pay, unlike most of the people Red Cross assists.\n\nSo as the Gulf of Mexico experiences unusually warm water temperatures this spring -- one predictor of the severity of upcoming hurricane season -- the Red Cross is drilling its staff on what a virus-safe group shelter might look like. It would, of course, include testing and a CDC travel questionnaire as a prerequisite for entering. Anyone with symptoms would be isolated in a separate ward. Everyone else would stay together, but testing would continue regularly and sleeping cots would be spaced 6 feet apart.\n\nShelter meals will be served individually instead of cafeteria style and disinfectant cleanings will be frequent. The Red Cross says it has 750 kits for shelters that include goggles, masks, gloves and gowns as well as hand sanitizers, thermometers and supplies for a hand washing station.\n\n\"This is definitely not business as usual,\" says Riggen, \"but we are operating.\"",

A mass lawsuit on behalf of more than 5,000 ski tourists is looming as prosecutors continue to delve into whether charges should be laid for criminal negligence or worse, to determine if locals looked the other way so as to not jeopardize the most lucrative part of the ski season.\n\nThe Ischgl outbreak and its aftermath brought down the curtain on the most over-the-top apres-ski scene in the Alps, where heavy drinking typically began well before noon. As the lifts close at the resort known as the \"Ibiza of the Alps,\" skiers crammed into bars like Schatzi, the Kuhstall and the Kitzloch for games of beer pong, while models in Dirndl-themed bikinis gyrated on podiums to the oompah beats of DJ Oetzi. The resort's biggest money-spinner has been an end-of-season mountaintop concert that has featured the likes of Robbie Williams. This year's event with Eros Ramazzotti was canceled.\n\n\"You'd have to say it doesn't look good for them, given that there were obvious problems that they appear to have ignored,\" said Mark Lee, a travel lawyer with Penningtons outside London who's not involved in the case. \"I've seen the timeline of events in Ischgl and on the face of it, it seems likely the prosecutor may conclude that the local authority did negligently endanger people.\"\n\nThe Ischgl case bears similarities to the cruise ships accused of being aware of the spread of the virus days before they took meaningful action to stop its spread, said Lee. \"This is potentially the thin end of the wedge for more cases, and I think a lot of people will be watching with real interest to see how this case evolves.\"\n\nRead more: Carnival Knew It Had a Virus Problem, But Kept the Party Going\n\nThere's already one claim that has been filed on behalf of 30 German skiers that would be accepted if Austrian prosecutors decide to lay charges.\n\n\"Why weren't there any measures taken when there were already so many suspected cases\" by early March, asked Stefan Rastl, the Vienna lawyer acting for the Germans. \"Why didn't the Tyrolean government act as soon as they had the warning from Iceland?\"\n\nIt's hard to overstate the role of tourism for the broader economy in Tyrol, the mountainous Austrian province sandwiched between Germany and Italy. A quarter of regional output comes from the mostly foreign guests who sleep, eat, and play there; and the ski instructors and bar-keepers who cater to them. Remote villages like Ischgl would be dying hamlets were it not for the influx of tourists in winter and summer.\n\nNearly 300 local families are shareholders of ski-lift operator Silvrettaseilbahn AG and many work there or at local hotels and bars. The March 13 shutdown cut the final third of a typical 150-day long ski season.\n\nWhen on March 7, a bartender at the Kitzloch bar tested positive for coronavirus, no one thought the resort was less than a week from shutting down for the season. Tyrol's health inspectors allowed the popular hangout near to the lifts to reopen the next day with new staff while the regular workers were tested. Two days later, test results showed the entire staff had caught the virus and only then was it closed.\n\n\"With hindsight, it was a big mistake, we're blaming ourselves for not having shuttered the Kitzloch,\" owner Wolfgang Zangerl said in an interview with German magazine Focus. \"But we listened to the experts from the authorities and trusted them to give us the right instructions.\" Zangerl didn't respond to a separate interview request.\n\nThe head of Tyrol's emergency task force, Herbert Forster, says the temporary re-opening of the bar was in line with protocol and that it was shut for good, along with all other bars in Ischgl, when it became clear how widespread the infection was. More forceful measures earlier would have been hard to argue for even based on emergency laws for epidemics, he said in an interview.\n\nLike Forster and Zangerl, Tyrol Governor Guenther Platter has said everything is clearer in hindsight and there should be no rush to apportion blame. \"If you read the book from back to front, you know how it ends,\" he told journalists May 6. Platter was not available for an interview until next week, Tyrol officials told Bloomberg.\n\nWerner Kurz, Ischgl's mayor echoed Platter's sentiments when asked in an email exchange if he considered closing down the whole town earlier than March 13.\n\n\"In hindsight, you are always smarter,\" said Kurz. When the bars in town were closed down on March 10, there were soccer stadiums in Europe still packed with thousands of fans, he pointed out.\n\n\"The virus and its effects were unimaginable worldwide at the beginning of March,\" said Kurz. \"Nobody could be prepared for such a pandemic.\"\n\nKurz said that the town acted \"to the best of our knowledge and belief\" and that local officials immediately implemented the requirements and regulations of Tyrol authorities.\n\nUnfortunately when the Tyrol government finally did quarantine the entire valley around Ischgl on March 13, it spread the virus more widely. Rather than lock down tourists with valley residents, guests were told to leave the same day and asked to quarantine themselves at home, scattering to Germany, Iceland, Israel and beyond.\n\nAsked about that, task force head Forster said that preventing around 30,000 tourists who'd just ended their holiday from going home, even as most of them had no symptoms, would have been hard for them to accept and practically impossible to enforce. Instead, Tyrol did what it could, registering the leaving guests, imploring them to return directly, and reporting them to their home countries.\n\nTo be sure, Ischgl was not the only ski station hit by the virus. Les Contamines, close to Mont Blanc in the French Alps, was a flashpoint, with a British national infecting five others.\n\nVerbier, a chic resort in neighboring Switzerland, was hit hard but when local doctors called for it to be quarantined federal authorities demurred. But even there, no one has been accused of a cover-up or criminal negligence.\n\nRead more: Chic Alpine Resort Became a Virus Hotspot as Officials Dallied\n\nA mass lawsuit looming from Austria's Consumer Protection Association aims to do exactly that, targeting the events in Ischgl.\n\n\"Keeping ski resorts open, even though authorities knew or should have known of a threat of mass infection, is certainly a reason to consider claims for damages,\" said association chief Peter Kolba, who is spearheading the claim from thousands of skiers from Germany, Scandinavia, Russia and the U.S. Kolba said he's waiting to see a 1,000-page report police filed to regional prosecutors in Innsbruck before acting further.\n\nBack at the Kitzloch, Zangerl doesn't want to see a repeat of the outbreak next winter, but he knows enough to not rule it out.\n\n\"The whole affair should be investigated on every level,\" he told Focus. \"And next time everybody should react better, faster and more coordinated.\"",

        "body": "A nasal swab is a small price to pay to visit a country that had a pandemic plan ready and stuck to it.\n\nThe world's tourism hot spots are gradually reopening after the great lockdown, but they don't look very alluring. Going to the beach will require spacing out parasols and forgetting about the drinks service, while a city break in Europe might mean keeping a mask on while shopping. Not to mention the quarantines being imposed to limit imported infections, hardly a great way to start a vacation. Public health has become a huge factor in tourism: \"Covid-free\" is the new five-star rating.\n\nIf there's one destination in particular that might turn into an ideal getaway from Covid-19, it's Iceland. The tiny island nation -- population 360,000 -- has long been known for its stunning landscapes, views of the Northern Lights, lava caves and other vistas featured in shows like Game of Thrones. Recently it has gained plaudits as a coronavirus case study, having kept its outbreak under control without imposing a messy or draconian lockdown. And it may very well show the way for countries trying to strike a balance between wooing visitors and avoiding a flare-up in cases.\n\nFrom the start of the outbreak, Iceland stood out from much of Europe by having a proactive pandemic plan ready and sticking to it. The country began testing widely for Covid-19 in February, even before its first declared case. It even tested people who showed no symptoms, partnering with a Reykjavik-based company called DeCODE Genetics to do so.\n\nIceland has tested more people per capita than anywhere else. By quarantining and tracing the contacts of positive cases, the country avoided the extremes of either an indiscriminate lockdown or simply letting the virus rip (in the hope of achieving group immunity). The result is a nation with just 1,802 cases and 10 deaths; its estimated mortality rate of 0.6% is lower than that of France, Italy and Sweden.\n\nThis isn't to ignore the impact of demographics -- Iceland's median age is about 36, 10 years below Italy's -- or the ease of social distancing in a country whose population density is on par with Montana in the U.S. But effective government planning, trusted scientific advice and testing played a key role. All of these things are now being brought to bear on tourism.\n\nRather than seek out special deals or exclusive \"travel bubbles\" with certain countries, Iceland's plan is, from June 15, to offer all visitors the choice between two-week quarantine or a Covid-19 test (the cost of which may have to be repaid at a later date). The obvious incentive to take the test means all visitors are being trusted to be responsible globetrotters, not just those with a certain passport. Indeed, DeCODE Genetics's research on the infection's spread at the beginning of March found it was people arriving from Britain and Europe, rather than China, who were bringing the virus into Iceland. (At the time, Icelandic warnings about its findings to countries like Austria went unheeded.) Rather than close borders or try to pick preferential partners, it's better to track and trace the infection.\n\nThat mindset makes it likely that visitors will have to download Iceland's Rakning C-19 contact-tracing app for mobile phones. That seems fair enough, considering the country's strong data-protection policies. In return for these pretty light strictures, visitors will get the run of a place without crowds or restrictive policies on movement and wearing face masks. It's a good trade.\n\nObviously, building something is no guarantee people will come. Where Iceland may also become a role model is in actively funneling financial support to the tourism industry, which became its key export after the crippling 2008 banking crisis. The government's fiscal package, worth 8% of gross domestic product, includes subsidies to promote domestic tourism, a suspension of hotel taxes and a marketing campaign. At 10% of GDP, the tourism sector is a big part of the Icelandic economy -- not far off Italy's level -- and wooing visitors at home and abroad is a necessary strategy.\n\nNone of this looks like it'll be enough to avoid a deep recession in Iceland this year, as global consumers cut back and travel less. It may not even be enough to avoid a new spike in infections if the worst-case scenario comes to pass.\n\nBut as other countries struggle to emerge from lockdown, at the same time as trying to promote tourism, Iceland is worth paying attention to. If a small island can test, trace and isolate coronavirus cases, and kick-start tourism in the space of a few months, it can be done elsewhere too.",

    "In Japan, Pandemic Brings Outbreaks of Bullying, Ostracism": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Tokyo (AP) -- The coronavirus in Japan has brought not just an epidemic of infections, but also an onslaught of bullying and discrimination against the sick, their families and health workers.\n\nA government campaign to raise awareness seems to be helping, at least for medical workers. But it's made only limited headway in countering the harassment and shunning that may be discouraging people from seeking testing and care and hindering the battle against the pandemic.\n\nWhen Arisa Kadono tested positive and was hospitalized in early April, she was only identified as a woman in her 20s in food business. Soon, friends let her know that groundless rumors were circulating: that the family-run bar she helps with was a hotbed of virus; that she had dined with a popular baseball player who was infected earlier but she has never met; that she was sneaking out of the hospital and spreading the virus.\n\n\"It was as if I was a criminal,\" Kadono said in an interview from her home in Himeji, western Japan, after ending her three-week hospitalization.\n\nApart from a fever on the first day and a loss of smell, Kadono had no major symptoms though she repeatedly tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Her mother developed pneumonia and was briefly in intensive care at another hospital.\n\n\"There are many other people who also have faced discrimination and prejudice,(asterisk) said Kadono, who decided to speak out on her own behalf and that of other COVID-19 survivors and their families. \"I really want to change people's tendency to blame those who get infected.(asterisk)\n\nApart from fear of infection, experts say the prejudice against those even indirectly associated with the illness also stems from deeply rooted ideas about purity and cleanliness in a culture that rejects anything deemed to be alien, unclean or troublesome.\n\nMedical workers risking their lives to care for patients are a main target, but people working at grocery stores, delivering parcels and carrying out other essential jobs also are facing harassment. So are their family members.\n\n\"I can imagine people fear the virus, but we are working hard at the front lines under enormous pressure,\" said a nurse in her 30s, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear she might be targeted if identified. \"We also have our own families we care about. Discrimination against us just because we are medical workers is discouraging and demoralizing.\"\n\nAnother nurse was approached by a few mothers and asked to leave a Tokyo park she was visiting with her children. Some nurses are unwelcome at restaurants they usually eat at. Some are rejected by taxi drivers. The Health Ministry issued a directive to day care facilities after some barred the children of doctors and nurses.\n\nA veteran nurse in the northern island of Hokkaido said the mother of one of her coworkers was suspended from work. The husband of another was told at a job interview he wouldn't be hired because of his wife's job.\n\nThe nurses, both assigned to COVID-19 patients, were staying at hotels to protect their families while working under severe conditions without adequate protective equipment and testing.\n\n\"We understand people's fears, but medical workers are doing their utmost to prevent infections at hospitals. We seek your support,\" said Toshiko Fukui, head of the Japanese Nursing Association.\n\n\"We are not asking for anything special. ... Just a word of thanks is a huge reward that boosts our motivation,\" Fukui said.\n\nThe backlash against coronavirus patients may lead some who fall sick to avoid seeking medical care, raising the risks of infection spreading further, clinical psychologist Reo Morimitsu at the Suwa Red Cross Hospital said in an interview with NHK public television. Reports said Japanese police last month found about a dozen people dead at home alone or collapsed on the streets who later tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"The virus not only infects our body but also our minds and behavior, harming us and dividing our society,\" Morimitsu said.\n\nPrejudice against those not viewed as mainstream or \"pure\" is a legacy of feudal times, when some Japanese engaged in professions such as leather tanning and butchering were deemed unclean. Their descendants still face discrimination. People suffering from ailments such as Hansen's disease, or leprosy, were likewise forced to live in isolation decades after a cure was found.\n\nVictims of the 1945 U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Japan, known as \"hibakusha,\" and others injured in industrial accidents such as mercury poisoning have faced similar treatment. More recently, some who fled the 2011 nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima have suffered bullying and harassment.\n\n\"Underlying the (coronavirus) discrimination is a sense that the patients are impure,\" Naoki Sato, an expert on criminology and Japanese culture at the Kyushu Institute of Technology, wrote in a recent article in the Gendai Business online magazine. \"Growing anxiety and fear of infection are adding to discrimination against the infected.\"\n\nRandom acts of hatred have been reported from across the country:\n\n-- Arson threats were made against Kyoto Sangyo University after some of its students were infected.\n\n-- An Osaka city assemblyman compared a young patient to \"a murderer\" of elderly people.\n\n-- In Mie, central Japan, people threw stones at a patient's house and vandalized property.\n\n-- In Iwate, a man died while in self-quarantine after his future neighbors sought to bar him from moving into a retirement home and the local government office refused to register him.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe and other officials have denounced such behavior.\n\n\"It's shameful,\" Abe told a recent parliamentary session. \"Anyone could get infected.\"\n\nSome places in Japan have begun following the examples set in Europe and elsewhere of sending messages of appreciation and praising medical workers and others in essential jobs. Some offices have started collecting donations and other support for hospitals.\n\nThe belated campaign to raise awareness and combat corona discrimination is only a first step, but it's a start, said the nurse from Hokkaido.\n\n\"People started to cheer us,\" she said. \"Neighborhood stores sometimes bring us treats like pancakes, fried noodles and milk.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi",

        "body": "Authorities to focus on travel curbs during holidays: Jokowi\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo ruled out an immediate easing of social distancing rules and ordered officials to strictly enforce a ban on travel during the busy holiday season to prevent a spike in new coronavirus cases.\n\nWith new infections soaring 80% so far in May, Jokowi, as the president is known, asked officials at a cabinet meeting to increase the surveillance of industrial clusters and focus on enforcing mobility restrictions at the village level. While the government is preparing various scenarios for reopening the economy, no deadline has been set yet, he said.\n\nThe spike in infections in recent weeks may delay plans to reopen Southeast Asia's largest economy as early as next month as an overwhelmed healthcare system fails to ramp up testing of those with even explicit Covid-19 symptoms. With reports of a large number of people traveling to their hometowns to celebrate the Muslim festival of Eid al-Fitr later this month in defiance of the ban on such travel, known as mudik, fears have increased of a fresh wave of infections.\n\n\"In the next two weeks, the government will focus on enforcing the ban on mudik and controlling the flow of people returning to cities,\" Jokowi said. He asked the military and police to prevent holiday travel but ensure the smooth transport of essential supplies and to support healthcare logistics, and also allow the movement of returning migrant workers.\n\nThe number of infections in Indonesia rose to 18,010 on Monday with the death toll climbing to 1,191, one of the highest among Asian nations. Almost 36,000 people were suspected of contracting the virus and exhibiting symptoms but still awaiting clinical confirmation, official data showed Sunday. With more than 270,000 people under observation nationwide, Jokowi asked officials to start using the more than 10,000 community health clinics as nodal points for sample testing, tracing and isolation.\n\nThe president also ordered officials to accelerate the distribution of cash, food and other social assistance. Jokowi's administration has announced economic stimulus totaling about $28 billion to cushion the impact of the pandemic that's left millions of people without jobs and any means of livelihood.\n\nRead: Indonesia's 2020 Budget Deficit Now Seen Double Initial Target\n\nAn estimated six million people from industries as diverse as tourism to textiles and retail have lost their jobs since the outbreak of the pandemic, according to Rosan Roeslani, chairman of the Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\n\"The condition of the hotel industry is very miserable,\" Roeslani said in a phone interview. \"Previously I thought the pharma sector was doing fine, but their association has reported that their condition is also bad. They are hit by a shortage of raw materials, high prices, a weak rupiah and inability to raise drug prices.\"\n\nIndonesia will calibrate its virus exit strategy on the basis of the health risk perception from region to region and reopen the economy in phases, Coordinating Minister for Economic Affairs Airlangga Hartarto said. The strategy will support the government's target of meeting 2.5% economic growth this year, he said.",

        "body": "Indonesian officials increasingly worried about hit to economy\n\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo urged a cautious approach to lifting of partial lockdowns covering almost 100 million people in a string of regions and cities amid pressure to re-open the economy as deaths from Covid-19 continue to surge.\n\n\"The easing must be done carefully and not in a hurry,\" Widodo, commonly known as Jokowi, said Tuesday. \"It must be based on data and implementation in the field so that the decision is the right decision.\"\n\nAs Southeast Asia's biggest economy continues to grind to a halt, adding millions to the ranks of the unemployed, officials have begun discussing an exit strategy from large scale social distancing rules. But with a health system buckling under the weight of the pandemic that's showed no sign of slowing its spread, medical experts have cautioned against easing restrictions.\n\nThe death toll from the outbreak reached 991 on Monday with a total of 14,265 people infected so far, official data show. The number of people suspected of contracting the virus and exhibiting symptoms but still awaiting clinical confirmation totaled almost 32,000 and authorities have put nearly 250,000 people under observation nationwide.\n\nMore than 20 provinces and cities in Indonesia have imposed large-scale social restrictions with varying degrees of success. Of the 10 provinces with the most cases, only three had resorted to partial lockdowns with the island of Java accounting for 70% of new cases, and 82% of deaths, Jokowi said.\n\nBut the spread of the virus and the strict social restrictions have also seen commerce stall, while officials are now warning of a massive outflow of capital that has already dwarfed levels seen during the global financial crisis. Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati on Monday reiterated an earlier revised projection for the economy to grow 2.3% this year, from an initial forecast of 5.3%, while warning it could contract 0.4% in a worst-case scenario.",

While the number of people infected in the world's fourth-most populous nation is fewer than those in China, India and Singapore, it has the highest mortality rate in the region, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nConfirmed cases have soared more than six-fold in April alone after the country reported its first cases only in early March. Authorities have imposed stricter social distancing measures in various regions and banned an annual ritual of millions of Muslims traveling to hometowns and villages ahead of the Eid al-Fitr festival. Still officials estimate the disease will infect about 95,000 people before it eases.\n\nIndonesia, a country of almost 270 million people, have tested only 72,351 people so far, despite health experts repeatedly calling for a ramp-up in detection to prevent the spread of the virus in the archipelago. Daily tests have averaged below 3,000 and almost 22,000 people suspected of contracting the virus and exhibiting symptoms are awaiting clinical confirmation, raising the possibility of a spike in confirmed cases.\n\nPresident Joko Widodo's order to scale up daily testing to 10,000 may not be realized soon because of the weak diagnostic service system in the country, according to Pandu Riono, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia. The official data probably reflected only about 20-30% of the actual infections and deaths in the country, he wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe pandemic has weakened the outlook for Southeast Asia's largest economy with growth this year forecast to more than halve to 2.3%. Widodo's government has in recent weeks announced a string of emergency measures, worth about $28 billion, aimed at supporting a health system and the economy.",

    "Inside the Dystopian, Post-Lockdown World of Wuhan": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Sharon Chen and Matthew Campbell, with Claire Che and Sarah Chen\n\nEvery workday at Lenovo's tablet and phone factory on the outskirts of Wuhan, arriving employees report to a supervisor for the first of at least four temperature checks. The results are fed into a data collection system designed by staff. Anyone above 37.3C (99.1F) is automatically flagged, triggering an investigation by an in-house \"anti-virus task force.\"\n\nDaily routines at the facility, which reopened on March 28 after stopping for over two months because of the coronavirus pandemic that began in this central Chinese city, have been entirely reengineered to minimize the risk of infection. Before returning to the site, staff members had to be tested both for the virus and for antibodies that indicate past illness, and they had to wait for their results in isolation at a dedicated dormitory. Once cleared, they returned to work to find the capacity of meeting rooms built for six reduced to three and the formerly communal cafeteria tables partitioned off by vertical barriers covered in reminders to avoid conversation. Signs everywhere indicate when areas were last disinfected, and robots are deployed wherever possible to transport supplies, so as to reduce the number of people moving from place to place. Elevators, too, are an artifact of the Before Times; everyone now has to take the stairs, keeping their distance from others all the way.\n\nPresiding over all these measures one Sunday in mid-April was Qi Yue, head of Wuhan operations for Beijing-based Lenovo Group Ltd. Qi, who's 48, with closely cropped hair and a sturdy frame, had been visiting his hometown of Tianjin, in China's north, when the government sealed off Wuhan from the rest of the country on Jan. 23. It had taken him until Feb. 9 to get home -- and he was only able to make it by buying a train ticket to Changsha, farther down the line, and begging the crew to let him get off in Wuhan. His job was now to bring the factory slowly back to life while emphasizing vigilance. Compared with keeping the virus out of the plant, he said, \"how much production we can deliver comes second.\"\n\nQi is one of millions of people in Wuhan trying to figure out what economic and social life looks like after the worst pandemic in a century. In some respects they're in a decent position. The outbreak in Hubei province peaked in mid-February, and according to official statistics there are now almost no new infections occurring (though other governments have cast doubt on China's figures). But scientists warn that the novel coronavirus is stealthy and robust, and a resurgence is still possible until there's a reliable vaccine. How to balance that risk against the need to reignite an industrial hub of more than 10 million people is a formidable dilemma -- one governments around the world will soon be facing.\n\nSo far, Wuhan's answer has been to create a version of normal that would appear utterly alien to people in London, Milan, or New York -- at least for the moment. While daily routines have largely resumed, there remain significant restrictions on a huge range of activities, from funerals to hosting visitors at home. Bolstered by China's powerful surveillance state, even the simplest interactions are mediated by a vast infrastructure of public and private monitoring intended to ensure that no infection goes undetected for more than a few hours.\n\nBut inasmuch as citizens can return to living as they did before January, it's not clear, after what they've endured, that they really want to. Shopping malls and department stores are open again, but largely empty. The same is true of restaurants; people are ordering in instead. The subway is quiet, but autos are selling: If being stuck in traffic is annoying, at least it's socially distanced.\n\nQi figures he's probably on the right side of this economic rebalancing. Tablets are in high demand as schools around the world switch to remote learning, and companies contemplating a work-from-home future aren't likely to skimp on technology budgets. Since restarting operations, he's hired more than 1,000 workers, bringing the on-site total above 10,000, and production lines are running at full capacity.\n\nHe said he was painfully aware, however, of how quickly work would stop if even one employee contracted the virus. \"In my meetings with my staff I always tell them, 'No loosening up, no loosening up.' We can't allow any accidents.\"\n\nMore than 80% of China's almost 84,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and more than 95% of the roughly 4,600 confirmed deaths, have been in Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital and largest city. Controlling the outbreak there, after a series of mistakes by President Xi Jinping's government, which initially downplayed the risk of human-to-human transmission and failed to prevent widespread infection of medical personnel, required a herculean effort. More than 40,000 doctors and other medical staff were dispatched from other regions to reinforce existing facilities and operate field hospitals built in the space of 10 days, and car and electronics companies were pressed into making protective gear. People suspected of having the disease were required to move into dormitories and hotels repurposed as isolation facilities, and allowed to go home only after they'd been declared infection-free.\n\nHubei was the last region of China to resume daily life, with curbs on movement lifted progressively from late March until April 8, more than three months after the epidemic began. The government presented the moment as a decisive victory -- part of a comprehensive effort to rewrite the narrative of the virus as a Communist Party triumph, in contrast to its catastrophic spread in Western democracies.\n\nLate on the night of April 7, crowds began arriving at Wuchang station, one of three large railway hubs in Wuhan. The first outbound train in weeks, to Guangzhou, was scheduled to leave at 12:50 a.m., followed by a dense schedule of departures to many of China's major cities. (Wuhan's position at the junction of several major rail and road routes, along with its industrial heft, has invited frequent comparisons to Chicago.) Police in black uniforms and medical masks seemed to be everywhere. \"Scan your code!\" they shouted at travelers approaching the departure gates. The public-private \"health code\" system that China developed to manage Covid-19, hosted on the Alipay and WeChat apps but deeply linked with the government, assigns one of three viral risk statuses -- red, yellow, or green -- to every citizen. It's a powerful tool with clear potential for abuse. A green QR code, which denotes a low risk of having the virus, is the general default, while coming into contact with an infected person can trigger a yellow code and a mandatory quarantine. Red is for a likely or confirmed case.\n\nTravel between cities requires a green code, and while Zeng Xiao, 22, had hers and felt fine, she was nervous about making her train. \"There's still a chance I'll be stopped if my temperature is too high,\" she said as she neared the departure zone. Before going to the station, Zeng had checked repeatedly for a fever, worried that being even a little bit warm would prevent her from getting to Guangzhou, where she works as a teacher. \"I haven't seen my cat in almost three months,\" she said. She didn't have to worry. Her temperature scan was normal, and she was soon able to board her train south.\n\nAnother passenger leaving on the first day, Qin Xin'an, 26, had been stranded since the lockdown began. He'd been on vacation in Wuhan when Hubei was cut off, and no amount of pleading with officials could get him on a train out. By mid-February he was living off online loans. \"I was eating instant noodles for every meal,\" he said. He ended up getting a bed in an austere dormitory constructed by the local government for people who couldn't leave. He also found work doing odd jobs at Leishenshan Hospital, one of the temporary infirmaries built to handle coronavirus patients. He'd lost his regular job, at a company in Jiangsu province that makes robots, because he couldn't get back, and was now headed to Guangdong to look for another one and see his family. He hadn't told his parents where he'd been all this time; as far as they knew, he was away working. \"I will not tell them I was in Wuhan,\" Qin said.\n\nWhen dawn broke, Wuhan came cautiously back to life. Hairdressers were some of the first businesses to fill up. The roads were noticeably busier, and workers flowed back into office towers in the city center. But these new freedoms felt distinctly provisional. At the entrance to every mall or public building, guards stood sentry with temperature scanners, ready to turn away anyone whose reading was too high. Green codes, required even to ride the subway, have become the city's most precious possession, and one that's easy to lose. Merely visiting a building around the same time as a person later found to be infected can turn them yellow. And apartment compounds still reserve the right to bar residents from leaving if cases are reported there, as they did during the lockdown.\n\nEven in the first city to confront the virus, following a containment effort as intense as any in the history of public health, the danger remains acute. \"Asymptomatic cases and imported cases are still risks,\" Wang Xinghuan, the president of one of the city's major hospitals and of the Leishenshan facility, told reporters at a press conference before the latter's closing. And many residents are still susceptible. Wang's hospital gave antibody tests to all 3,600 of its staff, and fewer than 3% came back positive -- a result that shows \"there's no herd immunity in Wuhan.\" There's only one way to durably protect the population, he said: a vaccine.\n\nWuhan's businesses are nevertheless hoping for a safe but speedy return to conspicuous consumption. In the days before the city fully reopened for business, the sales team at a local Audi dealership gathered for their daily meeting. The 20 or so salespeople were all dressed in dark suits and face masks, standing well over a meter apart in neat columns. As a manager briefed them on the day's plans, a colleague made his way through the group, spraying everyone with disinfectant as they spun around to ensure full coverage. \"Customers may not be kind enough to tell you if they don't feel well, so try not to bring them into the store,\" the manager said. \"Just talk to them at the entrance if possible.\"\n\nAfter reopening on March 23, the dealership had been selling about seven cars per day, on pace with last year despite all the restrictions. Most were relatively low-end vehicles, such as the A3, which retails for about 200,000 yuan ($28,000) -- the kind of car often bought by families to complement a bigger, fancier model. \"People are not willing to take public transport in Wuhan,\" said the marketing director, who asked to be identified by only his surname, Pan. \"And they don't dare commute by Didi\" -- the ubiquitous ride-hailing app. The focus now, Pan said, was on following up with people who'd expressed interest in an Audi in the past but hadn't bought one. They might be ready to bite. The dealership was looking to expand its current staff of about 150, and employees would soon receive the pay they'd missed during the lockdown. Another salesperson added, \"It's like a boom.\"\n\nFor many other businesses in Wuhan, though, it's anything but. Benny Xiao is director of international operations at Wuhan Boyuan Paper & Plastic Co., which produces the kinds of unremarkable but essential goods that still form the backbone of Chinese industry. In his case, they're disposable cups, which Boyuan sells to U.S. airlines and Japanese retailers, among other clients. Xiao works from an office inside a dilapidated residential compound, and, wearing a battered gray blazer over a green button-down, he didn't quite look the part of an international dealmaker. But he beamed with pride as he showed off a glass cabinet in his office stuffed with examples of his craft, from thin plastic vessels for economy-class soda to a sturdy tumbler he'd tried, unsuccessfully, to sell to Starbucks Corp.\n\nThe first months of the pandemic were challenging for Xiao, as they were for everyone in Wuhan. His wife, now retired, spent her career as a doctor at Xiehe Hospital, one of the first to report cases of what was later identified as the coronavirus, and she'd begun hearing from colleagues in mid-January about the impending crisis. Sick residents \"were lining up outside Xiehe at 10 p.m. in the freezing cold,\" many of them \"older people who could barely make it,\" Xiao recalled. \"Patients were really desperately looking for help.\" He and his wife had stocked up on food before the lockdown began, but three weeks in they started to run out. Unlike in Europe and the U.S., Wuhan's containment measures made it difficult for people to leave their buildings, even to buy groceries, forcing them to rely on delivery apps, government drop-offs, and neighbors who wrangled permission to go out. At one point, Xiao had to spend 26 yuan (almost $4) for a single cabbage, more than triple the usual price. Some of the vegetables provided by local officials were barely edible.\n\nHe returned in late March to a company in severe trouble. Orders in the first half of the year were headed for a 50% drop, with demand from food deliveries failing to offset the calamitous decline in air travel. The government had made some financial help available, but Xiao wasn't sure he'd be able to avoid layoffs. \"Back in January and February, I was expecting things to come back to normal in April,\" he said. Instead, \"I was just calling the bank this morning to tell them that I can't repay the interest on our loan.\"\n\nFor a country that's experienced an essentially uninterrupted boom throughout the living memory of anyone younger than 50, broad-based economic pain is deeply unfamiliar. The Chinese economy shrank 6.8% in the first quarter of the year, and the International Monetary Fund estimates it will grow just 1.2% in 2020, the worst performance since 1976. Urban unemployment, a widely scrutinized indicator of overall joblessness, rose to a record 6.2% in February before pulling back slightly in March. And it's not clear what China's business model will look like in a world where Europe, the U.S., and other key markets for its goods are flirting with a depression.\n\nXiao is 64, part of a Chinese generation that had seen more than its share of history even before the coronavirus emerged. But he struggled to recall anything in his experience that was more dramatic, save perhaps the famine of the Great Leap Forward, when he was a young child. \"This is the biggest crisis of my lifetime,\" he said.\n\nThe entrance to Wuhan's Biandanshan Cemetery is marked by an impressive stone gate with a pagoda-style roof and a frieze of a ferocious-looking dragon. But in recent weeks, it's been partly hidden behind a series of bright yellow crowd control barriers surrounded by temporary metal fencing and watched carefully by police. Almost no one is permitted to enter until April 30, and even then access is likely to be strictly controlled.\n\nOfficially, no patients in Wuhan are still dying from Covid-19, but the treatment of those who did pass away remains an extremely sensitive subject. On Tomb-Sweeping Day in early April, when Chinese families traditionally gather to pay respects to their ancestors, Wuhan's cemeteries were kept closed. Funerals have been banned until at least the end of the month, and family members of the dead have reported pressure from government officials to mourn quickly and quietly. According to the government, these measures are purely a matter of public health, because family gatherings are a potential vector for infection. But the restrictions also help Beijing avoid having funerals become a venue for people to vent anger about how the epidemic was handled, or to ask uncomfortable questions about subjects such as China's true death toll.\n\nWhatever the reasons for maintaining the ban, some mental health providers in Wuhan have expressed fears that the inability to properly mourn loved ones will have deep and enduring psychological consequences. The city's residents were the first to undergo the unprecedented social shutdown that's been repeated around the world, and it seems certain to mark many of them for a long time, especially if it's compounded by a prolonged economic slump.\n\nYao Jun is among those struggling to move on. The petite 50-year-old is the founder and general manager of Wuhan Welhel Photoelectric Co., a manufacturer of welding helmets and protective masks that exports to France, Germany, and the U.S. She came back to work on March 13 after wading through approvals from four layers of government, including her local neighborhood committee, which took 15 days to assess Welhel's ability to prevent infections. \"We can't afford to have a single one,\" Yao said in an interview at her factory. Every day the production line can run is crucial: Welhel was trying to catch up on orders it hadn't been able to complete in the first few months of the year, even as Yao wasn't sure her customers in locked-down overseas markets would be able to take the deliveries. She had no idea when more business would come in, given what's happening to the global economy.\n\nDespite the uncertainties, she was trying to focus on work rather than what the city had just gone through. \"I can't see news about medical workers without crying,\" Yao said, choking back tears and rubbing a jade keychain attached to her phone. She was having trouble sleeping, as she turned over the stories of doctors and nurses who'd succumbed to Covid-19 again and again in her head: \"I don't know these people, but if someone tells me what happened to them, it's devastating. These deaths aren't just numbers or strange names to me. They're vivid lives.\" She believed that many of her neighbors and colleagues were experiencing similar emotions but might not be willing or able to talk about them. \"Many other people are traumatized but can't recognize the problem or express their feelings,\" she said.\n\nThe pandemic was causing Yao to rethink her life. She spent almost half of last year on the road, often visiting clients overseas. Now, she said, she wanted to spend much more time at home, keeping her family close. Her son was supposed to return to Australia for university in February, but he was unable to get there, for obvious reasons. Yao didn't want him to go back.\n\nEven after seemingly world-shattering events, human behavior has a way of reverting to the mean. In the weeks after Sept. 11, commentators predicted the end of globalization, of the skyscraper, of irony -- which all, needless to say, persisted. Within a couple of years of the global financial crisis, banks and homebuyers were back to arranging risky mortgages, and the very wealthy were back to, and then well beyond, pre-2008 levels of excess.\n\nIt's reasonable to think this time will be different. Hardly anyone alive today has endured a pandemic this severe, and the basic problem it's created -- that anyone, whether friend, family, or stranger, might be a vector for lethal infection -- is uniquely corrosive to the daily interactions that keep countries and economies going. An effective vaccine could be at least a year off, and given what the world has learned about how quickly a novel pathogen can shut everything down, even that might not return things to the way they were. Wuhan was the first place to traverse both sides of the Covid-19 curve, and how it changes, or doesn't, in the disease's aftermath will say a lot to the rest of us.\n\nMany of the city's methods won't be universally applicable. Few other governments could assemble the all-seeing anti-viral surveillance China is trying to put in place, even if they wanted to. Fewer still, probably, have populations that would tolerate it. But whatever the tactics, the key lesson of Wuhan could be that the price of beating the virus is never-ending vigilance and a reordering of priorities that will be hard for many to accept.\n\nAt a Starbucks in one of Wuhan's fancier shopping districts, Ma Renren, a 32-year-old entrepreneur who runs a small marketing agency, talked about how he was sorting out these questions for himself. The store was open but only serving drinks to go, with customers permitted to sit at outdoor tables. Security guards were keeping a close eye on things, interrupting conversations to tell patrons to keep their masks on between sips and not sit too close together. Ma, who was wearing fashionably oversize glasses, a black baseball cap, and -- of course -- a light blue medical mask, had gone to stay at his parents' apartment on Jan. 24, intending to help take care of them. But soon he began to suspect that he might be sick. It was a time of greatly heightened emotion: No one knew the true fatality rate, and people in Wuhan were seeing reports on social media of appalling conditions in overwhelmed hospitals. \"I wrote my last words one night and decided to say farewell to my parents and go to the hospital alone the next morning,\" Ma recalled. \"I knew that if I went, I couldn't necessarily expect to come back.\"\n\nHe changed his mind at the last minute and eventually felt better, though the psychological effects lingered. He began having panic attacks, his breath short and his heart pounding. After looking up the symptoms online, he concluded that he was experiencing post-traumatic stress. Experiences like his, Ma thought, would make many people more introspective and more focused on those closest to them. \"We will put aside more time for ourselves and our families\" and for the other relationships that seemed truly worth holding on to during the crisis, he said. \"Misfortune tests the sincerity of friendship.\"\n\nMa was now trying to get his company back on its feet. The government had recently sent him a tax rebate as part of its stimulus measures, but this would help only so much. Tourism has collapsed, and few potential clients have much money for promotion. \"There's nothing to do but move on,\" he said. Ma had, inevitably, lowered his ambitions, and for the time being he was all right with that. \"We worked nonstop for years, chasing every opportunity,\" he said. Now, \"everyone I know has one goal for 2020. It's to survive.\" -- With assistance from Gao Yuan, Haze Fan, and Jinshan Hong",

        "body": "Duque De Caxias, Brazil (AP) -- Specialists stood over intubated patients in the intensive care unit, reviewing charts and jotting down notes. They conversed in low voices, barely audible amid the incessant beeps from patients' monitors.\n\nTwo empty beds were in sight Saturday morning, but doctors at the Sao Jose hospital in a working class city just north of Rio de Janeiro said they would be occupied by afternoon. It likely will be only a matter of days, or perhaps hours, until the rest are full, too, as the coronavirus spreads.\n\n\"People are coming from all over,\" Jos\u00e9 Carlos de Oliveira, health secretary for the city of Duque de Caxias, told The Associated Press in the hospital's parking lot.\n\n\"This disease is not kidding around. Whoever thinks it's a joke is going to lose their life,\" said de Oliveira, a physician who recently recovered from the virus himself.\n\nFour ambulances soon pulled up simultaneously at the hospital. A fifth had arrived 20 minutes earlier. All transported COVID-19 patients and were making a dash for the facility's precious few remaining beds.\n\nSao Jose is accepting overflow from other hospitals whose facilities are already maxed out in treating COVID-19 cases.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro state, which has the second highest number of deaths in Brazil, most hospitals accepting COVID-19 patients have run out of intensive care beds. According to the state's health secretary, as of Thursday, 369 people thought to have the virus were waiting to be transferred to an ICU.\n\nThe Sao Jose facility was just inaugurated, on May 4, and already 90% of its 128 beds are occupied. Less than a week after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, the city of Duque de Caxias bought a private hospital and began racing to transform it into an intensive care facility exclusively for treatment of COVID-19 patients.\n\nMore than 15,000 Brazilians have died from the disease so far, though many experts say the figure is probably significantly higher, with cases missed because of insufficient testing. In recent days, more than 800 people have been added to the death toll every 24 hours and the crisis' peak has yet to hit Latin America's largest nation, the experts say.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the pandemic, calling the coronavirus a \"little flu\" and fiercely criticizing state governors and mayors who have closed businesses, introduced lockdowns and recommended stay-at-home measures. Bolsonaro has instead advocated for everyone who doesn't belong to \"at-risk\" groups to return to work so the economy doesn't collapse.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms including fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for the elderly and people with other health problems such as diabetes or hypertension.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Yesica Fisch reported this story in Duque de Caxias and AP writer Diane Jeantet reported from Rio de Janeiro.",

        "body": "Startup pledges perks for workers, same-day delivery windows\n\nInstacart Inc. more than doubled the number of people who pick and deliver groceries to customers over the last few weeks and said it will add an additional 250,000 in the next two months, a response to unprecedented demand for the service.\n\nThe San Francisco-based startup said Thursday that it had quickly surpassed last month's goal to add 300,000 workers, an aggressive target that even exceeded one set by Amazon.com Inc. Instacart now has more than 500,000 in total but continues to be overwhelmed by demand. Order volume last week was up sixfold from a year ago, the company said.\n\nFor the next recruitment spree, Instacart will focus on six areas with the highest demand: California, Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Toronto and Washington, D.C. The company aims to bring back its offering of same-day or even one-hour delivery. Currently, deliveries can take a week or two, a time frame that has frustrated customers and bedeviled the company since the coronavirus pandemic hit.\n\nThe rapid expansion has brought many challenges. Some Instacart workers have staged walkouts or spoken out saying the company hasn't done enough to minimize their risk of being exposed to the virus.\n\nInstacart said Thursday it's taking additional steps to protect and compensate workers. It's adding a new software tool to evaluate whether a worker is exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Part-time employees and members of Instacart's gig workforce who are diagnosed or ordered into quarantine are eligible for sick pay from the company. The company declined to say how many people are eligible.\n\nWorkers began receiving Covid-19 bonuses last month. The amount varies from $2 to $4 per order depending on the region, demand and other factors.\n\nInstacart expects to recruit workers from other gig companies, like Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. whose drivers are largely idle, along more traditional companies. Instacart said it's working with more than two dozen airlines and other businesses that have recently terminated or furloughed employees to offer them jobs.",

        "body": "State agencies investigated plants after Covid-19 complaints\n\nBloomberg's daily technology newsletter is chronicling the impact of Covid-19 on the global tech industry. Sign up here.\n\nIntel Corp. compromised worker safety at some of its factories to maintain chip production in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, according to complaints filed with government agencies and employees at one of the sites.\n\nAt a plant in Chandler, Arizona, the world's largest semiconductor maker did not isolate staff that worked closely with teammates who had tested positive and did not institute tests, people who work there said. Factory managers also dismissed concerns that social-distancing guidelines were not being followed properly, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because they fear sanction by their employer.\n\nMany of these virus-related concerns were also raised in filings to state agencies that regulate workplace safety. The company said it responded with new policies to improve employee safety and kept factory output high because its products are essential.\n\n\"We completely understand that people would be concerned,\" said Darcy Ortiz, a vice president and general manager of corporate services within Intel's manufacturing organization. \"We have a strong safety culture. We've provided a means for people to escalate issues. We welcome that.\"\n\nAs far as Intel is aware, there has been no transmission of the virus at a company facility. Complaints in internal forums and to state safety agencies have helped the company refine and improve its response to the pandemic, Ortiz added.\n\nOne complaint about the Chandler site was sent to the Arizona Division of Occupational Safety and Health. The agency is investigating and won't comment further until the probe is complete, said Trevor Laky, chief of legislative affairs at the Industrial Commission of Arizona, which oversees ADOSH. It's unclear if the regulator will take any formal action against Intel.\n\nIn Oregon, the Occupational Safety and Health division received more than 40 virus-related complaints about Intel plants in the town of Hillsboro and another nearby location. Submitted from late March to late April, the filings accuse Intel of not enforcing social-distancing rules, not providing masks to workers and letting employees with symptoms return to work without providing proof they tested negative for Covid-19, according to documents the agency shared with Bloomberg News.\n\nFour of those complaints are still under investigation, and only one has been fully closed, according to the documents. The agency doesn't comment until a case closes or is escalated. It said it often only has to call a company named in a complaint \"to get a business to change course.\"\n\nIn New Mexico, where Intel has another manufacturing site in Rio Rancho, the Occupational Health & Safety Bureau said it received two complaints that resulted in imminent danger notices being posted in the plant's cafeteria, which was then shut down. Both investigations were closed after Intel took \"satisfactory corrective action,\" the agency said in documents seen by Bloomberg.\n\nSemiconductor production lines are some of the cleanest places on the planet to prevent dust particles getting into chipmaking machines. But workers who maintain the equipment and monitor production still have to move through other parts of the plant to reach these clean rooms. There are gowning areas, for instance, where staff put on hazmat-style suits to ensure they don't contaminate the manufacturing process.\n\nBefore Covid-19 began to spread, Intel was under pressure to ramp up production. It has struggled to switch to a new way of making smaller, more efficient chips, and spent most of last year unable to increase output enough to meet all orders from customers. Dell Inc. and Apple Inc. publicly complained about this. Semiconductor factories are run as close to flat out as possible because the expensive machinery becomes obsolete in as little as five years.\n\nAfter the virus hit the U.S., managers at the Chandler facility, known as Fab 42, prioritized output over worker safety, according to employees and internal company messages seen by Bloomberg News.\n\nIn early April, on internal message boards Intel uses for employee feedback, workers asked why CDC guidelines on maintaining distances of 6 feet and wearing masks weren't being enforced, even though there were people at Fab 42 testing positive for Covid-19. Managers said staff should stay home if they're ill and noted that Intel would be more flexible about how time off accrues against employees' \"Personal Absence\" allowance.\n\nOn the message board, one employee asked about the company providing masks and implementing testing. A company representative said they were \"not aware of any policy prohibiting use of personal masks.\"\n\n\"Here is what it looks like from the maintenance tech point of view,\" another worker wrote on April 2. \"Intel don't give two craps about us as long as we keep product moving.\"\n\nWhen one Fab 42 worker asked why Intel wasn't slowing production, factory manager Jim Evers replied that the company's products are essential for medical devices, and working and studying online from home. \"What we do makes a big difference,\" he wrote in the internal posting, a copy of which was seen by Bloomberg News. \"And how we will do it is the safest way we know how to take care of everybody on this campus.\"\n\nEvers reacted differently to a worker request for hazard pay, according to the copy of the internal communications.\n\n\"The way the question is worded just doesn't align to the way we think,\" he wrote. \"We do incentives like OT if we need more hours or gift cards at the holidays if we need more people. We are not interested in doing hazard pay because we are wired to remove the hazard. All efforts over the last two weeks was to make this place a SAFE place to be.\" Evers declined to comment through an Intel representative.\n\nIn Oregon, Intel workers expressed similar concerns in filings with the state's Occupational Safety and Health division.\n\n\"The equipment is close together which makes it very difficult to stay apart. People are not trying and distancing is not being enforced,\" one worker told the agency. \"People regularly gather around a computer or talk at a close distance. It's hard to hear with all the machine noise so it's difficult to have a conversation from 6 feet away.\"\n\nIn another complaint filed on March 28, a worker said Intel \"has told employees they are allowed to break the 6 foot rule for social distance as long as it is no longer than 30 minutes.\" Two other filings also mentioned that managers or the company told staff they could be closer than six feet apart for as long as 30 minutes, according to the Oregon agency documents.\n\nOne worker at Intel's Chandler facility also brought up this issue on the internal message board, citing a company email saying \"As a reminder, close contact is defined by Intel as being within six feet or two meters for 30 minutes or more.\" That guidance remains in place, based on advice from health authorities, Intel said.\n\nThe company has staggered work shift changeover times, and reconfigured rooms to make sure employees can stay away from each other, according to Ortiz, the Intel VP and general manager. She also said Intel has instituted patrols by \"red shirts,\" employees who police social-distancing rule compliance.\n\nIntel's response to the pandemic evolved rapidly and the complaints were addressed in a way that satisfied state workplace safety representatives who visited Intel plants in Oregon and Arizona, she also said. Intel initially didn't provide masks to employees because of limited availability and the need to prioritize supply for medical professionals. Masks have been available at all locations since the first week of April, according to Ortiz.\n\nIntel doesn't test for the virus because it can't get test kits, she said. When an employee tests positive by other means, the company does contact tracing and notifies those who were exposed, rather than making general announcements, to preserve medical privacy. Those affected are advised to seek tests and quarantine themselves, Ortiz said. She declined to disclose the number of employees who have been infected.\n\nDuring the company's quarterly earnings announcement on April 23, Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan and Chief Financial Officer George Davis thanked workers and said they were proud that the company kept production rolling during the lockdown. They also touted Intel's safety protocols, and Swan announced $100 million in funds to help workers while shelter-in-place orders are in effect. Part of that money is being paid as a reward for employees who keep coming to work.\n\n\"Our world-class safety standards have allowed our factories to continue to operate safely on a relatively normal basis,\" Swan said on a conference call with analysts. \"We only allow employees in our factories who are essential to the factories' operations. By design, our clean rooms in factories are among the cleanest places in the world.\"\n\nIn the first quarter, Intel said it filled 90% of orders on time.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Jerusalem (AP) -- Israel's embattled health minister on Sunday said he would step down following a public uproar over his handling of the coronavirus crisis and his own COVID-19 infection.\n\nHealth Minister Yaakov Litzman informed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he would step aside as the country forms a new government.\n\nHe made no mention of his much-criticized performance at the Health Ministry, which he has led for most of the past decade, and instead said he would instead take over the Construction Ministry.\n\nIn a statement, he said he \"decided not to return to the Health Ministry for a fourth time, and prefers to lead a sweeping development for solving the housing crisis in Israel in the Housing Ministry.\"\n\nThe government has generally been lauded for keeping the coronavirus crisis in check. It has infected over 15,000 Israelis and killed nearly 200 people, but Israel has not seen its health system overwhelmed like hard-hit places such as Italy or New York.\n\nLitzman, an ultra-Orthodox politician with no formal medical training, has come under criticism for appearing ill-prepared at news conferences and reportedly resisting proposals to tighten lockdown measures that would affect the country's religious community. Early this month, Litzman was diagnosed with COVID-19, apparently after ignoring his own ministry's orders to avoid group prayer in public places. He has since recovered.\n\nThe coronavirus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying health problems.\n\nWith the crisis appearing to be in check, the government announced new easing measures Sunday.\n\nBarbershops, beauty salons and other small businesses reopened, and restaurants were permitted to serve takeout orders for the first time in nearly two months. Last week, some shops were allowed to open as well. Malls and outdoor markets, however, remain closed out of concern of a renewed outbreak of the disease.\n\nThe restrictions on the operation of many small businesses has helped propel unemployment in Israel to over 25% since the beginning of March.\n\nMerchants at Jerusalem's large central Mahane Yehuda outdoor market protested its continued closure while many other businesses, including furniture giant IKEA, were allowed to reopen.\n\nThe Hebrew business paper The Marker reported that the owners of IKEA's Israeli franchisee have donated at least $1.3 million in recent years to the ultra-Orthodox organization that Litzman belongs to.\n\nLitzman denied any connection between IKEA Israel and ultra-Orthodox officials and the government's decision to permit the Swedish furniture chain to open its four locations in Israel.\n\nDespite the easing of restrictions, the government has approved a nationwide lockdown that will close military cemeteries on Memorial Day on Tuesday and cancel public celebrations for Wednesday's Independence Day.\n\nThe government has also ordered the closure of stores in Muslim communities from 6:00 p.m. until 3:00 a.m. until the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last week.",

        "body": "Residents in China's Jilin are only allowed to leave the northeastern city after testing negative for the coronavirus and completing self-isolation, the local health authority said in a statement. Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said coronavirus cases tied to nightclubs in Itaewon increased to 119 from 101 on Tuesday.\n\nGilead Sciences Inc. is licensing its potential treatment remdesivir to five generic drugmakers, including Mylan, in India and Pakistan to speed supply-chain development and help meet anticipated demand. Brazil recorded another record day in deaths. Australia's government downplayed a spat with China.\n\nSubscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg's Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus. See this week's top stories from QuickTake here.\n\nThe lockdown in Jilin city extends to residential compounds, villages and buses are halted. Freight transportation will keep operating. The statement didn't give detail on required length of self-isolation.\n\nBeating the initial sickness of the coronavirus may be just the first of many battles for those who have survived\n\nAustralia's Finance Minister Mathias Cormann downplayed a trade spat with China that's impacting key agricultural exports. In an interview with Bloomberg Television Wednesday, Cormann acknowledged \"disagreements\" between the government and Beijing over Australia's call for an independent inquiry into the source of the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nChina said among the new coronavirus cases reported May 12, one is a person in Shanghai who arrived from abroad and six are local infections in northeastern province of Jilin, according to the National Health Commission. Jilin's railway station has halted train services, according to a report by China Central Televsion.\n\nThe National Research Council of Canada agreed to work with CanSino Biologics to advance bioprocessing and clinical development of a potential vaccine against coronavirus, the NRC said in a statement on May 12. The Ad5-nCoV vaccine candidate received Chinese regulatory approval earlier this year, allowing CanSino to move ahead with human clinical trials in China.\n\nFor many people in Asia, coming forward to get tested -- let alone revealing the personal information of friends, family and close associates -- is more terrifying than getting Covid-19.\n\nNasdaq Inc. staff's return to the office will probably be voluntary for the foreseeable future, Chief Executive Officer Adena Friedman said. The exchange operator surveyed employees about how comfortable they'd be with coming back, under certain conditions, and the vast majority said they'd prefer to keep working from home and wait to see how the recovery from the coronavirus pandemic progresses.\n\n\"We have the luxury of patience -- we have the ability to work from home very effectively,\" Friedman said in a Bloomberg Television interview with David Rubenstein, co-founder of Carlyle Group Inc. \"We will ask people if they want to come back voluntarily, and if they feel they can do it in a safe way, then we would like to start to reopen offices to give them that flexibility. But we then will put a whole lot of protocols in place inside the offices to make sure they stay safe.\"\n\nBrazil reported a new record for coronavirus deaths as Latin America's largest economy becomes the new global hotspot for the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe country reported 881 deaths on Tuesday, pushing the total to 12,400. Last week, the country surpassed the U.K.'s daily death toll, trailing only the U.S. in terms of recorded daily deaths. The number of infections has more than doubled in the past two weeks to 177,589 -- numbers health officials say likely don't fully reflect the situation amid a widespread lack of testing in the nation home to 210 million people.\n\nLos Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer told county supervisors at their meeting Tuesday that the area's stay-at-home order \"with all certainty\" would last until July.\n\nLos Angeles had only recently begun loosening up. The nation's second-biggest city last weekend let residents hike on trails and play golf. Toy stores, flower shops and other retailers were allowed to reopen for curbside pickup. Beaches in the city were scheduled to reopen Wednesday.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said Tuesday that he would loosen statewide orders further, including allowing some malls and offices to open with limitations. Still, counties have the discretion to enact tighter rules. Beyond Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay area has extended stay-at-home measures until the end of May.\n\nGilead Sciences Inc. is licensing its potential Covid-19 treatment, remdesivir, to five generic drug manufacturers in India and Pakistan to speed supply chain development and help meet anticipated demand.\n\nThe companies are Cipla Ltd., Ferozsons Laboratories, Hetero Labs Ltd., Jubilant Lifesciences, and Mylan. They will be able to produce the drug without paying Gilead royalties until the World Health Organization declares the end of the pandemic or until another drug or vaccine is approved to treat or prevent Covid-19, whichever comes first.\n\nAnthony Fauci, the top infectious disease official in the U.S., Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield, and Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn will rejoin White House meetings under certain conditions after all three said Sunday that they were quarantining themselves after being exposed to a staff member who tested positive.\n\nThey'll attend White House meetings providing they are asymptomatic, screened, monitored for fever and other symptoms, wear face coverings and maintain social distancing, according to a joint statement from the CDC and Department of Homeland Security.\n\nU.S. cases rose 1.4% from the day before to 1.36 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That was higher than Monday's growth rate of 1.3% but below the average daily increase of 1.9% over the past week. Deaths rose 2.3% to 81,805.\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo said New York needs $61 billion in federal support to replenish the state budget, which has been ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic. If the state doesn't get cash assistance from Congress, it will be forced to cut spending, he said.\n\nCuomo, a Democrat, joined Republican Governor Larry Hogan of Maryland in calling for federal funding to show that the need for financial assistance has bipartisan support.\n\n\"When you don't fund a state, who does the state fund?\" Cuomo said at his daily briefing. \"The state funds schools, local governments and hospitals.\"",

        "body": "Korean firm says in talks to supply test kits to 25 states Osang Healthcare first in South Korea to gain FDA approval\n\nA South Korean medical diagnostics maker has ramped up production and is aiming to sell millions of virus test kits to the U.S., where cash-strapped states are scrambling for federal funds to buy them.\n\nOsang Healthcare Co., the first South Korean test-kit maker to receive authorization from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in April, is ready to ship kits that can test 100 million people in the U.S., the company's Chief Executive Officer Lee Donghyun said in an interview.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has earmarked $25 billion to expand testing in the virus rescue packages allocated to the states. Osang said distributors in 25 states, including Florida, California and Michigan, have expressed interest in the kits and are waiting for the funds to buy them.\n\nFlorida's Department of Health said it's not aware of any deal with Osang and the other states either declined to comment or did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nTrump Signs $484 Billion Package to Rescue Small Businesses\n\nSlow and inadequate testing has dogged the U.S. from the start of the pandemic and is one reason why the virus has spread so quickly through the country, which now has the most infections and deaths globally. While nations like South Korea have relied on rapid, large-scale testing to curb their outbreaks, access to testing in the U.S. is a fraction of what it should be, according to experts. That could hamper re-opening of the battered economy, with testing seen as a key way to get people back to work safely.\n\nWith some infected people displaying no outward symptoms of the virus, rapid testing among vulnerable groups has emerged as the best way of identifying virus carriers and stopping them from spreading the pathogen to others. Globally, access to testing has been uneven and especially difficult for countries without the capacity to mass-manufacture their own kits. While nations like Singapore and India are trying to procure sufficient kits, others like South Korea and China make more than enough for their own use.\n\nKorea has enough local capacity for its testing needs, so Osang exports all of its supply, Lee said.\n\nThis worldwide competition for testing kits is expected to intensify as countries look to re-open following lockdowns that have wiped $6 trillion from the global economy.\n\nVirus Test Shortages Undermine Drive to Restart U.S. Economy\n\nOsang is among a group of South Korean manufacturers that started making tests to identify the new coronavirus within weeks of the disease's emergence earlier this year. The company has supplied countries from Brazil to Russia and has already sold 760,000 tests to U.S. customers, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, said Lee, 59, who founded the company in 1996.\n\n\"The Moroccan ambassador in Korea came to us twice and bought 900,000 kits and shipped them via private plane,\" he said. \"We only ship out the kits after the payment has been made because the entire world is facing uncertainties caused by the pandemic.\"\n\nOsang, which employs about 300 staff in a suburb near Seoul, has exported a total of 10 million tests globally since the outbreak, and its stock has quadrupled in value this year, along with other Korean test kit makers like Seegene Inc. South Korea's strategy, which involves zeroing in on a group exposed to the virus and testing widely, has been cited as a potential model by the White House after the country was able to curb its first outbreak without the need for oppressive lockdown measures.\n\nEach of Osang's kits can run a hundred virus tests and costs $700 to $2,000, although some countries offer to pay more to procure supplies more quickly. The company can make 15 million tests per week, and has set a goal of selling 200 million tests this year, said Lee.\n\nEven as overseas sales move briskly, the company said it's constantly refining the kits.\n\n\"It took us about a week to design the kit, but we've been working non-stop for it to remain reliable,\" said Kim Joohyung, head of Osang's molecular diagnostics department. \"Mutation can easily occur and if that happens, we'll have to revamp our kit so we're keeping a close eye on the genetic sequence of the virus.\"",

        "body": "Two most populous countries haven't imposed complete lockdowns\n\nThere are early signs that rapid measures to contain the coronavirus are working in four African countries that have imposed the most stringent restrictions on the continent.\n\nLockdowns in Uganda and Mauritius are flattening the curve, with the number of new infections rising slowly. South Africa and Ghana have recorded new infections amid widespread testing but say they're mitigating the spread of the disease.\n\n\"African countries have acted fast to contain the spread of this virus, and this has helped delay the course of the pandemic on the continent,\" McKinsey & Co. said in a report.\n\nThere are now 25,131 cases on the continent of 1.2 billion people, a number the World Health Organization considers a fair reflection of the underlying trend. Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has imposed strong containment measures in the commercial hub of Lagos and the capital, Abuja. Ethiopia, which ranks second in population, has declared a state of emergency without a strict lockdown.\n\n\"It's important to put in place mitigation measures from the very beginning,\" said Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. \"And in a number of countries, this is being done.\"\n\nSouth Africa's response to the arrival of the coronavirus has kept the number of infections in check, and while it's unlikely the country will escape a surge in cases, scientists advising the government believe they have bought valuable time that will allow hospitals to get prepared. A travel ban came into force 13 days after the first infection was confirmed on March 5, and a lockdown was imposed on March 27. It now has 3,465 cases. Almost 127,000 tests have been conducted out of a population of 59 million.\n\n\"The trajectory in South Africa is different from anywhere else,\" said Salim Abdool Karim, chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Group on the outbreak, in a televised presentation. \"We want to focus on the small flames so we never get to the raging flames.\"\n\nGhana was the first in sub-Saharan Africa to ban travelers from high-risk countries, on March 15. As cases continued to rise, the government on March 30 put the main cities under lockdown and ramped up screening. The West African nation has tested more than 80,000 people so far, the highest number in the region after South Africa, out of a population of 30 million. Testing includes people who don't show symptoms but are considered at risk.\n\nWith 1,024 confirmed cases, President Nana Akufo-Addo lifted the lockdown on Monday but warned it \"does not mean we are out of the pandemic,\" saying stringent social-distancing policies will remain in place. As of Wednesday, 1,154 people had tested positive.\n\nGhana's presidential adviser on health, Anthony Nsiah-Asare, said at the start of the lockdown that the number of cases would climb.\n\n\"When we start testing a lot of people, you will realize that the figure of positives will likely go up,\" he said. \"There is no cause for alarm. It means we're doing our work very well.\"\n\nUganda shut its borders and banned commercial flights from March 23, less than 48 hours after the East African country identified its first case. A 14-day lockdown ordered on March 30 has been extended to May 5. Uganda has 61 confirmed cases of the virus, including 45 recoveries, with a majority of people who tested positive having returned from abroad. More than 11,000 people have been tested.\n\n\"We shall defeat this virus by protecting our people from its rapid spread,\" President Yoweri Museveni said last week.\n\nThe Indian Ocean island nation of Mauritius confirmed its first three cases of the virus on March 18. A \"sanitary lockdown\" came into effect two days later, allowing banks, shops and supermarkets to continue operating. This was extended to a complete lockdown on March 25 that closed everything but essential services.\n\nSupermarkets reopened on April 2, but people are only allowed to enter on specific days depending on their surnames and are limited to 30 minutes of shopping. The country has 329 cases, with more than 11,000 people tested out of a population of 1.27 million. 261 people have recovered. Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth says the lockdown may be eased on May 4.\n\n\"We have achieved to keep our real infection figures well below figures given to us by prediction models,\" the government said in an emailed response to questions.",

This year's performance will likely surpass its previous expectations, Reckitt said, while warning that the coronavirus could create further challenges in some markets.\n\nThe results cap a particularly unusual period for the company. Reckitt has pushed its factories to meet unprecedented demand for its cleansing products as the pandemic spread from Asia to Europe and the U.S. Lysol sales surged by more than 50% in North America, largely driven by demand in March as the health crisis became more pronounced in the region.\n\n\"We have seen strong consumer demand, particularly in March and April, but the split between defensive buying and higher levels of underlying consumption is unclear,\" Laxman Narasimhan, the chief executive officer since September, said in a statement. \"At this stage, it is uncertain how quickly this will change in the months ahead.\"\n\nDisinfectants became an object of social media fascination last week after U.S. President Donald Trump mused during a briefing with journalists over whether they could be used to treat Covid-19. That prompted Reckitt to publish a statement Friday warning that \"under no circumstance\" should its disinfectants be administered into the human body, through injection, ingestion or any other route.\n\nThe shares climbed as much as 3.5% in early London trading Thursday. Before today, the stock had gained 4.5% this year, even as Britain's benchmark FTSE 100 Index tumbled 19%.\n\nIt wasn't only Lysol and Dettol that lifted sales. Revenue at the company's over-the-counter medicine business grew by about a third during the quarter, driven by demand for cold and flu remedies such as Mucinex, which work to relieve some of the same early flu-like symptoms of the Covid-19 disease.\n\nThe company has responded to increased demand \"by ramping up production and streamlining the range of products,\" Narasimhan said on a conference call. \"To give you one example: In the coming month of May, in one month, we'll produce all the sanitizers we produced in 2019, for the whole year.\"",

        "body": "Male, Maldives (AP) -- The Maldives, an Indian Ocean archipelago nation with one of the world's most congested capitals, has seen a rapid rise in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks.\n\nHealth officials predict that more than 77,000 people -- or a fourth of those currently living in the country -- could become infected, with more than 5,000 possibly needing intensive care treatment.\n\nOfficial figures updated Saturday showed 766 cases, including 743 that are still active. A vast majority of the patients are residents of Male, the capital. Three people have died so far.\n\nThe Maldives, known for its luxury tourist resorts, reported its first case of COVID-19 in March, and until mid-April appeared to have contained the virus within the isolated resort islands that had been converted into quarantine centers.\n\nMale is highly congested, housing more than 150,000 people in a 5.8-square-kilometer (2.3-square-mile) area. The government had taken precautions to stop the virus from entering the capital by suspending on-arrival visas and screening people entering through airports and arriving from other islands.\n\nBut a patient in Male whose source of infection has not yet been identified triggered an explosion in the number of cases. Six inhabited islands, including Male, are now under lockdown.\n\n\"The main hurdle at the moment is the rapid spread of the disease among expatriate migrant workers living in congested accommodation. Many are undocumented, do not report symptoms or are asymptomatic,\" said Mohamed Mabrook Azeez, spokesman for the National Emergency Operations Center.\n\n\"Physical distancing measures is logistically difficult in place like Male in any situation,\" he said.\n\nThere are about 60,000 migrant workers, mostly from Bangladesh, working as unskilled laborers in Male, according to Azeez. They also serve as the primary source of couriers to deliver essentials.\n\nTheir congested living quarters have been a cause for the rapid spread of the virus, with at least 416 Bangladeshi migrants testing positive, Azeez said. The government plans to relocate some 3,000 Bangladeshi nationals to other islands in the Maldives to enable social distancing, he said. It also plans to repatriate 1,500 unregistered Bangladeshi workers.\n\nNima Hassan, a Male resident, was in self-isolation with a fever awaiting test results at her home.\n\n\"Even with a mild fever, it got you overthinking. Did I get the disease? Was it the delivery man who dropped by the other day? Were we not careful enough?\" she said. \"Are we not safe inside our four walls?\"",

        "body": "Antibody checks will provide a handy picture of the Covid-19 outbreak, but their usefulness will be limited in ending the lockdowns.\n\nAs governments in Europe and elsewhere start to look at reopening their economies after the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, mass antibody testing has come to the fore as a potential way of making sure the outbreak doesn't surge again.\n\nThese serological tests -- which are being rolled out in Italy, Germany and the U.K., as well as New York -- can help identify individuals who've developed an immune response to the new coronavirus, either as part of an active infection or a prior infection. While it's an excellent idea to get a better picture of just how widespread the epidemic has been, we should be under no illusion that we will then be able to hand out some form of \"immunity certificate\" that lets people return to normal lives. Most individuals will probably discover that they haven't been infected with the virus. Even those who were won't be certain about how long their immunity will last.\n\nThis week, Germany became Europe's first country to start large-scale antibody tests, one involving blood donations and another focusing on four of the country's worst-hit regions. Berlin is planning a separate mass test involving 15,000 people in 150 areas, starting next month. Italy is setting up a serological test of 150,000 individuals, and some of its most affected areas have already started running these examinations. Britain has started contacting 20,000 households to take part in a similar mapping effort.\n\nThese studies will be critical to understanding the impact of the virus. For example, we now estimate that about seven in 100 of those who tested positive for Covid-19 worldwide has died. Yet we also know that our health systems have failed to detect a large proportion of carriers who either have few symptoms or are asymptomatic. A mass testing in the Italian town of Vo' Euganeo, in the northeast of Italy, found more than 40% of those infected had no symptoms. It's highly probable that once we know the real prevalence of the virus, its fatality rate will plummet.\n\nThere's also hope that a mass test will show we are getting closer to \"herd immunity\" -- where outbreaks stop because enough people have developed antibodies. But there's not much ground for optimism on this point. We simply don't know how effective antibody protection is and how long it will last. The virus has circulated among the human population for just a few months, so not enough time has passed to draw a conclusion.\n\nMoreover, some early studies in Germany, Sweden and Italy found that even in the most severely affected regions only about 10% to 15% of the population had been infected. Data from the U.S. showed that about 13.9% of New York state's population has been in contact with the virus, including 21% in New York City. Other studies, including one from California, delivered more promising results, but that was likely the result of imperfect testing. This all leaves us far from the 60% infection rate that's seen as the lower bound to \"herd immunity.\"\n\nCompanies are particularly interested in immunity, as they hope it will allow some workers to return if they've already had the virus. In theory, this would create enormous ethical dilemmas and might prompt some individuals to seek contagion voluntarily in the hope of becoming more attractive to employers. This would be especially true among poorer and younger people (the latter have a lower chance of dying of Covid-19).\n\nIn practice, however, the extent of the infection is probably still too small for the antibody testing to be of great use to businesses wanting to reopen. Moreover, a serological test won't tell you whether an individual is incubating the virus or if and when they will lose their immunity. And many commercial tests are still far from the level of accuracy one would need to be confident. As a result, some tend to overestimate the outbreak's spread. Far from making a company safer, relying excessively on immunity tests could give a false sense of security.\n\nThe Covid-19 epidemic is taking a huge toll on the global economy, so it's natural that workers and companies are looking for a simple solution. However, just as the current mouth-swab tests (which determine whether you're actively infected) are helpful but cannot beat the virus on their own, serological tests also have limitations. As we wait for more effective treatments and -- perhaps -- for a vaccine, social distancing remains the best tool to fight the pandemic.",

        "body": "Gear shortage for nurses and carers leading to daily dread Nursing and care home workers say they need more PPE\n\nWe're tracking the latest on the coronavirus outbreak and the global response. Sign up here for our daily newsletter on what you need to know.\n\nWhile U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson was battling coronavirus in an intensive care unit in early April, Nathan Hudson-Peacock was returning to work as a junior doctor at another ICU in London after two weeks isolating at home.\n\nHudson-Peacock, 27, had a lingering cough and a feeling of anxiety. Despite having all the Covid-19 symptoms, staff at the hospital weren't being tested. He couldn't say for sure whether he was a risk to colleagues and patients. Since the lockdown began a month ago, the number of beds on his ward have almost doubled to 60 and he constantly worries about shortages of sedatives and painkillers needed to treat those on ventilators.\n\nHudson-Peacock's worries about running out of equipment and supplies are being echoed across the National Health Service. A nurse at the Western Health and Social Care Trust in the north of Ireland now dreads going to a once-loved job because of fears of catching the virus or passing it on to family or patients. A community mental health nurse in south west England, who regularly administers injections, said the team's first shipment of PPE only arrived on April 10.\n\nMinisters were warned last year that a pandemic could cost more than 2.35 trillion pounds ($2.9 trillion) and that the government should stockpile so-called personal protective equipment, establish a system for tracing infections and figure out how to repatriate Britons stranded abroad, the Guardian newspaper reported Friday. Failure to source extra gowns, visors and surgical masks has led to frantic efforts to buy additional gear from countries including Turkey and Myanmar.\n\nMore than 20,000 people have died in hospitals, including 413 on Saturday, since the pandemic hit Britain. Total cases have now surpassed 150,000 and more than 80 health workers have perished from the virus.\n\nThe government says it delivered more than a billion pieces of PPE across the U.K. from Feb. 25 through April 18, a number that also includes body bags, soap, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent. Details on how quickly the disposable equipment is being used remains sketchy, leaving the numbers lacking context. While the assignments have included about 1.2 million gowns, the BBC reported, about 80,000 a day are used in England alone, according to representative body NHS Providers.\n\n\"To help us further in delivering vital PPE both when and where it is needed, we are piloting a new model focused solely on providing PPE products to health care providers and NHS trusts,\" the Department of Health and Social Care said in an email. \"We are working around the clock to ensure PPE is delivered as quickly as possible to those on the frontline.\"\n\nAn online portal intended for community, primary and social care providers seeking protective gear was due to launch in April, but has been delayed, trade publication HSJ reported last week. Online auction company EBay Inc. built the site, which was set to open the week of April 6, the report said. The system is still being tested and U.K. officials deny it has been delayed.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with nurses, doctors and carers on the frontline many of whom asked not to be identified discussing their experiences or to limit the information being published about them.\n\nThe community mental health nurse said the clinic where she works has PPE waste all over the floor because the bins haven't been emptied, raising fears of contamination. A carer in the north of Ireland expressed worry about the lack of protective gear they've been offered given they travel from home to home treating vulnerable people. A lack of coordination at local authorities is contributing the problem, said an executive at a care-home provider in the north of England, adding that any equipment they get from the state is viewed as a bonus.\n\nGovernment officials are confident the peak of the virus has passed and the National Health Service is starting to think about returning to normal service. However, without enough PPE, the health care system risks being overwhelmed by any second wave of cases and the economy won't be able to fully reopen.\n\nThere are signs the situation is improving in hospitals. \"Obviously the government has prioritized the distribution to hospitals. That's where the sickest patients are. So they've received more PPE,\" said Dr Richard Vautrey, Chairman of the British Medical Association's GP committee. \"Nevertheless, many hospitals have struggled to gain necessary PPE as well, such as gowns when they run out.\"\n\nStill, it's nursing and care homes that are emerging as one of the hotspots for the virus, a situation that's being replicated across Europe. Accentuating the problem with PPE is the lack of testing, which leads workers to use the equipment with patients who may or may not be infected. The government reported Sunday that it carried out about 29,000 daily tests, far below the target of 100,000 planned for this week. Key workers, including medics, are now being given the option of home tests or drive-through testing centers, but they've been booked out within minutes.\n\nRead More: Fixing Nursing-Home Death Traps Is Key to Europe's Virus Fight\n\nBritish firms are also trying to fill the gap when it comes to equipment. Luxury fashion group Burberry Group Plc has transformed its trench coat factory in the north of England to produce gear for those working on the frontline and has donated more than 100,000 items of PPE to medics and care workers so far.\n\nHudson-Peacock, the London-based doctor, is working with other medics to collect donations of equipment, including hundreds of masks, goggles and visors from the public. \"It's taking a lot of time for sure, but we've been blown away by the generosity of the public,\" he said, asking that the hospital where he works not be identified. \"Anything is better than nothing.\"",

        "body": "Thailand and Malaysia moved quickly to head off the coronavirus, sealing their borders, shutting down people movement and encouraging social distancing. They now face the delicate challenge of re-starting their economies when the migrant workers they rely on pose one of the biggest risks of forcing another lockdown.\n\nTemperature checks and mandatory virus tests are some of the measures becoming the new normal for the five million guest workers in the Southeast Asian nations. But the combination of cramped living conditions and language barriers make migrant labor vulnerable to a new round of infections.\n\nBoth Thailand and Malaysia are attempting to avoid a repeat of what happened in Singapore, which suffered a spike of infections from its 1 million strong low-wage foreign workforce, many of which live in cramped dormitories. That would be a set back to the migrant labor market that has boosted incomes and economies across Southeast Asia.\n\n\"We could end up having a surge in cases similar to Singapore if we're not careful,\" said Adisorn Keadmongkol, manager at Migrant Working Group Thailand, which campaigns for labor rights. \"What's driving the businesses and workers to follow the rules is the fear of losing income when someone gets sick.\"\n\nWorkers from Cambodia, Indonesia and Myanmar have been drawn to their neighbors for jobs, where they manufacture goods, build skyscrapers and tend farmland. In turn, richer countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore benefit from a flow of cheap labor.\n\nRead More: Former Thai WHO Chief Calls for New Virus Testing Strategy\n\nOnce travel bans are lifted, worker ties to home nations still experiencing outbreaks could see a new surge as they go to see family and laid off workers return.\n\nAs of Thursday, Malaysia had more than 6,700 cases of Covid-19, and Thailand reported just over 3,000, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. That compares with more than 10,000 in Kuwait and Denmark, countries with much smaller populations.\n\nWhile Thailand remains on a state of emergency through May, it's allowing some business to resume operations with a ban on alcohol scrapped and permission given for restaurants to re-start. Authorities are due to decide on May 15 whether to allow shopping malls, salons and beauty clinics to re-open. Malaysia has let nearly all economic activity resume, such as factories, with the government enforcing guidelines against large gatherings.\n\nBoth countries have indicated that the easing of lockdown measures depends on keeping the virus under control and any new flare up could jeopardize that.\n\nOther countries are also grappling with how best to re-start their economies. China lifted the lockdown in Wuhan last month although this week it announced plans to test every person in the city of 11 million. Hong Kong has doubled the limit on social gatherings to 8 people and plans to reopen schools and loosen border restrictions with mainland China as cases dwindle.\n\nThailand has already been caught out by some new infections among migrants in detention centers and authorities are stepping up efforts to reach the country's three million foreign workers. That includes the Labor Ministry publishing information in Burmese, Lao and Cambodian as it asks migrants to practice good hygiene, such as regular hand washing, wearing a mask and forgoing local customs such as sharing food.\n\nThey are also urging employers to screen for symptoms although that isn't a foolproof way to detect infections.\n\n\"They're young and healthy and may be carrying the virus without showing symptoms and spreading it in the community,\" said Theanrat Nawamawat, deputy permanent secretary of Thailand's Labor Ministry. \"A cluster outbreak would cut companies an essential workforce. Everyone is being vigilant.\"\n\nSome companies are going further. At Charoen Pokphand Foods Pcl, where migrants make up about one-fifth of its workforce, employees are picked up by private car from a company apartment that sleeps two workers. They're required to go through temperature checks twice before continuing their regular process of sanitation at processing plants for Thailand's largest meat producer.\n\nRead More: Thailand's Top Meat Firm Sees Opportunity in American Disruption\n\n\"The important thing is that we make it a clean and safe place to work,\" said Chief Executive Officer Prasit Boondoungprasert. \"Workers are worried about getting the infection as well as losing income.\"\n\nFear of losing income is driving both workers and companies to follow rules and guidelines to avoid financial disruptions, said Adisorn, adding that those still employed probably don't face as a high a risk as those who lost their jobs.\n\nSome 700,000 migrant workers -- mostly in tourism, services and construction industries -- have been let go since the lockdown started in late March, according to Adisorn's estimates. Without income and adequate safety nets, about 200,000 migrants went back home, while those that stayed put, cut expenses by sharing apartments with many others.\n\n\"The risks increase when they have no jobs. Less income means worse living conditions for many,\" said Adisorn.\n\nSo far, about 20 migrant workers in Thailand have tested positive, he said, adding the reason cases remained low could be either because the virus is contained or there's a lack of testings.\n\nAs of early May, about 257,000 tests were conducted in Malaysia, and 286,000 in Thailand. The Thai Health Ministry said it's focusing on high-risk groups, including the services and retail sectors, although budget constraint won't allow for mass testings.\n\nMalaysia, where nearly 80% of migrant workers are from Indonesia, Bangladesh and Nepal, is taking a harder stance. The government ordered all migrant workers to undergo swabs, which can cost as much as 650 ringgit ($150) per kit.\n\nThe government said earlier that employers were required to cover the cost. But Malaysia's real estate and builders associations issued a joint statement a few days after saying: \"It is beyond the financial capacity of contractors to bear the cost, especially when contractors are already financially affected by the pandemic.\"\n\nIt later clarified that the tests are free for all workers who are currently working and registered with the Social Security Organization. According to PwC, all employers in Malaysia have to contribute to social security for their foreign workers, excluding domestic servants.\n\nThis long-standing inter-dependence of the region through migrant worker flows is likely to be threatened by the pandemic. Countries where the virus is under control like Thailand and Malaysia fear migrant workers returning home for visits and then bringing infections back.\n\nBut as businesses reopen, the demand for these workers is only expected to increase.\n\nThai Labor Ministry's Theanrat said once the situation \"returned to normal\" and tourism and services sectors reopened, Thailand will relax its rules to allow migrants to return, with a mandatory 14-day quarantine to avoid a resurgence of cases.\n\nSomprawin Manprasert, chief economist at Bank of Ayudhya Pcl, said the likelihood of continue restrictions on people's movements between countries in the region could create a tight labor market.\n\n\"The key question is whether there'd be enough workers when the economy reopens,\" he said.",

The price represents a 5% discount to Monday's closing price.\n\nMorgan Stanley is the sole book-running manager for the offering that allows underwriters to buy an additional 2.64 million shares, the statement said. Bloomberg reported the share sale plan earlier.\n\nShares jumped 20% on Monday after the company revealed positive early results from its experimental vaccine for Covid-19, capping off a 309% rally this year.\n\nModerna's vaccine is seen as one of the most promising candidates for immunization against the pathogen that has sickened over 4.8 million people worldwide and killed over 318,000 since it first emerged in China last December. A successful vaccine is a crucial step toward lifting lockdowns, easing social distancing measures and safely reopening economies gutted by strict containment efforts.\n\nThe promising results that Moderna reported were just a sample from the small, first study designed to look at the safety of the shot in human volunteers. But they showed no major safety worries - a key first hurdle since a vaccine would be given to millions of otherwise healthy people.\n\n\"This is a very good sign that we make an antibody that can stop the virus from replicating,\" Moderna Chief Executive Officer Stephane Bancel said in an interview Monday. The data \"couldn't have been better.\"\n\nThe biotech firm is moving ahead with plans for a larger test to pick a dose of the vaccine and further study its effectiveness, as well as a phase 3 test that will administer the vaccine to many thousands of patients.\n\nThe safety profile appeared to be good, Bancel said, and the reactions were typical of vaccines. Three patients who got a high dose of the vaccine had more severe side effects, according to a company presentation. That dose won't be used in later trials.\n\nSide effects seen in the trial included fatigue, fever, muscle pains and headache but all the symptoms resolved within a day.",

    "More Than 1,700 Previously Unreported Deaths Declared in NY Nursing Homes": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Albany, N.Y. (AP) -- New York state is reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities as the state faces scrutiny over how it's protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state's nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration late Monday that, for the first time, includes people believed to have been killed by the coronavirus before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test.\n\nExactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state's latest disclosure, as the list doesn't nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying.\n\nThe revised list shows that 22 nursing homes, largely in New York City and Long Island, have reported at least 40 deaths.\n\nParker Jewish Institute in Queens and Isabella Geriatric Center -- one of New York City's largest nursing homes with 705 beds -- have reported the highest number of deaths: 71 and 64, respectively.\n\nAudrey Waters, a spokeswoman for Isabella Geriatric Center, said in an email last week, \"Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff. This hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.\"\n\nIn many cases, the state's new figures reveal many more deaths than previously reported at nursing homes: Isabella Geriatric Center had 13 COVID-19 deaths reported as of May 1, and now reports the deaths of 21 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 along with 43 deaths of residents presumed to have COVID-19. And Ozanam Hall of Queens now is reporting a total of 53 deaths, up from just 10.\n\nSeveral veterans home have been especially hard-hit by the virus: The Long Island State Veterans Home has reported 53 deaths; including 48 confirmed and five presumed COVID-19 deaths. The New York State Veterans Home at St. Albans in Queens has reported 33 deaths while New York State Veterans Home at Montrose in Westchester says 22 residents have died.\n\nCuomo promised on March 2, when only a handful of coronavirus cases had been reported in New York, to make a \"special effort\" for nursing homes and congregate homes housing senior citizens. The state directed nursing homes to screen visitors and consider modifying visiting hours on March 6, and later suspended visits to nursing homes statewide March 12.\n\nBut the governor is facing criticism over his administration's role in overseeing and supporting New York's overwhelmed, state-regulated nursing homes as many have struggled to treat COVID-19 patients, amass enough personal protective gear or ensure adequate staffing.\n\nAdvocacy groups for the elderly and family members of nursing home residents have called for greater transparency over COVID-19 cases at each state-regulated nursing home and criticized an April 1 state law granting some immunity to hospitals and nursing homes from civil and criminal liability. They also questioned the state's March 25 policy that says \"no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe governor and his administration have defended that policy as ensuring nursing home residents aren't left lingering in hospitals or without anywhere else to go. Cuomo's spokesman tweeted Monday that the policy follows federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance. But the federal guidance says only that a nursing home \"can accept a resident diagnosed with COVID-19\" so long as the nursing home can follow federal guidance on transmission precautions.\n\nCuomo has also said the state has facilities that can house transferred COVID-19 nursing homes patients, and he recently said that nursing homes that tell the state up-front that they can't care for a COVID-19 patient wouldn't face regulatory scrutiny. His administration hasn't responded to a request for questions on the state's current capacity to care for COVID-19 nursing home residents and whether nursing homes were informed.",

The pace has since slowed amid the world's strictest lockdown and, \"while we are unlikely to touch those projections by the end of May, we continue to plan for the worst case scenario,\" she added.\n\nRead more: India's 50-Day Lockdown Brings Misery as Virus Numbers Surge\n\nMumbai's race against time spotlights the challenges for the densely populated Asian nation, which has failed to flatten its virus curve despite the harsh shelter-at-home restrictions. Home to globe-trotting executives and poor migrant laborers living in tiny slum shanties, Mumbai, like New York city, is fertile ground for the highly infectious pathogen.\n\nA Twitter video earlier this month showed a hospital ward allegedly in Mumbai's Lokmanya Tilak Hospital where corpses of virus victims tied in black plastic sheets were left on beds next to infected patients. The newly added facilities aim to remedy that.\n\nHere's a rundown on some of Mumbai's preparations:\n\nThis patch of land in the heart of the city has in developed into a financial hotspot, comparable with London's Canary Wharf. It houses the headquarters of several global investment banks as well as the country's capital markets regulator, posh restaurants and five-star hotels.\n\nOver the past weekend, it started operating a 1,000 bed non-critical Covid hospital, that can be scaled up to 5,000 beds. Soon it will have another 1,000 bed intensive care unit stocked with ventilators and other critical equipment.\n\nBuilt in 1950 soon after India gained independence, the iconic heritage structure and its dome-shaped auditorium have held TEDX talks, Broadway-like musicals and music concerts.\n\nIts dome is now a 600-bed quarantine plus observation facility with 30 Intensive Care Unit portable beds.\n\nBuilt in 1883, this sea-facing race course hosted 2020's Indian Derby in February, just days after India reported its first coronavirus infection. Located in one of Mumbai's most upscale neighborhoods, it's parking lot is now a 300-bed isolation center created using tent hanger structures and vast canopies typically constructed to maintain aircraft.\n\nThere are plans to add another 500 beds, according to Sharad Ughade, also an assistant commissioner in Mumbai's municipal corporation. \"These facilities will create vacancies in hospitals that can deal with more severe cases,\" Ughade said.\n\nA 37-acre green pocket tucked away in the middle of bustling Mumbai, this garbage-dump-turned-nature-park hosts over 120 species of birds and 75 species of butterflies. It will now have 1,200 beds and serve as a quarantine facility for high-risk contacts of virus patients near Dharavi, Asia's most densely populated slum. It will also have 20 beds isolated for patients who show severe symptoms.\n\nA venue for conventions exhibitions and trade fairs in one of Mumbai's suburbs, NESCO Grounds will sleep 1,200 asymptomatic patients from Mumbai's slums.\n\nA popular candidate for primary and middle school field trips, Nehru Science Centre in the pre-Covid world would showcase more than 500 interactive science exhibits on energy, sound, kinematics, mechanics and transport. Last year, it was the site of a vintage car and bike show. It's now been converted into an isolation facility of 100 beds for slum dwellers.\n\nBuilt for astronomers, space aspirants and school children curious to know more about the sun and stars, the dome-shaped structure of Mumbai's beloved planetarium plans to have 300 beds that will house asymptomatic patients.\n\nMumbai's authorities also propose to reserve 50% of beds in private hospitals for coronavirus patients and fill nearly 28,000 vacant positions across the broader state's health and medical education departments.\n\nMaharashtra, the western state of which Mumbai is the capital, has sounded off doctors with a private practice to show up for two-week mandatory virus duty to give respite to overworked health care staff in state-run hospitals. It has also requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi for 20 companies of paramilitary forces to rest its own fatigued policemen.\n\nWhile the lockdown has somewhat helped the situation, \"we will have to be careful until June,\" said Rajesh Tope, Maharashtra's Health Minister.",

        "body": "Restrictions relaxed elsewhere in Nigeria, maintained in Kano\n\nRising cases of unexplained deaths have put Nigeria's second-biggest city of Kano at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in Africa's most populous country.\n\nLocal news reports citing cemetery workers that emerged last month revealed a spike in mysterious deaths in the city with an estimated 8 million residents. Kano state Governor Abdullahi Ganduje initially blamed ailments such as diabetes and malaria. President Muhammadu Buhari extended the lockdown in the city, while loosening restrictions on the biggest urban area, Lagos, and the capital, Abuja. An emergency team he sent to assess the situation pointed to the pandemic.\n\n\"Our careful observation and understanding indicated that coronavirus is the cause of the mass deaths,\" Nasiru Gwarzo, the head of the presidential task force, told reporters on Sunday in the city.\n\nWhile fewer than 50,000 of the approximately 3.5 million confirmed cases of coronavirus worldwide are in Africa, the speed with which the situation unraveled in Kano has heightened concern the virus has spread undetected in other crowded cities on the continent.\n\nSome hospitals in Kano have closed because health workers fear contracting the disease as they lack protective equipment, while others are taking in an increasing number of people with symptoms of the virus, said Isa Abubakar, the director of the Centre for Infectious Diseases and Research at Kano's Bayero University. People with other conditions, either unwilling or unable to seek medical care, are dying at home.\n\n\"This disease has spread among almost every strata of our society,\" Abubakar said.\n\nWhy a Second Wave of Covid-19 Is Already a Worry: QuickTake\n\nLagos remains the hardest-hit part of Nigeria, recording 1,100 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Monday, about a third of the nation's total and three times as many as in Kano. But there isn't enough testing capacity in the city, which is a trade hub for northern Nigeria and the Sahel, an arid area on the southern fringe of the Sahara.\n\nAfter Kano recorded its first case on April 11, testing was slow to gain traction, with the lone laboratory testing for the virus closed for five days after one of the workers was infected. Two sites are now able to process about 300 samples a day, according to Abubakar, and Aliko Dangote, Africa's richest man, has donated a clinic supposed to perform 1,000 tests by May 10.\n\n\"If Kano had the capacity of testing of Lagos, Kano would probably surpass Lagos\" in the number of cases, Abubakar said.\n\nCritics of the state government say Governor Ganduje was slow to shutter markets and mosques in the predominantly Muslim city at a time when the central government and other regional authorities imposed movement restrictions and social distancing. Even as Abuja and Lagos went into lockdown on March 30, many people were still able to travel to Kano city with the state government \"evidently unprepared to deal with a Covid-19 outbreak,\" the Abuja-based Centre for Democracy and Development said in a report.\n\nNow the coronavirus has been detected even among the city's street kids, known as \"almajiris,\" who attend Islamic schools and often beg for a living. The Kano authorities have responded by sending many of these children back to their home states, a move that has raised fears the infections may be spreading further.\n\n\"We are now at great risk from what is happening in Kano,\" said Kaduna Governor Nasir el-Rufai, who recovered from Covid-19 last week. He said 21 street boys sent to the state from Kano tested positive for the virus.\n\nA lack of record keeping and the speed with which burials take place add to the difficulty of tracking the coronavirus in Kano, according to Zainab Mahmoud, a Nigerian cardiology fellow at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri, who is part of a team that investigated deaths in Kano between April 18-25.\n\nThe authorities are also struggling to persuade Kano's inhabitants of the seriousness of the outbreak and the need to change social norms.\n\n\"Part of the contributing factors in Kano is that people don't really believe that Covid-19 exists,\" she said.",

Tourism, heavily dependent on oceanside visitors, generates more than $5 billion in state and local taxes annually. Much of that comes from rentals, dining and entertainment, and the state has no clear picture on when those services will resume.\n\nIn his news briefing, Murphy described efforts to roll back some of the public-health actions taken in the face of the pandemic. While Atlantic City and Edison pop-up field hospitals continue to operate, authorities will close the Meadowlands Exposition Center in Secaucus, where the Federal Emergency Management Agency had set up 250 beds. Murphy said it had treated 268 patients, and its equipment will go into storage \"for rapid deployment elsewhere as needed.\"\n\n\"This is in no way a sign\" that residents should relax social distancing, Murphy said of the Meadowlands site closing. Over 24 hours, he said, 464 hospital patients were discharged while 334 were admitted. In all, 4,605 people were hospitalized with coronavirus.\n\n\"There are still families and communities that are coping with the absolute worst news,\" he said of 151 deaths recorded over 24 hours. Among them was a 4-year-old -- New Jersey's first fatality under 18 -- who had had a health condition.\n\nTesting of asymptomatic people will start at drive-up locations in Paramus and Holmdel on May 19. They will be open to first responders and health-care professionals, those with exposure to Covid-19, and workers in congregate residential settings, he said. The governor has said that New Jersey must double testing before it can start reopening.\n\n\"This is a chance for us to dip our toe in the water,\" Murphy said.",

New York is investigating 157 cases of the illness, with reports in a total of 25 states and 13 countries, Cuomo said.\n\nThough the number of cases is small compared to the total of 356,458 Covid-19 infections statewide, they are of concern because children were previously thought to be largely immune from the virus, the governor said.\n\n\"We know it exists,\" the governor said of the illness. \"We don't know how widespread it is. But the more we look, the more we find it.\"\n\nClasses can be conducted through distance learning over the summer. It's \"still too early\" to make a determination on whether schools and colleges will be able to open for in-person classes in September, Cuomo said. The state will issue guidance for schools in June.\n\nJust 1% of New Yorkers who have been hospitalized for Covid-19 related illness were under 20 years old, according to state data. But of the 157 reported cases of the virus-related illness, 90% tested positive for Covid-19. The symptoms of the illness are similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome and may include fever, abdominal pain, trouble breathing, change in skin color and lethargy.\n\n\"Until we have this answer on this pediatric syndrome, as a parent, until I know how widespread this is, I would not send my children to day camp,\" Cuomo said. \"And if I won't send my children to day camp, I wouldn't ask anybody else to send their children to day camp.\"",

The staff weren't given the results and those who went into self-isolation after exposure or showing symptoms renewed testing after returning to work, the report said.\n\nThe test results were anonymized and not immediately shared with the researchers, who didn't receive the data until three to four weeks after testing, the Telegraph newspaper reported. Twenty-eight people were positive in the first week at the peak of the outbreak, with seven testing positive over two tests with one giving a positive result three times, the study showed.\n\nThat infection rate among workers tested in the study was 7.1% the first week when the outbreak was peaking in London and declined to 1.1% after five weeks of lockdown. The study concluded that the infection rate among asymptomatic health-care workers is about the same as that of the general population, and the results show there is no need for people suffering from other maladies to avoid getting hospital treatment, which could aggravate their conditions.\n\n\"These data suggest that the rate of asymptomatic infection among HCWs more likely reflects general community transmission than in-hospital exposure,\" the report said. \"Prospective patients should be reassured that as the overall epidemic wave recedes, asymptomatic infection among HCWs is low and unlikely to be a major source of transmission, the report said.\"",

        "body": "Each beach must set capacity limits, impose social distancing\n\nNew Jersey beaches will be open for the Memorial Day weekend, with social-distance guidelines in place, Governor Phil Murphy said.\n\nEach beach must set capacity limits, and shore counties are collaborating in the plan for openings, Murphy said at a news briefing.\n\nOrganized games, fireworks, concerts won't be allowed, but beachside pavilions, changing areas and restrooms will be open, Murphy said. He also ordered reopening of restrooms at parks, where visitors in recent days have left behind urine in bottles.\n\nStatewide, amusement parks, playgrounds and visitor centers must remain closed \"for the time being,\" Murphy said. He was \"aggressively reviewing\" public-pool protocols, he said.\n\nThe governor credited New Jerseyans' social distancing for positive numbers: Since the mid-April peak, hospitalizations over the past 24 hours were down 66%; intensive-care patients, 39%; and patients on ventilators, 44%. \"These trends are your doing,\" he said.\n\nThe fiscal trends are less encouraging. New Jersey expects a $10.1 billion budget shortfall through fiscal 2021, and potentially higher if a second wave of infections hit in coming months, as some scientists have predicted. In a statement to bondholders Wednesday, state Treasurer Elizabeth Muoio said the state will have to borrow from the U.S. Federal Reserve and other sources, adjust revenue and budget estimates and press the federal government for more cash assistance.\n\nBudget revenue for the current fiscal year is expected to fall $2.75 billion short of the $36.7 billion projected. Forecast revenue of $33.8 billion for fiscal 2021 will be off by $7.34 billion, or about 18%.\n\nThe state is taking steps toward reopening, with a May 18 resumption of non-essential construction work and the start of curbside non-essential retail order pick-ups.\n\nConnecticut had 12 new cases per 100,000 people, one more than New Jersey, for the highest such figure among the largest U.S. states. But New Jersey continued to lead those states, including Texas and California, for hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nNew Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said the state was investigating 17 suspected cases of Kawasaki disease, a rare and potentially fatal inflammatory childhood condition. The cases, in nine of 21 counties, affected patients ages 2-18, she said. It's not certain whether they had a coronavirus link, she said.\n\nIn New York, more than 100 children had similar conditions, with 60% testing positive for coronavirus and 40% for its antibodies, according Governor Andrew Cuomo. Those with the inflammatory disease don't have typical coronavirus symptoms, he said. Reports of Kawasaki disease have surfaced in at least 15 U.S. states and five European countries, he said.",

They advised caution in reopening schools and kindergartens.\n\nThe findings add to a contradictory body of work over children's response to Covid-19 and the role they play in its spread, with another report showing kids aren't passing the virus to adults. The World Health Organization said Wednesday more research was needed on the topic.\n\n\"All we really know at this point is that with a small number of exceptions, children are mildly affected by this infection,\" said Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol and chairman of the WHO's European Technical Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization. \"What is much less clear is how often they get infection and how infectious they are to each other and to other people in their families.\"\n\nChildren Don't Pass Covid-19 to Adults, Report Indicates\n\nFor now, household transmission studies indicate that children are less likely to transmit Covid-19 to adults than the reverse, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters in Geneva Wednesday.\n\nSuch observations may be \"misunderstood as an indication of children being less infectious,\" Drosten and colleagues said. They cautioned \"against an unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens in the present situation.\"\n\nThe most detailed pediatric data on Covid-19 from China showed 13% of confirmed cases had no symptoms, and when confirmed and suspected cases were combined, almost a third of children ages 6 to 10 years were asymptomatic.\n\nIt's possible that because children typically get milder cases of Covid-19, they are less likely to spread the virus via coughing and sneezing, said Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's health emergencies program.\n\nWhile scientists have speculated about why few children get severely ill from Covid-19, no studies have explained the exact mechanism of this protective effect.",

The total number of positive cases rose by 233 to 14,265, he said.\n\nWith the pandemic showing no signs of slowing, Jokowi, as Widodo is known, called for scaling up the nation's diagnostic capacity, saying the daily testing of 4,000-5,000 specimens was \"far below our target.\" A lack of trained manpower and stretched medical infrastructure system have limited the country of 270 million people to test only about 116,000 suspects, missing a target to ramp up testing to 10,000 a day.\n\nThe number of people suspected of contracting the virus and exhibiting symptoms but still awaiting clinical confirmation totaled almost 32,000, Yurianto said. There were nearly 250,000 people under observation nationwide, he said. A total of 2,881 people have so far recovered from the Covid-19, he said.\n\nJokowi ordered officials to accelerate production of polymerase chain reaction test kits and ventilators to deal with the outbreak that officials say may infect 95,000 people before easing. There are fears of a second wave of infections from the return of thousands of migrant workers and cruise-ship employees in the coming weeks and Jokowi on Monday called for increased surveillance.\n\nThe spike in infections haven't stopped officials from discussing an exit strategy from the partial lockdown imposed in large cities from as early as June to prevent further damage to the nation's economy and jobs. Officials Monday reiterated they see the economy growing 2.3% this year, but warned it could contract 0.4% in a worst-case scenario.",

That's about 10 times more than the official count based on the state's testing, which covered mostly very sick patients.\n\nThe pandemic was more intense in New York City, the hardest-hit area in the U.S. There, 21.2% of people tested positive for a blood marker showing that they had been infected at some point.\n\n\"We're going to continue this testing on a rolling basis,\" Cuomo said. \"We'll have a larger and larger sample. But I want to see snapshots of what is happening with that rate. Is it going up? Is it flat? Is it going down? And it can really give us data to make decisions.\"\n\nThe study must be analyzed further to give a clearer picture, and it's possible that it didn't give a representative sample because it likely missed older people staying home as well as essential workers, Cuomo said. Still, the preliminary results appear to confirm predictions that the virus has infected far more people than New York has been able to diagnose.\n\nIt also means that the fatality rate is likely lower than implied by merely examining confirmed cases and deaths. If 2.7 million people have been infected, that would put the fatality rate at about 0.5%, based on the death count of 15,500 the state used to make its calculation. Since then, the number of deaths in New York has risen to 15,740.\n\nThe current death count doesn't include some people who may have died at home and weren't diagnosed with Covid-19, and may also miss people who died earlier on in the outbreak before diagnostic testing became widespread.\n\nThe survey used blood tests that look for antibodies, which are markers in the blood created by the immune system after a person has been infected. They can show whether a person was previously infected by the virus, even after they have recovered from the illness. Antibody tests may also help find people who were infected but showed few or no symptoms.\n\nDiagnostic tests, such as the nasal swabs used on people who show up sick at the hospital, check for the virus itself. They can't find out whether people were previously infected and recovered, however.\n\nThe antibody testing took samples from 40 locations in 19 counties, from people over the age of 18 who were shopping at grocery and big-box stores, Cuomo said.\n\nThe weighted results showed more than 1-in-5 New Yorkers testing positive, as well as 16.7% of those in Long Island and 11.7% of those in Westchester and Rockland counties. The estimates showed 3.6% testing positive in the rest of the state.\n\nPositive tests were highest among multiracial people -- at 22.8% -- along with African-Americans and Latinos, both around 22%.\n\nNew York has been focused on increasing testing for the coronavirus and antibodies. The federal government has agreed to help double capacity to 40,000 tests per day.\n\nThe number of new cases in the state remained relatively flat during the 24 hours that ended at midnight Wednesday, with 6,244 reported for a total of 263,460 positive cases statewide. Hospitalizations declined to 15,021 people. There were 438 deaths.\n\n\"That number is not coming down as fast as we would like to see that number come down,\" Cuomo said.\n\nWith diagnostic testing across the country hamstrung by logistical failures, antibody tests could play a crucial role in helping officials determine how widespread the virus actually is, and therefore how to prevent more deaths.\n\n\"Estimates have been that in New York, the epicenter of the U.S. infection, the rate could be between 10 to 15%,\" said Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. \"This is in keeping with that.\"\n\nUncertainty surrounds the accuracy of antibody tests, he said. The New York study could include false positives, he said, but by randomly sampling people, it avoided problems that plagued other surveys in which participants volunteered or were selected.\n\nTopol said many people likely never knew they were carriers.\n\n\"It's very high,\" he said, \"But obviously still way below what you would consider herd immunity.\"\n\nMany other such studies are under way. So far, early results indicate that many people who contract Covid-19 don't show symptoms, but those numbers also vary widely from place to place.\n\nTwo studies of California counties published prior to peer review last week showed that the prevalence of infection could be as high as 4% or 5% in Santa Clara and Los Angeles counties, respectively. Both studies attracted criticism for their methodologies.\n\nIn the Boston suburb of Chelsea, that percentage was even higher than New York, with 64 out of 200 randomly sampled residents having antibodies. John Iafrate, a pathologist at Harvard University and the study's principal investigator, told Bloomberg the high levels were likely in part due to dense living conditions.\n\nIn China, meanwhile, Wuhan's Zhongnan Hospital found that among 3,600 of its employees only 2.4% developed antibodies, doctors there said in a press conference this month.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that 25% of people may be asymptomatic for the disease.",

        "body": "The Russian flu pandemic of 1889 might have actually been caused by a foe that has become all too familiar.\n\nThe great \"flu\" pandemic of 1889 started in Russia, infecting more than half the inhabitants of Saint Petersburg, then spread rapidly through Europe. Its victims included Prince Albert Victor, the grandson of Queen Victoria. Americans felt safe for a few months -- until the first infections appeared in New York, and rail travel quickly spread it to other cities across the U.S. The pandemic ultimately killed 1 million people globally; it killed 13,000 in the U.S., which then had a population of 60 million.\n\nI put quotes around \"flu\" because that's what, until 15 years ago, most historians and epidemiologists believed it was. Since then, research has uncovered evidence that the 1889 pandemic may actually have been caused by a coronavirus much like today's SARS-CoV-2 -- one that leapt to humans from cows rather than bats. Indeed, observers of the 1889 pandemic noted a higher frequency of effects on the central nervous system than was typical for other influenza outbreaks. Such symptoms have been a marked feature of the current pandemic, with many people losing their sense of taste or smell, or suffering from brain swelling or immune-system attacks on nerve tissues.\n\nIf today's pandemic is a virtual replay of the past, then the 1889 pandemic may predict our future. After further yearly outbreaks through 1895, humans acquired partial immunity to the virus. It turned from a killer into simply one virus among many, mostly causing the common cold. It's still with us today.\n\nMuch of what happened in 1889 sounds eerily familiar. From a seemingly safe distance, U.S. newspapers reported on the rising death toll as the virus swept across Europe. After it reached the U.S., prominent public figures claimed it was nothing to worry about, just the common cold. Some health authorities suggested quinine as a treatment, leading medical specialists to warn about the dangers of self-medication. Those with \"underlying conditions\" such as heart disease or kidney problems were most at risk, and many cases of infection led rapidly to pneumonia.\n\nInfluenza was widely accepted as the cause of the 1889 pandemic for more than a century. But after the SARS epidemic in 1995 -- caused by a coronavirus named SARS-CoV -- biologists used modern gene-sequencing methods to begin comparing viruses infecting humans and other animals. The genetic perspective led to a very different hypothesis about the origin of the 1889 pandemic.\n\nIn 2005, Belgian biologist Leen Vijgen was studying coronaviruses as a Ph.D. student. She and her colleagues found a very close genetic match between one human coronavirus -- called OC43, and a frequent cause of the common cold -- and another coronavirus that infects cows but not people. The similarity suggested that these two viruses may well have both descended from a common ancestor, as two branches of a family tree.\n\nThe researchers also estimated how long ago this common ancestor might have existed, based on calculations of the rate of mutations, which account for their small genetic differences today. They found that their most recent common ancestor probably existed around 1890, when that virus jumped from one species to another. It could have been the cow virus jumping into a human, or vice versa. Vijgen and her colleagues argued that the former is more likely given other details of the genetics of human and bovine coronaviruses, as well as other closely related viruses.\n\nThere's no smoking gun; the evidence is circumstantial. We may never know for sure, but our current predicament may be less unique than we tend to believe. If we don't find a vaccine, this coronavirus, like others before it, will ultimately infect most everyone, become less deadly as time goes on, and end up as a circulating nuisance causing seasonal colds.\n\nYet delaying its spread is still important. That delay will save lives as doctors gradually discover better ways to keep those who are infected alive.",

        "body": "Scientists from the University of Oxford are starting a first-of-its-kind study to see whether available drugs can help keep older, more vulnerable people with mild cases of Covid-19 from becoming severely ill.\n\nMore than 500 U.K. doctors' offices are recruiting for the trial of drugs that are already approved for other purposes, such as the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine and antibiotics that are normally used against bacterial infections. Participants must be older than 65 or aged 50 to 64 with chronic illnesses such as diabetes or asthma.\n\nResearchers have launched more than 100 different programs globally to develop and test treatments for coronavirus as countries seek ways to quell the pandemic and safely exit lockdowns. Among them is Gilead Sciences Inc.'s remdesivir, a drug developed to treat Ebola virus that recently showed utility against Covid-19 in a late-stage trial.\n\nHydroxychloroquine has long been backed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential treatment for Covid-19, and the country has secured millions of doses to distribute to states. U.S. drug regulators have cleared it for emergency use in patients with low oxygen levels or who need help breathing.\n\nThe Oxford study is the first of primary-care treatment for Covid-19, according to a statement from the university. In the first phase of the trial, called Principle, researchers will test whether a seven-day course of hydroxychloroquine can reduce serious symptoms in vulnerable groups. The antibiotic azithromycin will also be tested. Participants' symptoms must include a new or continuous cough, a high temperature for less than 15 days, or both.\n\n\"As soon as we find that any one of the drugs in our trial is making a critical difference to people's health, we want it to be part of clinical practice as soon as it can be introduced,\" said Chris Butler, the chief investigator on the trial and professor of primary care in the Nuffield Department of Primary Care Health Sciences.",

        "body": "New York (AP) -- Gorgeous spring weather across the United States and Europe on Saturday drew people cooped up inside for weeks outside to soak in the sun, even as additional coronavirus hot spots in Russia and Pakistan emerged.\n\nThough grateful to be outdoors, people were still wary -- masks were worn everywhere, even on southern U.S. beaches and by some joggers in Spain. A New York City farmer's market enforced the familiar 6 feet (2 meters) of space between people waiting to buy spring flowers. Mothers in Central Park reminded their kids to give people space. And small groups of picnickers kept their safe distances, while joggers moved past each other without a glance.\n\nRetired New York attorney Stan Neustadter pulled down his mask to say it's been important to his spirit to get out. \"Why live like a rabbit? Plus I'm approaching 78, I've had a great run,\" Neustadter said.\n\nPolice and park officials were spread out across New York City, which sent out 1,000 officers to enforce social distancing on the warmest day since mid-March. But they were more likely to break up large groups, leaving the nuisances of social distancing and hanging out safely outside to New Yorkers themselves.\n\n\"Go for a walk, but respect the social distancing and wear a mask,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.\n\nWith gigs drying up at clubs and concert halls, German native Julia Banholzer, a saxophonist, said she has taken to playing al fresco in Central Park for whoever happens by. On Saturday that was a steady stream of folks, most wearing masks, who left tips for her trio as they worked their way through a set of jazz standards.\n\n\"It's great to have an audience after all these weeks.\" she said. \"All my dates have been canceled through September, and I don't know if any will come back this year. New York is a tough place, but this is just another tough period we need to get through.\"\n\nMeanwhile, fighter jets from the U.S. Navy Blue Angels and U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds drew people outside as they flew over Atlanta, Baltimore and Washington in honor of health care workers. In Atlanta, motorists stopped on a major highway while other people found open places to look to the sky on rooftops or a cemetery.\n\nNew Jersey reopened state parks Saturday. Limited to 50% capacity in their parking areas, several had to turn away additional arrivals by the afternoon. But nearly everyone followed the rules on social distancing and Gov. Phil Murphy said \"so far, so good\" at his daily briefing.\n\nMargie Roebuck and her husband were among the first people on the sand at Island Beach State Park. \"Forty-six days in the house was enough,\" she said.\n\nElsewhere in the world, the pandemic's danger was still evident. Russia and Pakistan reported their biggest one-day spikes in new infections.\n\nOverall, Russia has reported around 125,000 cases and more than 1,200 deaths. True numbers are believed to be much higher because not everyone is tested. In the far northeast, 3,000 of 10,000 workers at a vast natural gas field tested positive, Russian news agencies reported.\n\nMoscow's mayor said this week that officials are considering establishing temporary hospitals at sports complexes and shopping malls to deal with the influx of patients. Infection cases have reached the highest levels of government, with both the prime minister and the construction minister contracting the virus.\n\nPakistan appears to be joining Russia with rapidly increasing case counts. On Saturday, Pakistan announced nearly 1,300 new cases, raising the total in the country of 220 million people to about 18,000.\n\nNewspaper photos showed large numbers of the faithful at Pakistani mosques and only some practicing social distancing. Prime Minister Imran Khan's government said it might ease controls, but doctors have pleaded for stricter lockdowns, warning an explosion of infections would overwhelm hospitals with only 3,000 intensive care beds nationwide.\n\nThe virus has killed more than 238,000 people worldwide, including more than 65,000 in the United States and more than 24,000 each in Italy, Britain, France and Spain, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Health experts warn a second wave of infections could hit unless testing is expanded dramatically.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and those with health problems, it can cause severe illness such as pneumonia, or death.\n\nThere are economic factors to consider as well. In some areas of the United States, reopening is being urged to ease the shutdown of businesses that plunged the global economy into its deepest slump since the 1930s and wiped out millions of jobs.\n\nIt has created a patchwork of rules across the 50 states. In South Carolina, where about 20% of the state's revenue comes from tourism, beach hotels were allowed to reopen Friday. Webcams showed dozens of people on the beach Saturday, but pools still closed. South Carolina also hasn't reopened dine-in restaurants, unlike neighboring Georgia. Some U.S. states have yet to start start the reopening process.\n\nBusiness owners have also been left wondering if customers will return. On a postcard-perfect spring day, Detroit's Eastern Market had far fewer customers and vendors than normal at the farmer's market.\n\nJill and Mark Thomas said they felt safe selling bottles of homemade wine from their Unwined Winery, but it wasn't the same in the COVID-19 world.\n\n\"It's easier when you can get samples to people,\" said Jill Thomas. \"We're not allowed to do that now.\"\n\nIn Spain, where COVID-19 has caused more than 25,100 deaths, people ventured out Saturday for the first time since a March 14 lockdown.\n\n\"I feel good, but tired. You sure notice that it has been a month and I am not in shape,\" 36-year-old Cristina Palomeque said in Barcelona. \"Some people think it may be too early, as I do, but it is also important to do exercise for health reasons.\"\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said Spaniards deserved relief after weeks of confinement, but he asked citizens to remain vigilant.\n\n\"Until we have a vaccine, we are going to see more outbreaks,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"What we need to guarantee is that these outbreaks do not put our national health system in danger.\"\n\n___\n\nCollins reported from Columbia, South Carolina, and Wilson from Barcelona, Spain. David Rising in Berlin, Jim Heintz in Moscow and other AP reporters around the world contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "U.S. health insurers find themselves in an awkward spot: They're profiting from the pandemic.\n\nThey're not trying to exploit the situation for a windfall, like price gougers selling medical masks. It's simply a consequence of their role in the health-care system. Employers, individuals and governments pay premiums to insurers, who then pay doctors, hospitals, pharmacies and other providers when their members get care.\n\nBut most people aren't seeing a doctor or going to the hospital right now. The drop-off in surgeries, office visits and regular, face-to-face health care nationwide has been swift and steep. It's more than offset the increased costs of treating Covid-19, which largely still haven't hit insurers.\n\nAs a result, none of the major U.S. health insurers have lowered their profit outlook for the year. They're emphasizing all they do for members, clinicians and employers in the pandemic, including covering members' share of costs for Covid-19 testing and treatment. And by law, they must rebate some premium money if claims costs fall far short of expectations.\n\nInsurance companies, never high on Americans' list of favorite industries, are aware that booking big profits as a virus sweeps across a locked-down country isn't a great look. Especially when a substantial minority of the electorate recently voted for a candidate who basically wants to legislate them out of business.\n\nSome are touting their own health-care delivery operations, technology to enable telehealth, and apps to monitor for Covid-19 symptoms. They describe themselves as health-services businesses, rather than using the I-word. And many do much more than the core function of pooling risk. But that business, at least for now, is looking pretty good. -- John Tozzi\n\nSmoking and obesity are conditions that can lead to fatal results in Covid-19 patients.

        "body": "Rushing the drug through means we don't know who it might help, or hurt.\n\nThe big Covid-19 news this week was a promising result from a new study of remdesivir, an anti-viral produced by Gilead Sciences. But lost in all the discussion of how well the drug works -- an earlier study found it wasn't helpful -- was a tragic failure: Gilead missed its one shot at getting vital information on specifically which patients the drug could help.\n\nThe fact that a drug, any drug, seemed to fight Covid-19 is great news. But doctors also need information on whether older or younger patients were likely to benefit, for example, and how different pre-existing illnesses might tip the risk-benefit ratio. Instead, we got what Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center physician and epidemiologist Peter Bach calls the bare minimum of information -- just enough to get the drug over the hurdles needed for approval. Now there are ethical barriers to the kinds of placebo-controlled studies needed to learn more.\n\nThere's a tremendous heterogeneity in patients -- in age, health conditions, symptoms, viral load and genetics. More studies of remdesivir would surely have saved lives by revealing whether remdesivir helps only a subset of patients, and whether it might even be toxic to others.\n\nTo recap: On Wednesday this week, the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases released results from a placebo-controlled trial of 800 patients, which showed those who got the real drug left the hospital earlier -- after 11 days on average as opposed to 15. There was also a modest increase in survival which was not statistically significant.\n\nThis study comes after Gilead sponsored two other trials -- a larger one for the severely ill, which involved 6,000 patients but didn't use any control cases for comparison. Another, smaller study, for patients with moderate cases of Covid-19, hasn't been released. That study used a control arm, but no placebo. That means doctors knew which patients got the drug, setting them up for potential bias.\n\nThere was also an earlier trial of the drug in Wuhan which found no benefit. But this study was discontinued early for lack of patients as the Chinese got their outbreak under control.\n\nThese earlier trials were not very informative, says Bach. But now that there has been some hint of promise from the NIAID trial, he says, it will become the standard of treatment and make it ethically difficult to do any more placebo-controlled studies.\n\nWith experts saying emergency-use authorization is imminent, Gilead is gearing up to make millions of doses. But the more ethical thing would have been to design the early trials to get as much insight as possible, says Bach. Now, in terms of data gathering, \"We're going to fall off a cliff.\"\n\nFrom a risk-management perspective, it's optimal for the company's bottom line, says Bach. Even if the still-unreleased study on moderate illness trial shows no effect, it will likely be trumped by the NIAID one.\n\nDoctors are still on a steep learning curve and we're only at the beginning of this pandemic. We should be trying as hard as we can to get as much insight as possible today. Rushing remdesivir through its early trials is a missed opportunity that might help some patients in the short term, but hurt many more over the months to come.",

Though the death rate in the wider community is dropping rapidly, there's still a crisis in care homes that has exacerbated tensions across government. Ministers say they have been guided throughout by \"the science,\" leading to accusations they're seeking to divert blame for any missteps.\n\n\"Scientists advise, ministers take decisions -- that's how government works,\" Johnson's spokesman, James Slack, told reporters when asked about Coffey's comments, in an apparent attempt to diffuse the row.\n\nMuch of the criticism of Johnson's government has focused on the early days of the outbreak, including a decision in March to halt widespread testing for Covid-19 in the community and waiting until March 23 to impose a nationwide lockdown. The roll-out of a track-and-trace program, widely regarded as essential to ensure restrictions can be eased without triggering a wave of infections, is also yet to materialize.\n\nYet it's the outbreak in care homes that is arguably the most sensitive for ministers. Last week, Johnson was challenged by opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer over initial government advice that it was \"very unlikely\" coronavirus would spread in the facilities, which house elderly and vulnerable people.\n\nInstead -- along with hospitals -- they became the front line of the pandemic. According to the latest data, 42% of all deaths involving Covid-19 in England and Wales took place in care homes in the week ending May 8.\n\nMartin Green, chief executive of Care England, criticized the government's decision to discharge patients -- some with Covid-19 symptoms -- from hospitals to the homes.\n\n\"We had a policy of emptying hospitals and filling care homes,\" he told the House of Commons health committee. \"We should have been focusing on care homes from the start of this pandemic. What we saw at the start was a focus on the NHS, and that meant that care homes often had their medical support from the NHS withdrawn.\"\n\nIn Parliament, Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the government's performance, noting that 62% of care homes have had no reported coronavirus cases and the number of deaths is now falling. \"We have made social care a priority from the start,\" he told MPs.\n\nBut while the death rate is falling in the U.K., the government still faces significant hurdles to opening up the economy and schools. Disagreements between scientists, officials and ministers are likely to exacerbate tensions further.\n\nResponding to a question on opening schools, John Edmunds, a specialist in infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who advises the government, echoed the recent trend of scientists pushing back on the government's \"following the science\" defense.\n\n\"Clearly the decision to open primary schools or not is a political one, it's not a scientific one,\" he told the House of Lords science committee on Tuesday.",

Putin said he will still seek Mishustin's approval for decisions on economic policy while he's in isolation. \"I plan to remain in active contact by telephone and videolink,\" Mishustin said.\n\nMishustin, who showed no apparent symptoms of the virus during his brief appearance, said he will be going to hospital later Thursday. He and other Russian officials, including Putin, have been conducting public meetings by video link in recent weeks.\n\n\"What's happening to you could happen to anyone,\" Putin told him. \"I've always said that.\"\n\n\"I want to wish you a quick recovery,\" Putin said. \"Please call me when you get to the hospital.\"\n\nPutin named Mishustin, 54, as prime minister in January, calling on him to accelerate efforts to jump-start economic growth. But the former tax chief's agenda was quickly overtaken by the spread of the virus and the collapse in prices for oil, Russia's main export.\n\nThe government moved quickly to impose travel restrictions to limit the contagion and its infection totals for weeks lagged those of harder-hit countries. But the numbers have increased steadily in recent weeks and Putin has extended orders to stay at home through May 11.\n\nIn his comments to Putin, Mishustin appealed to Russians to \"take the coronavirus infection and its spread as seriously as possible,\" calling on his countrymen to follow the government's self-isolation orders over the upcoming long holiday weekends. \"The date when the country can return to normal life depends on the willpower of each of us.\"\n\nRussia has reported a total of 106,498 cases of the virus, with 1,073 dead. But Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin warned earlier Thursday that the capital, which leads in the number of affected patients, \"is at best a quarter of the way along the path\" of the virus. He said more than half of all patients in the city's hospitals are sick with the ailment.",

The recommendations build upon guidance from the White House and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were developed with participation by health and medical experts.\n\nIt could also give rise to a new class of executive at large travel-industry companies: the health and safety officer.\n\n\"As we move to the next phase of our response to the pandemic, we must demonstrate leadership to elected officials and public health authorities who will decide when, how and under what conditions travel businesses are allowed to reopen across America,\" the group said in the guidelines. \"Just as importantly, we must also inspire confidence in travelers by demonstrating travel businesses are appropriately focused on their health and safety.\"",

An unexpected flare-up in a nightclub. A swelling cluster in towns near international borders with no discernible source.\n\nAfter containing their outbreaks through measures from strict lockdowns to rapid testing regimes, the Asian economies that have seen some of the most success in quelling the coronavirus -- Hong Kong, South Korea and China -- are now facing resurgences that underscore how it may be nearly impossible to eradicate it.\n\nIt's a painful reminder that as countries open up again and people resume normal life, untraceable flare-ups even after an extended lull in cases are likely. Scientists have warned that the disease may never go away, because it lurks in some people without causing any outward signs of sickness.\n\nWhy 'Silent Spreaders' Make Coronavirus Hard to Beat: QuickTake\n\n\"Given the asymptomatic population, these cases are going to emerge from unexpected sources,\" said Nicholas Thomas, an associate professor in public health at the City University of Hong Kong. \"It is inevitable that the restarting of societies is going to lead to more cases emerging.\"\n\nIn Hong Kong, a 66-year-old patient with no recent travel history ended the city's much-envied 23-day streak of zero local cases this week. Some of her family members have now been confirmed to be infected as well, and fears are growing that the woman may have seeded more infections as she moved around Hong Kong's dense city streets before being detected.\n\nHong Kong Streak of No Local Transmission Ends With Mystery Case\n\nOn the Chinese mainland, an outbreak of more than 20 new infections in northeastern China has forced authorities to impose movement restrictions in two cities reminiscent of the lockdown placed on Wuhan, the city where the deadly virus first emerged. Schools that had just re-opened to students were closed again in three Chinese cities with a total population of 13 million people.\n\nNot far away from China's fresh outbreak, South Korea has identified more than 100 new cases from several nightclubs frequented by gay customers. Health officials are trying to test more than 5,500 people who visited the clubs since late April, but some fear coming forward given the country's lingering homophobia. The outbreak threatens to test a virus strategy that has gained praise around the world for containing the virus without strict lockdown measures or disruption.\n\n\"It's now proven that the epidemic has a very long tail,\" Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, said on state television earlier this week.\n\nThere's a growing consensus that the virus won't just go away, unlike its close cousin that caused the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in 2003 that infected some 8,000 people in Asia.\n\nPeople who contracted SARS were immediately and visibly ill, and once they were quarantined for treatment, transmission was halted. But the new coronavirus manifests in many people with few, no, or uncommon symptoms, thus ensuring that hidden chains of transmission endure and cases will likely spike seasonally, like with the flu.\n\nAll the Covid-19 Symptoms You Didn't Know About\n\nMoreover, people infected with SARS were not contagious during the virus's incubation period or even in their early days of being sick. In contrast, the new virus doesn't necessarily make people sick but can easily transmit while it is still incubating, making early detection and containment difficult.\n\n\"We have to find ways to live with the virus for now, and this is the new normal,\" said Takeshi Kasai, the World Health Organization's regional director for the western pacific in a briefing on Thursday. \"As long as the virus is circulating in this inter-connected world, and until we have a safe and effective vaccine, everybody remains at risk.\"\n\nMore than a hundred vaccines are in development globally, but experts say it could take at least a year until any are ready for use.\n\nAs China's Virus Cases Reach Zero, Experts Warn of Second Wave\n\nComplicating containment efforts, second waves are proving even harder to trace. It remains a mystery to epidemiologists in China how a 45-year-old laundry worker at a local police station in the northern Chinese city of Shulan became infected earlier this month, setting off a chain of over 20 infections.\n\nAccording to the China CDC's Wu, she may not even be the first infection in the chain given differing incubation periods. \"The laundry woman could have fallen sick after two to three days while the real source is only sick after seven or eight days,\" he said. \"In that case it's very hard to tell exactly who infected whom.\"\n\nHealth officials are now conducting genetic sequencing for the virus obtained from the new cluster of patients and will compare it with the strain found in infected travelers returning from Russia to determine if they're related, according to Wu.\n\nChina Seals Off Cities Near North Korea as New Clusters Grow\n\nThere's also suspicion that the cluster could stem from North Korea given the area's proximity to China's border with the reclusive nation. North Korea has yet to confirm any Covid-19 infections, but the U.S. military said it suspects there are cases, and Kim Jong Un's regime has accepted help from other nations to fight the virus.\n\nSouth Korea has been widely lauded for controlling its outbreak without resorting to oppressive restrictions over its people. But its envied strategy of mass and rapid testing - which slows the virus's spread while keeping mortality low -- may have now reached its limit.\n\nKorea's Virus Strategy is Tested by Outbreak at Nightclubs\n\nMore than half of the club-goers South Korean health authorities want to test remain out of reach and some are not coming forward due to the fear of being outed as gay.\n\nBack in China's Wuhan, the emergence of six local cases this month prompted the city to embark on an ambitious task: prepare for testing its entire population of 11 million in ten days.\n\nDespite their swift responses and abundance of resources like testing kits, which some other countries still struggle with, Asian nations could be more vulnerable to a resurgence given how most people live in crowded apartment blocks.\n\n\"The high levels of population density - especially in public housing estates - means that any virus has multiple sources for transmission within highly confined geographical areas,\" City University of Hong Kong's Thomas said. \"This is the challenge that Asia faces far more so than the rest of the world.\"",

Much of the surge in infections has been driven by hundreds of new cases from migrant worker dorms daily.\n\nSingapore now has capacity to conduct over 8,000 tests per day, up from an average of 2,900 less than a month ago, the health ministry said in a statement on Monday. To date, the Southeast Asian nation has tested about 2,100 per 100,000 persons, which its government noted is higher than U.S. and the U.K. respectively testing 1,600 and 1,000 per 100,000 people.\n\n\"The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up far more cases than many other countries,\" the ministry said in the statement. \"We also conduct testing as a means of general surveillance to detect signs of community spread and to pick up unlinked cases.\"\n\nRead more: How Singapore Flipped From Virus Hero to Cautionary Tale\n\nSingapore has pivoted to a more aggressive coronavirus response strategy as cases jumped to 14,423 cases on Monday from less than 1,000 at the start of this month. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said last week that the government hopes to be able to \"progressively reopen\" its economy in about a month's time and is planning mass testing for its population of 5.7 million people.\n\nOf the total number of confirmed cases, the overwhelming majority are from often-cramped, low-wage worker dormitories spread across the island. Roughly 200,000 of these migrant workers live in these dormitories, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said in a Facebook post. According to the health ministry, more than 21,000 of these workers have been tested so far and close to 3,000 of them were being tested every day.\n\nWorkers who report sick or show acute respiratory infection are immediately pulled aside and isolated, the ministry said. One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services.\n\nRead more: Singapore to Require Migrant Workers in Dorms to Stay There\n\nFurther testing is done across hospitals and clinics with a focus on high risk groups showing symptoms of acute respiratory infection. The ministry is also doing more testing to protect vulnerable groups including staff at nursing homes where there is close contact with seniors, heath care workers and front-line officers who have regular contact with confirmed cases.",

It will also look out for negative cases and allow workers to go back to work as it seeks to progressively re-open its economy.\n\nSingapore now has one of the largest outbreaks in Asia following a resurgence in infections, primarily among low-wage migrant workers staying in cramped dormitories. It reported 768 new cases on Friday, bringing the total reported infections in the country to nearly 22,000. To decisively bring down the numbers, Singapore has extended its partial lockdown -- now into its fifth week -- until June 1.\n\nThe surge in cases, coupled with plans to re-open its economy, has prompted the city-state to scale up tests. The country's aim to increase testing fivefold from 8,000 a day to 40,000 by later this year comes amid a global shortage of test kits and materials.\n\nRead More about How Singapore's Late Pivot to Mass Tests Challenged by Kit Shortage\n\nSingapore is committed to continuing its selective testing strategy, the health ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak said at the press conference.\n\n\"Our selective testing strategies have given us quite a yield. It's not like that hasn't worked out,\" he said.\n\n\"As we move on eventually, to a later period of time, in terms of when we normalize, our testing strategies would have to be reviewed and fine-tuned,\" he said. \"We haven't made any major decisions about mass testing.\"\n\nThough Singapore's scaling up testing efforts, its game plan is different from the mass testing adopted by countries like South Korea, where people can request to be tested.\n\nThe government is looking at vulnerable groups such as elderly people residing in nursing homes and the homeless as well as frontline workers caring for infected patients.\n\n\"When we talk about mass testing, it's not everyone raise your hand and apply for a test. It shouldn't be like that,\" National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs a government taskforce tackling the virus, said at the press conference.\n\n\"It has to be directed,\" he said. \"Testing will be a national resource, which we will apply in a strategic way to ensure that Singapore is safe from the virus.\"\n\nThe city-state will progressively test all 16,000 seniors staying in nursing homes as well as 5,000 other residents and staff in welfare, shelter and adult disability homes. Currently, 9,000 employees of nursing homes have been tested.\n\nEven as it plans to expand to 40,000 tests a day, supplies have to be allocated to \"areas of priority,\" Wong said. Aside from vulnerable groups, others include those with respiratory illness, and migrant workers where repeated tests are needed even though they've been cleared.\n\nThe goal is to ensure that large virus clusters do not form again, Wong said. Test kits will also have to be allocated for workers in essential services such as waste management, logistics and finance.\n\nSingapore will consider lifting its so-called \"circuit breaker\" measures if certain criteria are fulfilled, including reduced transmission of the virus in the wider community as well as among the migrant workers in the dormitories.\n\nSome workplaces and services will resume operations from May 12, while certain groups of students will be allowed to return to school the following week.\n\nSectors such as manufacturing, which require workers to be onsite, should meanwhile start making preparations for the gradual reopening of the economy in the coming weeks, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing has said.\n\nHere are the other measures Singapore is taking to fight the virus:",

Kenneth Mak, the health ministry's director of medical services, said in early March that \"community testing for all people, irrespective of whether they have symptoms or not, will generate a lot of activity\" but have a low yield.\n\nThe city-state has already been testing at a very high rate compared to other countries, according to health experts. The health ministry's website says it had swabbed about 14,500 unique individuals per million as of April 20, with more than 80,000 unique people tested in total.\n\nThe possible move comes as South Korea, which launched a massive testing campaign, managed to slow the growth of infection by early March. Due in part to its actions, the epidemic spiked quickly in the country but also ebbed rapidly. Hong Kong also widened its virus response beyond contact tracing to include community testing as it became apparent the coronavirus was different from 2003's Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, where those infected fell seriously -- and obviously -- ill.\n\nA pivot in Singapore's strategy could come as it grapples with a surge in cases among low-wage migrant workers living in cramped dormitories, who have long been essential in the city-state's service and construction sectors. It reported a fourth straight day of virus cases going above 1,000 on Thursday, and confirmed cases now number more than 11,000.\n\nWhile total cases are rising, infections in the local community have in fact dropped since so-called \"circuit breaker\" measures were installed more than two weeks ago. Those cases fell to an average of 25 per day in the past week, from an average of 34 cases per day in the week before, the health ministry said Thursday.",

The government already plans to bolster its testing capacity fivefold, from about 8,000 to as many as 40,000 tests a day by later this year.\n\nThe government announced its expanded testing plan as it seeks to re-open an economy that has been hammered by the ongoing partial lockdown. Some workplaces and services, including hair salons, laundromats and pet food shops were allowed to resume operations Tuesday, while certain groups of students will be allowed to return to school next week.\n\nMore than 80% of Singapore's workforce has been working from home after the government implemented \"circuit-breaker\" measures, including closing schools and most workplaces, in early April.\n\nSo-called herd immunity is established if enough people in a community develop immunity through prior illness or vaccination. Researchers would have to develop a vaccine that proves safe and effective against the coronavirus, and health authorities would have to get it to a sufficient number of people.\n\nAchieving \"herd immunity through natural infection is going to be very difficult and will result in large numbers of infections and complications,\" said Vernon Lee, the ministry's director of communicable diseases, at the briefing Tuesday. \"We will have to wait for a viable vaccine to come out.\"\n\nRead: The Two Kinds of Virus Tests That Can Save Us. Or Not: QuickTake\n\nWhile the number of cases in the wider community continues to come down, an outbreak among low-wage migrant workers staying in cramped dormitories has led Singapore to record one of the largest virus tallies in Asia. On Tuesday the health ministry confirmed 884 new cases, the \"vast majority\" of them in the dorms, pushing the total to more than 24,000.\n\nInfection rates at dorms are stabilizing, Brigadier-General Seet Uei Lim, commander of the inter-agency taskforce, said Tuesday. The government is creating \"clean blocks\" of recovered migrant workers who can go back to work when their sectors gradually re-open when the circuit breaker ends, he added.\n\nBy the end of May, 20,000 foreign workers will be ready for discharge from care facilities, Development Minister Lawrence Wong said. All of the more than 300,000 foreign workers in the city will be tested, he said.\n\nWith steady progress being made in the wider community and in the dorms, the government is in a \"good position\" to think about easing restrictions in a calibrated manner, Wong said.\n\n\"We are continuing to test many workers, including the ones who are asymptomatic,\" part of the process to clear the dormitories systematically, Wong said. This will be done through mass swab tests and serology tests, with the latter being used in dormitories with high infection rates.\n\nOfficials said last week the government is looking at testing vulnerable groups such as residents and staff of nursing homes, front-line medical workers and the homeless. It also will prioritize migrant workers and those in essential services such as waste management, logistics and finance.\n\nThough Singapore is scaling up testing efforts, its game plan is different from the mass testing adopted by countries like South Korea, where people can request to be tested.\n\nRead more: Singapore's Pivot to Mass Tests Challenged by Kit Shortage\n\nMinister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing said April 24 the city-state is looking at \"much more testings for the entire population, and at the same time to take on\" additional safe distancing measures.",

        "body": "Testing is improving, but the results can lead to wildly different conclusions.\n\nNew antibody tests are allowing researchers to begin to make more-informed estimates of how many people actually have Covid-19. They're not perfect, though, and they've been saying greatly varying things about the spread and severity of the disease. Bloomberg Opinion columnists Justin Fox and Noah Smith -- who, let's be clear, are not epidemiologists, but have been reading a lot of epidemiology research lately -- met online recently to discuss where things stand.\n\nJustin Fox: Some early studies are showing that a lot more people have been infected with the new coronavirus than the confirmed-case numbers indicate. Testing of pregnant women in two Manhattan hospitals found that 15% had Covid-19, which if it were true today for the entire city's population would mean about 10 times more infections than confirmed cases. Testing for coronavirus antibodies in residents of Chelsea, Massachusetts, found that 30% were infected, which if true for the entire population would be about 15 times the confirmed cases.\n\nTwo brand-new new studies of California counties by an overlapping group of researchers have come to even more dramatic conclusions. They found that only a small percentage of the people tested in Santa Clara County (aka Silicon Valley) and Los Angeles County had antibodies that indicated they had had the disease (1.5% in the first, 4.1% in the second), but after a few statistical adjustments the estimates of infection was 50 times to 85 times the number of confirmed cases in Santa Clara County and 28 to 55 times that number in Los Angeles County. This would also imply that the infection fatality rate from the disease was close to the 0.1% of the seasonal flu, possibly even less.\n\nThis would be ... great news, an indication that the coronavirus pandemic might be over much sooner than most experts have been predicting. But it also seems too good to be true. And before I go into why I think it seems too good to be true, how about you, Noah? Do you think it's too good to be true?\n\nNoah Smith: I think we need to be extremely cautious when interpreting these studies. The first reason is the possibility of false positives. As experts have been quick to point out, if most people in an area haven't been infected, then even a small rate of false positives can make the number look much larger than it is. This is a problem for both of the studies you mention because California has low infection rates.\n\nTo see how this works, imagine a place where only 0.01% of people have actually been infected -- essentially nobody. Now imagine giving everyone in the area a test that has a 1% false positive rate -- a very accurate test! That test will nevertheless show an infection rate 100 times higher than it actually is.\n\nExperts have identified other problems with the way these studies selected the people to test. Together, these issues suggest that we don't know much yet about how many people have really been infected with this virus, and should continue to err on the side of caution. Much more data will be coming in soon.\n\nJF: And when it does, I take this to mean that we should pay a lot more attention to studies conducted in places that we already know have been hard-hit by the disease. It's useful to know that 50 of 3,300 people in Santa Clara County and 35 of 863 in Los Angeles County tested positive (and that 13 of 2,283 randomly selected Icelanders did), but it seems like we shouldn't be drawing any grand conclusions about the severity of the global spread of the disease from those results. A similar study in New York City or Northern Italy, though, could presumably tell us things with much broader application. If 20% of the population is infected, that false-positive rate of 1% only bumps the result up to 21%. Right?\n\nNS: Exactly right. Note that there have been some large-scale tests of hard-hit regions such as the Italian town of Vo. That study found that 43% of infected people were asymptomatic at the time they were tested (some of those might have developed symptoms later). That's very close to the asymptomatic percentage recorded on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, where everyone was tested, and in Iceland, where 5% of the entire population was tested. These are PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests that check for the virus itself; in contrast, the studies you mentioned earlier are antibody tests, which are newer and perhaps less reliable.\n\nIt's also worth noting that coronavirus has already killed about 14,000 people in New York City, which is 0.16% of the population. That should conclusively reject the idea that this is a disease with a 0.1% infection fatality rate. Add that to the fact that the virus is still killing many New Yorkers each day, that many others have probably not yet been infected, and it seems clear that this is a much deadlier disease than the seasonal flu.\n\nJF: But let's say 25% of New Yorkers have been infected. That implies an infection fatality rate of 0.67%, which happens to be almost exactly what the epidemiologists at Imperial College London have estimated for China. I'm a New York City resident, and I've been struggling to get my head around whether this will be helpful going forward because so many of us might have at least temporary immunity, or a disaster because there are probably still so many infectious people here that we'll never get it under control.\n\nNS: Yes, 0.67% is just about at the lower end of the reasonable estimates. If that's the true fatality rate, and coronavirus eventually infects 60% of the U.S. population of 330 million, that's 1.33 million dead Americans. Plus, remember that survivors of this disease often appear to have long-term damage to their lungs or other organs.\n\nSo allowing the virus to rampage unchecked would be an enormous loss in human terms, but it's not as if we'd be getting a restored economy out of the deal. It's highly likely that reopening the economy without a system in place to suppress the virus would cause mass panic and continued efforts at social distancing, thus extending and deepening economic losses. So let's err on the side of caution and keep lockdowns going for now, until we have better data and a suppression system in place.",

The conservative People's Party, the main opposition group, refused to endorse Sanchez's extraordinary powers for the first time in a sign of how the political consensus is crumbling after almost two months of harsh restrictions on daily life. The PP accounted for most of the 97 abstentions.\n\nThe prime minister says he needs to keep the special regime in place to ensure that the ongoing restrictions are enforced and to control the health system, which is normally run by the country's 17 regional administrations.\n\n\"Lifting the state of emergency at this time would be an absolute mistake,\" Sanchez told lawmakers at a sparsely attended plenary in Madrid Wednesday, with most deputies following the debate and voting remotely. While the limits on activity will gradually be eased, \"there will continue to be restrictions and those restrictions require the state of alarm,\" he said.\n\nThe PP had voted in favor of extending the state of emergency on three occasions but as the pandemic abates, political hostilities are flaring up. Its abstention left the prime minister to stitch together support from a group of smaller parties since his minority government doesn't have the lawmakers to form a majority on its own.\n\nPP Leader Pablo Casado said Sanchez has failed to mobilize the testing operations required to keep track of infections properly and that leaves the country vulnerable as it tries to get the economy going again.\n\n\"Infected people without symptoms can infect the rest of the population without knowing it,\" he said. \"You still haven't recognized a single error and demand that everyone supports you without a murmur.\"\n\nEarlier in the day, the European Commission forecast that Spain will suffer a fierce contraction in economic output this year of 9.4%, exceeded only by Italy and Greece.

Sanchez has said he aims to return the whole country to a \"new normal\" by the end of June, though he's warned that a resurgence in infections could see restrictions tightened again.",

Midsize players are running on fumes. Brick-and-mortar stores are struggling to get financing just to make it to next month. Startups -- the building blocks of a competitive economy -- are disappearing.\n\nIt all adds up to a sobering challenge for U.S. antitrust enforcers: The pandemic risks worsening the very problems of rising concentration and declining competition that they were already trying to address before the outbreak.\n\nFor almost a year, the Justice Department, Federal Trade Commission, and state attorneys general have been investigating Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. for possible antitrust infractions. Antitrust officials claimed those inquiries were hardly slowed down by the outbreak as they shifted to working remotely. As the economy reopens, enforcers may find themselves under pressure not to undertake actions that could hurt jobs.\n\nThe pandemic is playing to the strengths of the biggest digital players, as seen in their earnings results for the quarter ending in March. Amazon.com Inc. has gone on a hiring spree to keep up with a surge in demand from millions of homebound consumers. In what is normally a slow quarter, sales jumped 26% to a record $75.5 billion, though earnings fell 29% compared with the same period in 2019.\n\nAlphabet's revenue exceeded analysts' expectations. Facebook's shares soared on Thursday after its results eased some investor concerns about advertising weakness, though the real test could come in the months ahead. Investors were braced for one of the biggest annual sales declines in Apple Inc.'s history, but the company reported a surprising 1% revenue increase to $58.3 billion.\n\nAt the same time, retailers, restaurants, airlines and hotels are struggling -- and more than 30 million Americans have suddenly become jobless.\n\nDominant companies were already on the march across industries, from the internet to wireless carriers and from health care to food processing, long before the virus hit. For years, antitrust experts and economists have been warning that markets were becoming less competitive, harming consumers and workers in the process.\n\nDid Big Tech Get Too Big? U.S. Joins Europe in Asking: QuickTake\n\nNow, antitrust experts fear that as the largest companies increase market shares, decimated firms might disappear or have little choice but to sell out at fire-sale prices to stronger rivals -- and that regulators and lawmakers will be under pressure not to stand in the way as the economy struggles to get up off its knees.\n\n\"If you have some shock to the system -- a financial crisis, a war -- one effect is the weakest firms in the market tend to fail,\" said Daniel Crane, a professor at the University of Michigan who studies antitrust law. \"I do worry that the world that recovers from this will be one characterized by firms having failed and pressure to consolidate.\"\n\nThe 2008 financial crisis, in which a wave of bank mergers increased concentration, could offer a template for what's to come. The banks that were \"too big to fail\" in 2008 got even bigger, with the blessing of policy makers who encouraged the strong to gobble up the weak.\n\nBy 2012, five banks -- JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. -- were about twice as large as they had been a decade earlier, relative to the U.S. economy, with $8.5 trillion in assets.\n\nThis time, embattled retail, restaurant, entertainment and travel industries could follow suit. Clothing chain J. Crew Group Inc. is preparing a potential bankruptcy filing, Bloomberg has reported. J.C. Penney Co. and Neiman Marcus Group Inc. are in talks with creditors about restructuring debt and might file for bankruptcy. Car-rental giant Hertz Global Holdings Inc. is trying to preserve cash and get leniency from lenders to avoid a bankruptcy.\n\nNew York University economist Thomas Philippon, whose book, \"The Great Reversal,\" documented how U.S. markets have become less competitive, said big companies gained access to Federal Reserve lending facilities in the $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package. Meanwhile, millions of small firms were left with a poorly designed Small Business Administration loan program that's been swamped by demand, including from larger companies with the ability to tap stock and bond markets.\n\n\"It will be harder for younger firms to survive, and they are the potential new competitors,\" Philippon said.\n\nEarlier: SBA's Herculean Pandemic Response Was Swift, But Not Smooth\n\nSome are already closing up shop. Service, a travel app, folded after an investment deal and a backup plan to sell to Enterprise Holdings Inc. fell through in quick succession, said Michael Schneider, the chief executive officer. He had to inform his nine employees in Los Angeles that they were out of a job. \"It feels like the end of the world,\" he said.\n\nSupply-chain bottlenecks from one industry's high concentration level already have led to President Donald Trump invoking the Defense Production Act to keep food supplies flowing. On April 29, he ordered meat-processing giant Tyson Foods Inc. and other slaughterhouses to keep their plants open -- despite Covid-19 outbreaks that have sickened thousands.\n\nTyson and its top two rivals -- JBS SA and Cargill Inc. -- control about two-thirds of America's beef production, the bulk of which is done in a few dozen giant plants. Pork and chicken are similarly dominated. Their tight control prompted Senators Tammy Baldwin, a Wisconsin Democrat, and Josh Hawley, a Missouri Republican, on April 29 to seek an antitrust probe of the meatpacking industry.\n\n\"This is 100% a symptom of consolidation,\" said Christopher Leonard, author of \"The Meat Racket,\" which examines the protein industry. \"The virus is exposing the profound fragility that comes with this kind of consolidation.\"\n\nThe pandemic could reshape the American economy in myriad ways, as companies begin to teeter and corporate defaults are projected to soar. And the fallout won't be limited to the U.S.\n\nJean-Paul Agon, the chairman of French cosmetics giant L'Oreal SA, alluded to that possibility on an April 16 earnings call. \"It's unfortunate, but it's the Darwinian side of this industry,\" he said. \"We are pretty sure to be able to get out this crisis even stronger. So will there be opportunities for interesting acquisitions? We will see.\"\n\nWall Street investment banker Ken Moelis echoed that sentiment. \"The people who are going to survive this are obviously the biggest folks in their industry,\" he said during Moelis & Co.'s April 22 earnings call. \"I could see a large M&A wave in industries where you just have to consolidate out the middle, and we end up with very large concentrated industries.\"\n\nEven as the pandemic grinds deal-making to a halt, famed investors in struggling companies like Howard Marks's Oaktree Capital Group are getting ready to pounce. Mastercard Inc. Chief Executive Officer Ajay Banga told investors on an April 29 conference call that the company is \"keeping the powder dry\" for acquisitions.\n\nFear of a consolidation wave has led Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who chairs the House antitrust panel, to call for a moratorium on acquisitions.\n\n\"As millions of businesses struggle to stay afloat, private equity firms and dominant corporations are positioned to swoop in for a buying spree,\" Cicilline said at an April 23 conference.\n\nTwo other Democrats, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, are proposing legislation to ban corporate mergers while the pandemic persists. Cicilline said in an April 28 interview with Bloomberg TV that he would try to get the ban included in the next stimulus measure.\n\nEarlier: A Guide to the Antitrust Battle's Biggest Players\n\nThe increase in concentration has sparked calls for tougher antitrust enforcement and proposals to overhaul how regulators police mergers and anti-competitive conduct. The issue was debated on the 2020 presidential campaign trail and has become an area of common ground for Democrats and Republicans who have raised concerns about the power wielded by big companies, particularly Google and Facebook.\n\nYet antitrust officials at the Justice Department and the FTC could face political pressure to pull back on enforcement, said Crane, the University of Michigan professor, who has researched how competition enforcement was ceded to other priorities during wars and financial panics. During World War II, for example, the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration implemented formal policies that shielded companies from antitrust prosecution.\n\nAs the pandemic accelerates Amazon's grip on U.S. online retail sales -- its market share already was about 40% -- it could also permanently shift consumer behavior toward online shopping, further dooming physical stores and alarming antitrust overseers. On Friday, Jerrold Nadler, the House Judiciary Committee chairman called Amazon Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos to testify about his company's treatment of third-party merchants on Amazon's website.\n\nHospitals could be another area of consolidation. To deal with the virus outbreak, they are delaying elective surgery, which is worsening already squeezed finances at many providers. An April 6 report by Boston Consulting Group said the strain on hospitals would accelerate consolidation and the integration of independent physicians into health systems. Bloomberg Intelligence health-care analyst Glen Losev expects hospital operators HCA Healthcare Inc. and Tenet Healthcare Corp. to be buyers once the crisis recedes.\n\n\"Our health-care supply chain because of all the consolidation is already bottled-necked,\" said Diana Moss, the president of the American Antitrust Institute, which advocates for aggressive merger enforcement. \"Allowing more consolidation would mean more bottle-necking and more dominance and lack of flexibility.\"",

        "body": "Results from recent blood tests show how widely the disease has spread, and they indicate that Covid-19 is many times deadlier than seasonal influenza.\n\nThe results from the first blood surveys that test for evidence of antibodies to the new coronavirus have begun rolling in. They've been confirming earlier hints that in hard-hit places a significant share of people -- 21.2% in the New York City survey -- may have been infected with the virus, and that in most other places the percentages are still in the low single digits. They're also making it ever clearer that the disease caused by the virus, Covid-19, is much, much deadlier than influenza.\n\n\"It's just the flu, bro\" has been a sort of know-nothing rallying cry for those skeptical of government lockdowns and social-distancing efforts this spring. But it has also been the base case of a few prominent experts, such as John Ioannidis of the Stanford University School of Medicine and former Swedish state epidemiologist Johan Giesecke.\n\nOne important thing to get straight here is exactly how dangerous seasonal influenza is. The fatality rate that has been cited most often (including by me) is 0.1%, which happens to be about what you get if you divide the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's estimates of U.S. influenza deaths over the past nine years by its estimates of symptomatic cases. But just as with the coronavirus, testing has shown that many people infected with influenza viruses develop no flu symptoms. In a Twitter thread from February that a reader pointed out to me this week, University of Oxford infectious disease epidemiologist Christophe Fraser estimated that the actual infection fatality rate (which I will refer to from now on as IFR) of seasonal influenza is 0.04%.\n\nFraser also speculated that influenza expert Lone Simonsen \"may have more accurate numbers.\" So I emailed Simonsen, a professor of population health sciences at Roskilde University in Denmark who has worked at the CDC and National Institutes of Health in the U.S., to ask. Her answer: Fraser's estimate is spot on. Simonsen believes that the IFR for the coronavirus will eventually turn out to be on the low end of current estimates, possibly as low as 0.2% or 0.3%, but emphasized that this is \"still far greater than ... for seasonal influenza.\"\n\nWhat are the new coronavirus serology surveys saying about the infection fatality rate? Before I run through the numbers, some caveats: Because of the difficulties in getting a truly representative sample of the population and possible flaws with the tests, none of these estimates of the virus's prevalence is necessarily right. None has been peer reviewed, either, and only one has even been presented in the form of a formal scientific paper. One bit of guidance is that surveys that find a large percentage of infected people are likely to be more reliable in calculating IFRs because tests that deliver false positives skew their results less -- if 20% of the population is infected and 1% of the tests are false positives, that just changes the result from 20% to 21%; if only 1% is infected, the false positives double the apparent rate from 1% to 2%. Also, the IFRs calculated here are snapshots that miss out on deaths from the disease that haven't happened yet or haven't been reported; the influenza death totals used in calculating its fatality rate are more-complete after-the-fact estimates. Where I do the calculations myself, I use the death totals available as of Friday morning, even though the surveys may have happened earlier, so that counteracts this effect at least a little.\n\nHere goes, in descending order of what percentage of the population is estimated to be infected.\n\nThose are all the survey results from antibody testing that I knew of as of Friday morning. There's an antibody testing program in the Boise, Idaho, area, that so far shows a 1.75% positive rate, but it seems to be intended not as a survey but to let people who think they've been infected know if they have been. Stockholm's Karolinska Institute medical university had released results Tuesday showing that 11% of Stockholm area blood donors had antibodies for the coronavirus, but retracted them Wednesday after discovering that an undetermined percentage of the blood samples were from people who knew they had Covid-19 and were donating to produce plasma for treatments for the disease.\n\nSo the range of IFRs derived from these surveys so far is 0.12% to 1.08%, and the latter result should probably be given much more credence than the former both because of the false-positives issue described above and the seeming flaws in the calculations used to arrive at 0.12%. The most exhaustive and up-to-date pre-serology-survey estimate of Covid-19's IFR that I'm aware of, from a peer-reviewed article in Lancet Infectious Diseases by a group of researchers at Imperial College London, is 0.66%. If the IFR of the seasonal flu is 0.04%, these blood surveys show Covid-19 to be anywhere from three times deadlier to 27 times deadlier -- and given the incompleteness of current death counts, the true range seems likely to be higher than that.\n\nThere are lots of factors that can affect these fatality rates, including demographics, underlying health issues in the population, the quality of the health-care system and how overwhelmed that health-care system is with coronavirus patients. Covid-19 severity is of course hugely dependent on age, with the estimated IFRs from the Lancet article mentioned above rising above 0.5% only after age 50 and topping 13% for those over 80. Severity that rises with age is customary with seasonal influenza as well, though, and risks from the coronavirus seem comparable to those from seasonal flu only for children. For every age group above 20 the fatality risk from Covid-19 -- going by the estimates from the Lancet article and the CDC's seasonal influenza estimates -- is much, much higher. It's not just the flu, bro.",

        "body": "The changes needed to prevent outbreaks at processing plants are easiest for the largest ones to implement.\n\nThere's one obvious culprit in the looming U.S. meat crisis being driven by the spread of Covid-19: The decline of the American slaughterhouse.\n\nDespite being the world's second-largest meat consumer after China, the country stuns, kills and dismembers almost all of its annual production of 130 million pigs, 33.6 million cows and 2.3 million sheep in just over 800 facilities. Five decades ago there were more than 10 times as many. 1\n\nIf anything, those figures understate quite how concentrated the slaughter industry is. About two-thirds of America's pork passes through the 24 giant facilities owned by Smithfield Foods Inc., JBS SA, Tyson Foods Inc. and Clemens Family Corp. More than 80% of beef comes from about a dozen abattoirs owned by Tyson, JBS, Cargill Inc. and Marfrig Global Foods SA.\n\nThat presents a bottleneck for the American meat trade not unlike the one causing such ructions in the country's oil business. It's worryingly easy for disease outbreaks to spread among slaughter-plant staff, who work for low wages, in close quarters, in long shifts, and often share tightly packed break rooms and transportation around the site.\n\nOnce one plant becomes a Covid-19 hotspot, the knock-on effects can be profound. Supply chains aren't configured for pigs and cows to leave the site except in the form of chilled cuts, so it's not easy to move them elsewhere.\n\nRead more: A Pork Panic Won't Save Our Bacon\n\nThose who expect the current situation will lead to a revival of smaller-scale abattoirs forget how America's meat industry ended up this way in the first place. If the current shape of the livestock supply chain is a result of anything, it's been the interplay of more than a century of food-safety regulation, logistics and labor force arbitrage. The coronavirus will just move that process another step forward.\n\nScale, and the problems it engenders, has always been a central feature of the industry. When canals and rail routes through Chicago first joined the Midwestern farm belt to the populous East Coast in the mid-19th century, the slaughterhouse at the juncture -- Union Stock Yards -- grew to be the world's largest.\n\nConditions in the yards were notorious, with little regard for the safety of either the meat produced or the low-wage, immigrant workforce. Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel \"The Jungle\" attempted to draw attention to the latter, but its most lasting result was the regime of federal slaughterhouse regulations. Now there's approximately one government food inspector for every 10 employees in slaughtering and packing.\n\nOver the past 40 years, tighter oversight, better transport and economies of scale have driven slaughterhouses out of America's cities to giant facilities across the Midwest, Great Plains and South. More than a dozen of these little-known sites are about as large as the Union Stock Yards. Modern slaughter plants are built close to feedlots and the grain and soy fields that supply them. That means most meat is transported in the form of cuts, which pound-for-pound cost about a hundred times as much as live animals. Located in rural areas, they can pay their workers less than would be expected in the city, too.\n\nIt's hard to see how making these facilities more resilient to infectious outbreaks among workers would reverse the concentration of previous decades. After all, better hygiene and humane standards for meat, and the (worthwhile) regulatory burden that entails, are one of the main reasons so many small-scale slaughterhouses have closed down in recent decades. The sorts of changes that would be needed post-coronavirus -- spacing workers further apart and separated by screens, staggering shift periods and providing more break rooms -- are likely to be easiest for larger plants to implement. To the extent that better practices help improve the meager wages of abattoir workers, that, too, will probably benefit the meat producers with the biggest market share and ability to pass on costs to consumers.\n\nReturns at the biggest businesses are sufficient to cover their capital costs, but hardly excessive. Investors generally prefer grains processors such as Bunge Ltd. and Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. Red meat consumption in the U.S. has fallen by a quarter since the 1970s. The concentration of America's meat packing industry is ultimately a symptom of its weakness, rather than its strength.",

        "body": "Sign up to receive the Green Daily newsletter in your inbox every weekday.\n\nJohn Sterman has spent his life explaining why big systems fail.\n\nA professor at MIT Sloan School of Management since the early 1980s, his research extends from global supply chain disruptions to the collapse of the biosphere. He literally wrote the book on how to manage complexity, Business Dynamics, and has guided generations of MBA students and executives. Now he focuses on sustainability and climate change.\n\nSterman likes to start his presentations with a devastating assessment of how well facts, diagrams and figures change people's minds: \"Research,\" he deadpans, \"shows that showing people research doesn't work.\"\n\nWhat does work is playing games. The latest game takes the shape of an easy-to-use, deceptively sophisticated model called En-ROADS that turns hypothetical policy scenarios into climate impacts, projected out to the year 2100.\n\nThe simulator came together over nearly a decade, with hundreds of climate workshops involving thousands of people. In some workshops the attendees -- often business leaders or policy wonks -- are asked to take on the interests of states or transnational blocs and, in character, haggle with each other over climate solutions. If China promises to cut its emissions by 2040, will the U.S. fund breakthrough nuclear-power research? Can we all agree to a carbon tax?\n\nAfter every round of negotiation, the terms of a global climate strategy are keyed into the model, which projects results about the future of the planet in real time. Once the players gasp at their poor results, it's back to the mock-negotiating table.\n\nSterman moderates this role-playing as a senior adviser to Climate Interactive, a nonprofit that develops tools for understanding policy options in an overheating world. MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative and Ventana Systems Inc. helped the group design En-ROADS to anchor these workshops. Think of it as a video game with primitive graphics and the highest possible real-world stakes.\n\nEn-ROADS offers 18 different policy levers and instantaneous visual analysis of how different decisions affect temperatures, greenhouse-gas emissions and energy use. Inside the software there are 64 adjustable settings, such as how much land can be reforested, how fast melting ice raises sea level or how long it takes to build a nuclear plant. The scientific basis of the simulation is transparent, meaning users can see which findings inform the outcomes.\n\nIt's easy to forget how impossible climate diplomacy seemed before the breakthrough sealed by the 2015 Paris Agreement. For more than 20 years, the U.S. would not commit to cutting greenhouse-gas emissions unless developing nations did, too. And no poor country was going to forego coal, oil and gas to fight a problem created by industrial nations enjoying the same fuels.\n\nThis was the prevailing mindsets in 2012, when about 30 government and business officials from China's Zhejiang Province filed into Sterman's workshop at MIT to take part in the mock-negotiation game, using an older Climate Interactive model. They eventually decided that rich nations should make deep and fast emission cuts, with China and developing countries cutting less aggressively.\n\nSterman showed the Chinese visitors the results of their choices, projected out over the decades: Global sea-levels would rise by as much as 2 meters by 2100. Projection maps put Shanghai, Shenzhen and other low-lying coastal cities under water.\n\nSterman then ran an utterly hypothetical scenario in which developed nations zeroed out all their emissions instantaneously. The results were the same. China and other developing nations would suffer terrible losses even if the West's emissions ceased tomorrow. \"What does this mean?\" he asked the group, through an interpreter.\n\nNo one spoke. The silence lasted 10 seconds. \"Which is a long time!\" Sterman says now. One participant finally answered through a translator: \"It means we have to leave the past in the past. We -- China -- we will suffer unless we cut our emissions dramatically.\"\n\nLooking back, Sterman sees that as an example of how a game can help us change what we think. \"If I had stood up and said, 'China must cut its emissions or you're going to suffer from sea-level rise,' they would have folded their arms,\" he says. \"But they discovered it for themselves.\"\n\nA discovery made by a handful of people has limited reach. China has surpassed the U.S. as the world's biggest source of carbon-dioxide emissions. Tremendous investment in renewable power by Chinese policymakers hasn't stopped the world's largest energy consumer from putting out 28% of all CO\u2082 emissions from fossil fuels, nearly twice the U.S. share.\n\nSystems break for reasons that generally have nothing to do with bad actors. The very design of a system, to begin with, is a \"consequence of generally well-intentioned decisions that smart people made,\" Sterman says. \"We're not in the business of blaming people. The blame problem is a huge issue today. You see it in the pandemic.\"\n\nAs he's watched the spread of Covid-19 from his solar-powered home several miles from the green headquarters of MIT Sloan in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Sterman has thought about the similarities between the virus and climate change. Both calamities lock in underlying problems well before their symptoms show up.\n\nSterman also sees a pivotal difference: There's not yet a treatment or a vaccine for Covid-19, but climate solutions are well in hand. Learning that is what his role-playing game is all about.",

The plan is for enough people to install it so it will be possible to isolate new cases of Covid quickly while the rest of the country starts the process of returning to normal.\n\nUsing a low-power Bluetooth signal from the phone, the app creates a record each time it gets close to another phone that has the app installed. If the user develops coronavirus symptoms, they press a button on the app, which then uploads its record of contacts to a central server. Those are then decrypted by the central server and messages are sent to each contact via the app.\n\nNHSX, the digital arm of the National Health Service, said it is working with Apple and Google, which are supporting contact-tracing apps.\n\nThe app is due to begin trials on the Isle of Wight, off England's south coast, this week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said it will be ready to launch nationally in the middle of May.\n\nNHSX argues the app is highly anonymous. It doesn't take a name or unique identifier from the user's phone, and the only personal information it asks for is the first half of the user's postal code, which would usually cover around 20,000 people. \"The app doesn't know who the user is,\" Matthew Gould, CEO of NHSX told Parliament's Human Rights Committee on Monday.\n\n\"The notifications don't say who it was that you saw,\" said Gould. \"It sets out only that you've had a proximity event. It doesn't say with whom or in what place or on what date.\"\n\nThe big one is around the central server. When someone's contact list is updated, it theoretically could reveal social networks of phones, and contacts between individuals they would prefer to keep private. But NHSX argues the data will be anonymous.\n\nNot at present. The app might be developed in future, and Gould said users could have the option to provide more information. But that raises the risk of a person who is happy to share their location accidentally compromising the privacy of a user who isn't.\n\n\"The data will only be used for health, public health and research purposes,\" Gould said.\n\nGould was ambiguous answering this question to the Human Rights Committee. \"At the end of the crisis all the data will either be deleted or fully anonymized so that it can be used for research purposes,\" he said.",

    "The U.S Needs Way More Than a Bailout to Recover From Covid-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Shore up the markets, sure, but don't stop there. It's time for Congress and the White House to do things that have been unthinkable since JFK's moonshot. It's time to go big.\n\nThe economic crisis created by Covid-19 is unlike any other in modern American history. Thousands are dead, and the economic fallout has been devastating. More people lost their jobs over four weeks in March and April than did so during the entire 2008-09 financial crisis. In fact, since mid-March, all of the employment gains since the last crisis ended have been lost. Of the 156 million people the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics measured as working full time then, more than 26 million -- about 16.7% -- were no longer receiving a paycheck as of April 23. If you add in gig workers and those who were unable to file unemployment claims because state offices were too overwhelmed, the tally was more than 20%. At this pace, we will eclipse the peak of unemployment during the Great Depression, 25%, in a matter of weeks.\n\nThis sudden collapse in economic activity, hitting every sector except for food, health care, and Netflix, is why Congress moved quickly to pass the $2 trillion CARES Act on March 27. In late April, lawmakers added $320 billion to replenish the U.S. Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program. That sounds like a lot, until you learn that the first allotment, $349 billion, lasted barely a week. CARES2, another trillion-dollar stimulus, is already under congressional consideration. CARES3 won't be too far behind.\n\nBut these are all temporary salves, not long-term solutions. The current rescues only treat the symptoms of economic distress; they do nothing to address structural issues that have been a drag on middle-class household income since the 1980s. If we want to restart the engine that made this nation a superpower, we need to do something big. I mean really, really big: defeat-the-Nazis, land-a-man-on-the-moon, invent-the-internet big.\n\nThere's no small amount of irony in this coming from me. I'm the guy who wrote an entire book, Bailout Nation, arguing against bailouts for, among others, Chrysler in 1980, Long-Term Capital Management in 1998, and the failing banks of 2008-09.\n\nBut I'm not talking about a bailout. For generations, and most successfully in the Depression's aftermath, the U.S. has used public-private partnerships to drive the country's economic expansion, allowing entrepreneurs and innovative companies to take advantage of the long-term planning and financial strength of Uncle Sam. This strategy led to new industries and technologies, creating millions of good middle-class jobs in the process. This is the solution that must no longer be overlooked. What we need right now are public-private partnerships on a scale not attempted since the Depression.\n\nWhen the stock market crashed in 1929, the Federal Reserve was a young institution with limited authority. Reviving the economy was the job of the White House and Congress. Programs such as the Works Progress Administration, in which the federal government hired workers to build more than half a million miles of streets and 10,000 bridges, along with airports, dams, highways, and sanitation systems, helped alleviate mass unemployment. However, the lasting economic gains came not from temporary work programs, but rather from the Reconstruction Finance Corp., a public-private entity better known as the RFC.\n\nLouis Hyman, an economic historian and director of the Institute for Workplace Studies at Cornell, recently described RFC in the Atlantic as \"an independent agency within the federal government that set up lending systems to channel private capital into publicly desirable investments. It innovated new systems of insurance to guarantee those loans, and delivered profits to businesses in peril during the Depression.\" Most impressive, as Hyman has noted, these programs cost taxpayers nothing.\n\nThe RFC was an enormous economic multiplier. Start with the Depression-era breakdown of the banking system. That institutional collapse wasn't caused by a lack of capital; larger national banks such as National City Bank and Bank of America had idle cash. But low potential returns, combined with post-traumatic stress lingering from the stock crash, made bankers so risk-averse they wouldn't even lend to each other.\n\nThe RFC's solution in 1934 was for private bank employees to work with its subsidiary, the Federal Housing Administration, to create insurance for pools of mortgages. This led to a resurgence of financing for home purchases. Another RFC subsidiary, the Rural Electrification Administration, worked with farm cooperatives and banks to issue low-interest 20-year loans to run thousands of miles of electrical wires to rural farms and ranches -- something the private sector had said would be too expensive.\n\nDuring the years before World War II, the RFC created the Defense Plant Corp., offering loans and tax benefits for the manufacture of tanks, planes, and other weapons used by the Allies to fight the Nazis. The DPC helped add 50% to the country's manufacturing capacity by the war's end, according to Hyman. In 1940 it was responsible for 25% of the nation's entire gross domestic product. Hyman noted that it remade the U.S. aerospace and electronics industries, turning them into some of the largest sectors in the economy.\n\nHalf a century later, most Americans have forgotten all that these public-private partnerships accomplished -- to such an extent that there is political hay to be made by demonizing government programs of any kind. We've lived off their fruits while failing to establish new programs. This void has led to a list of structural issues: underemployment, an increasing wage gap, a lack of household savings, and a looming retirement crisis.\n\nBy the time the Great Recession arrived in the late aughts, Congress resisted the idea of a big stimulus plan. That was, until Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke informed them the nation was \"days away from a complete meltdown of our financial system,\" as then-Senator Christopher Dodd later recounted. Even then, lawmakers didn't do all that much, passing the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, which was later reduced to $431 billion, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787 billion plan that included short-term benefit extensions and tax cuts.\n\nWhile Congress dithered, the response of the U.S. central bank was unprecedented. The Fed fashioned dozens of programs to put $4 trillion into credit markets. This helped to unfreeze credit markets and allowed bank lending to occur. The Great Depression had FDR; the Great Recession had Ben Bernanke.\n\nHis actions were effective in a narrow sense: He saved the finance sector. The Fed's zero-interest-rate policy stopped 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgages -- loans with teaser rates that shot higher after 24 months -- from resetting, which prevented defaults. This gave banks time to gradually improve their balance sheets, but it planted seeds that led to a variety of unintended consequences.\n\nSaving the banks turned out to be a boon to property owners, homebuilders, and the private equity funds that were investing in distressed real estate, who saw their holdings quickly recover their value. But those who didn't own homes, including many people who'd lost them to foreclosure, were turned into renters.\n\nInvestors did well, of course. If you still owned stock in March 2009, when the market hit its lowest point -- or better yet, if you had enough capital to buy more stock -- your risk-taking was richly rewarded. From those lows, the S&P 500 tripled over the next few years. Even with the recent post-Covid correction, the index is still worth four times what it was in 2009.\n\nMost Americans don't own much in stocks. In a 2017 study, Edward Wolff, a professor at New York University and researcher at the National Bureau of Economic Research, found that the wealthiest 10% of U.S. households owned 84% of all stocks. During the recovery, the wealthiest segments of society got wealthier. I should disclose that I benefited from it personally, too. My firm, Ritholtz Wealth Management, manages more than a billion dollars in stocks and bonds. Our clients did well in part because their portfolios have benefited dramatically from rising prices. The Fed deserves credit for some of that increase in asset values.\n\nAnother enormous windfall went to those employees who had lots of company stock options. From October 2007 to March 2009, the S&P 500 fell 56%. Many companies, including Apple, Starbucks, and Google, allowed their employees to trade in worthless stock options for new ones with much lower strike prices in 2009. The biggest beneficiaries were the executives who held the lion's share of issued options. As the market and the economy recovered thanks in part to the Fed's monetary efforts, these options became deep in the money. Tens of millions of dollars in risk-free profit were created for some already wealthy people.\n\nWhile the financial sector recovered, Congress did little to help the rest of the economy. In the past, when household and private-sector demand collapsed, the government stepped in to replace it by spending more and cutting taxes. For reasons people still debate -- ideology? deficit concerns? partisanship? -- the fiscal response in 2009 was sorely lacking.\n\nAs people began to find new jobs, they were often worse than the ones they'd lost during the crisis -- with lower wages and fewer (if any) benefits. Without a substantial fiscal stimulus, the good middle-class jobs associated with large public works projects or civil service employment never materialized. Gains from the economic recovery never \"trickled down\" to the working classes.\n\nThe 2020 economic rescue has skimmed from the responses to both the Great Depression and the Great Recession. But so far it's been heavily slanted toward the latter approach, as the Fed has slashed interest rates to zero and committed more than $2 trillion to keep rates low and credit markets liquid. The $2 trillion CARES Act aims to replace income and spending for those 92% of Americans under shelter-in-place orders until the crisis passes. Most of that CARES money will replace lost wages for employees of small and midsize businesses for a short while; the rest will cover lost revenue for a few larger businesses. There's also money going to states, cities, and hospitals.\n\nThe response has been more substantial than what the government did during the 2008-09 crisis. But it's still nowhere near enough.\n\nWe should be using RFC-like partnerships to build technological platforms and infrastructure for the future. The list of potential areas is long -- but here are a few ideas:\n\nNine of the 10 warmest years in recorded history have occurred since 2005. What's been missing from the attempts to address global warming has been a comprehensive search for a huge technological solution to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, or perhaps a series of smaller ones that cumulatively have a substantial impact. Accelerating this process could have implications for avoiding what might very likely be humanity's next great crisis.\n\nOne reason for modest hope in the looming climate crisis has been incremental improvements in the efficiency of wind and solar energy, along with battery storage improvements. What we need to make this energy technology much more efficient would be a Manhattan Project of sorts, aiming for fundamental breakthroughs in both the science and the technology. The resulting cheap, abundant energy would help reduce future carbon emissions and pollution -- and lower costs for energy-intensive businesses.\n\nThe U.S. once had the world's leading roads, airports, and electrical grids. We have foolishly allowed these to fall into disrepair and decay. This lowers the quality of life, hurts economic growth, and puts America at a disadvantage to rising powers in Asia. The solution is to create a Reconstruction Infrastructure Corp. to prioritize projects for repair and rebuilding. Fund it with 50- to 100-year bonds issued at 2%. Infrastructure is more than a make-work program; it's the platform that allows businesses to operate efficiently.\n\nSpeaking of platforms, it's only a matter of time before self-driving cars are here. Greater traffic capacity, faster commutes, and reduced automobile fatalities will be the happy result. But whether this happens in a few years or, more pessimistically, a few decades is unclear. What would speed things along would be a uniform set of radio-frequency devices built into roads and vehicles to allow safe navigation regardless of weather or traffic conditions. A public-private partnership could (among other things) create a set of standards that allows different vehicle manufacturers to interact safely on the open road.\n\nHow is it possible that in 2020 the flow of health-care information has yet to become seamless and universal? How is this crucial sector still operating as if it were the 19th century? Prior government attempts to address this issue have been too modest. Instead, combine the government's efforts with the health-care initiative created by Warren Buffett, Jamie Dimon, and Jeff Bezos -- and create a bold, comprehensive experiment.\n\nThis isn't merely something out of science fiction. Serious technologists believe we could launch a fleet of unmanned ships to mine valuable minerals. I understand that some want to go to Mars. I say aim farther, all the way to the asteroid belt, with its vast riches of industrial metals, nickel, cobalt, and likely gold and platinum.\n\nIn all of those examples, the journey is the reward. Landing a man on the moon was a triumph of ingenuity, but the economic benefits came from the technology that the Apollo program developed. Integrated circuits, fireproof materials, water purification, freeze-dried food, polymer fabrics, cordless tools -- the list is so long that we take it for granted. We need to update President Kennedy's challenge, not for the national glory, but for the societywide economic benefits.\n\nSome will say what I'm arguing for here would be a departure from 21st century U.S. political and economic realities. But as entrepreneur and author Bhu Srinivasan points out in Americana: A 400-Year History of American Capitalism, Uncle Sam has successfully partnered with the private sector throughout our history, creating exclusive monopolies through patent protections and municipal bonds, among many other innovations. Or, to quote the venture capitalist William Janeway, the U.S. innovation economy has always been \"sponsored by the state and funded by speculation.\"\n\nIt sometimes takes a crisis to get past the usual partisan wrangling in Congress. Right now there's a rare willingness to try more short-term stimulus. But the lesson of the past two centuries is that to benefit the U.S. population, the government needs to enact a long-lasting fiscal stimulus -- a new NASA, not just an extra few hundred dollars to get us through the next few months.\n\nGrover Norquist once said his goal for government was \"to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub.\" It's a great punchline, right up until you need the government to fight the Nazis -- or to control a global pandemic that threatens to kill millions and destroy the economy.\n\nTime will tell if this White House and Congress are up to this enormous task. The public gets to grade the response and rescue plan in about six months -- on Nov. 3.\n\nThis is no time for thinking small. America, confronted with the biggest crises, has always stepped up. We face yet another historic crisis. Once again it is time for America to go big.\n\nBarry Ritholtz is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist and the author of Bailout Nation: How Greed and Easy Money Corrupted Wall Street and Shook the World Economy.

        "body": "Researchers have identified a variant of the virus that causes Covid-19. It has quickly become the dominant form around the globe.\n\nAs the new coronavirus has spread from person to person, and country to country, the virus has changed thousands of times. The vast majority of these changes are incremental. But last week, researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory posited that at least one variant had significantly mutated to become more contagious.\n\nIf true, this development could have major implications. The possibility of what's known as a functionally significant mutation of SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, has intrigued and worried researchers and policymakers almost since the moment the virus was first identified. A new variant could, for example, hamper efforts to develop a vaccine or mean that people who've already had Covid-19 might face a greater risk of getting it again.\n\nThe Los Alamos hypothesis was quickly met with a rush of reactions ranging from raised eyebrows to dismissive skepticism from biologists and coronavirus experts around the world. The data, many said, just didn't support such a big claim. Critics also felt the paper's language oversold and sensationalized the actual findings.\n\n\"I find this hypothesis to be plausible but far from proven,\" Trevor Bedford, a top viral-genome expert at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington, wrote on Twitter in response to the paper. He said he had been watching the mutation closely.\n\nLos Alamos declined to comment. The federal research center was created during World War II to focus on national security.\n\nThe Los Alamos paper, which was published online prior to peer review, describes how researchers combed through a global database of SARS-CoV-2 variants. They found one that seemed to dominate quickly as the virus spread throughout Europe. This variant had several mutations that distinguished it from the Asian version. One was dubbed Spike D614G.\n\n\"It's in an important piece of the virus, and we need to study it to determine whether or not it's a concern,\" said David Montefiori, a Duke University virologist and author of the study. \"What we're claiming is that this mutation needs to be studied aggressively, quickly,\" he added. \"We're not trying to blow things out of proportion.\"\n\nViruses replicate by copying themselves, and often they make mistakes. These mistakes become what are known as mutations. Most of these changes though, are the equivalent of a few words in an entire book, and so they don't perceptibly change the virus.\n\nThe Los Alamos scientists set up a system to identify mutations that might be noteworthy, yielding the Spike D614G. The spike protein is critical: It's the key the virus uses to enter and infect a healthy host cell before taking it over to churn out copies of itself. Vaccines and therapies often are designed to disarm exactly this portion of a virus's operation. Some kinds of mutations, conversely, can make a virus much more able to spread rapidly. Others can change the nature of a virus, making it less or more dangerous.\n\n\"The mutation Spike D614G is of urgent concern; it began spreading in Europe in early February, and when introduced to new regions, it rapidly becomes the dominant form,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nMonitoring these tiny mutations over time is also how researchers are able to track how the virus travels through the world, much like building a family tree. The Spike D614G mutation occurred right around the time the virus arrived in Europe and ended up seeding much of the outbreak there. Now it's the predominant variant in Europe. In the U.S., this European version is prevalent on the East Coast, while the one originating in China was initially more present on the West Coast. The European variant has been gaining ground, however, fueling speculation it may have mutated in a way that makes it easier to spread.\n\nThe Los Alamos researchers note the increasing frequency of the D614G mutation and argue it demonstrates that the mutation makes it more transmissible than the original version. Genomics researchers say this is possible. But they also don't rule out random chance. As Bedford puts it, the D614G version may be more common simply \"because it got lucky in the European introduction,\" seeding a massive Italian outbreak that quickly spilled over to the rest of Europe and the eastern United States and has now spread to Australia.\n\nMuch more data is needed to confirm which possibility is correct, including lab-study results that could show the virus infects cells more effectively in the test tube. Researchers also will be on the lookout for more epidemiological data to confirm that the D614G is becoming the dominant variant.\n\nFor now, drugmakers rushing to create a vaccine for the virus have signaled they haven't seen anything to be concerned about. Ugur Sahin, the chief executive officer of Mainz, Germany-based BioNTech SE, said he has \"no doubt that from a vaccinology standpoint, we don't see mutations which could emerge as vaccine-escape variants yet.\" Moderna Inc.'s chief medical officer, Tal Zaks, has expressed similar views.\n\nAnd Roche Holding AG, one of the world's biggest players in diagnostics, has said it hasn't seen any mutation that would compromise the accuracy of its Covid-19 tests.\n\nA weakness of the paper, critics say, is that there's little lab data supporting the assertions it makes. It's possible the D614G mutation does something important, but it isn't clear what that would be and what it means, says Stanley Perlman, a top coronavirus researcher at the University of Iowa.\n\nA significant mutation could potentially change the course of the illness, for example, by causing more-severe symptoms, said Jennifer Doudna, a University of California at Berkeley geneticist. But \"there is no evidence that this increasing prevalence corresponds to more-severe disease outcomes.\"\n\nOther research suggested SARS-CoV-2 is somewhat more stable than other kinds of viruses. A Scottish study published this week in the journal Virus Evolution noted there have been just over 7,000 documented mutations thus far, a rate about a third that of the flu. The paper suggested these mutations aren't likely to significantly affect the virus's biology.\n\n\"It's important to remember that viruses mutate,\" said Oscar MacLean, a lead author on the study and researcher at MRC-University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research. \"That's what they do all the time.\"",

    "The Week Coronavirus Got Away From Boris Johnson's Government": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "On Monday, March 16, a secretive group of Britain's top scientists, health experts and government officials gathered to discuss the unfolding coronavirus pandemic. They knew they had a problem.\n\nFor days, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had brushed aside a crescendo of calls from politicians and academics to close the country's more than 30,000 schools. He had repeatedly refused, insisting that the scientific advice he was so publicly heeding showed such disruption wasn't necessary.\n\nBut shocking new data modelling presented to those gathered in the gray government offices on London's Victoria Street suggested the policy needed to change -- and fast.\n\nFor two hours over takeaway cups of coffee, the members of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies debated the evidence showing transmission between children, parents and teachers was higher than they thought. Moreover, radical social distancing -- the lockdown measures being put in place across much of Europe -- would be needed very soon.\n\nIn that tense meeting, though, the concern was political. Among those present were Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, and Patrick Vallance, the government's most senior scientific adviser. Flanking Johnson at press conferences broadcast live, they had become the public faces of Britain's war with Covid-19. They agreed it was the right time to pursue the U-turn on school closures, though worried about a loss of credibility.\n\nNow at the peak of the outbreak, the U.K. has just recorded its highest weekly death toll in 20 years and is failing in its hope of keeping fatalities below 20,000. Some university models suggest the U.K. could well experience the highest in-hospital death toll in Europe.\n\nAmid shortages of vital medical kit, the government even sent a military plane to Turkey to bring back protective clothing for health workers. Johnson remains off work, recovering after the Covid-19 infection he caught a month ago left him fighting for his life in intensive care.\n\nThe initial decision to delay closing schools is just one chapter in the story of the British response to the pandemic that Johnson's critics say was far too slow. The government waited longer than many countries before deciding to shut restaurants, bars and stores and banish people to their homes. While other countries chased down every case of infection they could find, Johnson's administration failed in its attempt to test the population and track the spread of the virus.\n\nIt's too early to fully judge the success or failure of efforts to tackle the pandemic, and despite starting out behind in capacity compared with other countries, the National Health Service is coping with the surge in cases so far. A government spokesperson said it took the appropriate action when needed and was driven by the scientific advice.\n\nYet what is clear is that Britain had time. According to specialists, academics and Johnson's political opponents, he wasted it. They say an opportunity was missed in February to stock up on vital equipment when the international competition was less fierce. And then, over the course of a critical period in March, the virus got away from the people running the country.\n\nEven though they knew the infection was spreading unchecked in the community, it was still more than a week before the government shut the pubs and schools, and 11 days before the fuller lockdown was brought in.\n\n\"We closed down too late -- that's clear from the maths,\" said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, who is advising the World Health Organization on the pandemic. \"English exceptionalism has been really damaging.\"\n\nBased on minutes from parliamentary committee hearings, conversations with senior government ministers and officials, data comparisons with other countries and conversations with virus experts and doctors, this article charts the opportunities that were missed to prepare for the worst and prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nAt the start of the year, the official message from Johnson's government was that the new illness taking hold in China was nothing to worry about. All the political focus was on Britain finally completing its tortuous departure from the European Union after more than three years of wrangling.\n\n\"The whole of the U.K. is always well prepared for these types of outbreaks,\" Health Secretary Matt Hancock told the House of Commons on Jan. 23, as China moved to quarantine its most-affected region. Government officials had just raised the risk to the population to \"low\" from \"very low.\"\n\nThe U.K. for weeks looked out of sync with the rest of Europe in trying to keep life as normal. After a conference call on Feb. 21, the day Italy reported its first death, Public Health England put the risk at \"moderate.\" Not everyone was so relaxed. John Edmunds, a professor of epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, emailed the group after to say it should be raised to \"high.\"\n\nOne senior emergency medicine doctor at Hillingdon Hospital in west London, Meng Aw-Yong, said he was already dealing with infected patients around that time. He looked at the X-ray of one case and realized in retrospect it was coronavirus, he said.\n\n\"I was seeing Covid patients without realizing,\" said Aw-Yong, who has 28 years of experience and is also a medical director for the Metropolitan Police. \"If I was seeing Covid being unprotected, and he was spreading it around, we missed the opportunity. I would have been exposed. His friends and family would have been exposed. Somewhere we lost the opportunity to grip this early on.\"\n\nYet the March 10-13 Cheltenham Festival, an annual horse racing meet, drew 250,000 attendees just after Italy imposed a national quarantine. A Champions League soccer match between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid was watched by 50,000 fans on March 11, the day the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic.\n\nThe government's view was that people were more likely to catch the virus watching sports in a confined space such as a pub than in the open air. There was no national lockdown until March 23.\n\n\"As soon as it happened in China, there should have been an awareness that we needed to move swiftly,\" said David King, the government's chief scientific adviser from 2000 to 2007. \"The actions should have been: get the ventilators in, get the protective gear in for the medical staff and we should have also got going on delivering the tests.\"\n\nJohnson encapsulated the British \"keep calm and carry on\" approach with his instruction to \"wash your hands\" while singing \"Happy Birthday\" twice. At the beginning of March, the 55-year-old premier proudly boasted of \"shaking hands with everybody\" during a visit to a hospital with coronavirus patients, while washing his hands regularly. On April 6, he was admitted to intensive care after failing to shake off the virus.\n\nBy March 12, Johnson's tone had fundamentally changed. He somberly addressed the nation from the wood-paneled state dining room inside 10 Downing Street to say it was now too late to stop Covid-19 taking hold and claiming many lives. The only hope was to slow its spread and avoid the catastrophe of hospitals being overwhelmed.\n\nThat day marked the moment the government gave up trying to contain coronavirus and instead moved into what officials termed the \"delay\" phase of its response plan. The government also gave up attempts to test the wider population. Speaking alongside Johnson, Whitty said testing in the community was no longer the priority and efforts would instead focus on confirming the infection in patients in hospitals.\n\nThe next day, Vallance provoked an outcry by suggesting the government's aim was to acquire \"some degree of herd immunity,\" in which as much as 60% of the population -- 40 million people -- would become infected. The government now insists herd immunity was never official policy, but on the same day that Vallance made his explosive remark, Hancock's actions suggested otherwise.\n\nThe health secretary dialed into a conference call for Group of Seven countries as governments across the world sought to coordinate their responses and share their experiences. Hancock asked the Italian representative if Italy was also working on a herd immunity plan.\n\nThe Italian representative was blunt: Allowing the virus to run riot would result in thousands of excess deaths and there was way too much uncertainty about the nature of the virus to be sure that such a gamble would even work. Hancock was shocked. The damage was done. Medical experts accused Johnson of failing to act soon enough.\n\nDropping widespread testing ran counter to WHO advice, and experience elsewhere. In South Korea, where contact tracing is in place, the government managed to contain the outbreak to a much lower level than in most European nations. By halting the tracing of people in the U.K. who had contact with patients who had tested positive, those without symptoms were able to keep spreading the virus.\n\nThree days after Hancock's G-7 call came the loudest alarm bell of all. On March 16, a team at Imperial College London, led by researcher Neil Ferguson, warned that Britain could face 250,000 deaths, with the health service inundated, if it did not take more aggressive steps to suppress the virus.\n\nThat day, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as SAGE and whose members and minutes aren't disclosed publicly, met in London to decide on school closures and wider lockdown measures.\n\nJohnson ordered the first phase of social distancing, telling the public to work from home where possible and not to meet friends in pubs and restaurants. The virus was spreading far faster than expected. The U.K. did not have the time it thought it had.\n\nBy now it was clear: the decision announced four days earlier to abandon wide testing left the U.K. with a huge problem.\n\n\"I think we need a big increase in testing, and that is what I am pushing for very hard,\" Vallance told a Parliamentary committee on March 17. Johnson himself conceded the point two days later when he promised an improbable 250,000 tests a day, without setting a target date.\n\nWhy did the U.K. give up on testing in the community, in another move that defied all the mainstream international advice? Vallance told the committee that testing capacity, at 4,000 a day, was \"clearly not going to be enough going forward.\" Efforts needed to be focused on those most seriously ill in hospital.\n\nScientists already believed there were thousands of cases they didn't know about, rendering contact tracing a lost cause.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice,\" a government spokesperson said in response to questions on the handling of the crisis. \"From mid-January, the government's scientific advisory groups started to meet to grip the emerging threat.\"\n\nOn March 27, the virus struck at the top of the British government. Johnson and Hancock both announced that they had tested positive and were self-isolating. Whitty said he too was in quarantine with symptoms, though he had not taken a test.\n\nIn Johnson's case, the infection became severe. A little over a week later, he was in hospital and then taken to intensive care and given oxygen treatment to help him breathe. The disease could have gone either way, he said later, as he thanked the medics who saved his life.\n\nOn April 2, Hancock emerged from self-isolation to find a government in disarray. Without leadership, the cabinet was losing control of the narrative, and the politically toxic question of failures on testing were growing louder.\n\nAccording to one person familiar with the matter, Hancock hatched a plan to get back on the front foot. He would pledge 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. That target unleashed another controversy.\n\nJohnson's team was unhappy, the person said. They warned Hancock's allies against setting such a lofty target, fearing the government would be castigated if it failed to deliver. Hancock pressed ahead. Another person involved questioned this version of events, blaming Johnson's office for setting what at the time looked likely to be an impossible target.\n\nDespite weeks of political pressure and frantic efforts from ministers to make amends for what they conceded was an inadequate testing regime, the picture is slowly improving.\n\nThe U.K. had tested 425,821 people as of April 23, of whom 138,078 came back positive. That's only marginally more in total than Germany has been conducting on a weekly basis. On April 22, 23,560 tests were carried out in Britain, up from the day before. The death toll stood at 18,738, not including those dying in care homes.\n\nHancock said on Thursday testing capacity is on track to reach 100,000 by the end of next week, and he expanded the list of people eligible to get them to all key workers in an effort to match demand to capacity.\n\nThe main challenge has been to increase the capabilities of laboratories to produce them, unlike Germany, which has a decades-old relationship with an established diagnostics industry, according to two government officials. It's \"breakneck speed logistics,\" one of them said.\n\nYet private laboratories were offering to help and getting no response, said McKee at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. \"One problem with testing is Public Health England has insisted on doing it itself,\" he said. \"Lots of veterinary and university laboratories and others in the private sector offered their services but no one got back to them.\"\n\nFor sure, Britain is competing with countries around the world to gather the resources needed and has blamed a shortage of chemical reagents for the slow progress in boosting the test capacity. As part of its effort to ramp up testing in April, the government has engaged laboratories, universities and industry.\n\nOne minister involved in the response conceded that mistakes have been made, though pointed to the pressures of decisions that need to be taken instantly, without sufficient data or time to weigh up options. \"You have to do it on instinct,\" the person said.\n\nBut as the pandemic accelerated, more deficiencies became clear and the government was left scrambling to catch up. Professional medical representatives warned that the crisis exposed a clear dearth of critical care nurses. Ministers heaped praise on former doctors and nurses for coming out of retirement to help.\n\nThe government began trying to order more supplies in late January and February, though many medics on the front line still do not have the equipment they need. The government says it's now delivered more than 1 billion pieces of personal protective clothing, such as face masks and gowns, but acknowledges that distributing it more widely than hospitals has been a logistical challenge.\n\nAusterity since the financial crisis has also taken its toll. The number of doctors, nurses, beds and scanners were all below the European average after a decade when health-care spending rose 1.3% a year in real terms in the U.K. compared with annual growth of 6% in the preceding 13 years.\n\nHancock says Britain now has 12,000 ventilators to help the worst-affected patients breathe, compared with 6,600 before the pandemic struck. Data from health ministries show that other countries were better prepared.\n\nGermany had about 28,000 ICU beds with ventilators prior to the coronavirus crisis, and that's risen to about 30,000. Italy, the first European country to bear the brunt of the pandemic, had about 18,300 ventilators in public and private hospitals combined before the crisis struck.\n\nThe British government initially estimated it needed 30,000 ventilators to deal with the peak of the pandemic, and Johnson held a call with manufacturers on March 16 asking them to make thousands within a month. Responses came from Airbus, Siemens, Nissan, Dyson and Babcock among others.\n\nA month later, a modified machine made by Penlon Ltd., which already worked in the field, received approval after an expedited process, but the volume sought by the government hasn't been delivered.\n\nThe good news is that although the U.K. is forecast to have the highest number of deaths in Europe, the rise in cases is slowing, suggesting projections could be revised downward. Demand for ventilators hasn't exceeded capacity.\n\nYet by the time Johnson imposed the lockdown, on March 23, the U.K. had recorded 335 deaths, fewer than the 463 toll in Italy when it ordered its quarantine, though more than three times the number of fatalities in France (91) and Germany (94) when they told people to stay at home.\n\nThe delay in imposing distancing measures hurt the U.K., along with the fact that London is a busy international metropolis, said Ali Mokdad, a professor at the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\n\"The delay in retrospect was a mistake,\" Mokdad said. \"It's like a deck of cards, and you have to play the cards you are dealt. Yes, England is at a disadvantage being a hub for business and with people coming from everywhere, but then you have to be more aggressive with restrictions.\"\n\nThe government won quick praise for its financial response to help struggling businesses and households as the economy went into freefall. A poll published by YouGov Plc last week revealed that 68% of Britons thought that the leadership was handling the coronavirus outbreak well.\n\nBut with Johnson still largely out of action, recovering at his country retreat, a leaderless government has extended the lockdown with no end in sight. That doesn't stop ministers clashing over the best way forward. Some fear the economic damage will far outweigh the health benefits of prolonging the restrictions.\n\nThe scientists also are well aware their own judgments are under the microscope. Johnson and his team have insisted the government is following all scientific advice -- but in recent days the experts themselves have been at pains to point out that it is the politicians who are responsible for taking all the final decisions.\n\nOne minister, who declined to be identified when discussing internal politics, said the lockdown had worked too well for the health of the economy. \"The problem is that compliance with the rules has been too much,\" the minister said. \"We didn't say 'don't work.' We said 'stay home, but work away from home if you can't work at home.'\"\n\nHaving been attacked for acting too late, Johnson himself is now reluctant to ease the social distancing measures, fearing that moving too soon could unleash a devastating second wave that would overwhelm the NHS. Whether guided by the science or not, the political risk of such a second peak might prove too great.\n\nIn London, emergency doctor Aw-Yong said the worst of the outbreak looked \"much like a war zone.\" He saw five or six Covid-19 deaths a day on his shift. \"They can't see their relatives. They can't speak to anybody. That must be such a horrible way to die.\"",

Taiwan, which started containment measures on Dec. 31, has seen just six deaths despite its proximity to China.\n\nThat quick reaction was prompted by an internet bulletin-board post read earlier that morning by Philip Lo, a senior government health official. Because of frequent cross-strait exchanges in areas such as trade, investment and employment, Taiwan excels at monitoring Chinese government and society through news organizations, blogs and social media. The WeChat and Weibo platforms proved useful in tracking an outbreak of pneumonic plague last year, said Lo, deputy director-general at the Centers for Disease Control.\n\n\"Taiwan is a sentinel for China's epidemic,\" he said. \"We can send an alarm to the world.\"\n\nThe rapid response is credited with minimizing Taiwan's infections, even with China sitting less than 100 miles away. As of Thursday, the island of about 24 million people had 440 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with six deaths, among the lowest totals in the world.\n\nBy comparison, Australia, with a similar-sized population, reported 6,895 confirmed cases and 97 deaths. Singapore, with only about 6 million people, has 20,000-plus cases and 20 deaths.\n\n\"We treated the virus as a serious epidemic from day one,\" Lo said. \"We didn't wait till it broke out to take action.\"\n\nAccording to Lo, he rang the alarm bell after waking up at 5:30 a.m. on New Year's Eve and going online to check social media. His Line Corp. contacts passed around an entry from PTT, Taiwan's version of Reddit Inc., that summarized text messages and social-media posts from medical professionals in China warning about a new and unknown strain of pneumonia.\n\nOne of the summaries was written by Li Wenliang, a Chinese doctor later sanctioned by the government for being a whistle-blower about the outbreak. He eventually died from Covid-19 and became somewhat of a folk hero on Chinese social media.\n\nAbout three hours after Lo read that post, his agency sent an email to its counterpart in Beijing asking for details, and that afternoon Wuhan's health committee issued a press release saying about 27 people were infected with an unknown virus.\n\nTaiwanese health officials also emailed the World Health Organization, telling it that some Chinese patients had been isolated for treatment -- a clear signal, in Taipei's view, that this new infection was transmittable from person to person.\n\nHistory motivates Taiwan's vigilance. The 2003 outbreak of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, severely hit the island and gave it the third-most infections in the world.\n\nThat made Taiwan strengthen its preparation for the next epidemic, including setting up an infectious-disease prevention network and holding annual drills with hospitals.\n\n\"Taiwan has prepared for the epidemic battle for 17 years,\" Lo said.\n\nBecause people infected by Covid-19 can be asymptomatic, the virus poses a greater challenge than SARS, said Chuang Yin-ching, a regional commander in the Infectious Diseases Prevention and Treatment Network. The island uses technology to trace suspected cases and deploys measures such as quarantine hotels and cabs. It also maintains a stockpile of face masks, medical officers and lab capacity to handle any outbreaks.\n\nTaiwan has a \"well-trained army against the virus,\" Chuang said.\n\nAfter Lo's agency emailed Beijing and the WHO, he checked the island's air traffic with Wuhan and discovered there were 12 direct flights a week. Officials started testing arrivals from the city that evening, and passengers with fever symptoms immediately were hospitalized.\n\nTaiwan health officials then flew to Wuhan on Jan. 12 -- more than a week before the first WHO delegation arrived -- for a briefing from colleagues at China's disease control agency. The Chinese officials reported 41 confirmed cases, of which 28 were related to an outdoor market selling live animals. The other 13 were not -- a marker of human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"These signs alerted us that we should be cautious about the situation in China,\" Chuang said. \"Someone asked me if we can downgrade the prevention measures such as temperature checks at the airport gate, and I said, 'No, we should upgrade it.'\"\n\nAt that time, Wuhan still was an open city full of energy, and just a few people wore face masks at the airport, he said.\n\nBy Jan. 20, Taiwan's CDC set up an emergency command center to monitor regional outbreaks, and the island confirmed its first imported infection the next day. With the Lunar New Year about to start, Taiwan suspended all direct flights with Wuhan.\n\nIt then banned entry for all Chinese residents starting in early February, making it among the first places globally to do so.\n\nThe WHO didn't declare the outbreak a global emergency until Jan. 31 after maintaining it was a local crisis. Even with that declaration, it didn't recommend limits on travel and trade. Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu has criticized the WHO's handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"If we had followed guidance from the WHO, we would have fallen behind,\" Lo said. \"We wanted to be on top of the virus's development right from the beginning.\"",

        "body": "Our lives and our societies have been getting far too complex. What better time to push the reset button than now?\n\nOnly a few months into the Covid-19 pandemic, its disruption of our lives might still seem to be no more than a giant pause -- global in scale and unprecedented, yes, but nonetheless temporary. But what if, as some experts reckon, this pause lasts years? What if there's no return to normality even when it's over? Maybe this pandemic isn't an interlude, but a reset.\n\nA reset to what? My guess is that it'll amount to a great simplification. A simplification of our lives, priorities, schedules, memberships, finances, relationships and maybe even world views. But also a simplification of our societies. That's because one of the side effects of Covid-19 is to expose the accumulation over decades -- at least in the wealthy West -- of untenable complexity in the individual, political and economic spheres of life.\n\nIn the individual context, the symptoms of complexity have been hiding in plain sight for years. One word for it is clutter. During that age of innocence that ended around January 2020, it was just too easy to buy stuff, and too hard not to. So things were piling up faster than we could organize, store or dispose of them, and certainly faster than we could enjoy them.\n\nThe proof includes the stunning success of somebody like Marie Kondo, a Japanese lifestyle guru who promises to help unclutter your home. Her approach, she says, is inspired by Shintoism, for who understands simplicity better than the people who also brought you Zen? In practice, Kondo wants you to look at all your stuff and keep asking: \"Does it spark joy?\" Usually, the answer is no, and out it goes.\n\nThe same clutter, until recently, extended to the rest of our middle-class lives. It was becoming hard to manage our calendars and travel, whether for trips overseas or around town. But we put up with the hassles because we were more afraid of missing out on opportunities of all kinds: professional, romantic or social. Double- and triple-booked, those of us fortunate enough to have good incomes have stressed over trade-offs between a gallery opening, a dinner party, a lecture or the gym.\n\nSomething similar was happening in the societies of rich countries. We kept adding layers of complication: new bureaucracies, legislation, divisions of labor, tax loopholes, and so forth. The European Union is one example, but the U.S. is arguably worse. According to one influential thesis proposed in 2013, America has become a \"kludgeocracy.\"\n\n\"Kludge\" is a term from the software world for a clumsy patch that doesn't solve the bigger issue, thereby creating even more complexity and future problems. This is easily observed in America's contemporary governance, or in its systems of health care, education and taxation. Ask, for example, any new visitor to the U.S. what the following gibberish could be about: 401(k), IRA, Roth IRA, Keogh? Nobody would guess it has something to do with retirement saving.\n\nSuch byzantine decay is in fact a recurring historical phenomenon, as described in 1988 by the American anthropologist Joseph Tainter in his book \"The Collapse of Complex Societies.\" By his count, complexity and an inability to simplify brought down some two dozen civilizations, from the Mycenaean and Minoan to the Hittite and Mayan, as well as several Chinese dynasties and the Western Roman Empire.\n\nCollapse isn't necessarily as scary as it sounds, by the way. It's merely a society's rapid and involuntary simplification. Yes, some collapses have segued into \"dark ages,\" but they needn't have. The alternative is to embrace simplification and call it innovation, if that helps.\n\nThanks to Covid-19, we may now be at such a turning point. As a first sign of rapid simplification, global supply chains are dissolving, and often being reassembled in much more rudimentary ways. Simplification may also cause upheaval in our health care, tax and welfare systems, as it becomes clear that those who rely most on medical or financial help cannot even navigate the complexities of getting it. In some countries, the reforms may come through populist revolt; the better way is to do it deliberately and thoughtfully.\n\nCloser to home, many of us have already begun to simplify. If we used to fear missing out, now there's little to miss out on, which is the best excuse for staying home with the family. Frivolous connections are being pruned, while meaningful ones are revived and cultivated during \"happy hours\" on Zoom. Prodigal and exotic travel is out, so nobody feels bad about \"staycations.\" In everything from diet to medicine and fashion, \"simple is the new black.\"\n\nWhat many of us are realizing in this pandemic is that we need much less than we thought we wanted only a few months ago. Does it spark joy? If not, out. We may one day look back at Covid-19 with gratitude.",

        "body": "Recovery time is key to innovation and output, says digital anthropologist Rahaf Harfoush.\n\nThere's burnout, and then there's pandemic-induced burnout. For many workers, the professional environment has changed radically since Covid-19 disrupted life -- but the intensity of their jobs hasn't. Juggling full-time responsibilities, family life, and the stress of confinement makes the risk of burnout greater than ever.\n\nDigital anthropologist and author Rahaf Harfoush, whose book Hustle & Float: Reclaim Your Creativity and Thrive in a World Obsessed With Work investigated the epidemic of burnout, says solutions must go beyond treating symptoms such as exhaustion and anxiety. Instead of merely prescribing rest, exercise, and healthful eating, she says it's time to deconstruct the underlying cultural sources of burnout and do something radical: Work less. Here, she explains how.\n\nSince the Industrial Revolution, the dominant philosophy of work has centered around productivity as the only metric that's important for success. As work culture developed, we've internalized the idea that any time that isn't spent doing something is wasted time. Worse, we've been made to believe that if we aren't struggling and hustling, we don't deserve our success. And now, our relationship to work has become tied to our sense of self and self-worth. But this ideology runs counter to scientific research that says that in order for knowledge workers to do their best work, they need space and unstructured time.\n\nThe structure upon which we've built our work expectations has been hurting us for a long time. When you combine our culture of chronic overwork with the distraction inherent to technology and social media, at a time when people are forced to stay at home, you have a recipe for amplified anxiety and shame. This puts people on a fast-track to burnout.\n\nWe have to build a system of work that reflects how our brains actually function and what our creativity needs. That begins with incorporating recovery into the process of work. You can't be innovative if you're not creative, and you can't be creative if you're stressed, exhausted, distracted, or sleep-deprived. Resting doesn't mean diverting from your goals but rather making it possible to achieve them. I'm not saying don't hustle. I'm saying, whether it's a pandemic or not, it's crucial to recover hard when you play hard.\n\nThis isn't a normal time, so it shouldn't be treated as normal work-from-home time. The lines between home and work, personal and professional, are blurred with an additional pressure to be productive since the thinking is that we all suddenly have more available time. This isn't the case, and furthermore, working nonstop simply doesn't work. We have turned busyness into a coping mechanism. Now, people are applying that to their personal time while sheltering at home, filling it with back-to-back Zoom calls, baking, workouts, and more activity. It's important to use some of this time to process our emotions and reflect on the discomfort from all this productivity propaganda. Operating as usual will not only negatively affect your work but could compromise your health.\n\nThere are steps we can all take. For example, take 30 minutes to eat lunch without stimulation: no email, no Slack, no distraction. You can even start with 15 minutes! It's up to us to carve out periods of time to give our cognitive capabilities the chance to unwind. Then consider managing up: Workers can be explicit in asking for expectations from their managers. Move from unspoken rules to written guidelines so everyone understands how to navigate this period of working from home.\n\nStart by paying attention to discomfort. If you're feeling restless, anxious, or guilty, sit with it and start to dig deep to understand what's behind it. We have to give ourselves the time to shift from a more-is-better approach to internalizing the idea that recovery is as valuable as the work. No one can do that for us. Put recovery time in your calendar and stick to it. If you don't, force yourself to write down why you didn't. The real exercise in moving past work devotion and burnout is in understanding why we're not giving ourselves that time. It isn't due to a lack of knowledge.\n\nI would also suggest timing your tasks to understand how much time you really need. This will allow you to make realistic to-do lists and avoid feeling overwhelmed. Remember: We are constrained by time, and yet we overestimate our self-expectations constantly. This is something that can be fixed.\n\nIf you're a high performer and recovery isn't an intentional and strategic part of your time and workflow, you're only damaging your output in the long run.",

        "body": "Britain needs people to trust its contract-tracing app for it to be effective.\n\nThe most important trait of any Covid-19 contact-tracing app is that people actually use it. Without widespread adoption, we may all be locked down for a lot longer.\n\nJust how widespread? In the U.K., at least 80% of smartphone users, covering 56% of the total population, will need to use the app to be effective in tracing contacts with those infected to control the novel coronavirus's spread, according to an April report led by Oxford University's Nuffield Department of Medicine. Winning popular trust has to be the priority.\n\nUnfortunately, Britain's National Health Service seems to have gotten off on the wrong foot with the solution it started trialing on the Isle of Wight, off England's southern coast, on Tuesday. The app has caused concern about the centralized collection of information. Even though it's anonymized, and less specific than the location data that many happily share with Google Maps or running apps such as Strava (the NHS app just asks you to identify your district), the fact it's a central repository of health data, with little clarity on who exactly holds it and for how long, has people in a tizzy.\n\nDon't get me wrong. The app appears thoughtful, seeming to keep user anonymity and privacy in mind, while providing health authorities with useful data for the epidemiological models developed to manage the pandemic in the U.K. But all of that becomes moot if people don't use it. Public opinion is fickle, and if people perceive this as a tool for government monitoring, then adoption will suffer. There are also questions about how it will interact with other nations' approaches, affecting the prospects for international travel.\n\nHere's how it works: Once someone reports symptoms that suggest they have the virus, their phone will share anonymized data about who they've been in contact with and for how long (it uses smartphones' Bluetooth chips to detect whether people have been within six feet of each other for 15 minutes) with a central server operated by the NHS. Those contacts are then alerted by the server, and told to self-isolate. Doing it this way might help the NHS understand how many people the infected have crossed paths with and identify trends, making it easier to predict any new flareup. By identifying those with symptoms, rather than simply those who have tested positive, it's trying to get ahead of the infection curve.\n\nI trust the NHS to use my data, which will be anonymized, responsibly. But it's possible not enough other people will. An April survey of potential app users in the U.K. suggested that 74% would be likely to download a contact-tracing app, short of the 80% necessary.\n\nBeyond the privacy concerns, however, there's a technological weakness that may be more significant in denting the app's efficacy. The NHS solution seems to require that when two people are in close proximity with each other, at least one of the them has to either have the app open, or to have opened it in the past few minutes. If that's not the case, it won't log the contact. A spokeswoman for the health agency told the BBC last month it was satisfied that the solution worked \"sufficiently well.\" We'll soon know: The Isle of Wight trial ought to reveal any shortcomings.\n\nIt's reassuring that there's an alternative solution available developed by privacy advocates as well as Apple Inc. and Google, who between them make the operating system for almost every new smartphone on the planet. It takes a decentralized approach. Rather than passing data up to a central server, the Apple-Google app broadcasts the unique anonymized identifiers of those who have the virus to the other phones using the app. Those smartphones then tally the identifiers against the list of handsets with which they have crossed paths in the past 14 days, and alert the user. The other advantage of the tech giants' approach is that phones will always be able to exchange identifiers in the background via Bluetooth.\n\nThat's the method already being pursued elsewhere, including in Austria, Switzerland and Germany. Germany is notable because its approach underwent a radical reversal: It had initially favored a centralized model, then changed course after public uproar.\n\nI understand why the NHS is, like France, pursuing the centralized approach. More data will help it manage the crisis better. I sincerely hope it works, and it can convince people to stomach their privacy concerns. But if it doesn't, and they don't, then Britain's health service needs to be prepared to pivot, and quickly, before public opinion is poisoned against any app.",

        "body": "Johnson's aide was more than a neutral observer, people say King: 'Dangerous' for an aide to filter science advice to PM\n\nBoris Johnson's most powerful political aide pressed the U.K.'s independent scientific advisers to recommend lockdown measures in an effort to stop the spread of coronavirus, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe government has confirmed that Dominic Cummings was an observer at some meetings of its Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), the secretive body which gives specialized advice to ministers on responding to the pandemic.\n\nAccording to two people involved, Cummings played far more than a bystander's role at a crucial SAGE meeting on March 18, as the panel discussed social distancing options to tackle the Covid-19 outbreak.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity because the meetings are private, the people said Cummings asked why a lockdown was not being imposed sooner, swayed the discussion toward faster action, and made clear he thought pubs and restaurants should be closed within two days. They then were.\n\nThe prime minister's office denied that political advisers influenced the experts on the SAGE committee and said it was appropriate for aides to sit in on meetings and to ask questions. The two people who took part in the meeting said Cummings's actions went further than simply asking for information.\n\nThe suggestion that Cummings influenced the group's lockdown decisions is likely to cast doubt on the government's assurances that it has simply followed scientific advice throughout the crisis. As the death toll continues to rise, that could put Johnson in a more difficult position as he seeks to deflect criticism of the government's response.\n\nThe Week Coronavirus Got Away From Boris Johnson's Government\n\nCummings has been a hugely controversial figure at the heart of the government ever since he was appointed to be Johnson's chief adviser last July.\n\nThe pair worked closely on the pro-Brexit campaign, which Cummings masterminded, and then set about continuing their political revolution in government -- ripping up establishment rules and purging the Conservative Party of Johnson's critics after he became prime minister last year.\n\nHis role in shaping the U.K.'s much-criticized Covid-19 strategy has been less clear. Johnson's office vigorously denied claims made in a British newspaper that Cummings originally wanted a policy of so-called herd immunity, even if it meant some older people would die. On March 30, it emerged that Cummings -- like his boss Johnson -- was in isolation with coronavirus symptoms.\n\nTop U.K. Aide Cummings Self-Isolates With Coronavirus Symptoms\n\nThe Guardian revealed on Friday that Cummings had attended meetings of the scientific advisory panel, known as SAGE, and the Observer newspaper on Sunday said he'd been an active participant in discussions.\n\nBut the disclosure that he was so vocal in the debate over lockdown raises questions about his influence on the group's ultimate recommendations.\n\nIt is \"quite possible\" that interventions from the prime minister's most senior aide swayed discussions, said former U.K. chief scientific adviser David King. \"There is a herd instinct in all of us - we call it groupthink,\" King, who served during Tony Blair's premiership from 2000 to 2007, said in an interview. \"It is possible that a group is influenced by a particularly influential person.\"\n\nAt the March 18 meeting, Cummings asked probing questions such as why the government should wait until the following week to impose a lockdown rather than doing so earlier, according to one of the people. He also said the public should not be allowed to leave work on March 20 and go to the pub afterward. The government ultimately told pubs and clubs to close on that day, before imposing a fuller lockdown that shuttered most shops on March 23.\n\nOne attendee at the meeting described feeling uncomfortable that the panel with Cummings's input was taking more of a decision-making approach than simply drawing up options and giving advice to ministers. The attendee added, however, that it was also a relief that Cummings had pushed for a lockdown because there were concerns that politicians had not fully understood how serious the coronavirus emergency had become.\n\nAccording to one person, Cummings directly asked the group at one point: \"What is the Prime Minister going to say?\" That was a sign of how far the panel had moved from drawing up advice to taking a policy decision, something that should not happen in a meeting of scientific advisers, the person said.\n\nWith the government coming under criticism in the U.K. for not locking down earlier, the accounts suggest Johnson's most senior adviser understood the severity of the crisis and was pressing for action to be taken more quickly. Some on the panel clearly agreed. The advisers were heading toward recommending a lockdown soon anyway, one of the people said.\n\nBut the intervention from Cummings shifted the dynamic in favor of tightening the restrictions more quickly, one person said, adding: \"He clearly wasn't an observer.\"\n\nJohnson's office said Cummings was not a member of the SAGE committee. \"SAGE provide independent scientific advice to government. No political advisers influence this advice,\" a spokesperson for the prime minister's office said an emailed statement. \"The scientists who contribute to SAGE are among the most eminent in their fields. It is completely wrong to imply their advice is in any way not impartial.\"\n\nGovernment officials attend or dial in to SAGE meetings \"to listen to its discussions and occasionally ask questions which is essential at a time the government is dealing with a global pandemic,\" the Downing Street spokesperson said.\n\nThe disclosure of Cummings's role in SAGE meeting will add to calls for the body to be more transparent. The committee's membership has not been officially revealed.\n\nKing, the former government chief scientist, said he had convened several emergency committees during his tenure to deal with crises including Avian Flu, SARS, Scrapie in sheep and foot-and-mouth disease. No political special advisers -- known in Westminster as \"spads\" -- ever sat in on them, he said.\n\n\"What I was very keen to establish was the science advice has to be apolitical,\" said King. \"I also don't like the idea that a spad could report independently of me back to a minister or the prime minister what their understanding - as a non-scientist - of a scientific discussion was. That is a dangerous practice.\"",

        "body": "Want to help open up the economy? Want to stick it to the World Health Organization? Wear a mask!\n\nFace masks are at risk of becoming a victim of America's culture wars, with a few conservative activists and commentators linking their use to cowardice, civil-rights violations and that worst of scourges, \"the safetyism ideology that has jumped from the university to the public sphere.\" I do not wish to exaggerate the strength of this anti-mask movement, which seems to consist mainly of a few cranks in search of clicks (as well as a few unbalanced people with guns), but there does seem to be broader incidence of mask-apathy and mask-embarrassment that such rhetoric risks hardening into outright opposition.\n\nThis makes me sad, not just because there's a reasonable chance that widespread mask-wearing could save lots of lives by slowing the spread of Covid-19, but because courageous, anti-authoritarian freedom-lovers ought by all rights to be big mask fans.\n\nThe rise of face masks as a response to the pandemic has been a largely grass-roots phenomenon, conceived in opposition to the recommendations of health authorities such as the U.S. surgeon general and the World Health Organization -- which still advises against their widespread use. Yes, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention came around to endorsing masks in April, and some states have recently begun requiring them in stores and other public indoor spaces. I get that such decrees rub some people the wrong way, and that mask-nannying by the news media does, too. But mask requirements are an awful lot less freedom-restricting than orders to stay at home or keep all \"nonessential\" businesses shuttered, and letting one's views be defined by opposition to anything the mainstream media says is not free thought. Wearing masks appears to be the simplest way to get much of normal life (and normal economic activity) back while we're still figuring out how exactly to control and maybe defeat Covid-19 by less-primitive means. What's not to like about that?\n\nThe evidence that masks can play this role is, I'll admit, more suggestive than conclusive. But there does seem to be more of it piling up every day. Public health officials in the West had discouraged widespread mask-wearing because of fears that (1) supplies for health-care workers would run out and (2) wearers might assume the masks made them invulnerable, leading them to take unwise risks. Early media coverage generally parroted this anti-mask line. But a wide variety of people not in positions of authority and not in the media began pointing out on places like Reddit and Twitter that the success of several mask-happy East Asian countries in combating the coronavirus, as well as a number of earlier studies focused on other respiratory illnesses such as influenza, seemed to indicate that while masks are no foolproof defense against Covid-19, they can slow its spread. A more recent study has found that countries where mask-wearing is widespread have so far experienced much-slower Covid-19 case growth than those where it is not.\n\nI'm referring here not to the N95 respirators that can filter out most (if not all) viruses but can be uncomfortable to wear and hard to find, but to simple procedural or surgical masks, as well as homemade cloth masks and even bandannas. A virus particle can definitely get through such masks under the right (wrong) circumstances, but Covid-19 seems to be transmitted mainly by infected people expelling virus-containing droplets while coughing, eating, talking or singing, and others breathing in those droplets. Any cover over the mouth and nose, even a quite imperfect and primitive one, will impede such transmission. The prevailing belief is that masks are more effective at keeping infected wearers from spreading their germs than at protecting non-infected wearers (which kind of negates the argument that mask wearing is cowardly), but their most important role is as barriers placed in the path of the virus that likely reduce its reproduction number and thus its spread. Because Covid-19 can become contagious before a person develops any symptoms, and it's still not entirely clear how long people who get the disease remain contagious, or whether it can recur, the most logical approach is for everybody to wear them.\n\nIn March and April, this would have been hard to do in the U.S. because face masks were in short supply. I even bought a sewing machine in late March and taught myself how to use it so I could make a few masks out of old dress shirts for me and my family. This is no longer necessary. Every major professional sports franchise in the U.S. is now willing to sell you a team-logo cloth mask. Etsy is overflowing with cloth masks, and lots of clothing companies that buy ads in my Instagram feed are selling them as well. President Donald Trump's re-election campaign will apparently have them on offer soon. You can also get disposable nonwoven three-ply surgical-style masks, which are generally more effective than the cloth ones if less fun, online and in some stores again.\n\nWhere I live in New York City pretty much all of us now wear some kind of face coverings outside of our apartments, even in situations where they serve no real purpose, such as walking the dog in nearly empty Riverside Park at 7 a.m. on a Sunday. In much of the rest of the country, from what I hear, masks are still rare even in the grocery store. I'd chalk up some of that difference to peer pressure, some to rational risk assessment: Covid-19 was running rampant in New York until recently, with more than 20% of the population likely infected already. In most of the rest of the U.S., that share appears to be well below 5%.\n\nStill, as state restrictions ease and people start venturing out again, masks represent a cheap, easy means of keeping that infection rate from rising as much as it otherwise might. They're a way to make new flare-ups of the disease less likely, and renewed lockdowns unnecessary. They're the ultimate pro-freedom, pro-life fashion accessory.",

        "body": "John Tyson, the billionaire whose family business reigns as the largest meat processor in the U.S., took out ads in national newspapers to complain about a \"breaking\" food supply chain.\n\nNo one would argue that supplies aren't an issue right now. Even Donald Trump is invoking the Defense Production Act to secure meat production. But the roots of this problem go back to decades of consolidation that Tyson's own company helped lead. Tyson Foods Inc. and its top two rivals -- JBS SA and Cargill Inc. -- control today about two-thirds of America's beef, and the large bulk of it gets processed in a few dozen giant plants. Pork and chicken are similarly dominated.\n\nWhile Tyson pointed out that the pandemic has affected businesses of all sizes, the producers, which also include Smithfield Foods Inc., have such a stranglehold on output that it leaves the supply chain with few remedies when even just a handful plants are down. There have been about 12 closures at U.S. slaughter plants this month because of coronavirus outbreaks among employees who are jammed together on processing lines.\n\nThat's wiped out roughly 25% of pork-processing capacity and 10% for beef -- enough for analysts to say that the country was weeks away from shortfalls. Meat prices are already surging.\n\n\"This is 100% a symptom of consolidation,\" said Christopher Leonard, author of \"The Meat Racket,\" which examines the protein industry. \"We don't have a crisis of supply right now. We have a crisis in processing. And the virus is exposing the profound fragility that comes with this kind of consolidation.\"\n\nIn his plea to the public, Tyson, the company's chairman, suggested meat plants should keep running, despite the outbreaks. Late Tuesday, Trump signed an order for the facilities to stay open amid the pandemic, drawing sharp criticism from unions and activists who want to protect workers that find it extremely difficult to practice social distancing in the cramped factories.\n\n\"This pandemic has affected businesses across our nation, in every sector of the economy, regardless of size, service, location, or ownership,\" Tyson said in emailed response to questions from Bloomberg. \"It's also affected thousands of farmers and ranchers, whose continued viability is extremely important to us.\"\n\n\"The safety of our team members is our top priority,\" Tyson said. \"We've been screening worker temperatures, requiring protective face coverings and conducting additional cleaning and sanitizing.\" The company is \"also implementing social distancing measures, such as installing workstation dividers and providing more breakroom space.\"\n\nSmithfield and JBS didn't respond to requests for comment on industry consolidation. Cargill declined to comment.\n\nGiven the high concentration of meat and poultry processors in a relatively small number of facilities, the closure of any plant can disrupt the food supply, according to a White House statement on Trump's order. The shutdown of a single large beef processing plant can result in the loss of more than 10 million servings of beef in a single day, according to a statement from the White House.\n\nTwo U.S. senators are asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate consolidation in American meatpacking and processing for any anticompetitive behavior resulting from concentration. Senators Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin and Josh Hawley of Missouri said that the high concentration has \"undermined the stability of America's meat supply and become an issue of national security,\" according to a copy of the letter sent to the FTC on Wednesday and seen by Bloomberg.\n\nTrump Orders Meat Plants to Stay Open in Move Slammed by Union\n\nThere's a reason meat is so cheap in America compared with the rest of the world. A big part of that is the rapid consolidation that's allowed meatpackers to operate on huge economies of scale and run lines at lightning speeds that continue to increase.\n\nThe number of slaughtering plants has plummeted about 70% since 1967, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. A huge chunk of that consolidation came in just the past few decades. In a 2019 report, Tyson lists an acquisition or a consolidation for almost every year of operation starting from 2001, though some of those deals were in packaged food and sometimes made outside the U.S.\n\nIn Europe, it's a different story. The top 15 companies account for less than a third of the European Union's meat production, and the region has seen far fewer disruptions to supply.\n\nIn normal times, the U.S. concentration is touted as a hallmark of a successful industry that's become extremely efficient at pumping out huge amounts of affordable meat -- something that's reaped rewards for the companies and investors alike. Tyson clocks in annual net income of about $2 billion and its shares have surged about 60% in the last five years, bringing its market value to about $23 billion.\n\nBut in the virus era, the vastness of these companies is a crucial point of vulnerability for U.S. food supply.\n\nHuge plants are responsible for processing thousands of animals per day. Employees are jammed into elbow-to-elbow processing lines. And low-paying jobs also mean workers face tough living conditions at home, where multiple families are sometimes sharing the same dwellings.\n\n\"We work to ensure our team members receive fair compensation,\" Tyson said. \"We provide our team members and families with affordable health, life, dental, vision and prescription drug benefits.\"\n\nAdvocacy groups like Food and Water Watch have long called for a break in the concentration, and they say the pandemic makes that more important.\n\n\"The highly consolidated, industrial food system is in fact less resilient than the regional, diversified systems it replaced,\" Amanda Claire Starbuck, a senior food researcher at Food and Water Watch, said in a posting on its website. \"We need smaller, more diverse crop-and-livestock systems and regional food hubs.\"\n\nBut it's hard to say if Americans would actually go for that, since it would also undoubtedly bring an increase in meat prices.\n\n\"There's a moral obligation to bring low-cost food to American consumers as not everyone can afford to buy grass-fed beef or antibiotic-free pork,\" said Steve Meyer, an economist at Iowa-based Kerns and Associates.\n\n\"They're not that way by accident, and they're not that way by conspiracy,\" he said of the consolidated meat companies. \"Americans really like their food, but they want to buy it for as little as they can.\"\n\nPractically every food company has announced increased measures to protect employees, including meat giants like Tyson, Smithfield and Cargill. Companies are enforcing hand washing and spraying down plants and break rooms. Shifts are staggered and lunch breaks are taken alone.\n\nStill, it's been hard to stop the spread of the disease in massive plants where hundreds of employees show up for each shift. Twenty workers in U.S. meatpacking and food-processing plants have died and at least 6,500 have been directly impacted by the coronavirus, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, America's largest private-sector union.\n\nPlants that remain open are also facing a worker crunch as employees call in sick and deal with child-care issues and the other complexities the virus has unleashed. Meat processing plants require a lot of labor to disassemble, trim and de-bone carcasses.\n\nWhile some companies have stepped up hiring, it's not easy to find workers, even with rising unemployment. The industry has struggled with a reputation of difficult conditions since the days of Upton Sinclair, the American author who wrote of abuses in his 1906 novel, \"The Jungle.\" Producers often rely heavily on immigrant workers to fill jobs that Americans shun.\n\nThe problem of consolidation isn't limited to the U.S. Nearly all the beef sold in Canadian grocery stores and exported from the country comes from just three meatpacking plants. A halt at one of those facilities is forcing McDonald's Corp's Canadian unit to start importing.\n\n\"I do expect for the U.S. and Canadian governments to look very closely at how things are done today and how we need to do it differently to protect the national interest, so if and when such an event happens again, we're better prepared for it,\" said Kevin Kenny, chief operating officer of Decernis, an expert in global food safety and supply chains.",

Referrals for people with suspected cancers from doctors fell 76%, while chemotherapy appointments fell 60% compared with pre-pandemic levels.\n\n\"The overall impact of the COVID-19 emergency on deaths in cancer patients could be substantial,\" Professor Harry Hemingway said in the report. \"There are many factors operating here including rapid changes to diagnosis and treatment protocols, social distancing measures, changes in people's behavior in seeking medical attention and the economic impact of COVID-19, as well as deaths due to COVID-19 infection.\"\n\nThis week, the country's health service said it will restart cancer care and mental health services that were sidelined to stop hospitals being overwhelmed by the pandemic.",

        "body": "The U.K. extended the availability of coronavirus testing to anyone over five years old showing symptoms as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the country is ready to start a national tracing program to control the disease.\n\nThe national launch of a contact-tracing mobile phone app has been delayed, in a setback to the tracing effort, but some 21,000 contact tracers have been recruited, including 7,500 health-care professionals who will give clinical advice to call handlers, the health secretary said.\n\n\"We now have the people in place,\" Hancock told Parliament on Wednesday. \"We have the elements we need to roll our our national trace and test service.\"\n\nA major expansion of the U.K.'s testing and tracing program is a key feature of its strategy to relax the virus lockdown, as the government seeks to emulate countries like South Korea and Germany in identifying where the virus is spreading so it can impose targeted restrictions. Virus tests were previously only available to certain groups of people, such as workers deemed 'essential' and the over-65s.\n\nA mobile phone app, which would form a crucial part of the tracing program, was supposed to be ready in mid-May. It is now planned to be released nationally within \"weeks,\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman James Slack told reporters on Monday.\n\n\"It remains our aim to roll out the app in the coming weeks,\" Slack said, without giving a specific reason for the delay. \"It is possible to do track and trace work separately to the app.\"\n\nWhy the U.K. Virus App Could Be Another Pandemic Misstep\n\nThe app, which is still being tested on the Isle of Wight, informs users whether they've come into close contact with someone who may have had the virus. Hancock previously said it would be a key component of the U.K.'s strategy to relax lockdown measures. If the app is effective and widely used in the population, it would allow the government to spot flare-ups of the disease and better control its spread, he said.\n\n\"The app is successfully being piloted and we are rolling out that system,\" Hancock said on Monday.",

Abdominal pain, gastrointestinal problems and cardiac inflammation -- consistent with toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease -- are among the symptoms appearing, according to the NHS alert.\n\nThere is growing concern that a \"SARS-CoV-2 related inflammatory syndrome\" may be emerging in children or that there may be another \"as-yet unidentified infectious pathogen,\" the NHS notice said. \"Over the last three weeks there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the U.K.\"\n\nSimon Kenny, NHS national clinical director for children and young people, said in a statement in response to media inquiries that these kinds of diseases are rare and guidance for parents is unchanged.\n\n\"Thankfully Kawasaki-like diseases are very rare, as currently are serious complications in children related to Covid-19, but it is important that clinicians are made aware of any potential emerging links so that they are able to give children and young people the right care fast,\" said Kenny.",

        "body": "U.S. coronavirus cases recorded the slowest daily increase for the month of April. U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Britain is past the peak of the outbreak. Spain recorded steep declines in new cases and Germany is set to extend restrictions.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand are considering a mutual reopening of their economies once the outbreak is under control, while Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong warned things won't ever return to the way they were pre-pandemic, and Japan's prime minister suggested an emergency status will be extended.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is moving at \"lightning speed\" to review data on Gilead Sciences' experimental treatment remdesivir. Gilead has more than 50,000 courses of the therapy ready to ship as soon as it's authorized for emergency use.\n\nSubscribe to a daily update on the virus from Bloomberg's Prognosis team here. Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus.\n\nLas Vegas casinos and gaming establishments across Nevada could be allowed to reopen two or three weeks after the start of the first phase of the state's recovery plan, if virus trends continue in the right direction, according to Governor Steve Sisolak.\n\nSisolak said he was looking for 14 days of improving trends in new cases, hospitalizations and other criteria before Nevadans could start the first phase of returning to work. That period would include small businesses, and he was aiming for phase one to begin on May 15 or sooner.\n\nSouth Korea's exports plunged the most since the 2009 global financial crisis as the spread of the coronavirus slammed world trade. Shipments plummeted 24.3% in April from a year earlier, the trade ministry said Friday.\n\nAustralia's house-price growth slowed in April and sales plunged, after home inspections and public auctions were prohibited as part of a sweeping economic lockdown to combat coronavirus. House values in the combined state and territory capitals rose 0.2%, versus 0.7% in March, according to CoreLogic Inc. data. Sales plunged about 40%.\n\nTokyo inflation plunged, returning to negative territory for the first time since 2017 as collapsing oil prices and the coronavirus dealt heavy blows to the Bank of Japan's long fight against deflation. Consumer prices in the capital excluding fresh food, a leading indicator of national trends, fell 0.1% in April from a year earlier, data from the ministry of internal affairs showed.\n\nAmgen Inc. will investigate the psoriasis drug Otezla as a potential therapy to treat Covid-19, the company announced during its first-quarter earnings.\n\nIn Covid-19 patients with extreme symptoms, it's believed that an overactive immune system may be at least partially to blame; Otezla is being investigated to treat immune system-related inflammatory diseases beyond psoriasis. Researchers are exploring if drugs that help temper the immune response may help to curb the severity of the illness.\n\nAmgen picked up the psoriasis drug Otezla in November from Celgene Corp. ahead of the company's sale to Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. Amgen plans to begin clinical trials of the drug as a potential treatment for adults with Covid-19 within weeks.\n\nCoronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 1.2% from the day before to 1.04 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That was below the average daily increase of 3% over the past week and Wednesday's 2.7% rise.\n\nRussian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said he just learned he has tested positive for coronavirus and is temporarily stepping down, becoming the most senior Russian official to be diagnosed with the illness.\n\n\"The tests I did for coronavirus came back positive,\" Mishustin said in a televised video conversation with President Vladimir Putin. \"As a result, I must observe self-isolation and fulfill my doctors' orders, which is necessary to protect my colleagues.\"\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said the U.K. has passed the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, which has now killed more than 26,000 people and forced the country into an ongoing lockdown.\n\nIn his first press conference since recovering from Covid-19, Johnson promised to set out details next week on how businesses can get back to work to revive the stalled economy.\n\n\"We're working with the company to emphasize the necessity of speed while at the same time to understand the data,\" the FDA commissioner said in an interview. \"There will be a lot of factors that go into all the regulatory decisions. We want to look at the totality of data to make sure that remdesivir is targeted to the right patients.\"\n\nAnthony Fauci, the U.S. government's top infectious-disease expert, said on NBC's Today Show that he expected an FDA decision relatively soon. A vaccine could be available by January, he said separately.\n\nThe economy could shrink from 5% to 12% this year, Lagarde said during the opening statement of the ECB's virtual monetary policy press conference in Frankfurt.\n\nThe ECB unveiled a further facility to inject liquidity into the economy after data showed the worst three-month contraction in a quarter of a century of data. It delivered a new lending salvo that includes a so-called \"PELTRO\" measure to further assist growth, and will keep asset purchases and interest rates unchanged.\n\nThe bank said the lowest interest rate on a program that gives banks incentives to lend to companies and households will fall to 50 basis points below the deposit rate, currently at -0.5%. Interest on the new, non-targeted facility will be 0.25% below the main refinancing rate that currently is zero.\n\nSingapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong cautioned that things won't ever get back to the way they were before. He warned \"significant structural changes\" to the economy are likely even after the virus abates, with some industries disrupted permanently, companies having to change their business models to survive and some jobs simply disappearing. Many workers will have to accept pay cuts so their companies can survive, he said.\n\nWhen Singapore does reopen, it won't happen all at once, Lee said. Rather, it will reopen step by step, with critical industries and those connected to global supply chains going first. Places that draw crowds, such as entertainment outlets and large-scale sporting events, will have to wait.\n\nChildren with the new coronavirus may be as infectious as adults, according to a study from Germany that recommends caution against an unlimited reopening of schools and kindergartens.\n\nWhile children have a lower risk of developing severe illness from Covid-19, they may be no less capable of spreading it. Levels of virus in the respiratory tract -- the main route via which the pathogen is transmitted -- don't appear significantly different across age groups, Christian Drosten, director of the Institute of Virology at Berlin's Charite hospital, and colleagues found.\n\nThe WHO says more research is needed on the topic. For now, household transmission studies indicate that children are less likely to transmit Covid-19 to adults than the reverse, WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove told reporters in Geneva on Wednesday.",

Click VRUS on the terminal for news and data on the coronavirus.\n\nGilead Sciences Inc. is in talks to expand manufacturing of remdesivir, its Covid-19 treatment that's been cleared by U.S. health regulators for emergency use.\n\nThe company said in a blog post that it's in talks with \"some of the world's leading chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing companies\" about their ability to make the drug for Europe, Asia and the developing world through 2022. It's also talking with manufacturers in India and Pakistan about manufacturing for developing markets, and about how to license the drug in those markets.\n\n\"Close coordination of remdesivir manufacturing will be critical. This is why Gilead is working to build a consortium of manufacturing partners -- to bring efforts together to help maximize global supply,\" the Foster City, California based company said in the post.\n\nThe company, which has faced questions from investors about how it intends to recoup its investment on the drug, promised it will make the compound \"accessible and affordable to governments and patients around the world.\"\n\nWith almost 1,500 cases of Covid-19 at just three meatpacking plants in Iowa, consumer outlets from Kroger Co. to Costco Wholesale Corp. are limiting shoppers' purchases. Even Wendy's Co. has dropped burgers from some menus.\n\nPrices for wholesale beef and pork have jumped more than 20% since President Donald Trump's historic executive order to keep plants running during the pandemic. The supply shortfalls and soaring prices underscore the challenges of quickly fixing America's broken meat supply chain.\n\nMeat supplies for retail grocery stores could shrink almost 30% by Memorial Day, leading to retail pork and beef price inflation as high as 20% relative to prices last year, according to agricultural lender CoBank.\n\nBeyond Meat Inc. however reported sales beating Wall Street expectations despite shuttered restaurants as business shifts to supermarket sales. The faux-meat maker hasn't seen any disruptions to supply chains or reported cases of Covid-19 at its plants, CEO Ethan Brown said.\n\nWalt Disney Co.'s second-quarter profit plunged by more than half as the world's largest entertainment company was bludgeoned on all sides by the coronavirus.\n\nThe worst performance by far came from the theme-park division, where operating income tumbled to $639 million from $1.51 billion last year. Disney's parks remain shuttered around the world, with the resorts in Asia closed since late January. Profits at the film studio dropped 8% with U.S. theaters shuttered since mid-March. And cable networks such as ESPN were hurt by an advertising slump in the wake of the coronavirus lockdown. ESPN is especially vulnerable in a world without live sports.\n\nOne bright spot, despite still being in the money-losing stage, was the direct-to-consumer division, which has seen strong growth in subscribers to its new Disney+ streaming service launched in November.\n\nU.S. cases rose 1.9% from the day before to 1.19 million, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. That was lower than Monday's growth rate of 2% and below the average daily increase of 2.6% over the past week. Deaths rose 2.9% to 70,272.\n\nThe White House is discussing disbanding the president's coronavirus task force, possibly as soon as Memorial Day, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters.\n\n\"We're having conversations about that,\" Pence said in a briefing Tuesday.\n\nThe White House may transition the government's response to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Pence said. A time frame for the move could be late May or early June, he added.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Pence portrayed the task force as having accomplished its goal as the U.S. outbreak -- the largest in the world -- plateaus. There have been nearly 1.2 million cases of Covid-19 and more than 69,000 deaths from the disease, but states are beginning to try to reopen businesses and lift social-distancing regulations as the growth of the outbreak slows.\n\nCalifornia reported 1,275 new confirmed cases for Monday, its lowest daily total since April 25. The state had 63 additional deaths, up from a three-week low of 39 the prior day.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom on Monday expressed optimism that the state had turned a corner in cases, allowing it to take modest steps toward reopening the economy. California has accelerated testing, now completing more than 30,000 a day. It has tested a total of 779,902 residents, according to data released Tuesday.\n\nNew Jersey's death toll surpassed 8,200 as hospitalizations continued to fall.\n\nIn all, 5,328 patients are hospitalized, a decrease of nearly 3,000 from about three weeks ago, Governor Phil Murphy said at a news conference. Of those, 1,534 are in critical-care units, with 1,169 on ventilators, and both of those figures are dropping, he said. About half of New Jersey's 8,244 virus deaths have occurred in nursing homes, Murphy said.\n\nIn the past day, 385 people were hospitalized, a sign that social distancing must continue, he said.\n\nIn Texas, hospitalizations rose the most in more than three weeks, climbing 23% to 1,888, according to state health department data. The number of available intensive-care unit beds was 2,094.\n\nNew cases rose 3.2% to 33,369, a slower rate than the almost 5% increase in testing, the data showed. Fatalities increased by 2.5% to 906.\n\nThe number of projected deaths in the U.S. from the coronavirus has doubled because of governors' push to reopen, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said as he warned against prematurely ending lockdowns.\n\n\"There's a cost of reopening quickly,\" Cuomo said Tuesday at a press briefing. \"The faster we reopen, the lower the economic cost, but the more lives lost.\"\n\nThe governor cited data from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, which has increased its first-wave death projection to more than 130,000 from earlier estimates of about 60,000.\n\nRegeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. said an experimental antibody treatment for Covid-19 could be available as soon as this fall, an expedited timeline for a drug that's scheduled to be studied in humans for the first time in June.\n\nTo meet the fall time line will \"depend on a lot of factors,\" including whether the treatment works as well as hoped, \"and there is obviously a lot of risk,\" Regeneron Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said Tuesday on a conference call with investors. \"We've sort of done it before but now we are trying to take it to the next level.\"\n\nFlorida reported 37,439 Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, up 1.5% from a day earlier. Deaths among Florida residents reached 1,471, an increase of 5.1%\n\nFlorida is in its second day of its gradual reopening, with restaurants and retail allowed to reopen in most parts of the state Monday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said U.S. infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci was blocked from testifying to the House of Representatives on the coronavirus this week because it's controlled by Democrats, undercutting the White House's earlier explanation.\n\n\"The House is a setup, the House is a bunch of Trump haters, they put every Trump hater on the committee, same old stuff,\" Trump said Tuesday in response to a question about why Fauci wasn't allowed to testify.\n\nA White House spokesman, Judd Deere, said in a statement last week that it would be \"counterproductive\" to allow top U.S. medical officials to testify to Congress while they're working to combat the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nEuropean Union Trade Commissioner Phil Hogan said countries around the world should scrap pandemic-induced commercial curbs as the global economy recovers.\n\n\"We have to remove all of those restrictions and return to an open, rules-based, approach,\" Hogan said in a Bloomberg TV interview in Brussels. He cited the need for World Trade Organization member nations to work together toward \"a more speedy recovery.\"\n\nConnecticut has canceled in-person classes for public school students for the rest of the academic year, according to Governor Ned Lamont.\n\nSchools will be still be required to provide meals to children under school lunch and breakfast programs for consumption at home, Lamont said.\n\nNew York and New Jersey also closed schools for the rest of the academic year.\n\nUnited Airlines Holdings Inc. will cut at least 30% of its managerial and administrative jobs when government restrictions lift in October. In addition to cutting the roughly 3,500 positions, the company will require that management and administrative employees take 20 days off without pay between May 16 and Sept. 30, according to an internal memo.\n\nVirgin Atlantic Airways Ltd. will eliminate 3,150 jobs and shutter its hub at London Gatwick airport to help ride out the coronavirus crisis after struggling to secure a bailout from the U.K. government. The cuts will be discussed with unions in a 45-day consultation, the carrier founded by billionaire Richard Branson said in a statement.\n\nFlights will be focused on London Heathrow and Manchester, though Gatwick slots will be retained in expectation of an eventual recovery there, it said.\n\nNew York state is reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities, the Associated Press reported. At least 4,813 residents with confirmed or presumed cases of Covid-19 have died at 351 of New York's 613 nursing homes since March 1, the AP said, citing the new list from Governor Andrew Cuomo's administration. The list, released late Monday, includes the reported number of both confirmed and presumed deaths as of Sunday evening.\n\nU.S. exports of goods and services plunged in March by a record and imports declined by the most in 11 years as the pandemic stymied trade and travel.\n\nThe overall gap in goods and services trade widened to $44.4 billion from a revised $39.8 billion in February, according to Commerce Department data released Tuesday. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for a widening to $44.2 billion.\n\nThe pandemic could lead to a 20% jump in corporate insolvencies this year in Germany with a spike in the autumn, according to Frankfurt-based financial advisory firm Falkensteg.\n\nOne third of respondents in a survey of 460 insolvency administrators last month expect that the number of companies seeking creditor protection could rise to 22,500 in 2020 from 18,750 last year. Three in four of the respondents expect a jump of at least 10%.\n\nSweden's light-touch approach to containing Covid-19 may be working in Scandinavia's biggest economy, but it would be wrong to regard it as a model for others to emulate, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSwedish schools, gyms, bars and shops have remained mostly open during the pandemic. At the same time, its fatality rate as a share of the population is lower than in most of the major European economies, and there are signs the infection rate has stabilized.\n\nBut Goldman says a number of uniquely Swedish demographic factors have shielded it from the worst, and there's no evidence that other countries would achieve similar results.\n\n\"We haven't seen the declines we expected to see right now,\" former FDA chief Scott Gottlieb said an in NBC interview. \"Certainly I expected to see sustained declines in new cases around the country,\" Gottlieb said, adding that cases are actually going up in around 20 states.\n\nSeveral states had said Gottlieb was helping to advise them on their approach to reopening and he was also named by President Donald Trump in April as someone providing guidance on economic revival to the White House.\n\nU.K. Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance told a parliamentary committee hearing that Britain should be able to avoid a second wave of infections \"if we do test, track and tracing well\" and keep social-distancing measures at the right level. \"But I want to add one caveat, which is winter is going to be extremely difficult when you also have flu circulating and all the other respiratory infections.\"\n\nWhen asked what could've been done differently Vallance told the committee: \"I think that probably we, in the early phases, and I've said this before, if we'd managed to ramp testing capacity quicker it would've been beneficial.\"\n\nAccording to documents released earlier, scientists advised the government to try a gradual easing of restrictions when its lockdown is lifted, saying a stop-start approach could lead to a loss of trust in the strategy. An April 1 paper on how to relax measures imposed on March 23 shows government scientists examined tactics to ease restrictions and then tighten them again.\n\n\"If strict restrictions are retained for months and then abruptly eased and people are told it is safe to resume social contact they will expect this to mean that the risk of infection has ceased or significantly reduced,\" they wrote in the papers released on Tuesday. \"If there is then an increase in infection rates that necessitates a reintroduction of restrictions this is likely to be seen as a serious failure of policy and trust in public health advice will be lost.\"\n\nMarathon Petroleum Corp. took a charge of $12.4 billion in the first quarter on non-cash impairments as America's biggest fuel maker adjusts to lower demand for its product. Marathon said it will slash its own spending by 30% to $3 billion for this year.\n\nThe biggest U.S. refiners have reduced rates sharply across their systems and Marathon has shut some of its plants as widespread lockdowns to stem the coronavirus outbreak kept cars off the road.\n\nPfizer Inc. has administered the first U.S. patients with its experimental vaccines to fight the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, part of a bid to shave years off of the typical time it takes to develop a new inoculation. The trials are being conducted at the NYU Grossman School of Medicine and the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\n\"The short, less than four-month time-frame in which we've been able to move from preclinical studies to human testing is extraordinary,\" Chief Executive Officer Albert Bourla said. Preclinical studies are what companies do in animals or in the lab before they test vaccines in humans. Drugmakers have been working with regulators to compress development times.\n\nPfizer and BioNTech are in a race with companies including Johnson & Johnson, Moderna Inc. and dozens of other biopharmacuetical outfits and academic groups to come up with a safe and effective vaccine against the illness within the next year to 18 months. A handful are in human trials already, including Moderna's and ones from CanSino Biologics Inc., the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology and Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc.\n\nThe German state of Bavaria announced a timeline for reopening all stores, hotels and restaurants this month in what may serve as a blueprint for the rest of the nation. The announcement of a gradual reopening of the southern region's economy came a day before talks between the nation's 16 state leaders and Chancellor Angela Merkel.\n\nLarger shops and malls in Bavaria, which has some of the strictest lockdown measures, can reopen for business from May 11, with restaurants following on May 25 and hotels from May 30, Premier Markus Soeder said at a news conference Tuesday.\n\nChina's Ambassador to the U.K., Liu Xiaoming, said British politicians who have called for a reset of ties between the two nations risk poisoning the relationship. Anti-China rhetoric is in danger of undermining international solidarity in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic, he said in a webinar on Tuesday.\n\nThe ambassador's comment is a thinly veiled warning to senior Conservatives, including Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who said last month it could not be \"business as usual\" with China after Covid-19. Critics have focused on China's lack of transparency about reporting early cases of the disease.\n\nSaudi Arabia has allowed private-sector companies to cut salaries by as much as 40% for up to six months and given employers more rights to terminate contracts, after its finance minister warned the kingdom of \"painful\" measures as it confronts the coronavirus pandemic and a meltdown in global oil prices.\n\nA company will only be allowed to use the new rules to end employment once it shows it hasn't benefited from government subsidy provided to confront the virus outbreak, has suffered losses during the \"current circumstances,\" and has made use of the six-month provision to lower salaries.\n\nFewer than 300 people who entered the U.K. in the months leading up to the lockdown were taken to government-supported isolation facilities to be quarantined. Passengers evacuated from Wuhan in China, where Covid-19 first flared up, and 32 people who had been on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship were among those taken to isolation facilities.\n\nThe government has faced criticism that it was too slow to respond to the threat caused by the pandemic. The U.K. may end up with the highest number of fatalities in Europe, in part because it tried to keep life continuing as normal while the rest of Europe was imposing restrictions to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nThe earliest Covid-19 cases had symptom onset in early December, according to Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization. A potential virus case in France that dates back to December, a month before the first reported case there, is not surprising and even more might be found after retesting patients who were sick in December and January for unspecified reasons.\n\n\"It's possible some of the infected people traveled from Wuhan to other countries at that time, and it's also possible more early cases will be found as countries retest samples,\" Lindmeier said at a press briefing on Tuesday. Aggressive testing and better contact tracing would've been more effective to reign in the virus than travel bans, he added.\n\nFacebook Inc.'s Oculus division is building a new version of its Quest standalone virtual reality headset, but the device is facing potential delays due to the impact of Covid-19 on product development and the global supply chain.\n\nThe social-networking giant is working on multiple potential successors to the Quest. Some models in advanced testing are smaller, lighter, and have a faster image refresh rate for more realistic content, according to people familiar with the matter. These headsets also have redesigned controllers, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing unannounced products.\n\nThe company hasn't finalized which new version of the Quest it will release, and the final product may have different features. Facebook originally planned to launch the new model at the end of 2020, around its annual Oculus Connect conference, but the coronavirus pandemic could delay the headset from shipping until 2021, the people said.",

        "body": "The U.S. is planning a major expansion of coronavirus testing at retail health locations around the country, part of a plan to vastly expand checks for the virus and begin getting people back to work.\n\nCVS Health Corp., the U.S. drugstore chain, said Monday it will open testing sites at 1,000 of its stores. The announcement coincides with a planned meeting between President Donald Trump and some of the nation's largest retailers and lab testing companies. Other retailers are expected to make similar announcements at the meeting.\n\nCVS will offer self-swab tests to people who meet Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria. People will be required to register online and will then be tested at a drive-through window or in a store parking lot. The company said it hopes to be able to conduct 1.5 million tests a month, pending availability of supplies and lab capacity.\n\nIf successful, the effort would represent a substantial expansion of testing capacity. Experts estimate the U.S. will have to run at least 500,000 tests daily to start to get people back to work. That's about 200,000 a day more than the peak number of daily tests conduced within the last week, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a data group following test counts.\n\n\"We all share the same goal, and that's dramatically increasing the frequency and efficiency of testing so we can slow the spread of the virus and start to responsibly reopen the economy when experts tell us it's safe,\" CVS Chief Executive Officer Larry Merlo said in a statement.\n\nTesting is a key part of the strategy to reopen the country and loosen social distancing rules. Widespread testing would allow states to conduct programs to better track infections and isolate sick people, shifting from programs of broad, blunt restrictions into more precise ones.\n\nThe testing announcement coincides with a new White House testing strategy released Monday aimed at monitoring the spread of the virus and reopening the country's economy.\n\nTrump in March at a Rose Garden news conference said the federal government would partner with CVS, Walmart Inc., Target Corp. and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. to test people for the new coronavirus in the retailers' parking lots. Rite Aid Corp. later joined the effort.\n\nCurrently, about 70 testing sites have opened at drugstores including Rite Aid, CVS and Walgreens, as well as Walmart. Most diagnostic testing is still done at hospitals or by other health-care providers. The result is that testing has been focused mostly on very sick people, resulting in what experts believe is a serious undercount of cases.\n\nWoonsocket, Rhode Island, based CVS operates about 10,000 drugstores across the U.S., and currently runs testing sites in five states at large parking lots that are sitting empty, such as Twin River Casino in Rhode Island and Georgia Tech in Atlanta.\n\nHealth experts agree that widespread testing is necessary to reopening the economy and sending people back to work. The federal government has been widely criticized for failing to quickly implement a national testing strategy.At Monday's event, it isn't clear whether the president will address shortages of materials needed to expand testing, including swabs to collect samples and chemical media to transport them to labs.\n\nThe CDC is also expected to release new guidelines widening testing criteria to people without symptoms, but who work in high-risk settings, the Associated Press reported. Research shows that people without symptoms or who have yet to develop them may be able to spread the disease.\n\nThe new coronavirus has sickened more than 979,000 Americans and killed more than 55,000 as of Monday, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.",

        "body": "Uber Technologies Inc. pledged to make it easier for California drivers to get sick pay if they fall ill from the coronavirus.\n\nUber told drivers in the state that it will pay three days, or 24 hours, of sick leave at $15 per hour for those who self-certify they have been diagnosed with Covid-19, or have experienced symptoms of the coronavirus. Self-certification means they don't need a doctor's note or any documentation to get the pay.\n\nThe ride-hailing giant had been prodded by a federal judge to loosen its restrictions on sick leave after a driver sued to force the company to change its policy. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen said April 1 he was reluctant to grant such an order because it might undercut the funding drivers would receive from a federal emergency law. Instead, Chen pressed the company to negotiate a compromise.\n\nUber's virus sick pay was confirmed by Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lawyer who filed the suit on drivers' behalf. In related lawsuits the lawyer is fighting, Uber continues to push back against a new California law that makes it harder for companies to claim their workers are independent contractors rather than employees entitled to full workplace rights.\n\nIn an email, Liss-Riordan described the sick pay as a first step in her years-long battle. \"Now we can focus on proceeding to seek a ruling in court that Uber is continuing to misclassify its drivers as independent contractors, and deprive them of other labor code protections, in obvious violation of California law,\" she said in an email.\n\nThe lawyer added that she's waiting to see if the adjusted sick pay policy works in California before trying to implement it in Massachusetts, where she's filed a similar suit.\n\nUber spokesman Matt Kallman declined to comment.\n\nUber's California coronavirus sick pay will also be available to drivers who believe they've been exposed to the virus or live with someone who has, or they suffer from an underlying condition that makes them more susceptible - including being at least 60 years old.\n\nDrivers will not be allowed to drive for the three days for which they receive the sick pay, but they can be put back on Uber's app and drive again by certifying that they no longer have coronavirus symptoms. Drivers must also have driven for Uber for a certain number of hours over a period of time to qualify.\n\nUber this month withdrew its financial guidance for 2020 and said it will write down about $2 billion in investments due to rideshares falling by as much as 70% in cities hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic. Lyft Inc., which is also a target of similar suits by drivers seeking sick pay, also withdrew its profit and revenue forecasts for 2020, citing evolving and unpredictable impacts from Covid-19.\n\nThe case is Verhines v.

        "body": "The novel coronavirus that emerged late last year in central China has infected millions of people around the world. It's taken health officials time to understand that it behaves in ways atypical of similar viruses, producing missteps in the response. The list of symptoms of Covid-19, the disease it causes, keeps growing, complicating efforts to diagnose and treat it. And the virus has yet to give up all its mysteries, creating uncertainties about when the pandemic might end.\n\nCoronaviruses, named for their crown-like shape, are a large family of pathogens responsible for diseases that range in severity from the common cold to the frequently fatal Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). New ones pop up now and then, often moving from an animal host to humans. Unlike the coronavirus responsible for the 2002-2003 outbreak in Asia of severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, this new one can spread via people who are infected but haven't yet developed or won't develop symptoms. Researchers at the University of Oxford estimated in March that a third to half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic people.\n\nInitial symptoms are similar, and influenza is also spread by people without symptoms -- but not that commonly. Also, flu's average incubation period -- the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms -- is two days. It's about five days for the coronavirus, enabling it to move silently in a community before being detected. Its stealthy nature wasn't well understood at first and contributed to the staggered and uneven quality of the response.\n\nRead more: Why 'Silent Spreaders' Make Coronavirus Hard to Beat: QuickTake\n\nOn Jan. 23, China imposed the most extensive quarantine in known history in Hubei province; the outbreak began there in the capital Wuhan, an industrial city of 11 million. Travel bans were introduced between countries, but not before the virus had reached around the world, fueling a mounting death toll. Governments locked down populations through stay-at-home orders and mandated \"social distancing\" to \"flatten the curve\" of new infections. As the extent of the virus's silent spread became clear, more of them recommended or mandated that people wear face masks in tight public spaces.",

        "body": "Positive study results have arrived quickly, but the next steps will be slower.\n\nThe fast pace at which various laboratories are working on vaccines against Covid-19 carries both promise and peril. On Monday, Moderna Therapeutics Inc. announced the first reported data from human trials, and they are positive. That's good news, and it arrived sooner than expected. But the parts of the project that lie ahead will be harder to accomplish with speed.\n\nEight patients who received low and medium doses of the Moderna's candidate vaccine appear to have developed antibodies capable of neutralizing the new coronavirus. The company didn't have detailed data on the rest of the 45 trial participants, but all generated at least some antibodies. It was early data from a small study, though, and the limited results don't prove that the vaccine provides broad and durable protection. Also, while there were no serious safety issues, three patients who received the highest dose of the vaccine briefly suffered modest \"flu-like symptoms\" after their second injection.\n\nFor this vaccine to succeed, tests ahead will need to demonstrate that it can indeed protect people from Covid-19 for an extended period, and that it will prevent substantially more harm than it causes. The bar is especially high for vaccines, because they're given to healthy people -- a Covid-19 vaccine, in particular, could be given to billions of healthy people. Of course, there's pressure to move quickly. But some parts of the vaccine development process simply cannot be rushed.\n\nModerna and other companies that have created vaccine candidates in record time have been able to speed early stages of the process -- for instance, by compressing animal experiments -- and they plan to keep hurrying by testing higher-risk patients earlier than usual and by starting more extensive efficacy trials while smaller safety studies are still running. The Trump administration's new Operation Warp Speed aims to help by building significant manufacturing capacity for candidate vaccines even before they prove successful.\n\nBut there are limited ways to shorten the large randomized human trials that will be needed to assess any vaccine's safety and effectiveness.\n\nOne way to try to move faster is to use so-called surrogate endpoints -- that is, to measure certain biomarkers of the drug's effectiveness rather than wait for hard data from patient outcomes. You might look, for example, at the number of antibodies that subjects generate after trying the vaccine. This evidence can demonstrate which specific candidates or doses are worth pushing forward. However, it isn't enough for approval. Only clinical data from a large and varied population can establish how much protection a vaccine can safely provide, and for how long.\n\nSuch trials take time, in part because so much needs to happen before the data are complete. It could take months for enough of the subjects who are given placebos to be infected with the coronavirus -- to demonstrate by comparison the vaccine's effectiveness. And public health efforts may inadvertently slow this process, if they are able to delay or minimize a second wave of the disease.\n\nHuman challenge trials, in which healthy volunteers are deliberately exposed to a virus in order to assess a vaccine rapidly, could also speed things up by identifying the most promising vaccine candidates. Even so, it makes sense to run trials on a diverse set of possible vaccines, ranging from Moderna's novel RNA-based option to more traditional inactivated viruses. Multiple good alternatives are going to be needed to meet the historic challenge of inoculating the world against Covid-19, and some will turn out to be easier to manufacture and distribute than others.\n\nVaccine studies need to be large especially to establish safety. Immune systems vary enormously from person to person, which means that it's easy for a mostly safe vaccine to provoke an occasional adverse reaction. Cutting corners on clinical trials boosts the risk that bad reactions could emerge as use expands.\n\nModerna's early safety data reveal nothing that would prevent broad use of its vaccine. In future trials, including a large pivotal test scheduled to begin in July, the company plans to use a middle-size dose, which should theoretically lower the risk of side effects. But if this dose produces anything worse than scattered and transient unpleasant symptoms, the vaccine may not be approvable.\n\nRegulators will need to determine exactly how much safety data is enough, based on input from both research scientists and clinicians. Despite the world's urgent need, this reasoning will need to be guided by the evidence as it comes in, not by any wished-for calendar date.",

        "body": "Chinese scientists say the novel coronavirus will not be eradicated, adding to a growing consensus around the world that the pathogen will likely return in waves like the flu.\n\nIt's unlikely the new virus will disappear the way its close cousin SARS did 17 years ago, as it infects some people without causing obvious symptoms like fever. This group of so-called asymptomatic carriers makes it hard to fully contain transmission as they can spread the virus undetected, a group of Chinese viral and medical researchers told reporters in Beijing at a briefing Monday.\n\nWith SARS, those infected became seriously ill. Once they were quarantined from others, the virus stopped spreading. In contrast, China is still finding dozens of asymptomatic cases of the coronavirus every day despite bringing its epidemic under control.\n\n\"This is very likely to be an epidemic that co-exists with humans for a long time, becomes seasonal and is sustained within human bodies,\" said Jin Qi, director of the Institute of Pathogen Biology at China's top medial research institute, the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.\n\nA consensus is forming among top researchers and governments worldwide that the virus is unlikely to be eliminated, despite costly lockdowns that have brought much of the global economy to a halt. Some public health experts are calling for the virus to be allowed to spread in a controlled way through younger populations like India's, while countries like Sweden have opted out of strict lockdowns.\n\nRead more on how herd immunity could work for poor countries\n\nAnthony Fauci, the director of U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said last month that Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, could become a seasonal ailment. He cited as evidence cases now showing up in countries across the southern hemisphere as they enter their winter seasons.\n\nMore than 3 million people have been sickened and over 210,000 killed in the global pandemic.\n\nWhile some, including U.S. President Donald Trump, have expressed hope that the virus's spread will slow as the temperature in northern hemisphere countries rises in the summer, Chinese experts on Monday said that they found no evidence for this.\n\n\"The virus is heat sensitive, but that's when it's exposed to 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes and the weather is never going to get that hot,\" said Wang Guiqiang, head of the infectious diseases department of Peking University First Hospital. \"So globally, even during the summer, the chance of cases going down significantly is small.\"",

        "body": "New coronavirus infections and deaths declined in Germany, France and Spain as all of Europe watches their efforts to gradually ease the lockdowns that sought to tame the pandemic.\n\nSpain, which lifted a ban on outdoor exercise last Saturday, recorded the fewest new cases and deaths in five days. Small shops in much of the country are preparing to reopen on Monday, three weeks after Germany took a similar step. Daily deaths in Italy fell to less than 200 for only the third time since mid-March. France reported 80 new deaths, the fewest since at least March 20.\n\nFrance is loosening restrictions on businesses and stores on Monday, though strict controls will remain on public transport in Paris. Germany is set to open restaurants, hotels and all shops and restart professional soccer games. Only parts of Spain will get a respite because restrictions won't be eased yet in cities including Barcelona and Madrid, the epicenter of the country's outbreak.\n\n\"This 51% of the Spanish population will get back a greater part of their lives\" after the whole country fought the outbreak, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Saturday. Spain has the most number of confirmed cases in Europe.\n\nDespite more than 150,000 deaths in Europe, leaders are feeling the heat to accelerate a return to normality and restart an economy that may be set to contract the most since the Great Depression. While European Union countries are testing the waters on rekindling social and economic life, borders will remain shut until mid-June, limiting transport and commerce.\n\nLate on Friday, euro-area finance ministers agreed to allow the region's bailout fund to extend an estimated $260 billion in credit lines to each of the bloc's governments on concessionary terms as leaders seek to cushion the economic blow of the pandemic. France's parliament on Saturday extended the country's public-health emergency until July, prolonging the government's special powers to stem the pandemic.\n\nOutside the euro region, Russia's new cases topped 10,000 for a seventh straight day, leapfrogging on Friday the size of the outbreak in France and nearing levels recorded in the U.K., Italy, and Spain, the region's hardest-hit countries.\n\nThe strictness of lockdown measures varies greatly in Eastern Europe. Belarus today ignored the pandemic risk and held a large military parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe. Thousands gathered in the streets of Minsk for the event, with little social distancing. The country's authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko said that not holding the event would be a \"betrayal\" of the country's war dead.\n\nIn the U.K., the end of the war was commemorated with a two-minute silence on Friday, but no public gatherings were sanctioned. With more than 31,500 fatalities, the U.K. has suffered the most deaths from the virus in Europe. Another 346 deaths were reported on Saturday, with almost 4,000 new cases of the virus.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who was at risk of dying from Covid-19 last month, is under pressure to ease the country's lockdown even after a week in which the death toll exceeded 600 on several days. Johnson will lay out a road map out of the lockdown on Sunday, though he is expected to largely keep restrictions in place until June.\n\nVirus-related restrictions are prompting Britons in crowded cities to look to move to the countryside in record numbers, the Guardian reported. Inverness in the Scottish Highlands saw the biggest year-on-year increase, with home searches up 167%, the paper said.\n\nJohnson's government has been criticized for being slow to respond to the risks of the virus even after cases began to spread in the U.K. in January. Now, there may be evidence that the virus may have been in Europe much earlier than that.\n\nThe outbreak could have started as early as October, according to a joint U.K.-French study cited by the Telegraph. A French athlete who participated in the World Military Games held in Wuhan, China in October suffered symptoms matching Covid-19, the paper said.",

        "body": "Sign up here for our daily coronavirus newsletter on what you need to know, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis.\n\nMore than one million people around the world have been deemed recovered from the coronavirus, but beating the initial sickness may be just the first of many battles for those who have survived.\n\nSome recovered patients report breathlessness, fatigue and body pain months after first becoming infected. Small-scale studies conducted in Hong Kong and Wuhan, China show that survivors grapple with poorer functioning in their lungs, heart and liver. And that may be the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe coronavirus is now known to attack many parts of the body beyond the respiratory system, causing damage from the eyeballs to the toes, the gut to the kidneys. Patients' immune systems can go into overdrive to fight off the infection, compounding the damage done.\n\nAll the Covid-19 Symptoms You Didn't Know About\n\nWhile researchers are only starting to track the long-term health of survivors, past epidemics caused by similar viruses show that the aftermath can last more than a decade. According to one study, survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, suffered lung infections, higher cholesterol levels and were falling sick more frequently than others for as long as 12 years after the epidemic coursed through Asia, killing almost 800 people.\n\nSARS infected 8,000 people. With more than 4 million -- and more every day -- infected by the coronavirus, the long-term damage to health could strain social safety nets and health-care infrastructures for years to come as well as have implications for economies and companies.\n\nThe prospect led Nicholas Hart, the British physician who treated Prime Minister Boris Johnson, to call the virus \"this generation's polio\" -- a disease that could leave many marked by its scars and reshape global health care.\n\n\"What these chronic issues ultimately look like - and how many patients ultimately experience them - will have huge implications for patients, the doctors who treat them, and the health systems around them,\" said Kimberly Powers, an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, who is developing models on the virus's spread to inform public-health efforts.\n\nHong Kong's hospital authority has been monitoring a group of Covid-19 patients for up to two months since they were released. They found about half of the 20 survivors had lung function below the normal range, said Owen Tsang, the medical director of the infectious disease center at Princess Margaret Hospital.\n\nThe diffusing capacity of their lungs -- how well oxygen and carbon dioxide transfers between the lungs and blood -- remained below healthy levels, Tsang observed.\n\nA study of blood samples from 25 recovered patients in Wuhan, the city where the virus first emerged, found that they had not fully recovered normal functioning regardless of the severity of their coronavirus symptoms, according to a paper published April 7.\n\nIn another study, CT scans taken over a month of 90 Wuhan coronavirus patients found that of the 70 discharged from the hospital, 66 had mild to substantial residual lung abnormalities on their last CT scans, which showed ground-glass opacity, said a March paper published online in Radiology.\n\nChronic cardiac complications could arise in patients even after recovery as a result of persistent inflammation, according to an April 3 paper by doctors at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. They based their analysis on patient data from Italy and China.\n\nFor clues on how Covid-19 may leave its mark, doctors and researchers are looking to the experience of SARS. Some survivors suffered long-term effects years after they first succumbed to the disease, which is part of the same family as the new coronavirus.\n\nResearchers in China analyzed 25 SARS patients 12 years after they contracted the virus, contrasting their results with a control group who were not infected with SARS. The study found that more than half of the recovered patients suffered another lung infection since their bout with SARS and also had higher cholesterol levels. Additionally, half the patients had at least five colds in the previous year -- a characteristic no one in the control group shared, said the 2017 paper published online in Scientific Reports.\n\n\"These data demonstrated that the recovered SARS patients had a poor quality of life 12 years following recovery, and were susceptible to inflammation, tumors, and glucose and lipid metabolic disorders,\" researchers wrote.\n\nDoctors like Tsang at Hong Kong's Princess Margaret Hospital said looking at former SARS patients is potentially instructive. Among survivors of the SARS outbreak of 2003, chronic fatigue and impaired lung function have been found in follow-up studies after two to four years.\n\n\"This is so new that I don't think anyone is able to tell what is the percentage of patients who will recover, what is the percentage of patients who will not recover and have long-term sequela,\" said Michelle Biehl, a critical care pulmonary doctor at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, using the medical term for chronic conditions after a disease.\n\nTracking and figuring out how Covid-19 affects the body even after recovery could inform governments budgeting for social safety nets, doctors that see patients long term, and businesses as they set policies such as sick and disability leave. These issues could be even more crucial as public health officials say there's a possibility the virus may become a seasonal affliction.\n\nEconomies and companies looking to get people back to work will need to understand how and if Covid-19 affects human health in the long run and its scope.\n\n\"There is such a wide range in the way the illness affects people. The various stakeholders need solid data to help them understand the breadth and duration of long term effects,\" said Jessica Justman, a professor of medicine in epidemiology at Columbia University.\n\nThere is some hope: Early intervention could play a role in longer-term outcomes of coronavirus patients, said Ivan Hung, a professor of medicine at the University of Hong Kong. Hung said in April that 90% of about 200 discharged patients he oversaw at a clinic at one of the city's hospitals appear to be making a full recovery a month out.\n\nHe attributed the success to Hong Kong's \"early diagnosis and early treatment\" of patients, which leaves the virus with less time to wreak havoc on the body.\n\n'False Dawn' Recovery Haunts Virus Survivors Who Fall Sick Again\n\nThis may not be possible in many countries like the U.S. and U.K where testing is uneven and inadequate, and only those with serious symptoms are getting treatment.\n\nStill, larger-scale studies in virus hot spots are needed to separate the physical legacy of the virus from how patients feel immediately after fighting off the infection. It will be crucial for scientists to track and quantify how Covid-19 affects such factors as oxygenation and breathing rate, said Roberto Bruzzone, a visiting professor at the University of Hong Kong, whose research focuses on cell biology.\n\nHospitals and researchers will have begun patient registries to start gathering data to study survivors over time as well.\n\n\"We need an epidemiological study that may be feasible in places like Wuhan, New York City, Milan or Paris -- where there has been a huge group of infections with a wide variety of symptoms,\" Bruzzone said.",

Shortly after that meeting, David Frost and Michel Barnier, the two sides' chief negotiators, were forced into isolation after showing symptoms of the virus.\n\nThey resume talks as the U.K.'s opposition to extending the deadline hardens and officials say they have made little progress beyond identifying the major areas of disagreement.

Many U.K. businesses, fearful of the economic disruption of Brexit and the coronavirus combined, have called for extra time.\n\nBut Boris Johnson's government, unwilling to countenance any further Brexit delays or payments into the EU's coffers, has repeatedly ruled out asking for a postponement and said last week it would veto any EU request for one.\n\n\"Transition ends on 31 December this year,\" Frost said on Twitter last week. \"We will not ask to extend it.

Over the following three days, negotiators will discuss trade in goods, trade in services, and how to prevent unfair competition, before a concluding session on Friday.\n\nDuring the course of the week, there will also be discussions on fishing rights, road transport and aviation, energy and nuclear cooperation, law enforcement as well as how any deal should be governed.\n\nThe key areas of disagreement are:\n\nTwo further video-conference rounds have been arranged for May 11 and June 1.

        "body": "More coronavirus tests won't be enough to stop social distancing. Better tests might be.\n\nThe debate about when and whether the world can reopen keeps coming back to testing. If only we could test everyone all the time, the logic goes, we could isolate the ill and everyone else could go back to school, work and life as we once knew it.\n\nSadly, that's not quite right. The prerequisite for reopening is better tests, not just more tests.\n\nA \"good test\" has three properties: It's rapid (like less than an hour), accurate and widely available. Only with all three can it be used to screen people before they go to the office, get on an airplane, or attend a class or conference. And only then -- barring an effective vaccine -- can authorities safely allow people to do all those things.\n\nCurrent tests fall short. The turnaround time for typical nasal swabs that detect the virus's RNA can be hours or days -- far too long to be useful as a screen, and plenty of time for people to get infected while awaiting the results. And even if people were willing to wait in quarantine for days, many of the available tests are not accurate. They have very high false negative rates, meaning that they would erroneously allow a lot of sick people to interact with everyone else, all but guaranteeing more super-spreader incidents. There are some promising tests that are both fast and relatively accurate, but they require nearby expensive machines, so they won't become universally available.\n\nChecking people's temperatures is no substitute. Thermometer guns and cameras are famously inaccurate, in part because the temperature of your face doesn't necessarily reflect your internal temperature. More important, people infected with coronavirus are highly contagious long before they show any symptoms, and many never experience a fever.\n\nGranted, current tests do have their uses. New York, for example, recently used antibody tests to estimate that about 15% of people in the state -- and about 25% in New York City -- had already been infected. This might be useful for understanding whether a place is nearing \"herd immunity\" -- but only if infection grants immunity for a significant period, which we don't know yet. Also, it's worth noting that New York's test wasn't a random sample: Participants were selected at shopping centers, so the results aren't representative of a population that is to some extent hunkering down at home.\n\nNone of this means that people shouldn't use the available tests. Done right, testing and tracing can slow the pandemic's spread. And even slow bad tests can provide some marginal risk mitigation for people working in hot spots. Hospitals should get access to the expensive machines to further mitigate risk. But the remaining danger, unavoidable in a hospital, is unacceptable in a college dormitory or industry conference. Which leaves sticking with social distancing, and requiring businesses to gear up with splash guards, partitions and credit card machines placed at a safe distance from cashiers. All imperfect, but helpful in reducing risk until a good test comes along.\n\nI'm fantasizing about how things will look when a good tests emerges, for the months or years before a vaccine. Maybe people will get up in the morning and, before going to work, spit into a \"smart test\" envelope that verifies their identity and shares the result with them and anyone they indicated should have access. Same for getting on an airplane, attending or teaching a college class, or whatever else involves proximity to other humans. If the tests are widely available and people take them daily, small inaccuracies will be mitigated. It will be easy to take another test to be sure.\n\nI want good news as much as anyone. Believe me when I say that I'd very much like to know if and when my college-aged sons will ever move out. But until there's a good test, I'm not making any plans.",

        "body": "Shutdowns were only supposed to buy time for hospitals and health officials.\n\nOfficials in the U.S. have undermined hopes of a successful economic reopening because they've garbled public messaging, never clearly explaining why strict lockdowns were imposed in the first place. They've failed to communicate what the lockdowns are achieving for us, let alone what criteria should be used to lift them.\n\nIt's intuitive to think there must be enormous benefits to something that's crushing businesses and career dreams, creating long lines at food banks, disrupting education and imposing, for those cooped up alone or with abusive family members, a brutal psychological toll. And yet there was primarily one, relatively limited goal: Preventing transmission from spiking so sharply that hospitals overflow with patients. (As a secondary benefit, the disease should become less deadly over time as doctors improve their ability to treat it.)\n\nKeeping people apart through voluntary social distancing or mandates to stay home can't defeat the virus; it isn't going away until a chunk of the population develops immunity. Once lockdowns are lifted, cases will spike here and there. That was always going to be true. But as long as hospitals don't become overrun, lockdowns may have served their purpose.\n\nThe public messaging has been all wrong, says risk communication consultant Peter Sandman. Whether it's on MSNBC or Fox, viewers are told that lockdowns should be lifted when \"it's safe.\"\n\n\"That's unachievable,\" says Sandman, who is co-author, along with his collaborator and wife Jody Lanard, of a May 6 report on Covid-19 crisis communication for the Centers for Infections Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP).\n\nSandman said many prescient things when I interviewed him about Covid-19 in early February. He had anticipated the behavior of the virus to spread around the globe, and the disruption it would cause. But he didn't anticipate how badly political and public health leaders would bungle the situation.\n\n\"We were aghast\" he says, referring to himself and others in the risk communication business, when the U.S. failed to organize testing and contact tracing early. Then leaders resorted to measures that were both draconian and impotent. There were lots of preparedness plans drawn up during previous pandemic scares, and none of them included mass lockdowns.\n\nThe message to \"flatten the curve\" is catchy, but it may be wrongly implying that this pandemic will rise and fall with a single peak. Epidemiologists say it's more likely the disease will either expand into a large second peak or rise in intermittent hills for several years. The whole idea of flattening the curve is to distribute the infections over a year (or more) rather than weeks or months. That can save lives by preventing anyone from dying for lack of hospital care.\n\nIt's a nuanced message to get across, to be sure. \"Not one in a hundred people understand the distinction between preventing a death and postponing a death,\" says Sandman. When the Wuhan was locked down, he says, \"We thought it was a horrible Chinese aberration.\"\n\nPart of the confusion may stem from the success in China, where the government appeared to \"crush\" the curve with decisive lockdown measures. There was a lot more going on than just lockdowns, however.\n\nDuring those shutdowns, there was intense testing and contact tracing to quarantine those most likely to be infected. Infected people were made to go to special facilities, spending a couple of weeks away from family members, heeding evidence that the virus spreads mostly within households. By focusing on where the virus was most likely to be, rather than treating everyone as equally infectious, they were able to drive their infection rate way down.\n\nNo state or city in the U.S. has done anywhere near that level of testing, tracing or focused quarantining.\n\nStill, some local lockdowns may have saved lives. They were clearly necessary in New York City, for example, where cases were exploding in March. Sandman says that shouldn't have been necessary if the U.S. had used its weeks of warning time early in the year to set up testing and contact tracing there, and to prepare the hospitals.\n\n\"It was too late in New York but it wasn't too late in South Dakota,\" says Sandman, or in most other parts of the country where there was no evidence of an immediate explosion. That didn't mean ignoring the problem in such other places. A lack of testing made it hard to rule out new spikes anywhere, but in Sandman's view, most places would have been better off with voluntary social distancing, cancellation of big events, preparation of hospitals and nursing homes, and focused testing and contact tracing or even contact tracing alone, quarantining contacts of people with flulike symptoms.\n\nToday, politicians in many areas are using these a falling number of infections as a barometer for reopening their economies, though statisticians consider these nearly meaningless. Leaders instinctively want to take credit for ameliorating the public's suffering, but the deciding factor is now on their shoulders: Do they have a plan to test nursing home and health care workers regularly? Do they have a plan for contact tracing? Is there a way to monitor the virus through random sampling?\n\nSweden took a more sustainable approach -- cancelling big gatherings but otherwise keeping the economy running while attempting to protect those most likely to get severely sick. There were no mandatory lockdowns. Sandman says that's what he expected here. \"Sweden only looks weird and extreme because the rest of the world did something weird and extreme.\"\n\nAnd yet Sweden does have a higher death rate than its neighbors, warns Harvard epidemiology professor Caroline Buckee. A slower spreading disease needs to infect fewer people to reach herd immunity, she says, provided certain assumptions about the length of immunity are correct. Buckee says people should wait to venture out until there are plans for dealing with future spikes, including testing and contact tracing and increasing hospital capacity.\n\nLockdowns were supposed to be a stopgap to let slow-moving officials get those plans in place, not a long-term solution. Epidemiologists tend to focus on what will save the most lives from a given disease at any cost, but Buckee admits that keeping everyone forced inside their homes until there's a vaccine is not an option anyone is seriously considering.\n\nStrict shutdown measures are good for protecting public officials from appearing responsible for any deaths. They also, to some degree, shift the blame for continued infections to the public -- any increase in cases can be blamed on people's failure to comply with rules so strict that even epidemiologists and health officials have been caught breaking them.\n\nThose wanting to lift lockdowns aren't necessarily denying the seriousness of the disease. Our safety can't be bought by more suffering. At this point we've done our part, and public safety depends on what health authorities and politicians have done with the time we bought them. It's now on them.",

        "body": "More than 600,000 Americans are expected to die this year from cancer. That doesn't slow down for the coronavirus. The good news is that scientists are still working on improving our odds by finding new ways to expand the scope and accuracy of early testing. And they recently had a promising breakthrough.\n\nCancers are much easier to treat if they can be caught before they spread. And yet aggressive screening can have downsides: Recent data show that mammograms and prostate cancer screenings have led people to have unnecessary surgeries and other invasive procedures for cancers that were unlikely to harm them. Such tests can mislead us about our risks.\n\nBut more knowledge is power, and a new blood test has shown the power to detect multiple cancers -- including ovarian and uterine cancer, for which there are no existing screening tests and usually no symptoms until it's far too late for treatments to be effective.\n\nResearchers at Johns Hopkins University studied a group of 10,000 women between ages 65 and 75 with no history of cancer. In 26 of them, the blood test combined with full-body imaging revealed malignant tumors.\n\nThe results, published in Science, were impressive. The 26 women with detected tumors got early treatments for cancer. All are still alive, and most are in remission. On their own, the blood tests generated 101 false positives, but none of those women were mistakenly treated for cancer. Some had unnecessary follow-up tests, such as endoscopies, but none underwent surgeries.\n\nBert Vogelstein, who was one of the authors of the study and has spent years working on early cancer detection, said the test relies on the fact that most cancers have at least one of 16 telltale genetic mutations. When cancer cells die, they leave behind this abnormal DNA in a person's blood stream, even very early in the course of a disease. The blood tests can find it.\n\nThe idea behind the blood test, he told me, is that positive results will be followed up by a full body PET scan, which can confirm whether there's a tumor and locate it. Such scanning would be expensive and cumbersome to do on everyone, but becomes much more manageable if deployed for the 1% of patients with a positive blood test.\n\nThe test detected a number of ovarian cancers, several lung cancers, and a uterine cancer. There was also a case of colorectal cancer and breast cancer that hadn't been picked up by standard screening -- though he said not everyone in the study had followed screening advisories.\n\nHe said the test isn't meant to be a substitute for the screening tests that can pick up those cancers, but a way to get at the other cancers for which there is no early detection method, and which often kill people because they are discovered after they've spread too far to be effectively treated.\n\nIn a previous study, he and colleagues at Johns Hopkins used a blood test on a set of confirmed pancreatic cancer patients and a control group with no known health problems. The test yielded a positive result for most of the cancer cases, and only one of the people in the control group. Whether it was a false positive or an undetected cancer remained unknown.\n\nThis new study was the first of its kind done on subjects believed to be entirely healthy, and in which subjects were told their results so they could seek treatment. The false positives were presumed to be cancer free if no tumors were detected in the imaging, but only time will tell. The test is not ready for standard practice quite yet, but the promising results will lead to more studies to better understand who would benefit from such tests and how to best interpret the results.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has brought with it a deluge of bad news, including that people are getting fewer screening tests. But we should still celebrate good news where we can find it, and a breakthrough in cancer-detection research is undoubtedly something to cheer.",

        "body": "Welcome to a world of short trips, Covid-19 symptom screening and socially distanced sun loungers.\n\nAnyone up for a beach holiday right now? The answer is probably a resounding yes, anything to escape lockdown and incessant worrying about the coronavirus outbreak and imminent global recession.\n\nBut would you actually book one for this summer or even the fall? There the answer is more complicated, as it becomes painfully clear that our next vacations will be close to home and overshadowed by concerns about health precautions.\n\nThere are the optimists: Almost three-quarters of the people who were due to sail in May, but had their dream cruise canceled by British operator Saga Plc, chose to rebook at a later date. The pessimists: More than half of Americans surveyed by Destination Analysts agreed their next vacation would be a \"staycation.\" Those organized souls who planned their July Fourth escapes before Covid-19 was upon us are playing wait-and-see. French hotel giant Accor SA has seen less than 10% of reservations for July and August scrapped. But it's still bracing for occupancy rates of 25-30%, as opposed to 75%, when travel begins again\n\nWhat's clear is that we're all going to be expecting something different for our next getaway: hotels with detailed Covid-19 symptom checks, abundant hand sanitizer, rigorous disinfecting and bars and restaurants configured for social distancing.\n\nThe $5 trillion global tourism industry has already taken a huge hit from the pandemic, and it's not over. Figuring out how to cater to tourists and business travelers in this new era will throw up huge challenges for even the most flexible and deep-pocketed companies. The about 35% gain in the Stoxx 600 Travel & Leisure Index since March 18 looks overly optimistic.\n\nIn the near term, consumers may be reluctant to crowd into airplanes or return to busy tourist hot spots. In response, European discount carrier EasyJet Plc said it's likely to leave middle seats empty on aircraft with a three-seat configuration, at least when it first resumes flights. The cruise industry, a haunting symbol of the Covid-19 outbreak, is likely to promote smaller vessels, which are more easily adapted to social distancing, a robust on-board medical staff and promises to fly holidaymakers home at the first whiff of a problem. Flexible booking policies without any deposit may become the norm. If all this fails to tempt, then deep discounts will be necessary.\n\nThis season may be a washout but there are some signs things will pick back up. Dart Group Plc said on Friday that bookings were still coming in to its Jet2 leisure travel business for late summer. EasyJet said winter bookings were significantly ahead of this time last year. Even if some of this may be rescheduling of trips that were canceled, it illustrates people's eagerness to travel once again. To capture pent-up demand, tour operators including European giant TUI AG and Jet2 have launched their 2021 summer holiday programs early.\n\nIt may still be a hard sell depending on the destination. For Italy, Spain and France, as well as New York City, the repercussions of having been the epicenter of the pandemic at some point may linger even longer. It took about 18 months for travel to Paris to recover completely after the harrowing 2015 terrorist attacks.\n\nWith international flights grounded and foreign tourists unwelcome in most places, it's impossible to say how soon we can start trotting the globe again. The big luxury and event-oriented hotels, such as those operated by Marriott International Inc. and Hyatt Hotels Corp., are more dependent on international travelers than their more downmarket peers. Companies will likely shore up offerings for domestic tourists. For example, Saga, which caters to the 50s-and-over crowd, already offers cruises around the British isles. This business could be expanded if customers are nervous about venturing further afield.\n\nIn more thrifty times, people tend to seek out no-frills lodging. In the U.S., Wyndham Hotels & Resorts Inc., has the most exposure to the economy and mid-scale sectors, with brands such as Super 8, Ramada and Days Inn, according to Brian Egger, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. In Europe, Whitbread Plc has the Premier Inn chain in Germany and the U.K., where 80% of its properties are outside of London.\n\nAirbnb Inc. may be a big beneficiary if tourists seek out private residences to avoid mingling with too many people in hotel lobbies, elevators or restaurants. The trailblazer for the sharing economy may provide more options in smaller towns or isolated regions. But as with hotels, people must have confidence in hosts' hygiene standards.\n\nIt's hard to say just how bad and enduring the impact from this new coronavirus will be. For those companies that manage to adjust, they can expect to be rewarded with some positive long-term prospects, as more people enter the middle class around the world and an aging population has more leisure time. But it will take much more than pictures of idyllic getaways to woo them.",

        "body": "When a forest fire is raging out of control, firefighters are forced to use blunt measures, such as trenches and aerial bombardment, to contain it. But they must also find and extinguish hidden hot spots to make sure the inferno doesn't blaze up again. A pandemic isn't entirely different. Broad lockdowns are a strategy for bringing the novel coronavirus under control. To stamp it out requires a technique that relies on old-fashioned shoe leather, thousands of workers and a high tolerance for boring details: contact tracing.\n\nNot really, although some mobile phone technologies can help with it. (More on that later.) Contact tracing has been a major public-health tool since the U.S. and U.K. first used it against sexually-transmitted infections in the 1930s. It's grunt work. Trained staffers ask infected people detailed questions about where they've been and who they've met. Everyone considered to be a contact -- a categorization that varies depending on how infectious the disease is -- is then informed and given guidance about what to do. In the case of Covid-19, close contact means living with someone who has the coronavirus or, according to one definition, having been in a closed environment within 2 meters (6.5 feet) of such a person for 15 minutes or more. These contacts are usually then advised to self-quarantine at home for 14 days while watching for symptoms.\n\nWhen you have enough resources to track cases. The U.S., U.K. and others tried to use contact tracing at the start of their coronavirus outbreaks but gave up in the face of too many cases. They're now hiring armies of contact tracers in an effort to get started again. Other countries, including South Korea, New Zealand and Germany, have used the strategy to good effect throughout their outbreaks.\n\nA laundry list of infections, including childhood illnesses such as measles that are on the upswing again thanks to skipped vaccinations. It's used regularly in the World Health Organization's effort to eradicate tuberculosis and to advise people who might not realize they've been exposed to sexually transmitted diseases. It was used against the Ebola virus in Africa and against Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which is also caused by a coronavirus. Contact tracing also was an integral part of the successful fight to eliminate smallpox decades ago.\n\nSpeed is a major issue. Between one-third and one-half of transmissions of the new coronavirus may happen before a person is aware that he or she is sick, a University of Oxford research team suggested in a study published in the journal Science. Another is staffing and money. In Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began, some 9,000 specialists worked to track down close contacts of virus patients. The U.S. government is providing $1.3 billion to help pay for a \"contact tracing army\" for New York, the U.S. state hit hardest by the crisis. Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg LP, the parent company of Bloomberg News, is donating $10.5 million to that effort together with Bloomberg Philanthropies.\n\nContact-tracing apps can help, if governments are willing to make them mandatory. In South Korea, authorities are using location data from three mobile carriers and transactions from 22 credit-card issuers to decrease the time it takes to track the movements of infected individuals, from one day to just 10 minutes. China asks people to scan a QR code when entering public places such as shopping malls and offices, making it easier for investigators to later trace those who were in a place at around the same time as an infected person. In countries where data privacy is paramount, it's trickier. \"Near-universal app usage and near-perfect compliance\" would be needed with any voluntary app, the Oxford team said in its study -- meaning that for the U.S. and Europe, apps will probably be just one piece of the contact-tracing puzzle.",

        "body": "Each virus has its unique pattern of spread, and scientists are starting to get a handle on how the novel coronavirus behaves. This understanding is making it possible to rank the risks of different activities from high to low to trivial.\n\nThe most informative studies show how the disease is spreading in the real world -- a big advance over the various simulations and models that, early on, showed only hypothetical scenarios.\n\nThe two drivers of the spread of the disease are close contact and crowding in closed spaces, said Muge Cevik, a virologist at the University of St. Andrews in the U.K. It spread through homeless shelters and nursing and care homes, where people were crowded with many others. It spread through people's households, and through meat packing plants.\n\nCevik has been collecting and reviewing papers from around the world on disease transmission. \"There are some trends emerging,\" she says. \"Spending time dining together, being in public transport,\" might risk spreading the disease, but \"going to a market briefly, for five minutes or a transient encounter while you walk or run past someone, those are low risks.\"\n\nThe studies come from China, Singapore, Taiwan, and to a lesser extent the U.S. They were all done through contact tracing, which may turn out to be humanity's greatest strategy for fighting the Covid-19 pandemic. Contact tracing can stop chains of transmission, even after a disease is widespread, as physician and former World Bank president Jim Yong Kim explained in The New Yorker. Another major benefit is that it offers clues as to how the disease spreads. Each virus has its unique pattern.\n\nThe U.S. has done almost no contact tracing yet. A survey of people coming to hospitals in New York City in May revealed that most of them had been home, and were not working or taking public transport. But why isn't everyone admitted to the hospital being asked about this? Why aren't we finding out who they live with, or who visited them, and tracking down where they've been? The lost opportunities are staggering.\n\nCevik said people often ask her how the disease could be so transmissible if it takes closed environments or close contact to spread. The first part of the answer is that after much speculation of extreme transmissibility, the data show something intermediate, with each infected individual transmitting the virus to between two and three others on average. But the important point, which is often missed, is that this is just an average. In the real world, most people transmit the disease to nobody, or one person, and a minority infect many others in so-called super-spreading events. It's those we must learn how to avoid.\n\nThe data show that nine percent of infected people are responsible for 80% of the transmissions, she says. Why? For one thing, the disease is apparently very infectious but only for a short window, and perhaps only in some cases. Contact tracing studies show people are most infectious right around the onset of symptoms, as well as a couple of days before and after. If someone in that stage goes to a party, or church service, or to work in a meat packing plant or nursing home, many other people will probably get sick.\n\nOne study in China showed how the virus spread at a business meeting and a restaurant. A contact tracing effort in Singapore revealed big clusters of cases stemmed from a business meeting, a church, and a visit to a shop. Another study, one of the few from the U.S., showed how one infected person in Chicago spread the disease to multiple people at a funeral and later at a birthday party, and one of those infected at the party then spread the disease to others at a church service that lasted more than two hours. Other studies connected outbreaks to crowded offices.\n\nPeople who eventually developed severe symptoms were more likely to transmit the disease to others than were those who had mild symptoms, Cevik says. While it's clear the disease can be spread by people before they have symptoms, it's still an open question how many people have no symptoms and whether they are driving much of the spread.\n\nMuch of the material in these studies comes as a surprise to people, says Erin Bromage, a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts, Dartmouth, who recently got 11 million views to a blog post he wrote on how the disease is transmitted. People think if you get exposed, you automatically get sick or become infectious, he explains. But even people exposed to sick family members in their homes don't always get sick.\n\nSharing a home or office does make transmission more likely, since length of exposure matters as much as distance from other people. People passing by you in a supermarket are unlikely to infect you. Outdoor environments appear much safer as well. In one study, which followed hundreds of cases, all but one transmission occurred indoors.\n\n\"I'd like people to stop wasting mental energy on the wrong things,\" Bromage says. \"To stop worrying about outdoors and bike riders since it's such a low risk.\"\n\nBromage doesn't think strict lockdowns have to remain until we get herd immunity or a vaccine. But he would like to see businesses use the data available to start up without fueling major outbreaks. He sees hope for restaurants and hair salons in the new normal, and is advising such businesses in his community on how to minimize exposure.\n\nAs Harvard population medicine professor Julia Marcus recalled in a recent piece in The Atlantic, 20th century doctors eventually relented on advice for unpaired people to remain celibate until there was a cure for AIDS. They started talking about safer sex. Now it's time to do the same with life under the coronavirus.",

        "body": "Inconsistent testing, time lags make daily numbers unreliable\n\nWondering whether it's safe to emerge from lockdown? Watching the daily coronavirus case trackers won't help much. A better indication might come from the length of the lines outside the doctor's office.\n\nTo strike the right balance between restarting the economy and guarding against new waves of the pandemic, countries must focus on more than daily infection numbers and death tolls, according to scientists. That's because these are lagging indicators, showing the virus's trajectory days or even weeks ago. The actual danger level in real time is better seen in more direct indicators.\n\nIn France, for instance, the country is monitoring increases in the number of calls to doctors' hotlines and visits to general practitioners, alongside data like admissions to intensive care. In Germany, there's more focus on the virus's basic reproduction number, or R0, thought to be a leading indicator of sorts. In the U.K., the government has commissioned surveys of people selected at random to gauge more precisely how entrenched the virus might be.\n\nCountries \"need to build up a picture from a range of sources, and some of that is the death data, some of that is the infection data, and then some of that perhaps is survey data,\" said Graham Cooke, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, which is working on a government survey of 100,000 people this week. \"Looking at the number of infections diagnosed as such is quite difficult to interpret on its own.\"\n\nReported cases are a lagging indicator of the impact of easing restrictions because it can take up to two weeks for symptoms to show. Then, when a patient seeks a test, it can take a few days or more for results to come back, if diagnostics are even available.\n\nAs the U.S. and a number of European countries relax lockdown rules in an attempt to restart their economies, the big question is whether those steps will lead to an unmanageable second wave of Covid-19. The roughly 4.4 million confirmed cases globally -- almost certainly an undercount of actual infections -- suggest only a tiny fraction of the world's population have so far contracted the disease.\n\nThe slow rollout of reliable antibody tests, which show who has already had the virus and possibly developed immunity, further clouds the picture. With economies at risk, governments can't afford to wait the many months, or even years, it might take to get a vaccine before allowing more normal life to resume.\n\nBecause testing is inconsistent and the new coronavirus causes mild symptoms in many people, data for new infections can be misleading, missing places where the virus can keep spreading undetected for weeks. Relying on deaths from Covid-19 is even more problematic since it's a lagging indicator: by the time a patient dies, his contact with an infected person goes back several weeks.\n\nWhen it comes to studying mortality, a better option may be to look at excess deaths -- the total number of deaths from all causes and whether it exceeds those reported in prior years.\n\nThe Independent SAGE group, a panel set up as an alternative to the U.K. government's official Covid-19 advisory group, said this week that the country should zero in on these weekly numbers. They may give a more a meaningful view of the pandemic's impact by offering a reliable trend, while coronavirus death statistics can swing from changes in the underlying counting strategies, like the addition of nursing-home deaths in countries that previously didn't include them.\n\nScientists also suggest focusing on multiday moving averages to avoid overreacting to tiny changes in daily tallies. In Germany, for instance, the so-called reproduction rate started creeping up over one again in recent days, just as the country eased its lockdown -- meaning that every infected person was statistically passing it to more than one other person. But scientists advising the German government said individual days couldn't be relied on because of the lag in data, and the rate has since fallen.\n\n\"We just need to look at the graph of daily figures to see the problems\" with only relying on that data, said Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. Moving averages can help \"smooth out the fluctuations. This is the only way to make sense of what we are seeing.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization said Wednesday there are six indications of whether countries have got measures right when easing quarantines. They include the ability to detect, isolate and care for cases, as well as protective measures in workplaces. But even if all the criteria on its list are met, there are no guarantees of success.\n\nIt's \"no time for celebration, but time for preparation,\" WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge said Thursday. \"We have seen that the strongest health systems can be overwhelmed in a couple of weeks.\"",

        "body": "The ability to give truly informed consent is the most important factor.\n\nThe notion of testing Covid-19 vaccines by deliberately infecting volunteers with the novel coronavirus -- something that's now on the table -- isn't necessarily crazy or unethical. It's smart, and it has benefits that far outweigh the risks.\n\nSo-called challenge trials, as scientists call them, vastly speed up the process of vaccine testing and might also help us understand the natural immunity of people who've already been infected.\n\nThis doesn't mean abandoning the framework of medical ethics that protects human research subjects from abuse. It means recognizing that there are risks and benefits unique to this situation.\n\nIn the weekend's Washington Post, philosopher Richard Yetter Chappell and bioethics professor Peter Singer made \"The Case for Experiments on Human Volunteers,\" below which a chorus of commenters fretted that this would exploit poor people, drawn by what few dollars the researchers would hand them as compensation. Some suggested that the authors go first.\n\nThat's not a bad idea, though older males are not the right people to go first (Singer is 73). I should go first. I'm exactly the kind of person who should be part of this experiment. In fact, I just signed up for one.\n\nI found out about the prospect of human challenge studies in late March, when I interviewed Rutgers University ethicist Nir Eyal for a column on rationing ventilators. Later, he gave an interview to the journal Nature on the ethics of human challenge trials.\n\nThe problem with ordinary vaccine efficacy trials is that they're very slow. This is what led Anthony Fauci to warn that it could take 18 months or more to identify a safe vaccine. (The fastest vaccine developed so far -- the one for mumps -- took four years.) Researchers typically have to test the vaccine on large groups of people and compare them to large groups of unvaccinated people, waiting weeks or months until an appreciable number of both the vaccinated test subjects and the unvaccinated control group to become exposed to the illness in the course of their regular daily lives. Challenge trials short-circuit that process by exposing people deliberately to the virus.\n\nSo that I could learn more about volunteering for such a study, Eyal put me in touch with Josh Morrison, who started a foundation called 1daysooner. The website has a place where I was able to add my name to a list of volunteers willing to be Covid-19 vaccine study subjects. Morrison, a former lawyer, told me he started the organization after becoming interested in advocacy and health issues. He's gathered signatures of more than 3,000 people.\n\nBefore Covid-19, his organization facilitated living organ donations. He's donated one of his kidneys to a stranger. But vaccine studies, even if risky, don't require such hyper-altruists. What they do require is subjects with the ability to acquire and understand technical information.\n\nInformed consent is a cornerstone of medical ethics. I've spent decades interviewing scientists, doing research, understanding new ideas and putting them into a readable format. Since February I've been on a steady stream of phone calls with virologists, immunologists, epidemiologists, pulmonologists, hematologists and risk communication experts. I've digested and understood what they've said. I know other vaccines have caused side effects. If anyone could give fully informed consent, I could.\n\nOther volunteers could be selected from the ranks of scientists, medical students, medical ethicists and others who have the relevant skills to become knowledgeable enough to give genuinely informed consent.\n\nStanley Plotkin of the University of Pennsylvania, who invented the rubella vaccine, the R in the standard MMR vaccines, told me they really want volunteers in their twenties, which rules a lot of people out, including me. But others have proposed a more diverse range of ages. While people over 65 would be at too high a risk to be deliberately infected, there's growing evidence that the risks have more to do with comorbidities -- existing health problems -- than age.\n\nVolunteers could be screened for the most high-risk comorbidities, and older volunteers should be female, since we're at lower risk than males. Older volunteers should be thinner and fitter and have lower cholesterol and blood pressure than the average American 20-something.\n\nEyal had originally suggested that whether the vaccine worked, volunteers would leave these studies with protective antibodies and the gift of immunity -- something that's become much-coveted in the age of Covid-19. But immunity to this new disease is not well understood, so the dream of \"immunity passports\" won't become a reality anytime soon. At the very least, volunteers could test the protective value of these natural antibodies.\n\nThat's something I learned from Plotkin. He said that even before vaccine trials began, human volunteers who tested positive for antibodies could participate in experiments where they got exposed to small doses of the virus to find out if these antibodies were indeed protective.\n\nSince the amount of virus you're exposed to might affect the course of disease, the doctors would want to use the minimum amount needed to develop symptoms in order to minimize risk.\n\nI've already canvassed some experts who say a challenge wouldn't necessarily be riskier than getting the virus out in the world, as most of us probably will without a vaccine. It might even be safer, since volunteers would likely be supervised and treated early with the best standard of care. There is a slight risk of something called antibody-dependent enhancement -- in which the vaccine actually helps the virus get into cells. Something like that happened with a dengue vaccine, but you'd have to be extremely unlucky for it to happen in this case without showing up in animal studies.\n\nThough some ethicists have debated paying volunteers, this would be a mistake. It would lead to the perception that the scientists were preying on those who need money. Nobody should participate in this kind of trial for the money.\n\nBut we should also recognize that, unlike a kidney donation, participation in Covid-19 vaccine trials wouldn't be purely altruistic, either. Unlike kidney donors, volunteers would benefit from being perhaps the first to feel safe from the disease. They'll also share in the collective benefit accrued from a broader return to a normal life when more of us have the freedom to move about, do our jobs, and find love and companionship.\n\nThere's always the possibility that something unpredictable could go wrong -- and that could lead to a public-relations nightmare that could derail vaccine research. But the bad PR might be worse if something happened to an innocent young person than to a considerably older, wiser, more informed person who knew what she was walking into.\n\nLittle about America's approach to the pandemic has been ethical to date. We weren't given informed consent about the lockdowns -- many people don't understand their purpose, or their limitations. There's also been little informed consent on lifting them -- it's not clear whether people understand that the risk of contracting Covid-19 remains as large as ever in the U.S.\n\nThe lockdowns only delay deaths from the virus. A vaccine would end them. Surely that's a reward for which some of us are willing to risk ourselves.",

        "body": "The power of the coronavirus is not that it's particularly lethal or especially easy to catch from someone else, but rather that it's stealthy. Infected people can pass it on to others before they realize they're sick, or even if they never develop symptoms at all, making them unwitting spreaders. The defense against the virus's insidiousness is thorough testing, to reveal where it is and might be in order to stop its spread, and to determine where it has been, which may help restart economies.\n\nThere are two main types. The first tests whether you are actively infected with the virus. Known as an antigen test, it looks for the presence of the virus, typically in your nose or throat. The second type tests whether you were infected with the virus and beat it. Known as an antibody test, it looks for evidence, generally from a blood sample, that your immune system has built up antibodies to fight off the virus.\n\nWhile there are a couple of different types, most people are familiar with so-called molecular tests. These became available for the novel coronavirus in the middle of January after Chinese researchers published the genome sequence of the virus. A molecular test looks for bits of the virus's nucleic acids, or its genetic materials, in a sample of secretions from the nose or sputum from the throat. The test generally requires several components, from swabs to chemical reagents to small plastic containers -- shortages of which have led to a shortfall of tests in many places, including the U.S. and the U.K. It also relies on trained lab technicians and sophisticated equipment, including instruments that perform a process called reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, a method to amplify the virus's genetic material enough to study it in detail.\n\nYes. Another type of antigen test that is just starting to appear looks for bits of the virus's protein armor in a sample from a person's respiratory tract. This technique is more difficult to get right initially but could offer a way to test people much more quickly and cheaply. No one has yet shown that a do-it-yourself test for coronavirus, akin to a home pregnancy test, is effective. U.S. regulators in mid-April gave emergency authorization to a test that people take at home but have to send to a lab for processing.\n\nIf everyone in the world stopped interacting with anybody else for two weeks, the coronavirus would die out because it wouldn't be able to infect anyone new. But since that's not possible, the goal is to reduce spread from person to person as much as possible. To do that effectively, it's necessary to know who is infected, so that they can be quarantined and so that all their recent, close contacts can be identified, tested and quarantined as well. This \"contact tracing\" slows the spread of the virus, since it lets people know when they're most likely to be spreaders, even if they don't feel symptoms.\n\nThey're certainly imperfect. Tests have been rolled out quickly, without undergoing rigorous validation for accuracy. In a study published in February of 1,014 suspected coronavirus cases in a hospital in Wuhan, China, 88% tested positive using CT scans of the chest whereas only 59% did so using antigen tests. Factors potentially undermining accuracy include a shortage of supplies and material for the tests, long incubation times for the infection and the challenge of getting an adequate sample from a patient.\n\nWhen a virus infects you, your body summons antibodies specifically designed to latch onto and neutralize the proteins that form the bulk of the virus itself -- like keys designed to unlock a particular door. Those antibodies typically linger for months or years after you recuperate, in case you encounter the virus again. To make the tests, developers either grow in a lab -- or buy from a supplier -- copies of a particular virus's proteins. The proteins for the coronavirus can flag whether a blood sample contains antibodies designed to fight the virus. To work well, the tests have to be highly specific, so they don't say \"positive\" when, in fact, they have found similarly shaped antibodies that once fought off, say, a different coronavirus that causes the common cold.\n\nIn theory, those who have defeated the coronavirus and have built up immunity should be free to re-enter society for some period of time with little or no risk of getting sick with it again or spreading the virus. There are growing calls for antibody tests to be rolled out on a wide scale to identify these individuals and let them get back to work to open up the economy as much as possible.\n\nIt's unknown how strong immunity will be for different people infected with the coronavirus and how long it will last. A 2007 study showed antibodies to the coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) appear to dissipate after an average of two years. Another report found those generated by infection with the coronavirus behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) tend to stick around a bit longer, but not in everyone. And neither study demonstrated whether the presence of antibodies was protection against re-infection.\n\nThat's another caveat. Antibody tests for the novel coronavirus are too new to have been proven reliable. A danger is that individuals who receive a false positive for coronavirus antibodies and stop social distancing will become infected and carry the virus back into their households.",

        "body": "Success depends on people trusting government with their data\n\nThe U.K. took its own route into a coronavirus lockdown, and now appears to be pursuing its own route out as well, developing a contact-tracing mobile-phone app that works differently from those favored by many other countries.\n\nThe app, rolled out for trial on the Isle of Wight Thursday, is central to the efforts of Boris Johnson's government to end the restrictions that have shut much of the British economy. If people can be quickly isolated after they've come into contact with an infected person, others can be allowed to go about their lives.\n\nBut success depends on the app working, and on very large numbers of people trusting the government with their data. Privacy campaigners and data scientists warn that the U.K. is putting both of those at risk by adopting its own model, rather than the one supported by Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Apple Inc.\n\nRead More: U.K. Virus App Contains Privacy Loopholes, Advocacy Group Says\n\n\"The National Health Service does not have a good record with this -- moving really fast, nimbly, understanding technology,\" said Neil Bacon, a doctor and founder of information-sharing networks Doctors.net.uk and iWantGreatCare.org. \"People are right to raise more than an eyebrow when they see that the NHS is going left and Google, Apple, and most of the world is going right.\"\n\nFrom initially resisting calls for a lockdown to failing to join a European Union effort to buy much-needed personal protective equipment, the U.K. has gone its own way during the pandemic, with questionable results. Britain is now the European country with the highest level of Covid-19 deaths.\n\nWith the U.S., Germany, Italy and others leaning toward the model supported by the American tech giants, some academics, lawmakers and members of the general public have suggested Britain could be making another misstep. The government disagrees.\n\n\"The NHS app will significantly speed up contact tracing and help us stop the spread of the virus,\" the Department of Health and Social Care said in an emailed statement. \"It is a key part of our wider strategy of testing and tracing, and will enable us to alert those most at risk of infection so they can take action to protect themselves, the people they care about and the NHS.\"\n\nBoth the U.K. and other countries' approaches use Bluetooth on smartphones to detect and keep track of who a person meets -- raising questions about privacy. Tracing apps supported by Apple and Google try to mitigate those risks by using a \"decentralized\" model that keeps the contact information on an individual's phone.\n\nUnder this approach, each phone regularly checks in with a central server to determine whether it has been near someone on an anonymous list of users who have tested positive for Covid-19. If it has, the owner is notified.\n\nThe U.K. argues this misses the opportunity to study how the virus is spread, and is proposing a \"centralized\" model. With its method, a user who develops coronavirus symptoms presses a button on the app, which then uploads its record of contacts to a central server. Those are then decrypted and messages are sent to each affected person.\n\nMatthew Gould, chief executive officer of the health service's digital arm, NHSX, which is developing the app, pointed out the benefits of the British model when he appeared before a parliamentary committee on May 4. It allows scientists to get more information about how the virus spreads.\n\n\"We are balancing privacy with the need for the public health authorities to get insight into what symptoms subsequently lead to people testing positive,\" he said.\n\nThe British setup would also make it easier to inform people if their contact who showed symptoms subsequently tested negative for the virus.\n\nBut the merits of a centralized model could be outweighed if they come at the cost of trust, even though the U.K. app never asks for a user's name.\n\n\"This is essentially usable as a surveillance system. I'm not saying they intend to use it as that, but they could use it as that,\" said Mark Ryan, a professor in computer security at the University of Birmingham. \"What I would really like to see is a much clearer statement about how this data can be used, how it's being siloed from other databases, and what kind of end they can promise\" to its use.\n\nForging its own path also raises technical questions because it cuts the U.K. off from tight integration into Apple and Google's operating systems. There are doubts about how well the app will work, whether it will be active when the screen is off, and whether it will start automatically when the phone reboots.\n\nThe app is being built for the NHS by VMware Pivotal Labs, a software development consultancy that is part of VMware Inc. Several other organizations are actively helping the NHS to develop and test the app.\n\nThe U.K. government began discussing the app in early March. At that point, scientists and ministers were resisting calls for a full lockdown, instead talking up the benefits of allowing the infection to spread among low-risk groups to develop \"herd immunity.\" Authorities were also insisting that the U.K.'s low capacity to test people for the virus wasn't a serious issue.\n\nThose early misjudgments have since been reversed: herd immunity was dropped, and testing dramatically ramped up. As Britons begin emerging from lockdown, experts say getting contact tracing right the first time is crucial.",

It's been grim reading.\n\nDespite having only 11 million people, the country has reported more deaths from the disease than China. With some 57 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, it has the highest per-capita death rate in the world -- almost four times that of the U.S.\n\nAccording to Belgian officials, the reason for the grisly figures isn't overwhelmed hospitals -- 43% of intensive-care beds were vacant even at the peak of the crisis -- but the country's bureaucratic rigor.\n\nRead More: Belgium to Gradually Ease Virus Lockdown in First Half of May\n\nUnlike many other countries, the home of the European Union's top institutions counts deaths at nursing homes even if there wasn't a confirmed infection.\n\n\"We often get criticism -- oh, you're making Belgium look bad -- we think it's the opposite,\" Steven Van Gucht, head of the viral disease division at the Sciensano public-health institute, said while maintaining the requisite distance of 1.5 meters (5 feet). \"If you want to compare our numbers with a lot of other countries, you basically have to cut them in half.\"\n\nAbout 95% of Covid-19 deaths in elderly care homes haven't been diagnosed, yet Belgium makes the decision to register them based on the symptoms shown and who the people have been in contact with. The goal is to get a clearer picture of the outbreak and better target hot spots.\n\nAt the start of each briefing at the Residence Palais, a stone's throw from the European Commission, Belgian officials detail the day's statistics in French and Dutch. They draw particular attention to those who die outside of hospitals -- typically around half the total.\n\nRead more: Coronavirus Is Leading to Europe's Highest Deaths in Decades\n\nThe impact of the disease on vulnerable care-home residents is a growing issue. While Europe knew it would need more ventilators and intensive-care capacity once the virus spread beyond China, the impact on nursing homes was unexpected, according to Agoritsa Baka, a senior expert at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\n\"It's a disaster,\" she said. \"We did not realize how devastating Covid would be if it entered these populations.\"\n\nYet not all European countries are measuring the impact in the same way, meaning that the numbers of coronavirus deaths are likely thousands higher than the official count of more than 110,000.\n\nThe consequence of uneven practices was evident in France. When the country reported data from some nursing homes for the first time in early April, those fatalities were almost double the number of people that died in hospitals.\n\nLast week, Spain had to adjust its historical data after Catalonia started including people who had symptoms but didn't test positive. This week a local radio broadcaster reported that more than 6,800 elderly died in Spanish nursing homes with symptoms but weren't recorded in official data.\n\nGermany's unusually low mortality rate may be helped by the fact that the country only counts deaths that have a positive virus test.\n\nSuch discrepancies show up in a concept called \"excess mortality,\" the number of extra fatalities above typical trends. In Belgium, just over 300 people normally die every day, but this year, it's jumped to nearly 600.\n\nA project called euroMOMO, originally developed for gauging the scale of flu epidemics, is now being used to track the impact of the coronavirus in Europe.\n\nBelgium's practice means that nearly all deaths are accounted for in a given week, while neighboring Netherlands has around 1,000 undefined fatalities. Some countries' virus deaths are around a sixth of their excess mortality rates.\n\nBetter tracking could help improve Europe's response to outbreaks, especially as the region gradually eases lockdown restrictions, raising the prospect of second-wave outbreaks. Coordinated procedures could also defuse tensions as Europe grapples with recovery efforts.\n\n\"We are still in a situation where within the EU we do not count the same way, which could lead to political misunderstandings,\" said Pascal Canfin, chair of EU Parliament's environment and health committee. \"It leads to different perception awareness of the crisis.\"\n\nIn the meantime, the world's eyes shouldn't be focused on Belgium because at least the extent of the problem is known, according to Van Gucht.\n\n\"When you have a good surveillance system, you report a lot of cases,\" he said. \"It's the countries that are not reporting or that are reporting very low numbers, you should be more worried about.\"",

The coronavirus may pose an even bigger threat.\n\nThe pandemic jeopardizes the future of a 134-year-old industry that once employed more than half a million workers on the world's biggest gold field. While Cyril Ramaphosa's government has been praised for its rapid response to the health crisis, the country's five-week lockdown and the strict conditions attached to reopening gold mines risks undermining their viability.\n\nTo ensure the social distancing needed to safeguard tens of thousands of workers in the world's deepest mines, the nation's gold producers will only be allowed to operate with half their normal employees. That may make them unprofitable, even as they struggle with the added burden of screening workers for virus symptoms and testing of those who display them.\n\n\"They are pretty much on a cliff,\" said Rene Hochreiter, an analyst at Noah Capital Markets Ltd. \"Nobody is going to make money at 50%.\"\n\nFor more on the challenges of restarting the mines click here\n\nWith no sign of a cure or vaccine for Covid-19 anytime soon, much will depend on how long the operating restrictions are applied.\n\nGold Fields Ltd. may limit cost increases at its South Deep mine to 5%, but only if it can reach full capacity by the end of May, according to Chief Executive Officer Nick Holland. In the meantime, further virus infections could temporarily halt operations again, he said.\n\n\"How much are we going to lose on productivity? That's a tough one,\" Holland said. \"If we are stuck at 50% beyond the end of May, then we will have to relook at all the numbers.\"\n\nSouth African gold mines already have some of the world's highest production costs, averaging about $1,000 an ounce, according to RMB Morgan Stanley. That makes the industry \"more vulnerable,\" said James Wellsted, a spokesman for Sibanye Stillwater Ltd.\n\n\"We are only building to 50% capacity, which is positive, but not viable for an extended period,\" he said.\n\nMarian Van Der Walt, spokeswoman for Harmony Gold Mining Co., the nation's largest gold producer by volume, declined to comment.\n\nSome mines may only achieve 30% of their previous output with half their workforce, said Tebello Chabana, senior executive for public affairs and transformation at the Minerals Council South Africa, which represents most producers. Others are warning it may already be too late.\n\nVillage Main Reef, owned by Hong Kong-based Heaven-Sent Gold Group Co., has notified the government and labor unions that it may cut more than 6,000 jobs as losses deepen due to the national lockdown, CEO Jeff Dong said.\n\n\"We had restructured the mines by cutting a lot of costs,\" Dong said. \"Unfortunately as we started to see signs of a turnaround, Covid-19 forced us to shut down completely.\"\n\nFor more on the decline of South Africa's gold industry click here\n\nStill, it's too early to sound the death knell for South Africa's gold industry, according to Noah Capital's Hochreiter. Restarting the mines may at least allow producers to cover the costs of salaries and electricity, he said.\n\nProducers are also benefiting from the rand's 25% decline against the dollar this year, which lowers their costs. At the same time, a 12% rise in the dollar price of bullion is boosting revenue.\n\nThat may not be enough to counter the impact of reduced operating levels, according to Arnold Van Graan, a mining analyst at Nedbank Ltd.\n\n\"One thing that's critical for mining, especially deep-level underground mining, is volumes,\" Van Graan said. \"The industry needs to find a way to ramp up to full capacity as soon as possible.\"",

        "body": "Infections come as China cautiously reopens reeling economy\n\nWuhan has ordered officials to test its entire population of 11 million people after the central Chinese city where the coronavirus pandemic began reported new infections for the first time since its lockdown was lifted.\n\nAll districts in the city have been told to submit a plan laying out how they will prepare to conduct testing of everyone under their purview within 10 days, according to a document from Wuhan's anti-virus department cited in Chinese state media reports. The plans should prioritize the testing of vulnerable groups and areas like residential compounds, the document is cited as saying.\n\nSix locally transmitted cases, reported on May 10 and 11, were found in people already under quarantine classed as being asymptomatic before testing positive, according to the local government. All six cases emerged from a single residential compound in Wuhan and were the first new infections found in the city since its lockdown was lifted on April 8.\n\nWuhan Emerges From Lockdown With a Mission: Our Goal Is Survival\n\nThe ambitious plan to test everyone in Wuhan reflects China's anxiety over a resurgence of the virus, which it managed to stamp out through restrictions that locked down hundreds of millions of people at its peak in February. Wuhan was sealed off from Jan. 23 until April 8 in a months-long ordeal that saw scores die as the local health system became overwhelmed.\n\nEven as its people cautiously return to normal life, Wuhan remains in the global spotlight with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration claiming that the virus somehow emerged from a laboratory run by the Wuhan Institute of Virology. China has denied any link and the laboratory's director said that no staff have been infected, which he said disproves the theory.\n\nRead more about the researchers hunting the virus' true origin\n\nAlthough the new cases in Wuhan are few and appear under control, they serve as a reminder of the risk China faces as it tries to reopen an economy that has seen its worst contraction since 1992.\n\n\"Seven provinces reported new infections over the past 14 days, and clustered cases were continuing to increase,\" Mi Feng, spokesman for the National Health Commission, said on Monday. China reported only one confirmed case on Tuesday, with no new infections in Wuhan.\n\nChina's massive effort to assess the pandemic's hold on the city contrasts with narrower approaches in the U.S. and the U.K., where testing has been limited to patients with symptoms due to a lack of equipment as well as a desire to preserve those tools. Diagnostic testing tells doctors nothing about a brewing contamination or a past infection, it can only reveal whether someone is harboring the virus at the time of the test.\n\nFears of a coronavirus resurgence in other parts of China were highlighted on Sunday when the northeastern city of Shulan, which borders North Korea, was partially locked down after 11 new infections were discovered. Many cities in China still don't allow cinemas and bars to operate, and heavy restrictions against social gatherings remain in place. Face masks are required on public transport and to enter stores and public facilities.\n\nInside the Dystopian, Post-Lockdown World of Wuhan",
