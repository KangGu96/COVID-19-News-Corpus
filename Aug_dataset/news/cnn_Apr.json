        "body": "(CNN)The patient had been relatively fine for the first 10 days he was down with Covid-19.\n\nJust 38, he didn't fit the description of people at high risk of complications from the new coronavirus. \"He had mild pulmonary symptoms that he was just sitting at home with,\" said Dr. Sean Wengerter, a vascular surgeon in Pomona, New York. \"He had been diagnosed at an urgent care clinic and it was going fine at home. He just had a little cough.\"Until one of Covid-19's surprising effects kicked in.\"Then he just woke up with both his legs numb and cold and so weak he couldn't walk,\" said Wengerter, who is division chief of vascular surgery at Westchester Medical Center Health's Good Samaritan Hospital.Read MoreCoronavirus can cause blood clotsThis relatively young man had an aortic occlusion -- a big blood clot in the body's main artery, right above where it splits into two parts to run into each leg. Blood was not getting into the iliac arteries and his legs were being starved.It's an extremely dangerous development that can kill between 20% and 50% of patients, Wengerter said. \"It just doesn't usually happen in a 38-year-old,\" he told CNN.Quick diagnosis and a surgical procedure to slice open the arteries and scoop out the clot using a catheter saved the patient. \"We had two surgeons working simultaneously on him,\" Wengerter said.Doctors treating coronavirus patients are seeing a range of odd and frightening syndromes, including blood clots of all sizes throughout the body, kidney failure, heart inflammation and immune complications.\"One thing that is both curious and evolving and frustrating is that this disease is manifesting itself in so many different ways,\" said Dr. Scott Brakenridge, an assistant professor on the acute care surgery team at the University of Florida College of Medicine. It can also cause multi-system organ failure\"In some cases it's having severe effects on the patient's ability to breathe, and in others it seems to be associated with development of multi-system organ failure -- when all your organs shut down. And now it's associated with immune effects in children.\"While the new coronavirus is designated as a respiratory virus, it's clear that it is affecting some people throughout their bodies. The most obvious symptoms of infection are classic respiratory symptoms: fever, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.But the virus also seems to attack some organs directly. One of the most troubling is its assault on the lining of the blood vessels, which in turn causes unnatural blood clotting.\"It seems like Covid, the virus, is creating a local inflammatory response that's leading to some of these thrombotic events,\" Wengerter said. \"This is happening because of the direct action of the virus on the arteries themselves.\"Other teams of doctors have reported unusual strokes in younger patients, as well as pulmonary embolisms, the medical name for blood clots in the lungs.Pathologists are finding tiny blood clots in the smallest vessels, as well, said Dr. Oren Friedman, who has been taking care of Covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. \"There's no debate -- the virus seems to affect thrombosis and seems to directly affect your blood vessels,\" Friedman told CNN. And that means it affects the whole body.\"Obviously, every single organ in your body is fed by blood vessels, so if the virus affects your blood vessels, then you can have organ damage,\" he said.\"It is a very confusing picture. It's going to take time to understand,\" Brakenridge said.It might cause children's immune systems to overreactOne of the most frightening syndromes that might be linked with Covid-19 is \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\" New York City reports 52 cases, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday, and the New York State Department of Health says it is investigating 100 cases.It is characterized by persistent fever, inflammation, poor function in one or more organs, and other symptoms that resemble shock, a panel of pediatricians known as the International PICU-COVID-19 Collaboration says. \"In some cases, children present with shock and some have features of Kawasaki disease, whereas others may present with signs of cytokine storm. In some geographic areas, there has been an uptick in Kawasaki disease cases in children who don't have shock,\" Boston Children's Hospital rheumatologist Dr. Mary Beth Son said. Kawasaki disease involves inflammation in the walls of medium-sized arteries and can damage the heart.It may be caused by an immune system response known as a cytokine storm, doctors say.\"Your immune system is overreacting to the virus, and because these are inflammatory diseases, this overreaction can cause a Kawasaki-like disease,\" Dr. Glenn Budnick, a pediatrician in Pomona, New Jersey, said on CNN Newsroom Saturday. \"It is even possible that the antibodies that children are making to SARS-CoV2 are creating an immune reaction in the body. Nobody knows,\" said Dr. Jane Newburger, a cardiologist on the Boston Children's panel and an expert on Kawasaki disease.Cytokine storm may also cause some of the lung damage and unusual blood clotting seen in adult patients, doctors said.\"There is other evidence that the virus really doesn't generate a strong immune response and actually it is suppressing the immune system,\" Brakenridge said. That would allow the virus to more directly attack organs.A study published in the journal Nature Medicine on Tuesday supported both theories.Dr. Zheng Zhang and colleagues at Shenzhen Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, China analyzed samples of immune cells taken from the lungs of nine coronavirus patients and found abnormally high levels of immune cells called macrophages and neutrophils, as well as immune signaling chemicals called cytokines and chemokines in the sicker patients. Sicker patients also had high levels of proliferating T-cells, another type of immune cell. But the patients with the most severe symptoms had lower numbers of CD8 T-cells, which directly kill virus-infected cells.Doctors say they are finding that various treatments can help control symptoms. Blood thinners can help control the unusual blood clotting, while immune blockers may help control the cytokine storm.It can cause 'Covid toes' One last symptom that is puzzling -- but less troubling -- is known as \"Covid toes.\" Patients are reporting red or purple swelling of their toes.It's possible the tiny blood clots associated with Covid-19 are causing it, doctors said.\"One pattern of COVID toes that people are reporting is red lesions typically on the soles. It's possible that this is a skin reaction or caused by a small clog or micro clots in the blood vessels found in the toes,\" Cleveland Clinic pulmonologist Dr. Humberto Choi said on the clinic's website.It's not usually associated with any serious symptoms, Choi said.",

        "body": "(CNN)The father of a 14-year-old boy now recovering from a coronavirus-related syndrome says all the symptoms began with a slight fever and some rashes on his son's hands in mid-April.\n\nThe condition, which doctors are calling multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, has shown up in children across the US -- and internationally.\"We dismissed it,\" John McMorrow told CNN's Don Lemon Monday night. \"We spoke to his pediatrician and he gave us some antibiotics, he had a slight fever. But within five days it blew up to be a lot more than that.\"Jack McMorrow said he didn't think his symptoms had anything to do with coronavirus because it all began with a sore throat. But days later, he was hospitalized with heart failure and his fever was so high he \"couldn't move anything.\" Read More\"Even for others to move my limbs at all, it was painful,\" he said. \"The only way I could describe it is that it felt like almost electricity or fire coursing through my veins.\"Doctors across the country have been investigating similar cases in at least 150 children, most of them in New York. The condition seems to be affecting youth after they've had a bout with coronavirus, doctors said last week. \"This multisystem inflammatory syndrome is not directly caused by the virus,\" Dr. Jeffrey Burns, a critical care specialist at Boston Children's Hospital, told CNN. \"The leading hypothesis is that it is due to the immune response of the patient.\"Similar cases have been reported internationally, including in the United Kingdom and Italy. Positive for both virus and antibodies McMorrow's doctor, Dr. Thomas Connors, from NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, told Lemon Monday when he became involved the teen was experiencing a high fever, high heart rate and low blood pressure. \"He was showing signs of having shock,\" Connors said, and added the boy had no known pre-existing conditions.McMorrow tested positive for both coronavirus and antibodies. \"It shows us two different things, two different aspects of this infection,\" the doctor said. \"When you have an active infection and especially one that is transmitted by the respiratory tract, you can find it first in your upper respiratory tract, in the nose and in the throat,\" he said. \"After you've had an infection what you hope will happen (is that) your immune system will develop protection to it if you see it again and the most common thing to look for for protection is antibodies.\"McMorrow's test results showed the teenager had a previous infection or enough time with the disease to develop antibodies but also still had an active strain of the virus in his nose, according to the doctor.",

Symptoms similar to Kawasaki DiseaseSome of the patients experienced persistent fever and features similar to Kawasaki disease or features of toxic shock syndrome, the alert said.Read MoreKawasaki disease causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart. It is usually treatable and most children recover without serious problems, but it can be deadly.At least five of the cases required a ventilator and more than half of the patients required blood pressure support. So far, no fatalities have been reported among the New York City patients. A team at Stanford Children's Hospital in California has reported a case with similar features.Pediatric specialists in the UK recently warned that a small number of children were becoming ill with the rare syndrome that could be linked to coronavirus. The Paediatric Intensive Care Society UK (PICS) warned about a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children, some who had tested positive for Covid-19, presenting \"overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters.\"Similar cases have also been reported in Italy and Spain.",

        "body": "(CNN)Two coronavirus studies released Friday -- one involving almost 2,000 people from Florida and the other from a Washington state nursing home -- came to the same conclusion: Many of the people who tested positive for the virus didn't know it they had it because they showed no symptoms.\n\nThe findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that people who don't feel sick are contributing to the spread of the deadly virus that has swept the world.The pandemic has taken at least 50,890 lives in the US, according to tallies collected by Johns Hopkins University. Were Covid-19 cases undercounted in Miami-Dade?Miami-Dade County and the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine conducted a random antibody testing study of the county's 2.75 million residents, with about 1,800 people participating, Miami Mayor Carlos Gimenez said Friday during a news conference.Read MoreThe data showed 6% of the people in the study tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, which extrapolates to around 165,000 residents, Gimenez said.In comparison, the Florida Department of Health says 10,701 people have tested positive in Miami-Dade County.That means that the actual number of Covid-19 cases in Miami-Dade County is about 16.5 times the number reported by the state, Gimenez said.Gimenez said this appears to mean a significant number of his constituents were carrying the virus while being asymptomatic. He emphasized that imposing social distancing requirements has worked. For that reason, Gimenez said any reopening strategy will require strict rules regarding social distancing with police enforcement of those rules.\"Identifying the number of asymptomatic individuals is critically important for public health,\" Gimenez said. \"Like I have said before, those are the folks who can pass on the virus to the most vulnerable.\"According to Gimenez, the study's researchers are 95% certain that the true number of people infected in Miami-Dade County is between 4.4% and 7.9%, or between 123,000 and 221,000 people.The data shows that the African Americans and Caribbean communities might be twice as likely to be infected with Covid-19 than other racial groups, Gimenez said.In nursing home, 1 in 4 infected residents diesThe Washington state study was performed by researchers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the health departments of Washington and Seattle-King County.The study did not identify the nursing home, so it's not known if the researchers investigated Life Care Center in Kirkland, which became the first epicenter for the coronavirus. At least 35 coronavirus deaths are associated with the facility, according to officials. The virus infected two-thirds of residents and dozens of staff members.In the study released Friday, more than half of the residents at a nursing home tested positive for coronavirus without showing symptoms.\"Transmission from asymptomatic residents infected with (the coronavirus) most likely contributed to the rapid and extensive spread of infection to other residents and staff,\" the researchers wrote in their study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Just over three weeks after the nursing home's first case was identified, 64% of residents had been infected with the virus, researchers said. One in four infected residents died.Of those who tested positive, 56% didn't feel sick at the time, the researchers said. But most of them later developed symptoms, which means they were pre-symptomatic when they got tested, according to the study.Most coronavirus tests look for snippets of genetic material from the virus, so positive tests don't always mean someone is infectious.But in this study, researchers found that more than two-thirds of people were giving off live, infectious virus when they tested positive before showing symptoms.The researchers cautioned their study was conducted in nursing homes, which means it can't necessarily be generalized to the public at large. Still, the study supports the use of face masks when people are in crowded places, according to a commentary published in the NEJM by virologist Diane Havlir of the University of California, San Francisco, and her colleagues.The findings also mean that people without symptoms may need to be tested in so-called congregate living situations, like such as nursing homes, prisons and homeless shelters, they said.\"Current U.S. testing capability must increase immediately for this strategy to be implemented,\" they said. \"This unprecedented pandemic calls for unprecedented measures to achieve its ultimate defeat.\"Two other studies, from Boston and IcelandOther studies have found many people who have or had the coronavirus and didn't know it and that asymptomatic people are helping to spread to the virus. An outbreak in a Boston homeless shelter prompted officials to do more testing. Of the 146 people who tested positive, all of them were considered asymptomatic, the study found.A study in Santa Clara County, California, estimated that 2.49% to 4.16% of people in the country had been infected with Covid-19 by April 1. This represents between 48,000 and 81,000 people, which is 50 to 85 times what county officials recorded by that date: 956 confirmed cases.In Iceland, testing showed that fewer than 1% of the tests came back positive for the virus, according to the founder of the testing company. But around 50% of those who tested positive said they were asymptomatic.",

        "body": "Coventry, England (CNN)A nurse opens a hole in the oxygen hood to feed a patient with a straw. Thick bandage gloves cover the hands of a patient to stop them, bewildered and sedated, from tearing out uncomfortable tubes. A nurse says loudly to one Covid-19 sufferer on ventilation: \"Do you remember me?\" The focus and dedication is as overwhelming as the silence, broken only by the bleep of pagers and ventilators, calling the somber rhythm of the hospital's ICU.\n\nWeeks into Britain's pandemic, the agony of Covid-19 is still lethal and urgent in the General Critical Care unit of University Hospital Coventry (known as UHCW). During the 24 hours we spent in the hospital, two patients died and two recovered enough to leave the intensive care unit (ICU). But every day, more come in. And the fear of a second wave, once the lockdown ends, hangs over an exhausted, yet resilient staff.\"For the next six weeks, we're on standby,\" said ICU consultant Roger Townsend. \"For another one.\" Aoife Abbey, another consultant, agreed. \"I feel like one will come and I think we'll do what we've done before, which is our best, and hopefully we'll get through it.\"UHCW is one of the largest hospitals in the Midlands, the worst-hit area of the UK after London. It offers two global warnings. First: Doctors fear that a second wave could be just weeks away, if the lockdown lifts and Britons again begin to move around and infect each other at higher rates. And the second? Just because a country's capital city is seeing the virus ebb, doesn't mean it is not still ravaging the regions. In UHCW, the ICU has more than a dozen patients and over 170 people have either tested positive for Covid or possibly been infected. Since the pandemic began, about 170 have died from Covid there. The pain of UHCW's exposure to Covid-19 hasn't brought the comfort of knowing it better. \"It's like nothing we've seen before,\" said Townsend. \"We don't really understand it. Most respiratory failure manifests itself in a text book way, but these patients? It doesn't manifest like that.\"Read MoreBut they understand too intimately the agonizing solitude the disease imposes on its victims. To prevent infection from spreading, patients must live their last hours without their family nearby, and only doctors and nurses with them as they die.\"I've held a telephone to the ear of a gentleman who was dying, so that his wife could speak to him,\" said Townsend. \"He was sedated, but we would always assume someone hears you. The nurses looking after the patient will sit and hold their hand as they pass away as well. So they're always with someone.\"Another consultant, Jonathan Paige, said: \"We're talking to people who are breaking down in tears on the other end of the phone.\" The unpredictable nature of the disease -- mostly hitting elderly men, but sometimes killing fit, young patients with no other health conditions -- is also harrowing, Paige said. \"Everyone's finding it quite hard especially when you see someone who's young fit, in the prime of life, get struck down and -- despite everything we can do for them -- losing their life.\"The nurses gather in hallways, removing protective gowns as a grueling 12-hour shift ends, showing nerves of steel. The moments when the relentless suffering, or discomforting heat of protective gear, gets too much, are gently referred to by staff as \"wobbles.\"They look out for and comfort each other. Amid a nationwide controversy about the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the UK's healthcare workers, nurses at UHC broadly said they have the protective gear they need, and seemed properly equipped. But that doesn't eradicate fear and despair at the end of a long, bleak night shift.\"There have been really difficult shifts where I've just cried in the shower\", said Nerissa Cifra Manalad. \"Cry in the shower, I cry at night, I'm going to cry again now,\" she said, welling up. \"I'm just scared and I'm just basically [wondering], 'When am I going to catch this?' Despite having all the PPE, you still don't know. If you go by the book, there are people still getting infected, so... I'm just so scared.\"Adding to Manalad's concerns are her elderly parents being alone at home in the Philippines, where she cannot travel to help, in the event they fall sick. \"I pray before coming to work. I pray before going to sleep. It's just not only for myself, I'm scared for my husband as well. It's just really scary...\"Fear at first caught Townsend -- fear of the unknown and of failure to combat the disease -- but now he says they focus on getting through and being ready for another wave. \"When my colleagues confessed that they were scared, I confessed -- I said, 'I'm scared, too.' Now this has gone on, I think the best we can do is wear the PPE, keep our fingers crossed that we don't get it. Yeah. So am I scared? No. Not scared like I was when I started.\"Back inside the ICU, the team continue \"proning\" patients -- turning them on their fronts to ease breathing. Townsend admits they still don't fully understand why the palliative technique works. \"It changes the distribution of air within the chest\", he said \"but also changes the way the blood is distributed.\"Sometimes, no level of care can alter the trajectory of a patient, and the team must make the difficult assessment as to whether they are only prolonging a patients' pain. Townsend said: \"If people pass away it's more often because we've come to the conclusion that they are not going to survive whatever we do, rather than them dying suddenly.\"The fear of a second wave is tempered by the hospital knowing how they braved the first. \"I think we all fear that potential second wave and possibly even further waves as we move into winter if we find this becomes a seasonal disease,\" said Andy Hardy, CEO of University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire. \"We have to keep the public onside, by being honest with [them], and the government giving clear direction as to why, for example, an extended lockdown might be necessary for certain types of vulnerable patients.\"But at the back of the hospital, the new normal is already visible. Patients come off a stream of ambulances into one of two channels: Covid-19 possible, if they have any breathing symptoms, or a separate channel if not.Inside is Brian Forster, who recently suffered from cancer and has been shielding himself at home as per government advice. But recently it became too hard for him to breathe, and he came in for a test. His first night in hospital was a struggle. \"Because with my breathing being so tight, it was hard to get comfortable,\" he said. \"So I've not had a lot of sleep.\" Movement had become a struggle. \"As soon as I get out of bed to go to the bathroom or do anything like that, I'm completely out of breath. I break out into a sweat and I just have to come back and have a sit down.\"In another ward lies Jacqueline Smith, a grandmother of five, who delayed coming into hospital when she fell ill, as she feared catching the virus she didn't know she already had. She half-laughs through a cough: \"They called the ambulance three times and I kept refusing to come in.\" The disease itself was deadly serious. \"Oh my goodness. It's so tight.\" She pushes down on her pyjamas and adds: \"You've got somebody sitting on your chest. And you're trying to breathe and you're not getting anywhere. It's really frightening.\"One peak behind them, and the lull before a possible second wave, is not a place for fear, said consultant Abbey. \"I am not sure that fearing it is helpful.\"",

        "body": "New York (CNN Business)Doctors and nurses on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic are in desperate need of face shields, crucial equipment to prevent the spread of the virus. But they're in extreme short supply. That's why tech companies are stepping up to help.\n\nThe transparent, plastic headgear resembling a welding mask protects medical professionals from infection while they're treating patients suffering from the deadly and highly-contagious disease. Hospital administrators responsible for acquiring personal protective equipment (PPE) for their staff say proper face shields are even harder to find these days than the surgical masks being horded by panic-buying consumers.For weeks, government leaders and health officials have been talking about the nation's limited supply of N95 masks and other PPE, such as latex gloves and medical gowns. But the face-shield shortage has been under-covered, argues Dr. Kranthi Achanta, liaison officer for the Washington Township Medical Foundation in Fremont, California.\"If you have an N95 mask and you don't have a face shield, you don't have any protection,\" Achanta told CNN Business on Thursday.3D printer makers like Carbon, Prusa Research and Formlabs 3D Systems, have recently ramped up production to help meet face shield demand.Read More\"Our production will go from 7,500 [face shields] this week to 15,000 next week,\" Carbon President and CEO Ellen Kullman told CNN Business on Wednesday. \"Between us and our partners, we'll have close to 18,000 face shields out. I think this number is going to grow considerably.\"For years, Carbon and its competitors have been selling 3D printers that design and produce plastic parts more efficiently to leaders in manufacturing, aerospace, industrial production, tech, and the medical industry.Carbon has 40 certified production network partners, including Fast Radius, The Technology House, Resolution Medical and Paragon, according to a company spokesperson. Each of those partners has a subscription to use Carbon's 3D printers and produces parts for customer companies, such as Ford Motor Company (FPRC), Adidas (ADDDF), and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ).Since the coronavirus began spreading throughout the United States, Carbon and some of its customers have been adapting 3D printers to mass-produce face shields. Ford recently said that face shields made with its Carbon 3D printers were being tested at Detroit-area hospitals. The automaker said it initially plans to make 1,000 face shields per month, but wants to increase production as quickly as possible.If the face shield shortage continues, Carbon can produce more than 50,000 face shields per week across its global network, a company spokesperson said. Carbon said its face shields vary in price depending on the volume it sells to each medical client. Hospitals and care providers can submit requests for equipment on Carbon's website.Why are face shields so important?A third of hospitalized coronavirus patients, those suffering from the most severe symptoms, need a medical tube inserted in their mouths and down their throats to help them breathe, a process called intubation, Dr. Achanta said. Intubated patients often cough and gag during the high-risk procedure, propelling spit and other bodily fluids onto the faces of medical staffers.Normally goggles and N95 masks would be enough to protect medical personnel from catching serious illnesses like HIV, according to Dr. Achanta, but since coronavirus is so contagious, most staffers prefer wearing face shields.\"We have two doctors and three nurses who have contracted the illness [Covid-19],\" Dr. Achanta said. \"One of them has been admitted to the hospital. ... A mask and goggles is not adequate for Covid-19. There are gaps all around the goggles that expose the eyes and elsewhere.\"In recent weeks, Achanta said major PPE providers have focused their attention on coronavirus hotspots like New York and New Jersey, leaving his relatively smaller hospital network near the San Francisco Bay Area to fend for itself. So Washington Township Medical Foundation's administrative team has been forced to find alternative PPE providers for its staff members who treat an average of 12 to 15 coronavirus patients per day, he said.\"We were down to single digits of PPE and supplies,\" Dr. Achanta said. \"We reached out to Silicon Valley. Right now, without them we would be left with literally no face shields.\"Christian Lawson, director of emergency services at UNC Health Care in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, said he recently ordered 107,000 face shields for his 11 hospital network, which he said has more than 30,000 healthcare employees.\"[Face shields] are in limited supply across the country,\" Lawson told CNN Business. \"Some places don't even have them anymore. We're burning through those at a pretty quick clip.\"Traditional face shields cost about $15 apiece, according to Lawson, who said those units must be disposed of after each use. Individual medical staffers in his network usually run through 30 disposable face shields per day.Lawson said the kind of face shields Carbon makes can be reused multiple times after being sterilized, reducing the rate of usage to two units per day.\"A PPE change of 30 a day, that's just burning through it,\" Lawson continued. \"[With reusable face shields] you go through one or two a shift with two nurses. From 30 to two, that's a drastic savings.\"Lawson and Achanta said coronavirus has created a major business opportunity for 3D printer makers or their clients to permanently fill a void in PPE supply needs in the medical industry. Carbon's head of communications, Iska Hain Saric, said the company is just focused on relief efforts at the moment.\"Right now our focus is on providing these critical medical supplies to help healthcare workers on the front lines,\" she said.",

Sign up here.)1. VaccineThere's some good news in the quest for a coronavirus vaccine: The biotech company Moderna says volunteers who got its Covid-19 vaccine had positive early results. Trial participants developed neutralizing antibodies to the virus that sometimes surpassed levels seen in people who've naturally recovered from Covid-19. Neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus, disabling it from attacking human cells. But it's still not clear whether natural infection confers immunity to reinfection, and so it's also not clear whether vaccination confers immunity. The trial was very small, and the results haven't been peer-reviewed, but Moderna's chief medical officer says if future studies go well, the vaccine could be available to the public as early as January. Read More2. HydroxychloroquinePresident Trump claimed he's taking daily doses of hydroxychloroquine, the controversial antimalarial drug he and his inner circle have touted as a possible treatment for Covid-19. While speaking at a meeting of restaurant executives, Trump said he started taking the drug after consulting with White House physician Dr. Sean Conley -- though notably, he did not say Conley recommended the drug. Conley said in a White House memo that he and the President decided \"the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risk.\" That's not a view shared by other medical experts. The FDA has warned against the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the coronavirus, saying it should only be used in hospitals or clinical trials because it can kill or cause serious side effects. News of the President's regimen has drawn scrutiny and concern, including from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.3. Coronavirus symptomsHealth agencies are recording more symptoms and risks brought on by Covid-19. A new review of studies reveals delirium, confusion and agitation may be common in severe coronavirus infections while patients are hospitalized, though it's unclear if these psychological symptoms extend further into recovery. In the UK, the loss of taste or smell has been added to the official list of coronavirus symptoms. The condition is called anosmia, and its connection to the virus has been known among medical communities for months. Finally, another study has shown enlargement of one of the heart's four chambers -- the right ventricle -- was the best predictor of which patients with severe Covid-19 infections were most likely to die. It sounds dire, but knowing this can help doctors better determine which new patients are most at risk.4. European UnionGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron have unveiled a $500 billion initiative to rescue the European Union from economic crisis. The pandemic fallout has plunged the EU into its worst economic shock since the Great Depression, and it's also opened old political wounds among the 27 member countries. Those divisions have slowed progress on a recovery fund to rebuild regional economies. Under Merkel and Macron's plan, the European Commission would borrow money to boost the EU economy and channel the funds through the EU budget to the hardest-hit regions. Germany and France are the EU's leading economies, and the two leaders are hoping their proposal will unite their fellow EU nations, which would have to all agree on the proposal before it could happen. 5. Al QaedaDid al Qaeda strike on American soil last year? That's the question raised by new information from the FBI about a shooting at the Pensacola Navy base that left three US sailors dead in December. FBI Director Christopher Wray said attacker Mohammed Alshamrani, a member of the Royal Saudi Air Force, was a longtime associate of an al Qaeda affiliate who had communicated with operatives from the group as recently as the night before the shooting. US investigators uncovered the connection after the FBI broke through the encryption protecting the Saudi attacker's iPhones. But Wray stopped short of saying Alshamrani, who was killed by law enforcement during the attack, had been directed by the terror group. Since 9/11, no foreign terrorist organization has successfully directed a deadly attack in the US.BREAKFAST BROWSEA priest used a squirt gun to fire holy water at congregants.

Coronavirus task forceThe White House's coronavirus task force will start winding down its operations by the end of the month. Officials say doctors and experts from the task force will still advise the administration as well as businesses and state leaders who may want insight on how to reopen local economies. But the group as a whole is expected to scale back meetings and other activities. Some see the move as another sign the Trump administration is ready to pivot away from the coronavirus crisis as much as possible and focus instead on reelection efforts and messages of economic revival. Meanwhile, the US Covid-19 death toll has topped 70,000 and an influential model has adjusted its prediction of total US deaths to 134,000 by the beginning of August.Read More 2. World updatesThe UK now has more coronavirus deaths than any other country in Europe. Nearly 30,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the country, putting the roll ahead of other hard-hit nations like Italy and Spain. The grim development comes as Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to address the country on Sunday. He is expected to announce the next steps in the nation's coronavirus response, possibly including how it will ease lockdown measures. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is monitoring the spread of Covid-19 in Latin America amid fears the pandemic could drive more migration north. The Department of Homeland Security has focused on hospital capacity in the region and whether the health infrastructure is equipped to adequately test and treat patients. US Customs and Border Protection is also sending daily reports on the Covid-19 situation in Mexico. 3. Whistleblower complaintDr. Rick Bright, the ousted director of the federal office involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine, has filed an extensive whistleblower complaint saying his early warnings about the coronavirus were ignored. He also says his hesitance at promoting a treatment touted by President Trump led to his removal. Bright led the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority before he was reassigned last month to a narrower position at the National Institutes of Health. He says he raised concerns about US preparedness for coronavirus starting in January and pushed back on efforts to make hydroxychloroquine available for Covid-19 treatment. But his warnings, he said, were met with indifference and even hostility. 4. Election 2020The New York state Democratic presidential primary will go on as planned despite efforts to nix it altogether. A federal judge granted an injunction related to a lawsuit brought by ex-Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang against the state board of elections. Last week, Democrats on the board voted to cancel the state's primary due to coronavirus fears. They also decided to remove from the ballot all candidates who had suspended their campaigns. Since that left only presumptive nominee Joe Biden, the board claimed the election would be moot anyway. But the judge's ruling means the election will happen on June 23. States, including New York, have postponed presidential voting to stem the spread of Covid-19, and some have pushed to expand voting by mail. 5. 1918 flu study A new study has linked the effects of the 1918 flu pandemic to the rising strength of Nazism in 1930s Germany. The study found that influenza deaths in various regions were correlated to the share of votes received by extremist parties in 1932 and 1933. To be sure, the study does not suggest that the flu led to Nazism -- other countries suffered the flu and escaped the impact of such sentiments -- but rather that there was a link between the relative impact of the flu and the strength of Nazi support in a given area. The study's authors say that's important now because the current pandemic has renewed questions about how a global crisis affects social responses and preferences.BREAKFAST BROWSEBlizzard Games says people may turn to free online mobile games during economic uncertaintyThink more Candy Crush, less Call of Duty.Here's how to stop your glasses from fogging up while you wear a maskNews you can USE!NASA is working with Tom Cruise to shoot a movie ... in SPACEMission: Intercosmic.1 in 5 Wendy's is reportedly out of beefClara Peller would know what to say.Organizers of Portland's Naked Bike Ride are encouraging enthusiasts to go it alone this year (with proper social distancing) Hey, someone's gotta keep the tradition of tastefully-spaced-out nude cycling alive, and it might as well be you.

In response, preventive measures are now in place for staff who are caring for cats across all four zoos run by the nonprofit in the state. All four have been closed since mid-March, the nonprofit said. Read MoreThe zoo said the animals are now behaving normally, eating well and are not coughing as much.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A 100-year-old World War II veteran who died from Covid-19 lost a twin brother to the 1918 pandemic a century earlier, his grandson said.\n\nPhilip Kahn is the oldest veteran in Nassau County, New York, according to his family, and had been fearful of another pandemic happening in his lifetime, his grandson, Warren Zysman, told CNN.\"It was something he brought up quite frequently,\" Zysman said. \"I would have conversations with him, he would say to me, 'I told you history repeats itself, 100 years is not that long of a period of time.'\" Kahn and his twin brother, Samuel, were born on December 5, 1919. His brother died weeks later, his grandson said.The 1918 influenza pandemic, caused by a virus previously known as the \"Spanish flu,\" killed and estimate of more than 50 million people globally and about 675,000 in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of April 22, there are more than 46,000 Covid-19 deaths in the United States and about 19,000 deaths in New York State, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally.Read MoreKahn was a sergeant in the US Army Air Force during WWII, Zysman said, and acted as an engineer and co-pilot, keeping war planes fueled. He received two Bronze Battle Stars for his service in WWII, his grandson said. After the war, he worked as an electrical foreman to help build the World Trade Center, Zysman said. In Long Island, Kahn lived on his own and walked one to two miles a day, Zysman said. He was very aware of what was happening with coronavirus since he watched the news all the time, and in the last days before his death on April 17, Kahn experienced coughing and respiratory symptoms of the virus, his grandson said. Kahn knew that there was a possibility that he could have contracted the coronavirus. \"He talked about his brother a lot in the last few days,\" Zysman said. The 100-year-old veteran received a coronavirus test, but his family did not get the results until after Kahn passed away.\"He had always wanted a large military funeral, but we weren't able to provide that to him,\" Zysman said. The cemetery arranged for two people in the armed forces to perform a military ceremony, and a man whose father was a Marine during WWII played the bugle at Kahn's funeral from a distance, Kahn's grandson said.\"He volunteered because the Air Force protected the Marines by providing cover for them and he felt it was a honor to do this for my grandpa,\" Zysman said.Sampson Lester Friedman, Khan's friend who served with him during WWII in the Army Air Force, attended the funeral and gave a tribute to Kahn, which Zysman recorded on video and provided to CNN. \"[There was] something about him that was very very special,\" Friedman said at the funeral. \"On our airplane, he was an engineer, and he was the hardest working guy aboard that airplane.\"Over the century that followed his brother's death, Kahn kept the memory of his brother alive.\"Pretty much every holiday, every event, he would also bring up his brother Samuel,\" Zysman said. \"It clearly made a hole in his heart that he never got to meet his twin, and that his twin died a few weeks after birth.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Dr. James \"Charlie\" Mahoney, a physician in Brooklyn for over 30 years, is another frontline casualty in the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic. But to those who knew him, he lived every day serving others and fought the virus with his endless positive spirit until he physically couldn't.\n\nMahoney devoted his entire career to the University Hospital of Brooklyn, SUNY Downstate, where he began his medical schooling in 1982 and eventually worked as a pulmonary and critical care attending physician until Covid-19 sidelined him.\"He was the first one on the front lines taking the onslaught. He was our backbone,\" Dr. Robert Foronjy, the Chief of the Pulmonary and Critical Care Division at SUNY Downstate, told CNN.\"He saw this as his calling,\" Foronjy said.Mahoney, who was 62, could have taken a back seat during the pandemic, given his age and health. But his family and colleagues say he wouldn't even consider it. Read MoreThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has cautioned that individuals older than 60 and people with serious chronic medical conditions \"are at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness.\"Mahoney's daughter told CNN that she \"may have been worried. And I know the rest of our family was also worried, but there was never a question of was he not going to do it.\"\"He wasn't going to step back and he was going to try to help people, and as many people as he could,\" Stephanie Mahoney said.His patients could always reach him. He always gave them his cell phone number. \"He was almost like the mayor walking the halls of Downstate,\" Foronjy said.He even had family on campus. His older brother Dr. Melvin Mahoney is an internal medicine physician at the hospital. They'd often get each other's hospital pages, his daughter said. Known best as \"Charlie\", Mahoney was also a clinical assistant professor at the academic hospital. He supervised and mentored countless medical students throughout his career.\"Sometimes he did it by giving someone a pat on the back and sometimes when they needed a dressing down, but they were always getting the truth from him and they always knew that he cared,\" Foronjy said.'My dad was a big story teller'Vytas Vaitkus, a pulmonary critical care fellow, trained under Mahoney for seven years during his time at SUNY Downstate. Vaitkus was nervous to present a patient to Mahoney his first year as an intern in 2013, because his excellent reputation preceded him, but Mahoney took care of that quickly. \"Before I started he cut me off and started talking about a story. He made me feel completely at ease right away,\" Vaitkus recalled.Mahoney's kids agreed.\"My dad was a big story teller,\" Stephanie said. \"He would always tell these stories and he would be so vibrant and so funny and he would be really truly like a character.\"Mahoney brought that energy to the physically and mentally taxing treatment of critically ill Covid-19 patients at the beginning of the pandemic. New York City is considered an epicenter of the virus, with more than 191,000 cases since March, according to city data.All the patients at SUNY Downstate have suffered from Covid-19 -- it's one of three hospitals in the state ordered by Gov. Andrew Cuomo to dedicate itself entirely to dealing with the pandemic in late March. Four patients died of the virus in one hour that CNN visited SUNY Downstate in early April.\"One of those days in the early kind of beginning, he called me and just was like, 'you know Steph, this has been one of the hardest days I've ever had in in medicine,'\" his daughter said. 'My number one guy, my best friend and my hero'Though he worked day shifts at SUNY Downstate, nights at Kings County Hospital Center and served an outpatient practice, Mahoney's kids saw him as ubiquitous.Mahoney has three children, Jamie, 31, Stephanie, 27, and Ryan, 25. \"You would've thought he had more hours in the day than anybody,\" Stephanie said.Mahoney managed to coach his kids in several sports as they grew up. \"No matter how hard he worked, how long he was at the hospital, he was always there for me growing up. One day he'd be at Downstate, next night at Kings County and during the day coaching my teams and picking me up. He was always here,\" his son, Ryan Mahoney, told CNN.Just like his dad, his son Ryan played collegiate baseball and is now pursuing a medical degree at Rutgers University.\"He got me through everything I did -- my number one guy, my best friend and my hero.\"His daughter, who's in law school at Howard University, said he'd even talk to her about medicine. \"Even through his stories he was always teaching us things and teaching us how to be,\" Stephanie said. \"He would explain a procedure or something like that. And I'd be, like, 'I mean, I wasn't calling about this, dad, but sure, you can tell me about that.' He kind of was unbelievable in that way.\"He was a work-hard, play-hard kind of guy, his kids said. Mahoney loved to travel and usually with his family. \"He loved to cruise,\" Stephanie said. They'd go on family vacations once or twice a year -- he and his kids and their extended family since he's one of five. He'd play Craps in the casino and teach anyone the game if they'd let him. They hoped to go on a trip together when the worst of the pandemic passed, according to Stephanie. \"He worked hard but he also liked to enjoy his life. Even when coronavirus hit he was saying, 'I had to cancel my trip I'm sad about it,'\" she said.'He was a doctor right up until the end'Doctors at Downstate were starting to see the number of critically ill patients shrink by the end of April around the time Mahoney caught the virus, Foronjy told CNN. The hospital has since closed several expanded ICU units no longer needed. \"As soon as we thought we were getting over it, this happened,\" Vaitkus said. \"It was a gut punch. It sucks your spirit to know you're trying to do as much as you can for these patients.\"Mahoney checked himself into the emergency department at his own hospital after suffering a week of fever and mild symptoms, according to his family.\"He was a doctor right up until the end,\" Foronjy told CNN.Mahoney was eventually admitted to the ICU and was directing his own medical care up until he was sedated and intubated , according to Foronjy. \"He embodied excellence. The level of skill -- that's a real loss,\" Foronjy said. Unlike thousands of others who died of Covid-19 without loved ones near due to visitor restrictions, Mahoney was surrounded by people who loved him at the hospital in his last days.His long-time student, Vaitkus, visited Mahoney a few times each day during his final week in the ICU in the hospital they shared for nearly a decade. \"He was so gracious and humble and kind and made you feel warm visiting even when he was critically ill,\" he said.\"He was so humble even, the fact that he trained all of us and then he's an ICU patient and thanked all of us for coming to visit\" Vaitkus said.A small army of SUNY Downstate healthcare workers transferred Mahoney to an NYU Langone Hospital that was planning to treat him with a more sophisticated oxygenation treatment. Just as they settled him into the facility, he succumbed to the virus on April 27 -- his own colleagues performing chest compressions. \"I think that spiritually he felt us there. It shows you how much people love him. It shows you how much he meant to the institution,\" said Foronjy, who was in the room in those last minutes.\"I couldn't fathom losing him, and it's still something that everyone here is still having a difficult time processing. I have literally witnessed a village of people die in the past month or two and on top of that you lose someone who was such a good human being,\" Foronjy said.Foronjy, with the hospital organization, has raised more than $30,000 in a GoFundMe campaign that will sponsor a scholarship for a student of diversity at the medical school, in Mahoney's memory. In the weeks since his passing, his kids have been flooded with memories and words of support from friends and strangers who knew their dad, Stephanie told CNN.\"It reminds us how many people cared for our dad and how many lives that he touched. It's almost overwhelming. I couldn't be more proud to be his daughter.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A North Carolina family's pug may be the first dog in the United States to test positive for coronavirus, according to researchers.\n\nThree members of the McClean family -- Sam McClean, wife Heather and their son, Ben -- contracted Covid-19 last month. Sydney McClean, the couple's daughter, was the only family member to never show any symptoms.The family found out their dog, Winston, tested positive for the virus too after they participated in a Duke University study about Covid-19 aimed at trying to find potential treatments and vaccines. As part of the study, members of the family under go weekly nasal swabs and give blood samples.Chris Woods, the principal investigator of the study, said researchers have also been collecting samples from family pets to see how coronavirus spreads in households. Researchers did not use the commercial tests that are in high demand around the world to test the animals.Although they haven't tested many pets, Winston's sample is the only one that's come back positive. He is believed to be the first dog in the country to test positive for the virus, according to the university.Read More\"His (Winston's) amount of virus that we detected was very low, suggesting that he would not be a likely mechanism or vector of transmission of virus to either other animals or to, to humans in these households,\" Woods said.Sam McClean, a researcher and emergency room doctor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, was the first member of the family to get sick, his wife Heather McClean said. He had treated Covid-19 patients before he got sick. Winston did show some minor symptoms while his family was also sick.\"He had a small cough for a day or two right in the peak when all of us were sick and he didn't eat his breakfast one morning,\" Ben McClean told CNN. \"But we didn't have any concrete, like, super alarming illnesses where we're like, 'we need to take him to the vet. He's like really sick.'\"Woods said researchers don't know if coronavirus made Winston sick, or if he had an unrelated ailment. The McCleans have another dog and a cat, whose tests were negative.Winston tends to lick things and likes to spend more time around his family, Heather McClean said. Their cat is more aloof, and their older pug likes to sleep most of the time.\"Winston is much more affectionate and we hold them all the time,\" she told CNN. \"So if any of the animals were to have a positive viral test, it would be him.\"Federal officials announced last week that two cats tested positive for the novel coronavirus in New York. Eight lions and tigers tested positive for Covid-19 at the Bronx Zoo, but the big cats are all doing well, according to a news release.Two dogs under quarantine in Hong Kong also tested positive for the virus, according to officials there.Experts have stressed that there is no evidence that pets play a part in transmitting coronavirus.\"I would not change our, our behaviors with our household animals at this point. They're really an important part of our ongoing mental health as we continue to participate in our social distancing to combat the pandemic,\" Woods said.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist, said in a press briefing last week that \"there is no evidence whatsoever that we've seen, from an epidemiological standpoint, that pets can be transmitters within the household.\"William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, said that it is extremely rare for a virus to jump from an animal to a human.He said the first case in the Covid-19 pandemic was believed to have come from a market in Wuhan, China, but it has spread around the world through human-to-human contact.\"We still don't think this is common and we certainly don't think it's a major route of transmission in either direction,\" Schaffner said. \"It's not common for people to give it to their pets, nor has it been demonstrated ever that anyone's ever gotten this virus from a pet.\"Schaffner said it would be a good idea for people who are sick to social distance themselves from their pets, as well as their family members. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has made similar recommendations.Heather McClean said that her family is now out of quarantine and are cleared to go back to work. Her husband has volunteered to work in a special Covid-19 unit in the emergency room, because he thinks he'll be at less risk than colleagues who haven't been infected.Heather McClean and Ben McClean hope to be able to donate plasma, so their antibodies can help patients.\"We are feeling very grateful that we have the opportunity to participate in this research study,\" she said. \"We are really hopeful that we can donate plasma to be able to help other patients.\"She said Winston is also doing well. He is getting lots of walks, and enjoying following his family around the house to keep an eye on what they're doing.\n\nCNN's Sandee LaMotte contributed to this story.",

Aye and Toe had lived in the camp after fleeing their native Burma years before. In August of 2007, the couple left southeast Asia and arrived in Colorado with their children. Unable to speak English and needing money to support her children, Aye took a job at JBS's Greeley beef plant, says Twin. \"It was very hard work, but she didn't want to change jobs,\" Twin told CNN. \"She relied on her co-workers that spoke the same language and they would give her rides to work because she couldn't drive.\" In the hospital since MarchRead MoreOn Sunday, Tin Aye, 60, died of complications from Covid-19, according to a spokesperson for the Union Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 7, the union that represents workers in the JBS Greeley plant. Aye is the eighth JBS Greeley employee confirmed to have died from the novel coronavirus, the seventh worker from the plant. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment's latest data shows 316 workers at the plant have tested positive for Covid-19. So have five corporate employees. Aye had been in the hospital and on a ventilator since March 29th, one day after her first grandson, Felix, was born. When Twin began having contractions on the 28th, she said, doctors tested her for Covid-19 as a precaution. Her test came back positive and doctors performed an emergency c-section to deliver Felix. Once Twin knew of her positive test, she contacted her mother and told her to get to the hospital. Aye had symptoms for weeks, Twin said. Earlier in the month, she went to a JBS health clinic to be examined by company officials. Twin told CNN that her mother was told she had symptoms of the flu or common cold, and she could return to work. \"If this is true, it would be a clear violation of our culture and procedures, which puts team member health and safety first,\" Nikki Richardson, a JBS spokesperson, told CNN in early May. \"No one is forced to come to work and no one is punished for being absent for health reasons. We do not want anyone who is sick coming to work, and anyone who is fearful of coming to work can simply call the company and inform us, and they will receive unpaid leave without any consequence to their employment.\" Plant was temporarily closed for cleaning in AprilOn April 13th, JBS announced it was temporarily closing the Greeley plant to sanitize and implement new safety initiatives in the facility. On April 24th, the plant resumed operations. JBS said it would screen all workers coming into the plant for high temperatures and other symptoms common with Covid-19. Workers that felt sick were mandated to stay home. Any worker older than 70, pregnant, on dialysis or undergoing cancer treatment was removed from all production facilities. During her stay in the hospital, Aye was connected to a ventilator for over a month. Twin says her mom suffered multiple strokes, had fluid in her lungs, and had surgeries to insert a feeding tube. Twin was able to see her mother in person before she died Sunday afternoon. But her mother never met her first grandson, Felix. \"I want people to know she was a very humble, sweet, and giving person,\" says Twin. \"If she saw a homeless person on the street and hungry, she would give them her food and she wouldn't eat. She loved taking care of people, but especially her family.\"\n\nCNN's Hollie Silverman contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)A 57-year-old Northern California woman whose February 6 death has become the first known coronavirus-related fatality in the US had been in relatively good health, her brother told CNN.\n\nShe was Patricia Dowd, a Bay Area woman who worked as a manager for a semiconductor company and who \"exercised routinely, watched her diet and took no medication,\" the Los Angeles Times first reported Wednesday. Rick Cabello, Dowd's older brother, told CNN she didn't smoke and was in good health. \"She was an athlete in her high school days, she was always active,\" Cabello said Wednesday. Her sudden death was a shock to family members. They all believed it was a heart attack, Cabello said. California's Santa Clara County had announced Tuesday that tissue samples confirmed two people who had died in early February tested positive for coronavirus -- well before the United States' previously understood first coronavirus-related death on February 29 in Washington state.Read MoreOne victim was a 57-year-old woman who died on February 6, and the other was a 67-year-old man who died on February 17, the county said. The county did not name the woman, but Cabello told the Los Angeles Times and CNN that she was Dowd, his sister. Neither patient had a recent history of travel that would have exposed them to the virus, Santa Clara County Department of Public Health Director Dr. Sara Cody said in a Wednesday news conference, and officials are presuming both cases represent community transmission. 'She had flu-like symptoms' Before Dowd was found dead February 6, \"she had flu-like symptoms for a few days, then appeared to recover,\" the Los Angeles Times reported. Five days before she died, Dowd called her brother to tell him she couldn't make it to a family visit in Stockton, California. \"She wasn't feeling well, which was very unusual for her,\" Cabello said. \"I remember her specifically saying 'I'm not feeling well,'\" he added. She also had canceled plans to go a weekend funeral, the Los Angeles Times reported.Dowd started working from home as her condition improved and had been in touch with a colleague around 8 a.m. on the day of her death. She was found dead about two hours later, according to the Los Angeles Times. A traveler and 'everybody's rock'Dowd was a frequent world traveler, her brother said.She had planned to travel to China later this year and went abroad \"multiple times a year to different global locations,\" a family member told the Los Angeles Times. Dowd had a history of foreign travel, as did her coworkers at Lam Research, the newspaper also reported. Dowd was \"hardworking, loyal, and caring,\" Cabello told the Los Angeles Times. \"She was the energy person in her large network of friends,\" her brother said. \"She was everybody's rock.\" In a tribute wall set up for Patricia Dowd by the Cusimano Family Colonial Mortuary, a coworker wrote, \"I'll always remember the kindness and generosity of her spirit. She was genuinely caring and had an amazing energy.\" As more deaths are investigated, more positives may comeNeither of the two victims who died in February had been tested for the virus at the time of their deaths because testing capacity was limited, Santa Clara County officials said Tuesday in a news release.Tests were only available through the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and were restricted to people who had a known travel history and showed certain symptoms. Both of the victims who passed away in February had flu-like symptoms before dying, county officials said. \"Because there was continued suspicion by the medical examiner that these deaths were caused by Covid-19, the medical examiner sent autopsy tissue to the CDC for definitive testing,\" the coroner's office said in a statement.As the county investigates more deaths, it's likely that more will be tied to the virus, officials said. And that adds to evidence that suggests the current case and death tallies across the country may be significant undercounts.\n\nCNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report.",

    "A surprising way you may risk getting Covid-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN)Much of what we understand about the transmission of infectious diseases is derived from odd outbreaks in far-flung places. For example, we learned more about measles from its rapid spread on an isolated Polynesian island in 1911 and about influenza from people stuck on a grounded plane in Alaska in 1979.\n\nAdd to this important list a startling and revealing outbreak of Covid-19 affecting as many as 52 of 61 people at a choir practice in March. The story was detailed this week in a new report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Public health officials in Skagit County, Washington, which lies between Seattle and the Canadian border, meticulously reconstructed the outbreak. The area had already seen a nursing home outbreak in nearby Kirkland, and testing and local expertise were therefore available. Read MoreAfter interviewing everyone involved in the March 10 choir practice, and determining precisely how the chairs been arranged and where each choir member had been sitting, standing and later mingling, the investigators determined that one person with mild respiratory symptoms (and who later tested positive for Covid-19) had likely triggered the outbreak. They found that, at the start of the practice, all 61 members sang together in a room for 40 minutes. Then they split into two groups in two rooms for an additional 50 minutes. Next came a 15-minute break, where the whole group chatted and snacked on cookies and oranges. Finally, the large group returned to their seats in the main room and practiced for another 45 minutes before re-stacking their chairs and leaving. Within the next five days, 49 people developed symptoms of Covid-19. The early development of symptoms was remarkable (at a median of 3 days versus 5 days in most other reports) and may relate to the intensity of the exposure. Three additional cases developed symptoms over the next week. The choir members were almost all women (84%) with an average age of 69 years. Of those with symptoms, 32 tested positive for Covid-19. Another 20 were not tested but were considered probable cases based on symptoms and association with the lab-proven cases. Three of the 52 were hospitalized, including two who died from the infection about two weeks after developing symptoms. As with other reports, the three hospitalized patients had at least two pre-existing health conditions. According to the report, the choir members risked infection when moving and stacking the chairs, sharing snacks and touching common areas. But the most likely way the virus spread was through singing and chatting while sitting close together. The possibility that singing might help transmit infectious diseases is not a new concept. A 1968 article, \"Singing and the Dissemination of Tuberculosis,\" described an elaborate box that volunteers could talk, sing and cough into, allowing investigators to measure the number, size and length of time airborne of individual infectious droplets they breathed out. And a few TB outbreaks have featured singing, including one in a New Jersey church choir in 1995.The public health implications of this report are considerable. First, additional respect emerges for the highly contagious nature of Covid-19, with so many exposed persons being infected after a single, intensive exposure. Second, despite the older age of those infected, hospitalization was rare probably because of the overall good health of the group. The outbreak also provides strong if indirect support for continued adherence to current CDC guidelines that emphasize physical distancing as well as active screening with self-isolation of those with even mild symptoms. Until we have capacity for accurate testing with rapid results, we will be left with this sturdy, grandmotherly advice that saw countless generations in the pre-vaccine era through countless other epidemics. The report of this outbreak also includes an important limitation. The authors decided not to map out where each of the 32 confirmed, 20 probable and 8 uninfected persons sat, though they had constructed a complete seating chart. This weakened the article a small amount, but the decision was made to protect patient privacy, an extremely important but sometimes overlooked aspect of any outbreak investigation. Indeed, the relentless pursuit and exposure of a culpable so-called \"patient zero\" is not only of little value in an epidemiological context. It's also vindictive and potentially life-altering for anyone correctly -- or, worse, incorrectly -- identified as the putative \"source\" of the misery for so many in the community. As with other aspects of this complex epidemic, the maintenance of our humanity first and foremost must remain the everyone's highest priority.",

        "body": "(CNN)An elementary school teacher in Connecticut says she is taking care of a newborn baby boy after getting a phone call from a student's mother who was eight months pregnant, when she was hospitalized suddenly with Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nBaby Neysel turned 1-month-old over the weekend, but his parents, Zully and Marvin, have not been able to hold him.Instead, Neysel is staying with Luciana Lira, one of their 7-year-old son's teachers, who agreed to care for the baby until it is safe for him to come home.\"I'm hoping it's going to be very, very soon,\" Lira told CNN, \"because that's my biggest dream to have this baby meet his mommy, and his daddy and his older brother.\"Zully and Marvin have declined to speak to CNN directly while they recover from their illness, but they have spoken through Lira and others close to them.Read MoreZully could barely talk when she called from the hospital on April 1, and doctors said she needed to have an emergency Cesarean section.Lira teaches English as a Second Language at Hart Magnet Elementary School in Stamford, where Zully's son is in the first grade. She's been working with him since the beginning of the school year. Zully called her, Lira said, to translate for her husband Marvin, who doesn't speak English. Lira said Marvin needed help talking with the doctors and health care workers, who were taking care of his family. The family is from Guatemala and Zully and her oldest son are seeking asylum. CNN agreed to report only the family's first names out of respect for their privacy.Lira said she only knew Zully and Marvin from parent-teacher conferences and school events.\"I'm very proud that she felt safe in calling me,\" Lira said. \"Out of anybody else, she called the teacher, probably because she felt like she could count on me and trust me.\"Lira says she was set up as the hospital's contact person so she could give updates on Zully and the baby to Marvin and Zully's mom in Guatemala.She said Zully's Covid-19 symptoms worsened quickly, and she had to go on a ventilator.\"But thank God, she was she was a survivor, a miracle case,\" Lira said.Neysel was born on April 2 and tested negative for coronavirus, Lira said. He was about five weeks premature but healthy and weighed more than five pounds.When it was time for Neysel to leave the hospital after five days in the NICU, Lira said Marvin was afraid to take his son home, concerned that he himself might also have Covid-19.Lira, who is married with an 11-year-old son, offered to take the baby home for a few days, while they waited for their test results.Two days later, Marvin tested positive, Lira said.\"So thank God I decided to take that baby home.\"Lira had frequent video conferences with Marvin and Zully's mother in Guatemala so they could see the baby. They also got to all connect with the hospital, so they could be with Zully while she was in a coma.\"Even though her daughter was in critical condition, she always wanted to say a prayer by her bedside,\" Lira said.Zully recovered after getting a plasma treatment and was able to be removed from the ventilator, Lira said.Getty Images photographer John Moore was one of the first people to cover the story and has spent time with both families. He was able to be in Zully's hospital room when she got to see Neysel and talk to him by video chat and photographed the family on April 25 when Zully got to go home from the hospital.How first responders are tackling this unprecedented threat\"Zully is still very weak,\" Moore told CNN. \"She's starting to walk with a walker, but she is often breathless after a few steps, and so even though she's out of the hospital, she's not ready for the baby to come home.\"He said Marvin was feeling much better after having bad headaches.Marvin and Zully have not yet tested negative for Covid-19, so Lira is still caring for Neysel.The group Building One Community is helping the family arrange doctors' visits, testing, and all the other things the family needs to do to be healthy and ready to bring Neysel home.Executive Director Catalina S. Horak told CNN that the community has rallied around the family and brought them meals, groceries, furniture and even toys.She's visited the family a lot, and says Marvin is thankful for the help and support.\"Every time Marvin says to me, 'We are so grateful to this community and we can't wait to celebrate and thank everybody for what they have done,'\" Horak said.Lira said Neysel is growing fast -- he weighed almost 7 pounds at a recent checkup -- so she's taking lots of photos and videos so his family will be able to look back at these early days of his life.She talks to the family \"a thousand times a day\" and is looking forward to the day when Zully, Marvin and Neysel's big brother can hold the baby for the first time. It's not clear when he will be able to go home.\"The family is amazing. I mean, amazing. They love their baby, they can't wait to be reunited,\" Lira said.",

        "body": "(CNN)A high-pressure ventilator prototype developed by NASA engineers to help coronavirus patients was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday, according to NASA.\n\nThe approval is for use of the ventilator specifically for coronavirus patients under the FDA's ventilator Emergency Use Authorization, established by the agency on March 24.\"This FDA authorization is a key milestone in a process that exemplifies the best of what government can do in a time of crisis,\" NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said in a statement. \"This ventilator is one of countless examples of how taxpayer investments in space exploration -- the skills, expertise and knowledge collected over decades of pushing boundaries and achieving firsts for humanity -- translate into advancements that improve life on Earth.\"It's called VITAL, or Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally. The approval comes on the heels of the prototype passing a critical test at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York last week.\"Fighting the virus and treating patients during this unprecedented global pandemic requires innovative approaches and action. It also takes an all-hands-on-deck approach, as demonstrated by the NASA engineers who used their expertise in spacecraft to design a ventilator tailored for very ill coronavirus patients. This example shows what we can do when everyone works together to fight Covid-19,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a statement. Read More\"We believe today's action will increase availability of these life-saving medical devices,\" he added. \"The FDA will continue to add products to this emergency use authorization, as appropriate, during this pandemic to facilitate an increase in ventilator inventory.\"Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena developed the ventilator, which can be built quickly using fewer parts, most of which are available in current supply chains, the agency said. But it won't compete with the existing supply chain for ventilators.Currently, the California Institute of Technology, which manages JPL, is conducting outreach through its Office of Technology Transfer and Corporate Partnerships to offer a free license and find manufacturers for VITAL. \"Now that we have a design, we're working to pass the baton to the medical community, and ultimately patients, as quickly as possible,\" said Fred Farina, chief innovation and corporate partnerships officer at Caltech, in a statement. \"To that end, we are offering the designs for licensing on a royalty-free basis during the time of the pandemic.\"What is VITAL?The prototype works like traditional ventilators, where sedated patients rely on an oxygen tube to help them breathe. But it's built to last three or four months, unlike ventilators in hospitals that were designed to last for years and help patients with other medical issues. The engineers hope that more traditional ventilators can be freed up for patients with the most severe cases of coronavirus if VITAL is put into place. \"We were very pleased with the results of the testing we performed in our high-fidelity human simulation lab,\" said Dr. Matthew Levin, director of innovation for the Human Simulation Lab and associate professor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine, and genetics and genomics sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine, in a statement. \"The NASA prototype performed as expected under a wide variety of simulated patient conditions. The team feels confident that the VITAL ventilator will be able to safely ventilate patients suffering from Covid-19 both here in the United States and throughout the world.\"The innovative ventilator was also designed to offer more oyxgen at higher pressures than typical models because Dr. Levin said some of the patients he's treating needed that capability. \"Intensive care units are seeing Covid-19 patients who require highly dynamic ventilators,\" said Dr. J.D. Polk, NASA's chief health and medical officer, in a statement. \"The intention with VITAL is to decrease the likelihood patients will get to that advanced stage of the disease and require more advanced ventilator assistance.\"It was also designed to be flexible with easy maintenance, meaning it can be used in the diverse settings hosting field hospitals, including hotels and convention centers.\"We specialize in spacecraft, not medical device manufacturing,\" Michael Watkins, JPL director, said in a statement. \"But excellent engineering, rigorous testing and rapid prototyping are some of our specialties. When people at JPL realized they might have what it takes to support the medical community and the broader community, they felt it was their duty to share their ingenuity, expertise and drive.\"Rising to the challengeEngineers like Stacey Boland stepped up, driven to do anything they could to help. The last 40 days have taken everything they had to make VITAL. The team worked long hours each day, which bled over into nonexistent weekends.Boland is a project system engineer developing the MAIA instrument, the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols that will characterize particulate matter in air pollution. The instrument could provide the data that helps medical professionals determine what types of pollution correlate with negative health outcomes. On MAIA, Boland has worked with epidemiologists to determine the data they would need from the mission. On VITAL, Boland acted as the operations lead to create a communication pathway between engineers, designers and visualization specialists with doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and intensivists (board-certified physicians providing special care for critically ill patients). Translating between the different professions to put everyone on the same page was a challenge, but one she enjoyed. Operating during a pandemic meant that they were relying on calls, sending images and video conferencing to make a product in real time. Medical professionals called in on their lunch breaks, still in scrubs, describing what they were seeing in patients and what they would need VITAL to do. A limited staff worked in person on the hardware, while the rest of the team video conferenced in. Boland was literally writing the instruction manual for how to operate VITAL as it was being built. For Boland, it's personal. Her sister is a hospitalist nurse practitioner at Memorial Hospital at Gulfport in Mississippi. She would call her sister, send her pictures and ask questions as they worked on the device, and her sister would send feedback in real time.Boland calls it the experience of a lifetime, working on a team that was able to find camaraderie through their singular desire to create something helpful during such a challenging time. When they encountered obstacles while working on VITAL, there was no sleeping on decisions that needed to be made, Boland said. Normal coping mechanisms were tossed out the window, and they worked through issues in real time to overcome the next challenge. It's been an adrenaline rush, working on a ventilator in such a short time, and the team wished it were under better circumstances. But the VITAL team was driven to help.\"I am not a medical device engineer, but when I hear someone on the front line needs something, I want them to have it,\" Boland said. \"We want to be there for them. It's been a blessing and a privilege to have something so challenging and yet so relevant to be working on.\"Leon Alkalai, a technical fellow at JPL, manages the office of strategic partnerships. In recent years, he's been leading a small effort to build relationships with the medical engineering community. He joined the VITAL team in a leadership role and helped establish communication between JPL and Mount Sinai, the FDA and the US Department of Homeland Security.Alkalai said the FDA has been extremely supportive. And the doctors at Mount Sinai were interested in partnering together on VITAL after he reached out and shared the idea. The collaboration between NASA and the FDA and medical professionals is an example of how institutions with different areas of expertise are coming together to create solutions for the pandemic. \"We're rocket scientists and engineers, we know how to land on the moon and Mars,\" Alkalai said. \"But building a medical device is new. We were humbled by that challenge to do something we've never done before for a good cause. It goes against our culture to do something quickly in a domain where we're not experts. But it fits with the JPL mantra: 'Dare Mighty Things.'\"A helping handAdditionally, NASA is trying to help fill the gaps due to shortages of other medical equipment in local communities, like Antelope Valley, California. One new device is the Aerospace Valley Positive Pressure Helmet, which can be used to help treat coronavirus patients with minor symptoms so they don't have to use a ventilator. It functions more like a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine, commonly used to treat sleep apnea, the agency said.It has already been successfully tested and submitted to the FDA for emergency-use authorization. Meanwhile, 500 are currently in production. The device is the result of a collaboration between NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in California partnered with Antelope Valley Hospital, the City of Lancaster, Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company, Antelope Valley College and members of the Antelope Valley Task Force.The prototype for VITAL and the helmet are the result of NASA's call to action issued on April 1 called the NASA@Work challenge. Within two weeks, NASA employees had submitted 250 ideas. The NASA Glenn Research Center in Ohio previously partnered with Emergency Products and Research, an Ohio company, to work on small, portable devices that decontaminate ambulances quickly and much cheaper than current systems called AMBUStat. They're looking at the best way to apply this during the pandemic as well.Indeed, \"NASA's strength has always been our ability and passion -- collective and individual -- for solving problems,\" Bridenstine said in a statement. \"All the work being done shows how NASA is uniquely equipped to aid in the federal response to coronavirus by leveraging the ingenuity of our workforce, mobilizing investments made in the U.S. space agency to combat this disease and working with public and private partnerships to maximize results.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)A new study suggests that the Covid-19 diagnostic test being used by the White House frequently misses cases of the virus.\n\nThe Abbott ID NOW test, which has been touted by President Trump on several occasions, is faster than other tests, showing results within 13 minutes. The study authors at NYU Langone Health in New York said the Abbott test was so inaccurate that it was \"unacceptable\" for use with their patients. An infectious disease expert said he thought the White House should also think about discontinuing its use of the Abbott test. \"The White House might have to call an audible and switch tests,\" said Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor at Baylor University School of Medicine in Houston. \"Calling an audible\" is a football term when the quarterback changes the play at the last minute. Read MoreThe White House has not yet released an official comment. The NYU researchers looked at nasal swabs from 101 patients who came in for coronavirus testing, and compared the results from the Abbott test to results from another Covid-19 diagnostic test made by a company called Cepheid. The test from Cepheid found that 31 of the 101 patients were positive. The researchers ran those same positive swabs through the Abbott test and found it got a negative result on 48% of them. Test missed patients with symptomsThe NYU researchers called the Abbott test \"unacceptable.\" \"The fact that it misses positive samples on patients being admitted to the hospital with clinical picture of COVID19 makes this technology unacceptable in our clinical setting,\" they wrote in the study. The Abbott test was better for the negative samples, with a 98.5% accuracy rate, according to the NYU research. The research was posted on the pre-print server biorxiv.org. It was not reviewed by outside scientists or published in a medical journal. Abbott disputed the findings.\"The NYU study results are not consistent with other studies,\" the company said in a statement posted on its website.\"For example, in another recent study in Washington state, out of approximately 1,000 subjects there were 23 positive for COVID-19 on a lab test and ID NOW picked up 21, demonstrating 91% sensitivity and 100% specificity. We have many questions for the study authors,\" the company added.\"While no test is perfect, Abbott's ID NOW is delivering reliable results when and where they're needed most. The test is performing as expected by the more than 1,000+ sites using ID NOW for COVID-19.\"The Food and Drug Administration, which permitted the Abbott test under emergency use authorization in March, is also investigating. \"We are reviewing the information in this non-peer-reviewed study,\" an FDA spokesperson told CNN. The Abbott test, which takes 13 minutes at most, is quicker than most other coronavirus tests on the market. Several tests take 30 minutes to two hours, and Cepheid's test takes 45 minutes. The FDA recently authorized the Quidel Antigen Test, which takes 15 minutes. Trump called for daily testsThe speed of the test is why President Trump has praised it. On May 11, he stood between two tables holding the Abbott ID NOW test and other Covid-19 test. \"What they've been able to do -- the private sector,\" he said. \"This is a five- to 15-minute test, as an example -- the Abbott Laboratories' test. These tests are highly sophisticated -- very quick, very good. This is things that didn't even exist a short while ago.\"Trump has said everyone around him would now be tested daily -- although he also suggested it \"wasn't a perfect art.\"Hotez said in the NYU study it was reasonable to trust the Cepheid positive results over the Abbott negative results, because the patients had symptoms of Covid-19. Kelly Wroblewski, director of infectious disease at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said other studies have also found accuracy issues with the Abbott tests. Researchers at the Cleveland Clinic found that the Abbott quick test missed 15% of positive cases, while a study from Northwell Health showed it missed 12.3% of positive cases. Wroblewski said part of the issue is that rapid tests sometimes don't perform as well as tests that take longer to run. \"You end up sacrificing accuracy for speed,\" she said. She added that in some situations, it can be helpful that the Abbott product is fast and portable. \"The Abbott is a nice little toaster-size thing that you can carry around, and that does seem to be the most convenient one,\" she said. Abbott has said studies on its test have misused its product. Some researchers have analyzed the Abbott test by taking specimens and storing them in what's called a viral transport medium for a period of time before testing them. Abbott said viral transport media could dilute samples and impact testing performance. The company says it has updated the product information with that warning. The NYU researchers analyzed the Abbott tests with and without the use of a viral transport medium. \"Once again, a study has been conducted using ID NOW in a manner that it's not intended to be used,\" according to the company statement sent to CNN. However, the NYU study found the Abbott test was more accurate when the specimens had been stored in a medium.\n\nCNN's Devon Sayers, Nadia Kounang, Michael Nedelman and Patricia DiCarlo contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Enell \"Trent\" Porter has long battled hereditary congestive heart failure and diabetes. But after recovering from Covid-19, the Florida resident is calling himself a survivor.\n\nThe 50-year-old had a heart and kidney transplant at UF Health Shands Hospital at the end of February and went home once he had recovered from the complicated surgeries.But a few weeks later, Porter's wife and son fell ill, and then Porter got a cough and a runny nose. Porter says at first it seemed like he had allergies; his nose was running, he had headaches and couldn't sleep at night. But then he developed a cough followed by shortness of breathe. A nasal swab test for Covid-19 came back positive. His wife, Irish Porter, says at one point his breathing was so bad, he could barely walk down the hall from the bathroom to the kitchen, so she called the ambulance. Very soon Porter was back in the hospital.\"This isn't over\"Read MoreHe spiraled into severe respiratory distress, needing a lifesaving-ventilator and medically-induced coma to protect his fragile new organs, says the University of Florida Health where he was treated.But before he was put on the ventilator, the health care workers allowed him to speak with his wife. And he told her, \"This isn't over.\"Irish Porter says those words helped her through the hardest days while he was in hospital. \"I wasn't thinking positive at that time. Because I kept seeing all these people around us passing away,\" she says. But hearing his words changed that. \"It was a sense of relief. Even though I was sick myself and had body aches, I was able to sleep. A peace came over me once he said he'll be back,\" she added.And Porter did get well.The first thing he said to his wife when he was conscious again was, \"I made it back.\"A complicated casePorter says his can't thank his caregivers enough, and in particular Dr. Juan Vilaro, his cardiologist at the University of Florida Health. \"He became a real friend. He made me feel more than just a patient,\" says Porter.Dr. Vilaro says Porter's case was more complicated than others because he developed severe Covid-19 less than 30 days after a combined heart and kidney transplant. Since he was still intensely immunosuppressed, he was therefore at very high risk of the infection being fatal. \"Our concern was his high mortality risk. Every death from Covid is tragic but this was a man who had been fighting for years to get definitive treatment for his failing heart,\" Dr. Vilaro says.\"He was just starting to experience the benefits of living without end-stage heart failure symptoms with his family when he became infected with Covid,\" he added.Dr. Vilaro calls Porter's recovery very lucky, especially given the the risk category he was in. \"Even in the highest risk subset of patients, there are plenty of survivors, but he certainly had numerous risk factors for dying of this and was able to pull through nonetheless,\" Dr Vilaro adds. A difficult choicePorter's case posed a tough choice for his doctors. \"It was like threading a needle with one hand. Covid causes other parts of the immune system to go into overdrive -- should we use meds to block that or should we other medication to keep him from rejecting his heart. One choice worsens the other,\" says Dr. Kartik Cherabuddi, Director of Antimicrobial Stewardship at the Univerisity of Florida Health, who also treated him. The hospital says everyone knows Porter, knows his smile, knows the special guy he is. When they saw his condition go downhill so quickly that he needed to be sedated and ventilated, they braced ourselves for the worst. But they were committed to getting him through it. \"We knew how badly he wanted to fight,\" Dr Vilaro says. \"All I can say is that with a team effort, and lots of prayers, he's living to tell this story now, still smiling.\" Porter and his wife says their faith carried them through this difficult time.The family has just one message for people during this pandemic: Follow the guidelines of social distancing, washing hands and staying home. Otherwise, the virus will harm seniors and people on immune-suppressant medications like himself.Dr. Cherabuddi says the coronavirus has also taken a huge emotional toll on patients like the Porters.\"We have had family members admitted at the same time. We had patients who were not able to go back home as they did not want to expose anyone else. The emotional issues have been as challenging as medical issues,\" he says. The Porters' son, Caleb, says he's thrilled his father is finally well and back home. \"I am very, very excited,\" the five-year-old giggled.",

        "body": "(CNN)\"I love you guys with all my heart and you've given me the best life I could have ever asked for.\"\n\nThat's the beginning of a goodbye note one woman found on her husband's phone after he died from coronavirus this week.Jonathan Coelho, 32, passed away on April 22 after a 28-day battle in the hospital and 20 days on a ventilator, his wife, Katie Coelho told CNN.Now she's processing the sudden grief, and wondering how their two young children will react.\"They don't know that they lost the greatest human being and they'll only know their dad through pictures and videos,\" she said Friday night on Anderson Cooper's show.Read MoreJonathan seemed to be getting better, she said, and doctors had discussed taking him off the ventilator last Thursday or Friday.But early Wednesday morning Katie said she got a call from a nurse at the hospital in Danbury, Connecticut asking her to make her way over. By the time she got there, Jonathan had passed away from cardiac arrest caused by his coronavirus symptoms. She didn't get to say goodbye. And even though the couple didn't get the proper farewell they deserved, Jonathan left something special for Katie to discover in his absence. Gone but not forgotten \"They brought me into his room and he was laying there and he just looked scared,\" she said. \"He didn't look peaceful and I just kept saying 'I'm sorry.'\" Katie collected a plastic bag filled with her husband's possessions and headed home. \"For some reason in my delirium, I wanted to get all of the pictures of my husband and my kids off of his phone,\" Katie said.She turned the phone on and found a note from Jonathan along with his life insurance information.\"I am so lucky it makes me so proud to be your husband and the father to Braedyn and Penny,\" he wrote. \"Katie you are the most beautiful caring nurturing person I've ever met. You are truly one of a kind...make sure you live life with happiness and that same passion that made me fall in love with you. Seeing you be the best mom to the kids is the greatest thing I've ever experienced.\"Katie said she was really taken aback when she saw it.\"If I was sick and feeling crummy, I don't know if I would have had the strength to give my family a goodbye letter,\" she said. \"And to make sure they knew how much I loved them and how happy I was with them.\" Katie Coelho's story was originally reported by BuzzFeed.Taking necessary precautionsThe couple of seven years met in college. They became friends and dated other people for a while.\"He was always my go-to person,\" she told CNN's Cooper. \"He had an amazing way of always making you feel safe.\"Finally, in 2011, Jonathan said, \"Why haven't we been dating each other this entire time?\"They married and have two children together, Braedyn, 2, and Penelope, 10 months. Braedyn was born with several medical complexities including cerebral palsy, according to Katie. But the road to parenthood wasn't easy. The pair had two miscarriages and went through IVF.When Braedyn was born doctors predicted he only had 6 weeks to a year to survive. Because of his health complexities, Katie looks after the kids full time while Jonathan worked at a courthouse close to home.With Braedyn considered a high risk individual, Katie said the family went above and beyond to make sure they were social distancing and quarantining at home to reduce their exposure to germs. Katie said two weeks prior to her state's stay-at-home orders, she remembered Jonathan calling her from work to tell her just how worried he was about the potential for what was to come.Jonathan, a probation officer, considered an essential employee, was still going to work. Katie said she canceled all of Braedyn's therapy appointments and the family began self-quarantining at home.On March 23, Jonathan got tested for coronavirus after finding out he had come in contact with someone who had tested positive during the week before.'I can hear him so clearly in my mind' Jonathan tested positive on March 25 and was admitted to the hospital a day later after he started experiencing headaches, coughing, stomach problems and issues with his sense of taste and smell. By all accounts, Katie said her husband was a healthy man with no pre-existing conditions.\"When you have heard of people passing, you read the stories and you almost look for a justification like oh, they were 65 years old or they smoke or have pre-existing conditions, but my husband doesn't fall under any of these categories,\" she said. Katie said the last time she had a coherent, logical conversation on the phone with Jonathan was on March 29. Later that evening, the couple exchanged a final set of texts.According to the time stamp on Jonathan's note to Katie, he wrote the note to her during that phone call. The next day he was intubated. A Facebook page dedicated to documenting Braedyn's medical journey turned into a place for Katie to document what was happening with her husband.In the first few weeks while Jonathan was hospitalized, the nurses would call Katie and sometimes FaceTime her so she could talk to Jonathan.\"I've found myself replaying memories in my head to picture what Jonathan and my conversations would be for the day,\" she wrote. \"It's my only comfort, because I know him so well, I can hear him so clearly in my mind.\"She told Cooper, \"I keep thinking in my head there will be a time when I've been without my husband longer than I was with him, and it hurts a lot.\"A shattered heartKatie said she wanted to share what happened to her husband in hopes of painting a raw picture of the reality of how going to work cost her husband his life.\"My husband should not have died Wednesday morning,\" she said. \"But he did.\" On April 22, Katie posted a video memory of Jonathan with the update that he had passed and hours later, a link to his obituary.\"The pain we are feeling is indescribable, Katie wrote on Facebook. \"Our everything was stolen from us. My heart is not even broken it's shattered. My kids and I will live the rest of our lives without Jonathan. And I don't know how we're going to do it.\"A GoFundMe account has been setup to help The Coelho family.",

        "body": "(CNN)The air quality in the United States is dramatically declining, leaving about 150 million people -- nearly half of America's population -- breathing unhealthy, heavily polluted air, according to the newly released \"State of the Air\" 2020 report by the American Lung Association.\n\n\"We're moving in the wrong direction, with nearly 21 million more people breathing dirty air than in last year's report,\" said Paul Billings, the national senior vice president of public policy for the American Lung Association.That's particularly bad news for people like Tim Seib, a 37-year-old New York City regional theater director who has suffered from asthma his entire life. \"Knowing we've let our air get worse is maddening to me because air quality directly affects my day to day health,\" Seib said. \"It's not like a political stance, it's not an ideology thing.\"\"When asthma symptoms start, you don't know when your next full breath of air is going to come. It almost feels like you're drowning,\" Seib continued. Read More\"I don't think until you've walked in the shoes of someone with respiratory issues (that) you really understand how scary that can be.\"50th anniversary of Clean Air ActThis year marks the 50th anniversary of the Clean Air Act, which charged the US Environmental Protection Agency with regulating all sources of air emissions. The goal was to reduce air pollution and acid rain, increase air quality and visibility, slow climate change and protect the ozone layer. According to the EPA, the act is responsible for a 50% decline in emissions of key air pollutants since 1990, the year when a new series of amendments were passed.Under the Trump administration, however, a number of those protections have been rolled back or have gone unregulated. It's that lack of enforcement -- along with worsening climate change -- which has lead to the recent reversal of air quality gains, the report said.\"If there's no environmental cop on the beat, we know that polluters will skirt the rules of the law, will cheat and will increase emissions,\" Billings said. \"And pollution will increase. It has increased.\"Environmental advocacy groups were equally critical.\"Around the world, toxic air kills 5 million people every year and, as this report makes clear, the US has a long way to go to better protect communities.\" said Sarah Vogel, vice president for health at the Environmental Defense Fund. \"Unfortunately, the Trump administration is still trying to weaken existing safeguards and allow even more dangerous pollution in our air,\" Vogel said.CNN reached out to the EPA for comment but did not receive a response.Increases in types of pollutionThe 21st annual \"State of the Air\" report analyzed data from 2016, 2017 and 2018 -- three of the five hottest years in recorded history in the world, the report said.Those warmer temperatures contributed to the rise of ozone levels in many places in the US, the report found, affecting more than 137 million people. Breathing in ozone, or smog, can cause asthma attacks, shortness of breath, and trigger coughing, the report said.The heat from increasing climate change also contributed to wildfires, especially in western states, which spiked particulate pollution levels to dangerous levels, the report said. Particulate matter is a mixture of solid and liquid matter found in the air. Dust, dirt and smoke particles are larger but there are also extremely small, inhalable particulates that can't be seen with the naked eye. Those are called PM 2.5 because their size is generally 2.5 micrometers or less.That's really tiny. As a comparison, an average human hair is 30 times larger than a PM 2.5 particle. Because they are so small, these particulates can get deep into our airways and wreak havoc with our lungs and bodily functions.The report found nine western cities reached their worst levels of particulate pollution ever recorded: Fairbanks, Alaska; Yakima, Washington; Las Vegas, Nevada; Phoenix, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; and the following cities in California -- Chico, Salinas, Redding and Santa Maria. In contrast, the cities with the cleanest air, defined as no high ozone or high particle pollution days over the three-year period of the sudy, were Bangor, Maine; Honolulu, Hawaii; Wilmington, North Carolina; and Burlington, Vermont. \"The report finds the air quality in some communities has improved, but the 'State of the Air' finds that far too many people are still breathing unhealthy air,\" said American Lung Association President and CEO Harold Wimmer in a statement.\"Climate change continues to degrade air quality and increase the risk of air pollution harming health,\" Wimmer said. Significant health impactsEven short-term exposure to particulate pollution can trigger cardiovascular issues, strokes and asthma attacks as well as contribute to the development of dementia, studies show.Air pollution is also increasing the risk of dying from Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A recent Harvard study found US counties with the highest levels of air pollution had significantly higher death rates from COVID-19 than counties with much lower levels.Seib lives in the Harlem district of New York City, which has been extremely hard hit by Covid-19. He caught a milder form of the virus a few weeks ago, and even that was frightening for him. \"All my life, my asthma symptoms have gotten worse at night,\" he said. \"So the Covid symptoms just kept intensifying and it was scary to go to bed at night not knowing if I was going to wake up in the middle of an asthma attack or be more compromised than I was when I went to sleep.\"Knowing what it is like to struggle for breath, Seib finds it hard to understand why any regulations to protect US air quality would be cut or relaxed.\"So my message would be, please just try to see it through someone's eyes, like myself or God forbid, someone who has even even worse symptoms or health concerns,\" Seib said. \"Because we don't have a ton of options out there, and it's a very scary and very real thing to wake up to everyday.\"",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Face masks can be unexpectedly complicated, especially for those who are new to wearing them.\n\nNavigating which ones you should buy and understanding who they protect, figuring out if you can reuse them and how to get your little ones to wear them are daunting tasks. Social distancing is still our best bet to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. But since April 3, Americans have been encouraged by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to wear \"cloth coverings\" in places where distancing guidelines are hard to maintain. But is your bandana really helping you? Should only people who know they're infected wear masks? And what if your kids throw a tantrum when you ask them to put one on? We answer every question readers have been asking about face masks. Read MoreShould I wear a mask in public?On April 3, the CDC shifted its guidelines to recommend that we should wear \"cloth coverings\" in public places where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores and pharmacies. The updated guidance was in light of new evidence of the high percentage of people spreading the virus asymptomatically. This means the virus can easily spread between people interacting in close proximity by coughing, sneezing or even talking -- even if those people aren't exhibiting symptoms. Some states require citizens to wear masks in public spaces -- such as Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, as of April 20. Some countries, including Germany, Turkey and Jamaica, have required to some degree that people wear masks. Who is protected by wearing a mask?The benefit of wearing masks in public isn't to protect you from getting sick. It's to protect others from exposure if you are sick or if you're an asymptomatic carrier. But if we all wear masks, we could help each other, said Dr. Joseph Vinetz, a professor in the infectious disease section at Yale School of Medicine.\"The idea about the face mask is to prevent the virus from coming out of somebody's mouth and nose, mostly out of their mouth,\" Vinetz said. \"They prevent somebody, when they talk or sometimes when they sneeze or cough, from expelling virus and leading to infection in other people.\"Wearing a mask doesn't totally prevent you from getting infected, Vinetz added. The virus can live on surfaces for hours, and in trace amounts up to three days, and it's easy to touch your face when you're not wearing a mask. Even if you wear a mask, maintaining 6-feet social distancing is still important to slowing the spread of the virus. The CDC considers face masks an additional, voluntary public health measure -- but remember to refer to your home state's guidance as well. What kind of mask should I buy?Though the CDC recommends we wear masks, we shouldn't buy surgical masks or N95 respirator masks. Those types are desperately needed by health care workers and first responders who are in constant proximity with coronavirus patients every day, and supplies in some areas are dwindling. You can, however, easily make your own cloth mask from old clothes or other common materials and household items. And you don't even have to sew. You can make one using a bandana and coffee filter. US Surgeon General Jerome Adams showed us how to make face masks with a T-shirt and rubber bands in this CDC video. \"Ultimately, it's about having some form of barrier with multiple layers,\" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN video on why masks in addition to physical distancing are important. Masks made with a combination of cotton with natural silk or chiffon may also effectively filter out aerosol particles, according to a new study published Friday in the American Chemical Society Nano journal. Our respiratory droplets form in a range of sizes, but the tiny ones, called aerosol particles, can slip through the gaps between certain cloth fibers. You could substitute the chiffon with natural silk or flannel, or use a cotton quilt with cotton-polyester insulation, to achieve similar results, the study said. There are also disposable cloth masks you can buy in a store or online. They're not made for surgery or hospitals, but they are effective for your needs and widely used. What's the difference between a surgical mask and an N95 mask?\"When we talk about face coverings, there are the surgical masks I wear in the hospital to protect patients from my own germs and avoid any splashes,\" said Gupta, who works as a neurosurgeon. N95 respirators are masks that must be fitted to the faces of health care workers to protect them during certain procedures, Gupta added. \"It's the only one of these masks that prevents most very small particles from getting in, when used properly,\" he continued. \"We need to keep those masks in their hands.\"Are cloth masks as effective as medical masks?Medical-grade masks are more effective, but that \"doesn't mean we should dismiss the benefit of cloth masks,\" Gupta said. Because of how far our respiratory droplets travel when we talk, cough or sneeze, face masks can still help to contain the range of those droplets. The researchers in the Nano study used sodium chloride to replicate respiratory particles ranging in size, and blew with a fan the particles across material samples at a rate similar to a person's resting breath. They measured the number and size of particles in the air before and after they passed through the fabric. One layer of a tightly woven cotton sheet combined with two layers of polyester-spandex chiffon filtered out the most air particles, between 80% to 99%. According to the study, its effectiveness was close to an N95 mask. Tightly woven fabrics such as cotton can be a mechanical barrier to particles, while fabrics with a static charge, such as natural silk or chiffon, act as a electrostatic barrier, the study said. However, a very small gap reduced the efficacy of the mask by at least 50%, emphasizing the importance of a properly fitted mask, the study said. Can you reuse them?Homemade masks can be reused because they're washable, Vinetz said.You should launder the masks before and after each use to clean off any germs you may have picked up in public. Hand-wash the masks or put them in a mesh wash bag in the washing machine so they don't come apart, and use a high-heat setting.If you already have a disposable surgical or medical-grade mask, those can be reused, too. To disinfect it, leave it in a clean, safe place in your house for a couple days, Vinetz suggested. After that, it should no longer be infectious. Can you microwave them to kill germs?If you're thinking you might be able to nuke your mask to kill germs, that's \"not a great idea,\" Vinetz said. \"We have no evidence about that,\" he said. \"If there's a metal piece in an N95 or surgical mask and even staples, you can't microwave them. It'll blow up. If you have a homemade or cloth mask or what's called a face covering, you just wash it. Microwaving it is not going to work.\"How can I stop my glasses from fogging up?For those who wear glasses, wearing a mask means figuring out how to avoid our humid breath blocking us from seeing across the grocery store. Or from seeing anything, really. \"To avoid fogging up your glasses -- I have the problem myself -- short of getting Lasik surgery, you have to fold the mask around your nose so that the air coming out of your mouth or nose doesn't rise to your glasses,\" Vinetz said. (He's not recommending anyone get elective surgery right now.)How do I get my kids to wear one?If your child refuses to wear a mask, takes it off and throws it down, chews on it or otherwise, his actions could defeat the point of wearing a mask and raise the risk of infection, said Christopher Willard, a psychiatry lecturer at Harvard Medical School and author of \"The Breathing Book,\" a breathing practice book for kids.Kids may be apprehensive about wearing a face mask because they're more sensitive to new things than adults are, Willard said. \"There's also the weird psychological aspect of not being able to see their own face or other people's faces and facial expressions,\" he added, \"which really interferes with communication and signals that they [feel are safe].\"To ease their mask fears, buy or make coverings with appealing fabrics, or draw something cool with markers to make them look more fun. Try drawings of your child's favorite superheroes or ninjas wearing masks as they go about helping other people. Show your child your own mask and how, by wearing one, he'll be just like Mom or Dad. See if you can find pictures of your kid's favorite celebrities wearing masks. Doing so could make your kids feel like the masks are \"theirs\" and give them a sense of ownership, making them more excited and more likely to wear them, Willard said.\"I think also knowing that they are protecting others can help, and making it fun by talking about it as dressing up like superheroes or something.\"And altruism isn't only for kids, but for everyone wearing a mask for the public good. \"It's part of our social contract to look after one another,\" Vinetz said. \"It's social solidarity for everybody in a public place, when told to by public health and political authorities, [to] wear a face covering according to what's recommended.\"\n\nCNN's Holly Yan and Scottie Andrew contributed to this report.",

        "body": "America's response to the coronavirus is the most American thing ever\n\nBy Scottie Andrew, CNN\n\nUpdated 1210 GMT (2010 HKT) May 19, 2020\n\n(CNN)The US response to coronavirus has been consistently inconsistent. It's also uniquely American.\n\nThere are no national guidelines and no organized efforts to reopen the country beyond what measures states have taken. Public health officials say one thing while governors say another and President Donald Trump says something else entirely. We Americans are left to make up our own minds. It's a symptom of American individualism, a national value that prizes personal freedoms, limited government and free will over all else. \"It's always been the orientation of America on balance, compared to other countries, to put a priority on individual freedom and liberty,\" says Andrea Campbell, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies the intersection of politics and public health.It's the ideal that birthed the US, when colonists split from the British monarchy to establish their own nation. It powered pioneers who ventured west to the frontier, where they settled their own towns and made their own rules. It's in our DNA.Read MoreIt's also sown deep political divides, distrust of centralized authority and even skepticism of science. And it's informing the country's unruly response to this pandemic.It's reinforcing our partisan politics Republicans and Democrats interpret individualism differently, and those divides are more pronounced than ever in our deeply polarized political climate. Now, even the pandemic is refracted through an ideological lens. \"Nothing binds groups together like facing a common enemy,\" says Ann Keller, a University of California-Berkeley associate professor who studies pandemic responses. \"But we're still treating members of the other party as the enemy rather than the virus.\"President Trump has changed his tune on coronavirus throughout the pandemic, often at the same briefing. He publicly disagreed with public health officials on reopening schools, recommended masks while saying he doesn't plan to wear one and repeatedly downplayed the severity of the virus. His supporters are listening. So are those who detest him. Both hear what they want to. In an April CNN poll, a plurality of Americans (55%) said the federal government has done a poor job of preventing the spread of the coronavirus. But 80% of Republicans said the federal government has done a good job, and 85% of Democrats said the opposite. Questions over reopening are fraught, too. More than half of Republicans in the same poll said they feel comfortable returning to their normal routines. Just a quarter of Democrats said the same. Those opinions played out in state closures. Democrat-led California shut down on March 19, the first state to do so. Meanwhile, Republican-led states like Florida and Texas resisted shutting down until two weeks later and reopened relatively quickly. In this unsettling time, even the wearing of a face mask has become a political statement.It's possible for even a deeply divided America to overcome party divides. Keller points to President George W. Bush, whose popularity soared from the low 50s to 90% in the days after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Terrorism was a national threat, and there was no question of that threat's legitimacy. But the coronavirus isn't being viewed in the same way.\"We have the capacity to overlook party and get behind a president and get behind a cause,\" Keller says. \"And we're just not seeing that in this pandemic.\" It's feeding anger toward state governmentsAmericans have resented centralized power since they dumped tea in Boston Harbor. Many still bristle when they think politicians are stepping on their freedoms -- even in a pandemic. Because there was never a nationwide stay-at-home order and the virus didn't unfold evenly across the country, some states took decisive early action, which might've helped them avoid potentially devastating outcomes, says David Rosner, a sociomedical historian at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. \"The fact that different states at different moments had the ability to shape their own reaction was a good thing,\" Rosner says. \"They didn't depend on a federal government that had no coherent activity, actions or ability to shape a federal response to illness and disease.\" Limited government is a conservative ideal, which may explain why Trump has handed the reins back to the states. Without national guidelines and an organized response, states, counties and residents have been left to make their own choices, either in line with or against public health advice. For weeks, protesters have led rallies to reopen their states' economies. And instead of directing their ire toward the federal government, they're targeting governors responsible for the stay-at-home orders. Republican governors like Maryland's Larry Hogan and Democrats like Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan have stoked the rage of residents who accuse them of stifling their rights to reopen their small business or go to a hair stylist. But Americans have obeyed and even welcomed government intervention in past crises, Rosner notes. In the 1930s President Franklin Delano Roosevelt grew the federal government's powers permanently with New Deal programs that helped pull the country out of the Great Depression. And again during World War II, Americans largely accepted sweeping changes for the communal good. Food and clothing were rationed and the economy became almost entirely industrial -- all in service of the war effort. \"We're not seeing Americans pull together in the way we thought they would, like the sacrifices made in World War II,\" Keller says. \"People saw it as part of being an American, and people found meaning in those individual sacrifices. I think it's striking that we're not seeing that.\"It's reflecting our distrust of scienceRosner lived through the polio crisis in the 1950s. Lines outside physician's offices would wrap around buildings and down several blocks, and within 25 years, polio was virtually eradicated from the US.The same may not be true if and when a coronavirus vaccine becomes available. That's because of a meager but vocal (and growing) mistrust in science, punctuated by the climate crisis and the anti-vaccine movement. People in these groups view scientific experts as dictatorial figures whose decisions strip people of their freedoms to choose what's best for them. The most divisive scientific topics of our time, climate change and vaccination, are well-studied. The novel coronavirus is not. It emerged at the tail end of 2019, and we are still learning more about its transmission. Guidance around it has changed rapidly, most notably where masks are concerned. That only fuels further mistrust in people already skeptical of science. It's telling, too, that the CDC has taken a backseat in handling the crisis, Keller says. It started when the CDC's initial coronavirus tests failed and delayed the response for weeks. And CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield has been much less visible than Dr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. It may have weakened the White House's confidence in the health agency, Keller says. \"For some reason, the CDC has not regained its footing and has not been given leave to create a national-level response,\" she says. \"The organization that has always led pandemic responses nationally looks to be incredibly hobbled.\" It's fortifying our belief that America knows bestWe defend our freedoms fiercely. We bark in the face of fear, and we don't like being told what to do. We're Americans, and we've emerged victorious from every crisis we've ever weathered, right? So it's hard to imagine the US taking the same approach to the coronavirus as Hong Kong, where arriving passengers are apprehended at the airport, required to wear tracking bracelets and mandated to stay in quarantine for two weeks upon arrival. Our approach also wasn't as lax as Sweden, where residents have lived freely, without lockdowns, since the pandemic began. We haven't followed any countries' leads. That's the American way -- our individualistic identity is a global one, too. \"Americans have this very strong sense of American exceptionalism -- that the US is different than other countries and superior in many ways,\" Campbell says. The US and South Korea saw their first confirmed cases around the same time. But by mid-April, South Korea was counting only 30 new cases daily, compared to 20,000 in the US. That's because the East Asian country quickly opened hundreds of testing facilities, imposed quarantine measures on travelers from Wuhan, China, in early January and recruited contact tracers from the start. South Korea's model worked. The US lagged behind it. \"You'd imagine that people would take [other countries' responses] as evidence that continuing to quarantine and social distance are effective responses to the virus,\" Campbell says. \"But what we've seen is kind of poo-pooing what other countries do and thinking we know best.\" It's leading our cost-benefit approach to the virusAmerican individualism is the driving force behind another national value -- capitalism, which requires people to act in their self-interest. So, when weighing the tradeoffs of social distancing, many Americans make their decision with some capitalistic cost-benefit analysis. The cost is life as we know it -- going to restaurants, shopping, visiting friends, working at an office. The benefit is our health, and the health of loved ones and strangers.Making sacrifices to help a stranger may be a hard sell for some. \"The issue with the coronavirus is that it's not very visible,\" Keller says. \"You don't know who you're protecting, who's avoided getting sick from your actions. That's a big ask of people, especially when it appears that not everyone is doing it or that the criteria seems to be different in different parts of the country.\" Coronavirus isn't something we can see rip through the country like a tornado. The benefits, too, are invisible. If coronavirus guidelines work, they may not seem like they were ever necessary, because fewer people will have gotten sick. But people will remember what they lost by making those sacrifices. It's easier for policymakers to weigh their response to coronavirus with a utilitarian approach. By that philosophy, the minority will suffer so that the majority may benefit. More than 89,000 Americans have died from coronavirus. But more than 36 million have filed for unemployment. If lawmakers rely on that ratio alone to decide whether to reopen, the decision is already made. But we can still fight this togetherIf the virus is with us for many more months, we may move toward a united response, Keller says. \"There is potential that we will see something that looks more like Americans pulling together, a more common view of what kind of sacrifices are necessary,\" she says. Americans have \"great traditions\" of coming together when crises threaten us, Rosner says. From the Great Depression to 9/11, we've weathered conflicts that have tested our national mettle. The conditions of coronavirus are more fraught than those crises, but Keller thinks that the longer we live with this, the greater the pressure to coalesce to defeat it.Not every American subscribes to the historic definition of individualism that prizes oneself over the communal good. Some are exercising their individual will to stay home if they can, in line with public health advice. And those of us who can't stay home are largely following the safest protocols for how to act in the workplace. Americans don't want to live in fear of an invisible enemy, and we don't want our country to crumble. But to beat this crisis, we may need to balance individual liberties with collective sacrifice. That doesn't come naturally to us, but we can do it. We've done it before.\n\nCNN's Athena Jones, Jennifer Agiesta and Daniel Burke contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Even as global health authorities warn of potential dangers and misinformation about an untested natural therapy, the leader of one African country is pushing a traditional tonic to try to treat coronavirus patients across the continent.\n\nThe product has not been tested in line with international standards, the World Health Organization said this week. Its use could accelerate resistance to an ingredient that has proven effective in treating malaria, heightening risk related to that potentially deadly infection, experimental medicine expert Dr. Arthur Grollman told CNN. Madagascar, where many people rely on natural medicine, has agreed to work with the African Union and the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention on an herbal remedy it claims could help treat Covid-19, the bloc's deputy chairman announced Wednesday in a tweet.The effort would aim to \"benefit the continent at large,\" Kwesi Quartey tweeted.But the World Health Organization, or WHO, has warned against using untested herbal therapies to treat coronavirus patients without first \"establishing their efficacy and safety through rigorous clinical trials\" in step with global standards. Read MoreWHO acknowledges medicinal plants such as Artemisia annua, from which the tonic is made, are \"being considered as possible treatments\" but stresses they \"should be tested for efficacy and adverse side effects,\" it wrote this month in a news release.\"As efforts are under way to find treatment for COVID-19, caution must be taken against misinformation, especially on social media, about the effectiveness of certain remedies,\" the agency wrote.\"Many plants and substances are being proposed without the minimum requirements and evidence of quality, safety and efficacy. The use of products to treat COVID-19, which have not been robustly investigated can put people in danger, giving a false sense of security and distracting them from hand washing and physical distancing which are cardinal in COVID-19 prevention, and may also increase self-medication and the risk to patient safety.\"How unproven claims can fuel drug resistanceMadagascar's President, Andry Rajoelina, has put himself front and center in the push for the tonic he calls a preventive and curative remedy against the coronavirus. But he has not detailed how it supposedly treats the virus or discussed potential side effects. His spokeswoman has not responded to CNN's request Wednesday for comment. Along with a photo of himself sipping an amber-colored fluid from a bottle, Rajoelina announced last month that scientists from the country's research institute had developed Covid Organics, or CVO, to treat Covid-19. CNN's calls and emails this week to the Malagasy Institute of Applied Research have not been returned.CVO is made from the artemisia plant and other local Malagasy plants, the president said. The herb is a source of artemisinin, a significant component of modern antimalarials, and the plant has been the subject of Western studies looking at possible coronavirus treatments. But the tonic promoters are drawing erroneous conclusions from unproven claims that artemisinin, much like antimalarial chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, will work against the coronavirus, Dr. Arthur Grollman, professor of pharmacological science and experimental medicine at Stony Brook University in New York told CNN.\"The flaw in their thinking is that antimalarial activity has anything to do with antiviral activity, which it does not,\" Grollman said. Widespread use of Artemisia annua in the pandemic will accelerate resistance to it, endangering people in countries, including Madagascar, where artemisinin-based drugs are being used to treat malaria, he said.\"The product won't work and will result in more people dying from coronavirus due to the false sense of security created by the advertisement and also more people dying from malaria due to artemisia resistance,\" Grollman said.Malaria is endemic in many African countries, and as many as 400,000 people died of it globally in 2018, according to WHO.Independent validation is criticalWhile WHO recognizes herbal medicine as a resource in the public health systems of many Africa countries, its efficacy must be proven on a case-by-case basis, the agency's director for Africa, Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, said Thursday. \"Any medicine that is being used including this product in Madagascar, we advise be taken through some assessment,\" she said. \"How effective it is? ... What might be the side effects that may be undesirable? What could be the dosing that needs to be adjusted?\" The WHO country office has \"initiated\" a conversation with authorities in Madagascar to test and assess the tonic, officials said. The race to find a treatment for the coronavirus has reignited interest in antimalarial drugs. Even US President Donald Trump had touted the antimalarial hydroxychloroquine as a potential treatment, though studies since then have shown it doesn't work against Covid-19 and could cause heart problems.Even as researchers the world over work feverishly toward a treatment for Covid-19, no country should simply promote the efficacy of an unproven remedy, said Charles Wambebe, professor of pharmacology at the Tshwane University of Technology, South Africa. Independent validation with appropriate bodies is key, he said. Potential treatments, including traditional medicines, must pass safety, efficacy and quality checks, among other criteria before they can be accepted globally.\"If you're confident about the clinical and scientific studies you've done, then submit to a regulatory body for revalidation to give it more credibility,\" Wambebe told CNN.The African Union has asked Madagascar to share technical and scientific data about the herbal infusion for review as leaders across the continent have expressed interest in using the drink, called Covid Organics, or CVO, to fight outbreaks.Madagascar has been giving out the tonic for free, and Equatorial Guinea, Chad and Guinea Bissau have gotten shipments, the island nation's president said. Nigeria said it had received samples of the product from Guinea Bissau and would first test and validate it. \"We will not put anything to use in Nigeria without the endorsement of our regulatory institutions,\" Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari said in a statement on Saturday.The tonic also was distributed door-to-door for free across many regions of Madagascar after its unveiling last month, journalist Ga\u00eblle Borgia told CNN. It's now being sold in supermarkets and stores in the capital Antananarivo for 40 cents,1,500 ariary) and it's free for locals who can't afford it, Borgia said.But WHO warned in its earlier statement May 4 that Artemisia annua and other medicinal plants must be \"tested to the same standards as ... the rest of the world.\"\"Even if therapies are derived from traditional practice and natural, establishing their efficacy and safety through rigorous clinical trials is critical,\" the agency wrote.Rajoelina in an interview this week with France 24 slammed WHO's position and claimed 105 people have recovered from Covid-19 and those who did weren't treated with anything other than Covid-Organics. After someone is exposed to the virus, symptoms tend to appear within two to 14 days.Still, the President insisted the possibility of a treatment should not be ignored.\"You speak of proof; I spoke of war earlier,\" Rajoelina said when asked about evidence of his claim. He again did not share any further evidence of the tonic's efficacy or safety.\"When we are in this period of war, what is the proof we can show or give?\" he said. \"It is, of course, the healing of our sick.\"Madagascar has recorded 230 cases of Covid-19, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. No exception for clinical trialWHO is not opposed to countries developing research into potential treatments, but they must follow established scientific protocols and guidelines before any product can be recommended for wider use, said the agency's program manager for emergency response for Africa, Dr. Michel Yao.\"Instead of exporting it, like in the case of Madagascar, and having blanket statements about it, why don't we set up a clear protocol that is already on ground so we can have stronger evidence of its impact in this outbreak,\" Yao told CNN.Indeed, 70 traditional medicine experts who met virtually with the world health agency \"unanimously agreed that clinical trials must be conducted for all medicines in the Region, without exception,\" WHO Africa Region tweeted Tuesday. WHO has licensed dozens of herbal medicines for the treatment of other ailments and also matched traditional practitioners with research institutes to help their work, Yao said.Researchers are working on treatment options for Covid-19, and at least 110 potential vaccines are in development, according to WHO.\n\nCNN's Niamh Kennedy and Devon Sayers contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)An 8-year-old boy was rescued by his teen brother's quick thinking after going into cardiac arrest at home, his family says, following what doctors told them was a coronavirus-related condition.\n\nJayden Hardowar in Queens, New York, came down with a mild fever in late April and seemed to show he had recovered, his father told CNN's Anderson Cooper Wednesday. But shortly after, he came down with an upset stomach and three days later, collapsed.Tyron, the boy's 15-year-old brother, performed CPR he learned as a Boy Scout and helped keep Jayden alive until first responders arrived and used a defibrillator to revive him, Roup Hardowar, the boys' father said. \"I was very nervous. I had all these thoughts going through my head, but then I told myself I need to put them aside and I need to focus,\" Tyron told CNN.\"Once I saw him take a deep breath I was, like, 'I'm doing something right,'' he said. \"I'm very happy that, you know, I made an impact on his life.\"Read MoreJayden, who his father says is now back home and recovering, tested negative to the virus but positive to antibodies. He stayed in the hospital for nearly two weeks and is still not yet able to communicate, Roup Hardowar told CNN.Hardowar said when his son presented the fever, they consulted with a pediatrician who suggested it was the flu, since the boy was not showing any other coronavirus related symptoms. He said they have no idea when their son may have gone through the coronavirus and whether it could have been weeks ago, while he was still in school. \"This is the mystery of what's happening with the kids today,\" Hardowar said, adding that doctors told them an underlying condition the boy had may have been \"compromised as a result of the coronavirus.\"But the parents had no idea he may have had the condition. \"We never knew this. And it's an underlying condition that just came about right now and the doctors believe it's as a result of the virus,\" he said.Because of the many unknowns, Hardowar says parents should take seriously any signs, even if they think those are not virus-related.\"At one point we (knew) that only adults and the elderly we should look at but I would say today that's not the case,\" Hardowar said. \"We have to look at our kids and look at all the signs that are coming along. The signs are no longer Covid-related signs. They can be anything that you have to take very (seriously).\"A mystery illness reported in childrenMeanwhile, officials across the US have raised an alarm in the past week of a mysterious coronavirus-related illness that is showing up in kids. Doctors warned Wednesday that parents and hospitals should expect to see more of the condition that seems to be affecting children who may have already had the virus.An informal panel of pediatricians organized by Boston Children's Hospital dubbed the condition \"Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with Covid-19.\"The condition appears to be a post-viral syndrome, said Dr. Jeffrey Burns, a critical care specialist at Boston Children's Hospital who has been coordinating a global group of doctors who compare notes on the condition.Doctors are investigating cases in at least 150 children, most of them in New York. \"This multisystem inflammatory syndrome is not directly caused by the virus,\" Burns told CNN. \"The leading hypothesis is that it is due to the immune response of the patient.\"Symptoms of that condition include persistent fever, inflammation and poor function in organs such as the kidneys or heart. Children may also show evidence of blood vessel inflammation, such as red eyes, a bright red tongue and cracked lips, said Dr. Moshe Arditi, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.\n\nCNN's Maggie Fox, Michael Nedelman and Jen Christensen contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)The coronavirus pandemic may have slowed down in many parts of the country because of social distancing efforts but don't plan your parties, vacations or trips to the office just yet. Experts say the virus won't be a thing of the past any time soon.\n\nA second round of Covid-19 cases is \"inevitable\" come fall, the nation's top infectious disease doctor said, as people increasingly try to resume regular life and more states ease or lift their stay-at-home orders.\"I'm almost certain it will come back, because the virus is so transmissible and it's globally spread,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci during an Economic Club of Washington webinar earlier this week. Americans could be in for \"a bad fall and a bad winter\" if the country is unprepared, said Fauci, who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Here's what we know about the possibility of a second wave of the virus and the reasoning behind it.Read MoreWhy in the fall?There are many aspects of the virus that remain unknown for scientists but older viruses are offering some clues. People usually get infected by four common coronaviruses that were first identified in the mid-1960s, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And those tend to peak in the winter months. Dr. Greg Poland, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the Mayo Clinic, said that SARS-CoV-2, the technical name for the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19, is likely to follow that pattern.If that happens, a second wave of the virus would return just in time for the start of flu season. The flu has been a constant threat for Americans and devastating in recent years. The CDC estimates there were at least 39 million cases of the flu in the US and at least 24,000 deaths during the 2019-2020 season. Poland, the director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group, says the combination of a second wave of Covid-19 with flu season could create \"a lot of confusion\" because of their overlap in symptoms and put a heavy strain on the health care system.It wouldn't be the first pandemic to come back in force. In 2009, the US experienced a wave of cases of the H1N1 influenza virus, known as swine flu, in the spring. Months later, a second wave was reported in the fall and winter, the CDC says.\"Often, not always ... often the second wave of a pandemic is worse,\" Poland said, adding that the coronavirus pandemic spread in the US well into the flu season. Another example is the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed 50 million people globally and about 675,000 Americans. At the time, there was an initial mild spring wave in the US but a lethal second wave hit the country in September.It appear that the novel coronavirus is likely to keep spreading for at least another 18 months. There are several possible scenarios for the course of the pandemic but the worst of them is a second wave of infections just like the 1918 influenza pandemic, according to a report by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.\"This thing's not going to stop until it infects 60 to 70 percent of people,\" said Mike Osterholm, the CIDRAP director, in an interview with CNN.\"The idea that this is going to be done soon defies microbiology.\"Osterholm coauthored a CIDRAP report released Thursday that recommended the US prepare for a worst-case scenario that includes a second big wave of coronavirus infections in the fall and winter. What can be done about a second wave of infection?Health experts say the coming months would be a good time to prepare for a potential second outbreak of the virus.Hospitals and clinics should replenish their stocks of personal protective equipment and testing supplies. People should try to get healthier if possible, continue using face masks for the time being and keep gatherings to no more than 10 people, several experts told CNN.As cities reopen, local officials should make plans to quickly reissue stay-at-home orders or other strict social distancing measures in the future if needed, Poland saidHealth officials across the country must continue focusing on expanding coronavirus testing, contact tracing and treatment, said Dr. Helen Boucher, chief of the geographic medicine and infectious diseases division at Tufts University Medical Center.\"We hope we'll have more tools in our toolbox, maybe we'll have some treatments for Covid-19 by then, maybe we'll have better diagnostics,\" Boucher said. The Trump administration has estimated a vaccine is 12 to 18 months away, though some leaders in the field say that timeline could be too fast.Improving the way health workers handle the coronavirus pandemic will be key, Boucher says, so the country is \"as prepared as we can be\" when it's time to face an outbreak of both the coronavirus and the flu. While most experts believe that people who have recovered from the virus will have some sort of immunity, Poland says it's unclear how strong that immunity might be, how long it might last and the accuracy of antibody tests is inconsistent.\"We are placing a lot of hope on that but we don't have answers yet,\" Poland said. \"This (virus) is only 16 weeks old so there's a lot we don't know yet.\"The experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir was approved on Friday by the US Food and Drug Administration to treat hospitalized Covid-19 patients in severe condition. The drug, which is the first authorized treatment for Covid-19, is far from a cure, according to a government-funded study, but patients who took it recovered faster than patients who did not. \"We have work to do. We are looking for other therapies. This trial is going to continue,\" Dr. Andre Kalil, the principal investigation behind the clinical trial, told CNN's Elizabeth Cohen earlier this week.Has the virus made a comeback elsewhere?Yes. In recent weeks, Singapore has seen a dramatic spike in coronavirus infections, with thousands of new cases linked to clusters in foreign worker dormitories. Singapore had initially been praised for its response and apparent ability to suppress infections in the first three months of the coronavirus pandemic. Then the number of cases exploded in April. Since March 17, Singapore's total cases grew from 266 to more than 17,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.To control the spread, the government has attempted to isolate the dormitories, test workers and move symptomatic patients into quarantine facilities. It's a daunting task because workers live in cramped conditions that make social distancing near impossible. The government also instituted what it is calling a \"circuit breaker,\" a package of restrictions and new rules, combined with harsh punishments.The semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong had a relatively small number of cases when it saw a spike after it relaxed restrictions in March. Many cases were imported from overseas as Hong Kong residents who had left -- either to work or study abroad, or to seek safety when the city seemed destined for a major outbreak earlier this year -- returned, bringing the virus back with them.",

        "body": "(CNN)Dr. Matt Dougherty isn't waiting for his pediatric asthma patients or their parents to call him in a panic, frightened that a sudden cough or wheeze is due to the novel coronavirus. He's reaching out to them, virtually, via telemedicine.\n\n\"I look through my patient files, identify the ones in the past that I know have had problems this time of year with allergies triggering their asthma and contact them before they have symptoms,\" said Dougherty, who treats children with allergies and asthma at Esse Health in St. Louis, Missouri.\"I tell my patients, let's maximize your lung health now,\" he said. \"Then in case you get unlucky enough to run into coronavirus, at least we've come into it with the best lung condition we can.\" Asthma vs. Covid-19 symptomsAsthma is one of the underlying health conditions that puts one at higher risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Read More\"During an asthma attack it's almost like breathing through a straw because that inflammation is restricting the airway,\" said Dr. Lakiea Wright, who specializes in allergies and immunology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.\"You can imagine if a virus that causes extra inflammation gets in there, then that's going to be worse,\" Wright said. \"Those are the patients who might end up on ventilators to help with breathing because Covid-19 is doing a lot of damage in the lungs.\"Many of the key signs of Covid-19, such as coughing, shortness of breath and chest tightness, are also typical symptoms of asthma. Other potential Covid-19 signs, such as sneezing, runny nose, red eyes and fatigue, can mimic allergy responses.That's an issue because of the 25 million Americans who have asthma, two-thirds suffer from the allergic form of the disease, in which environmental allergens such as dust, insects, pets, mold and pollen will trigger their asthma. The number is even higher in children, Wright said: \"Up to 90% of children with asthma can have allergic asthma.\"So if the signs are so similar, how can one tell them apart?\"It can be very confusing to patients,\" Wright said. \"I tell my patients to look for things that would be more distinguishing symptoms of Covid-19 such as fever and body aches. Allergies or asthma alone would not cause those symptoms.\" Those with allergic asthma can try antihistamines and other allergy treatments, Dougherty said. If those treatments reduce their symptoms, that's a sign that it's just allergies.As for asthma, he said, anyone experiencing an asthma attack will likely have a history of asthma, and would be able to compare their symptoms to their typical asthma event.\"I would not expect a person to have a first asthma event by getting coronavirus,\" he said. \"And even if you did have both coronavirus and an asthmatic event at the same time, your asthma symptoms should improve by using your rescue inhaler.\"Prevention tacticsIf keeping lungs as healthy as possible is the goal, how does one do that? Know your triggers. \"Asthma doesn't just show up out of the blue. Asthma has triggers and each person's triggers are different -- cigarette smoke might be your trigger or perhaps it's exercise,\" Dougherty said. \"I would hope every asthmatic would get a good understanding of the things that are more likely to bring on their asthma and try to avoid those,\" said pulmonologist Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association.That means analyzing your environment and using common sense, said pulmonary intensive care specialist Dr. Mitchell Glass, a spokesperson for the American Lung Association. \"This is the time to find a loved one who will clean the kitty litter,\" Glass said. \"As much as you love your cat, this may not be the time to have your cat in your lap. Minimize your exposure to dust, to noxious smells, to anything that might trigger an asthma attack.\" Keep a record. Asthmatics should use peak flow meters, devices that measure the strength of a breath, to monitor how well their airways are staying open, Rizzo said. Then they should keep a daily record of that and other telltale signs.\"They should assess how often they're reaching for their rescue medications. They should assess how often they're waking up at night with a cough or a wheeze. These are the signs of some instability that might be occurring,\" Rizzo said.\"It gives asthmatics a way to self-manage a little bit of a change in their breathing and gives information they can relay to their physician if the condition doesn't reverse when they take their rescue inhaler,\" he added.You should also record your temperature on a daily basis, Wright said.\"Then when you're talking to your doctors, you would have that sort of objective evidence,\" she said.Locate and check your medications. \"I've definitely had some patients where I've asked them to go get their inhaler, and they can't find it in their house,\" Dougherty said.\"We have data that is suggesting you should have a rescue inhaler no matter what else you are taking at hand,\" Glass said. \"So that would be your albuterol or levalbuterol, the inhaler that is strictly for rescue if you have an acute attack.\" Then check the expiration dates and make sure they are still active, Glass said: \"You really want to make sure that what you're using is active and hasn't been sitting on the shelf for two years because you 'quote' haven't had an attack.\"Asthmatics who are on biologic medicines, which significantly lower immune response and make the user more susceptible to infection, should discuss their regimen closely with their doctor.Know how to use inhalers correctly. Pediatrician Dougherty loves using a video telemedicine visit instead of a phone call because he can ask his patients to find their inhalers and correctly identify them.\"I make sure when they hold up their inhaler, they can identify it for me,\" he said. \"Is this an inhaler that they take as a preventative medicine to keep them from wheezing?\"Or is it their rescue medicine, the inhaler they use when they're actually wheezing or in the midst of an asthmatic event?\"Misunderstanding that completely alters how an asthmatic does when they're trying to treat themselves,\" Dougherty said.It's also critical that asthmatics know how to properly use their inhalers and spacers (a device that helps deliver the medication more precisely).\"I have them get their inhalers and their spacer and demonstrate how they're using it so I can make sure they're using it correctly,\" Dougherty said, adding that exactly how that is done may depend on the type of inhaler that is being used.Use your asthma action plan. Because every asthmatic is different in both triggers and how their lungs respond, each person needs to work with his or her doctor to develop an individual action plan.\"That asthma action plan will help them decide, 'Do I need to call my doctor and get any additional medication?' And I emphasize calling a doctor because you don't want to rush into the office or the emergency room unless you are in severe distress,\" Rizzo said.Dougherty makes it a point to go over each patient's action plan during his telemedicine visit. Once he has done that, he asks them to go and repeat it.\"I tell them, 'I want you to take this plan and then I want you to sit down and explain it to someone who wasn't here at the visit,'\" he said. \"And if they can't, I tell them not to be embarrassed. That simply means I didn't explain it well enough. Call me back.\" When it comes to pediatric asthma patients, it's critically important that every adult in charge of caring for that child is also intimately familiar with the action plan, Dougherty said.\"Everybody who could care for that child in an emergency needs to know what to do and how to do it when the child's breathing comfortably in front of you,\" he said. \"Don't wait to read this plan and figure it out when the child is struggling to breathe.\"Feel good about being prepared. While this may sound like a lot of items to tick off a list, the experts CNN spoke to said that asthma patients shouldn't let the fear of the virus overwhelm them. After all, they are now prepared.\"No one should be scared,\" Rizzo said. \"I think it's important for asthmatics to understand they're not at higher risk of getting the infection as long as they follow the social distancing and hand washing. They should stay on their medications and be in communication with their doctors. But I don't think they should be scared.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler will begin to gradually restart their US factories Monday, with some big changes put in place to help protect workers from the coronavirus.\n\nAt Ford 59,000 factory workers, about 80% of the workforce, are expected to show up for work, according to the company. At GM, about 15,000 of the company's 48,000 factory workers are expected to report to work on Monday, with more expected to report in coming weeks as the ramp up in production continues, a spokesperson for the company said. Meanwhile, about a third of Fiat Chrysler's hourly workforce, or about 16,000, are expected to start Monday, according to the company.The workplaces they will be returning to will look somewhat different from the ones they left in mid-March.\"We work really hard at imagining a world with Covid-19 in an assembly plant,\" said Ford CEO Jim Hackett in an interview with CNN Friday. \"So they have lots of consideration, of course, for social distancing. We used to have two people, for example, that would be inside the vehicle as it's going down the assembly line. We stopped that.\"All three companies have said they would thoroughly and frequently clean facilities and allot extra time between work shifts to do so. At Ford, for instance, factories that had been running on three shifts, or essentially around the clock, will work on two shifts to allow extra time for cleaning. At Fiat Chrysler factories, 10 minutes per shift will be allotted for cleaning. Read MoreThe automakers said they will also screen employees with questionnaires before they leave for work and administer temperature checks as they enter plants or other facilities. Employees who have recently been exposed to someone with the coronavirus or exhibit a high temperature or other Covid-19-related symptoms will be sent to local clinics for testing before they are allowed to return to work. While in factories, employees will work at least six feet apart from one another whenever possible, the companies said. Employee workstations will be separated by clear plastic panels. Workers will also wear surgical-style face masks and clear plastic face shields or goggles whenever they're required to work close to one another. Ford will also be testing watches that warn wearers if they get too close to someone who is also wearing one of the devices, Hackett said. All three companies will also make changes to how \"common areas,\" such as dining areas, are used in order to keep employees apart from one another. Fiat Chrysler shared an image of a break area table that normally seats six that now has plastic dividers that reduce its seating to three.These practices are based, in part, on the experiences at the companies' factories that have reopened in Asia and Europe.\"Absolutely, I would feel comfortable sending my family to work at Ford,\" Ford's chief operating officer, Jim Farley, said recently when asked how confident he felt in the steps the company was taking.Both Ford (F) and GM (GM) have also been operating a few plants in the US in order to make personal protective equipment and ventilators for healthcare workers. Ford has also been manufacturing face masks for its own workers around the world. Both companies also have some warehouses operating to distribute parts for repairs. Workers at those US plants have been trying out the safety protocols and equipment that will go into wider use in the US as factories reopen.Employees at Ford's currently operating US plants will be sharing their experiences with other employees. Among other things, they will describe what it's like working with masks and face shields on and the best ways to wear and use them, said Kiersten Robinson, Ford's chief human resources officer.Auto plants may look different in the future, too, said Jim Glynn, GM's vice president for global safety. Future factories may take physical distancing into account in their initial design, he said in an interview with CNN.\"Because we could face another pandemic at some point in time. And so we want us to definitely be much better prepared, he said. \"So I think this will definitely play a part in how we lay out facilities.\"CNN's Vanessa Yurkevich contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(Kaiser Health News)Families are beset by fear and anxiety as Covid-19 makes inroads at nursing homes across the country, threatening the lives of vulnerable older adults.\n\nAlarmingly more than 10,000 residents and staff at long-term care facilities have died from Covid infections, according to an April 23 analysis of state data by the Kaiser Family Foundation.But often facilities won't disclose how many residents and employees are infected with the coronavirus that causes the disease, citing privacy considerations. Unable to visit, families can't see for themselves how loved ones are doing.Are people getting enough to eat? How are their spirits? Are they stable physically or declining? Are staff shortages developing as health aides become sick?Perhaps most pressing, does a loved one have Covid symptoms? Is testing available? If infected, is he or she getting adequate care?Read More\"This is the problem we're all facing right now: If you have family in these facilities, how do you know they're in danger or not?\" Jorge Zamanillo told the Miami Herald after his 90-year-old mother, Rosa, died of Covid-19 only days after staffers said she was \"fine.\"In recent weeks, amid mounting concern, states including California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New York began releasing data about cases and deaths in individual nursing homes. (The data varies by state.) And the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services said it would require homes to report cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and to notify residents and families. (Previously, facilities were required to report only to states.)Families' worst fears have been expressed in recent headlines, including a New York Times story that described \"body bags piled up\" behind a New Jersey nursing home where 70 residents had perished. Another investigation called nursing homes \"death pits\" and reported that at least 7,000 residents across the nation had died of Covid-19 -- about 20% of all deaths reported at the time, April 17. What can families do? I asked nearly a dozen long-term care advocates and experts for advice. They cautioned that the problems -- lapses in infection control and inadequate staffing foremost among them -- require a strong response from regulators and lawmakers.\"The awful truth is families have no control over what's happening and not nearly enough is being done to keep people safe,\" said Michael Dark, a staff attorney at California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform.Still, experts had several suggestions that may help:Stay in touchWith virtually all visitors barred from nursing homes since mid-March, frequent contact with loved ones via telephone calls or video visits has become even more important. In addition to providing much-needed emotional support, it signals to staffers that family members are vigilant.\"When a facility knows someone is watching, those residents get better care,\" said Daniel Ross, senior staff attorney at Mobilization for Justice, a legal aid agency in New York City. \"Obviously, the ban of visitors is a real problem, but it doesn't make family oversight impossible.\"If a resident has difficulty initiating contact (this can be true for people who have poor fine-motor coordination, impaired eyesight or hearing, or dementia), he or she will need help from an aide. That can be problematic, though, with staff shortages and other tasks being given higher priority.Scheduling a time for a call, a video chat or a \"window visit\" may make it easier, suggested Mairead Painter, Connecticut's long-term care ombudsman.Advocacy group AARP is pressing for Congress to require nursing homes to offer video visitation and to provide federal funding for the needed technologies. If you can afford to do so, buy a tablet for your loved one or organize a group of families to buy several.Band togetherMore than likely, other families have similar concerns and need for information. Reach out through email chains or telephone trees, suggested Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York City.Ask your nursing home administrator to update families weekly through a conference call or Zoom video chat. Explain that families will probably call less often with repetitive questions if communication is coordinated.Many nursing homes have family councils that advocate for residents, and they're potentially valuable conduits for support and information. Your long-term care ombudsman or administrator can tell you if a council exists at your facility.Working with a group can reduce the fear that complaining will provoke retaliation -- a common concern among families.\"It's one thing to hear 'Mrs. Jones' daughter is making a big deal of this' and another to hear that families of 'everyone on the second floor have noted there's no staff there,'\" Ross said.Contact ombudsmenEvery state has a long-term care ombudsman responsible for advocating for nursing home residents, addressing complaints and trying to solve problems. While these experts currently are not allowed to visit facilities, they're working at a distance in this time of crisis. To find your ombudsman, go to The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care's site.Twice a week, Painter holds an hourlong question-and-answer session on the Connecticut Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program's Facebook page. Among dozens of questions that people asked last week: What kind of communication can I expect when a family member is Covid-positive and in isolation? What's the protocol for testing, and are homes out of test kits? Could families get a robocall if a resident died?One person wondered whether installing cameras in residents' rooms were an option. This practice is legal in eight states, but facilities may consider this elsewhere on a case-by-case basis. A fact sheet from The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care lays out the pros and cons.\"Most of what we do is trying to work out better communication,\" Painter said. \"When there are staffing issues, as there are now, that's the first thing that falls off.\"Lodge a complaintUsually, Painter advises families to take concerns to a nurse or administrator rather than stew in silence. \"Tell the story of what's going on with the resident,\" she said. \"Identify exactly what the person's needs are and why they need to be addressed.\"If you think a family member is being ignored, talk to the director of nurses and ask for a care plan meeting. \"Whenever there's a change in someone's condition, there's a requirement that a care plan meeting be convened, and that remains in effect,\" said Eric Carlson, a directing attorney with Justice in Aging, a legal advocacy organization.If that doesn't work, go \"up the facility's chain of command\" and contact the corporate office or board of directors, said Robyn Grant, director of public policy and advocacy at The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care.If you're getting nowhere, file a complaint with the agency that oversees nursing homes in your state. (You can refer to this directory from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal agency that oversees nursing homes.) This is a formality at the moment, since the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has temporarily released agencies from the obligation to investigate most complaints. Still, \"there may come a day when you'll want a written record of this kind,\" Dark advised.Complaints that are getting attention from regulators involve \"immediate jeopardy\": the prospect of serious harm, injury, impairment or death to a resident. \"If you believe your concern rises to that level, make sure to indicate that,\" The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care advised.Also, contact local, state and national public officials and insist they provide Covid-19 tests and personal protective equipment to nursing homes. \"Calls, letters -- the lives of your loved ones depend on it,\" said Dr. Michael Wasserman, president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine.Bring a relative homeSome nursing homes are asking families to take loved ones out of their facilities and bring them home. Every day, all day, Dark said, he gets calls from California families in this situation who are distraught and terrified.Families need to think through these decisions carefully, said Dr. Joanne Lynn, policy analyst of the program to improve eldercare at Altarum Institute, a research organization. What if their loved one becomes ill? Will they be able to provide care? If their relative has dementia or serious disabilities, can they handle the demands such conditions entail?Researchers in Ottawa, Canada, have developed a useful decision aid for families, available from The Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. (Americans can ignore the Canada-specific information.)At the very least, \"get plans in place in case your relative has a bad [Covid-19] case. People can go from stable to serious illness within hours in many cases,\" Lynn said.This involves updating advance directives, including whether your loved one would want cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, transfer to the hospital in the event of a life-threatening health crisis or hospice care, should that be indicated.\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

        "body": "(CNN)For the majority of her 69 years, Celia Yap-Banago dedicated her life to her patients, carrying out her nursing duties.\n\nBut just weeks before she was set to celebrate her 40th anniversary at the hospital, the tables turned as she became the one needing care after contracting the coronavirus. Yap-Banago died on April 21 at age 69, her son told CNN. Tuesday would have marked her 40th anniversary at the hospital. Now, her colleagues, and the nurses' union she was a member of, hope her death will raise awareness about the lack of personal protective equipment. They want to push hospitals and government leaders to acquire more for the nurses and other health care workers on the front lines of this crisis. Read MoreTaking precautionsWhen the coronavirus pandemic hit the Research Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri, Yap-Banago told her family not to worry because she was working in the cardiac telemetry unit, which is on a different floor than where coronavirus patients were being treated. But on March 23, one of her patients started showing symptoms of Covid-19, according to her son, Jhulan Banago.\"It was a Monday when I got a text from my mom saying, 'Hey, I just had a patient that was showing Covid-19 symptoms,' a 'just be careful' kind of thing,\" Banago, 28, told CNN. As many other health care workers across the US have expressed, Yap-Banago raised concerns about the lack of PPE at her hospital, according to her son. Collectively, the nurses at RMC raised concerns of \"insufficient supplies of the optimal personal protective equipment for RNs and other health care workers, delays in notifying nurses of being exposed to a suspected infected patients and staff and expected to continue reporting to work when exposed,\" National United Nurses, Yap-Banago's union, said in a statement. Christine Hamele, HCA Midwest Health System spokeswoman, called the allegations of exposure \"vague.\"\"We screen all individuals entering the hospital, including our colleagues and we follow CDC and state health department guidelines on the notification of any individuals who may have been in contact with a suspected COVID patient,\" she said in an email statement to CNN. \"As important, if a colleague is quarantined per the CDC guidelines and works in a patient care facility, we will pay 100 percent of base pay for up to two weeks, regardless of where the exposure occurred.\"Charlene Carter, a registered nurse at RMC who worked with Yap-Banago for seven years, first treated the patient before handing her off to Yap-Banago. After seeing that the patient was exhibiting potential coronavirus symptoms, Carter said she raised her concerns to her charge nurse, who then relayed those concerns to higher-ups. \"They assured my charge nurse that they were not treating this patient as if she has Covid-19,\" Carter told CNN. \"It was already an understanding that if you didn't have a positive Covid patient, they didn't want you to use PPE unnecessarily.\" Carter said that the PPE was placed in a centralized location for the floors that worked with confirmed and probable coronavirus patients. When asked about Carter's assertion, Hamele declined to comment further.Two days after treating the patient, Yap-Banago learned that the patient had tested positive for the virus, according to her son. So, she took extra precautions to avoid potentially spreading the virus by isolating herself away from her husband and sleeping on the living room couch. \"It wasn't until maybe that Sunday (March 29) where it started to take a turn for the worst,\" Banago said. \"Her fever got up to over 101 and she wasn't eating so that's when we swapped her back into her room and dad came out to the living room. Once she went in that Sunday, she did not leave.\"While there's no way to tell exactly if she contracted the virus from the patient, Yap-Banago's test for the virus came back positive, her son said. Carter told CNN that she herself had also tested positive for the virus. Unlike many other coronavirus patients who need to be hooked up to a ventilator, Yap-Banago never experienced shortness of breath so she didn't admit herself into a hospital, Banago said. She started to seem like she was getting better, Banago said, but after being bedridden for two and a half weeks, the virus took its toll.\"I saw her from the door and she was kind of just in a weird position,\" he recalled. \"That's when I went up to her and she was unresponsive.\"Honoring her legacyBanago remembered his mother as a strong woman who successfully fulfilled her American dream after immigrating from the Philippines. Even though she loved her work, she never missed either of her sons' baseball and basketball games. Yap-Banago was also a mother figure to many of the young nurses at the hospital. \"She never had a daughter so her coworkers became the daughters she never had,\" Jhulan Banago said. \"She was always keeping up with their lives... I have pictures of her braiding one of her coworker's hair and them just messing around. They loved her just as much as we (her family) do.\" On Thursday night, her coworkers, family and friends held a vigil outside the hospital holding candles and pictures of Yap-Banago. \"She loved being a union nurse -- that was really important to her,\" one of her coworkers said during the vigil, a video of which was shared on Twitter by National Nurses United. \"Part of that was her expressing her concern about the safety here at the hospital.\" \"Celia didn't have to die if she had the proper PPE so from now on we nurses should be fighting for proper PPE so none of us will also die,\" another coworker said during the vigil, before reading off the names of other nurses across the US who have died due to Covid-19. Earlier this month, nurses from Research Medical Center joined a nationwide protest at 16 hospitals owned by HCA Healthcare, blaming one of the nation's largest hospital chains of being ill-prepared for the coronavirus pandemic, according to National Nurses United. Carter said while availability of PPE at Research Medical Center has improved since then, it's still not enough. In a statement issued to CNN, Hamele expressed her condolences to Yap-Banago's family. \"It is difficult to put into words what Celia means to our hospital and to the countless number of patients she cared for,\" Hamele said. \"Her impact on the nursing profession and to those she worked with will be everlasting due to the mentorship, training, support and guidance she provided our colleagues.\" HCA Midwest, however, disputed the claims made by National Nurses United. \"Research Medical Center's preparedness and planning started months ago, and since the outset of the pandemic, we have followed guidelines on PPE from infections disease experts, including those at the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). We continue to do everything in our power to help ensure the protection of our colleagues, not only today, but into the future as the pandemic continues to evolve,\" Hamele said. HCA implemented a universal masking policy across all of its hospitals in late March, according to a post on its website. But that was after Yap-Banago treated the patient. On Tuesday, the nurses at Research Medical Center were supposed to gather to celebrate the 40 years that Yap-Banago had dedicated to the hospital. But now, nurse Michelle Fleschner wrote on Facebook that her colleagues will gather to remember the life of their heroic coworker, who is gone too soon.",

        "body": "London (CNN)Boris Johnson has warned against relaxing the United Kingdom's coronavirus restrictions too soon, in his first remarks since returning to work after contracting the disease.\n\nThe British Prime Minister, speaking outside 10 Downing Street in London on Monday, said there were real signs that the country was close to winning the first phase of the battle against the coronavirus, which has killed more than 20,000 people in the UK. But he warned that the UK was at \"the moment of maximum risk\" and suggested restrictions would need to remain in place for the time being in to avoid a second peak of infection. The UK's lockdown measures are due to be reviewed again by May 7.Johnson compared the virus to a \"physical assailant, an unexpected and invisible mugger\", which the UK was beginning to \"wrestle... to the floor.\"The British government has faced criticism for its handling to the disease, particularly whether it took it seriously enough in the early stages of transmission in the UK; the availability of protective clothing for health workers; and the country's low rate of testing. Yet Johnson struck a characteristically upbeat tone during his remarks, saying that the UK's lockdown measures had succeeded in preventing the National Health Service from being overwhelmed. Read MoreBut he said it was too soon to ease the restrictions. \"I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak,\" he said.Decisions on when and how to lift the lockdown would be taken with \"the maximum possible transparency,\" he promised, addressing criticism that the UK government has so far refused to share its thinking on how restrictions might eventually be lifted.Johnson also thanked First Secretary of State and Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab for deputizing for him during his illness. He said: \"I am sorry I have been away from my desk for much longer than I would have liked.\"Johnson spent several nights in intensive care earlier this month after his condition with coronavirus symptoms worsened.He will have little time to rest. His government has set an ambitious target to test 100,000 people a day by April 30. The Department of Health and Social Care said 29,058 tests were carried out on Saturday, although the government says the capacity is much higher.The British Prime Minister will also need to decide when to ease social distancing restrictions, how to exit the lockdown and how to prepare for future spikes of the virus. \"I know it is tough and I want to get this economy moving as fast as I can but I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life and the overwhelming of the NHS,\" he said.",

        "body": "Business owners who care for Washington's powerful now look to them for survival\n\nBy Kate Bennett, CNN\n\nUpdated 1:58 PM ET, Wed April 29, 2020\n\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)The nation's capital is a town where relationships are currency -- and where behind all the partisan bluster, most businesses run in a party-free zone, serving and tending to both Republicans and Democrats. They actually operate not knowing, nor particularly caring, who is whom, as long as the customers are kind and repeat business, bills get paid and people, to the left or the right, treat each other well.\n\nAnd then the coronavirus pandemic hit Washington, DC.These business owners have cared for, fed, clothed, hosted and slung cocktails for Washington's most powerful movers and shakers. They've served them drinks after tough votes didn't go their way, dressed them when constituents wouldn't take notice, handled the menu for deal-brokering dinner parties, groomed and soothed and primped in a hurry, when time was of the essence -- taken care of them. Now, the tables are turned. What do you do when the people who have been your customers are now the people whose actions and decisions could very well determine your future? Nationally, everyone is bracing for the economic fallout, and with the backdrop of a the worst national economic contraction since the Great Recession, all business becomes local.Here are the stories of five local Washington business owners.Read MoreAmy Brandwein, chef and owner -- Centrolina and Piccolina \"What's it been like? Well, today was not a good day,\" said Amy Brandwein, chef and owner of the award-winning, 60-seat Centrolina restaurant in the upscale retail and residential City Center area, and its sister market, Piccolina, located across the way. \"Today, I felt really weighed down by the emotions of everything.\"Brandwein had just heard her restaurants did not make it into the first round of the Paycheck Protection Program loans. \"Just one month ago, I had this incredibly successful business, I had done everything right. I was careful with money, I was careful with expansion, I took care of my team, I was in a really, really good place,\" she said.And then, it was gone.Brandwein could still employ some of her 80 employees, keeping on an essential 20 as she pivoted business to take out and delivery. Everything was going well enough, but a few days ago, one of her team members came down with symptoms of Covid-19. Out of an abundance of caution, Brandwein shut everything down, alerting her customers and promising to return as soon as she possibly could, after deep cleanings to ensure the health and safety of her workers and her patrons. She's hopeful to start up again at some point in early May.\"To not know how to get out of this, to not have any assurance on how I'm going to get out of it, or when ... I'm used to having all the answers and for once I don't have them,\" Brandwein said.Her revenue is down 70% overall at the two businesses, both of which opened in 2015, she said, but she is still providing groceries every week for all of her employees, even the ones she has had to let go. Brandwein said she's also gotten some rent relief from her landlord, which helps, though every day she looks as her cash reserves and hopes it will be enough, for how long, is the question.\"Sometimes I make pasta in the morning,\" she said, an exercise that earned her fame and recognition as a chef, but now provides more than that, something for her soul. \"Dinner seems to start for people now at 4:30, that's when the to-go and delivery orders started coming in. It's like everyone's so bored they can't wait to start dinner. For me, it's a much shorter day since coronavirus, by the clock -- but a much longer day by every other measure.\"Brandwein said hearing from regular customers, or even seeing them for a few seconds if they came in to grab food for takeout, has been restorative, just knowing they haven't forgotten about her.\"That, to us, is gold,\" she said.After 20 years in Washington working as a chef at some of the city's most notable eateries, Brandwein is tougher than most, but she has days, like this one, where she feels broken.\"I have been part of restaurants that have closed, like, couldn't stay in business, so I'm conditioned to know what that feels like, and that isn't new to me,\" said Brandwein. \"The emotional part now is going through that similar death, but here, I did nothing wrong.\"Nina McLemore, owner and operator -- Nina McLemore boutiques Nina McLemore knew it was coming. \"I went to Paris on February 14 for the semi-annual fabric show, and 30% of the people who are normally there weren't,\" said McLemore, who attends the show as a buyer and overseer of her 13 eponymous clothing boutiques, the second-largest, behind New York City, of which is in Chevy Chase, Maryland, literally across the street from the Washington, DC, border. \"The airports were empty, the planes weren't full. It was clear to me, this was really serious.\" McLemore lives in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington, but the mills she uses to make the fabrics that produce her clothes are based mostly in Northern Italy; by March 1st, she was well aware life was already in a global shift. Her stateside stores eventually all closed for the foreseeable future. McLemore now spends her days devouring information, watching numbers of Covid-19 cases all over the country, waiting for news of which region might open first. She also passes hours talking to her regular customers -- because many of them work on Capitol Hill, or in the White House. \"We have a lot of clients, most of them in in Washington, in divisions of the government,\" said McLemore, ticking off names such as Trump Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-West Virginia, former secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan, and perhaps her most photographed customer this past year, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, who recently ended her 2020 presidential bid.\"I was surprised by how many people look up what she's wearing and come in to shop. I think she must have every color cardigan and blazer we make,\" said McLemore, whose ubiquitous, colorful suit jackets typically sell for between $650-900.McLemore is consumed with staying afloat. She has 36 full-time people on staff, but employs at least 100 more in New York's garment district, where her line is manufactured. She has been able to pivot her manufacturers to turn her wares into masks, 7,000 of which she just delivered to Children's National Hospital. \"We're waiting on an order from FEMA for 200,000 more,\" said McLemore.Overall, though, she said her regular sales for March were down 53%, and her total business down 80%. But her internet sales are only down 20%, a hopeful sign that her customers still need to look polished and professional, at least from the waist up. \"With Zoom and Skype, when you think about it, you're much more conscious of how that person looks because that's all you see, just them,\" McLemore said. \"I know a lot of our customers personally. I've been reaching out to encourage them to buy now, so that we have enough money to make payroll.\" McLemore said one client bought a $20,000 gift certificate, from which McLemore used $7,000 to help 20 deserving women who had undergone an education program with an outfit for work, citing an overwhelming need to give back.Like her fellow small business owners, she's also figuring out regulations for a Paycheck Protection Program loan. \"It became clear to me that my bank was going to have trouble, so we moved banks,\" said McLemore, whose introduction to her new bank was handled by none other than former chair of the Federal Reserve Janet Yellen, a longtime client, and an example of the \"small town\" feel that can sometimes happen with the exchange of goods and services in a city such as Washington. \"That definitely helps. But, new bank means new relationships, and the paperwork alone took 10 days,\" she said.McLemore at the time of our interview had not yet heard if she got into the first round of the surplus.\"I'm flying blind,\" she said. She's not sure how coming back in full will work, but she acknowledges it will be a \"slow ramp up, because people have to trust. The issue is going to be confidence. And that's testing, which we aren't doing enough.\"Derek Brown, mixologist and owner -- Columbia Room\"I thought about this place as a 20 or 30 year operation when I imagined it, and when I opened it,\" said Derek Brown of Columbia Room, a swank bar in DC's Shaw neighborhood that is consistently ranked as one of the city's best, if not the nation's best, watering holes. \"So far we've had 10 great years. But, now, I don't know,\" he said, his voice trailing off, lost in the time and space vacuum that so many business owners find themselves in these days. His bar has gone from serving alcoholic \"tasting menus\" and $16 cocktails, to being a to-go joint, with what remains of his staff -- he's already laid off 15 employees -- selling drinks and \"cocktail kits\" to the few dozen customers that come by during the window that normally would have been happy hour. \"Sales are down overall 80%,\" said Brown, who applied for \"everything under the sun,\" in terms of financial assistance. \"We applied for an SBA loan, we applied for the business grants DC is offering, we applied for a Verizon fund I saw, and we applied for the PPP, and I have no idea what's happening with that. Our bank has not responded. SBA? Haven't heard anything there either,\" said Brown, referring to the federal Paycheck Protection Program which was intended to help small businesses during the pandemic. He has yet to see a penny of government or federal support. \"(The banks) got overwhelmed, and I understand that. But we're finding a way to stay alive, so they have to find a way to help,\" he said.Columbia Room has served high-profile members of both the Trump and Obama administrations since they've been open, and Brown himself has tended bar at the White House, several times during the Obama years. \"Democrats, Republicans, we all hang out together in a weird way in this town, we're on the same plane, we're connected just by living here. Outside looking in, it seems like Washingtonians are embroiled in a constant battle, but it's not like that. It's not the swamp,\" he said. Brown's now found a way to give back to his city, launching the \"Get a Hero, Be a Hero\" sandwich campaign, donating a sandwich to a DC hospital worker for every one sold.Though he's planning to reopen Columbia Room, Brown sounds less enthused about what that might look like. \"We'll have measures that take away the hospitality aspect of what we do. Six feet apart? Who wants that? Bartenders in masks and gloves? It's hard to imagine an easy turnaround,\" said Brown, whose days now include homeschooling his five-year-old son. \"We just don't know how it's going to go. It's like leaping off a cliff and building wings as we fall down.\" Brown said he's going to fight for his business, fight for his workers to come back, fight for more nights of music, celebrations, clinking glasses, laughter and conviviality, but there's something in his voice, something that says uncertainty might be winning. \"Is a place like Columbia Room even a thing anyone wants anymore? I hope so, but I don't know,\" said Brown, saying out loud one of his biggest fears. \"I know what I want. I want out of this spending more time with the people I really care about. Long conversations with those I love.\" And placing hope in the Washingtonians he's come to know as regulars? \"I think the long and short of it is I don't need to have faith in the government, because I have faith in people. I know that the American people and the people in Washington will make the right decisions going forward, and I believe in that. I have to,\" he said.Eric Michael, caterer and co-founder/creative director -- Occasions Caterers \"I like to say that food is not political,\" said Eric Michael, who with his twin brother, Mark, founded Occasions Caterers in the 1980s. The two have gone on to grow the business to 800 employees and a massive commissary in the Brookland neighborhood of Washington, preparing meals for thousands of Washington's most bold-faced names. \"We feed lots of government folks, our local community -- the power players are my customers, on both sides of the aisle, prominent Democrats and Republicans,\" he said.Right now, however, Occasions is mostly feeding the families of those people and new customers discovering the business via the company's hastily established home delivery service. They are also feeding a population Michael's food has rarely reached: the homeless. \"We now have a contract with the DC Department of Housing to use our facilities to produce a few hundred meals a day for our homeless population. It's been, for us, a really important way to help out, and it has the added benefit of keeping most of our employees working,\" said Michael. He's also launched a mobile market in several locations around the region to bring local produce and farm goods from outlying areas, paired with Occasions' own prepared meals, to customers who order online for pickup. Michael noticed lots of the farmers he worked with pre-coronavirus were suffering, unable to get their goods to shuttered farmers markets. \"A portion of our mobile market dollars goes back into emergency feeding. We're trying to provide, not make a profit,\" he said.It's been a quick and essential pivot for a high-end catering company that saw a massive drop in the hundreds of bookings it had on the calendar -- weddings, bar mitzvahs, graduation celebrations. \"It was surreal,\" said Michael of the week back in March when everyone realized gatherings were well, risky. \"Parties started canceling. One by one, everything on our books, canceled. They just fell away, and fell away in big numbers, until they were all gone.\"Michael said he's found comfort in getting a little philosophical, and looking to history. After all, when things in the nation or the community go south, he has often felt it first, because no one wants to celebrate. Catering is a barometer of society's collective temperature. \"Black Monday, 9/11, even the DC sniper attacks (in 2002), intermittent government shutdowns. Having business go away is an unfortunate reality of our business. We've adapted before to understand what we have control over, and what we don't,\" said Michael. He added that a personal silver lining this time around is his parents, both in their 80s, who have moved in with him from their retirement community. \"The last time I sat to dinner with my parents every night was when I was a kid. So, that's been great and it's helped me search for meaning in all of this,\" he said.As for how he's preparing for a return to normalcy, Michael said the most important thing for his business, no matter who he serves, congressman or common citizen, will be health and safety. \"If people don't feel comfortable going into a gathering then nothing matters. If someone wants to host but the guests don't want to come, there's no party,\" he said.Michael said there will be no more buffets, no more passed food. \"I know we'll do more food stations with chefs in gloves and masks, serving individual plates. We're going to take the communal part out,\" he said.Economically, the bells and whistles of creative catering -- late-night food trucks, sushi bars and expensive specialty items -- are going to be pared back. \"I would predict we're going to focus on healthy and fresh and simple foods that don't feel out of step with the environment we're all in. People aren't looking for molecular and exotic,\" he said. Asked what he has found people are eating now, what quarantine cravings he's seeing, Michael unequivocally said: \"Chicken. Our chicken dinners have sold 2-1 over every other option. Comfort food. Honest food. It just feels like a chicken kind of time, I guess.\"Doan \"Dawn\" Nguyen, aesthetician and owner -- Georgetown Nail Salon Doan \"Dawn\" Nguyen had her eye on the shoe store downstairs for at least two years. It wasn't huge, maybe a few hundred square feet, but it would provide the expansion she'd envisioned for her business, Georgetown Nail Salon, which is located upstairs. When the landlord said she could rent the shoe store, after it finally went out of business, she pounced. \"Just after the architect submitted the paperwork for permits to start the renovation down there, everything stopped,\" Nguyen said of the coronavirus shutdown. Nguyen has run Georgetown Nail Salon since 1997, regularly servicing hundreds of Washington's most notable women (and men) with manicures and pedicures, waxing, eyelash extensions, microblading and facials. On any given day, when you walk up the narrow flight of stairs and into the small salon, you'll see movers and shakers, including some of DC's most prominent society hostesses and influential lobbyists. There are notables from both political parties, be they Hope Hicks, Valerie Jarrett or Fox News' Shannon Bream. It's a who's-who of Washington, but in baseball caps and Lululemon leggings, on their days off getting a fresh coat of gel nail polish, elongating their tv-ready lashes or grooming their eyebrows. Nguyen's most famous client, whose nails she has done for almost a decade now, is former first lady Michelle Obama. Though 'waiting it out' is what life revolves around now, not so much tending to the nails of the rich and famous. Nguyen has a glass-half-full mindset. \"People have to come back,\" she said, \"they can't do their own nails!\" True. And in the meantime, she's had to come to terms with doing something she's never done before, accepting help. \"I've been working all my life to support myself and my family, so I feel uncomfortable when people reach out. It makes me feel strange,\" said Nguyen, a divorced mother who emigrated to America from Vietnam in 1989 when she was 18. \"Yesterday, another client said, 'can we help?' and I finally said, 'If you want to a little, please feel free to do so.' Clients are so nice to do that. It's very touching, it's kind of ... I was speechless.\" Nguyen, whose children are now two teenage girls, said in the days when the shutdown was looming, and inevitable, her customers loaded her and her employees with ballooning tips, extra cash, they said: \"just in case.\" \"I got so emotional. I wish it was a dream, but it's not. It's real,\" she said. \"All of my savings are in this business,\" said Nguyen, adding the expansion had just about drained any additional resources. The downstairs spot will have the same services as upstairs, but the ground floor location not only fulfills her decades-long dream of a Wisconsin Avenue storefront, it will also help with clients who have mobility issues. \"I'm going to have to rebuild pretty much from scratch,\" she said. \"I know Covid doesn't do me any favors, but I am very fortunate, very positive. The future is uncertain, but we'll be back, we'll be safe. We'll just wait until we squash the virus out of America.\"\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect chef and owner Amy Brandwein's revenue is down 70% as a result of coronavirus.",

So it came as a real shock when she shared her health battle with viewers.\"One of the rules of journalism is 'don't become part of the story,'\" she said. \"But instead of covering the pandemic, I was one of the more-than-one million Americans who did become part of it.\"Stahl pointed out that several other \"60 Minutes\" staffers also tested positive for the virus. Covid-19 swept through the New York offices of CBS News in March and disrupted all of the network's news operations.Read More\"One Covid-positive '60 Minutes' coworker had almost no symptoms while others had almost every symptom you can imagine. Each case is different,\" Stahl said.She described her own case this way: \"After two weeks at home in bed, weak, fighting pneumonia, and really scared, I went to the hospital. I found an overworked, nearly overwhelmed staff. Every one of them kind, sympathetic, gentle and caring from the moment I arrived until the moment days later when I was wheeled out through a gauntlet of cheering medical workers. In the face of so much death, they celebrate their triumphs.\"Stahl did not specify how long she was hospitalized. She last had a story on \"60 Minutes\" in the first week of April, but it appeared to be produced before the pandemic upended American life.Stahl used her Sunday night script to honor the hospital workers whom she called a \"valiant army in scrubs and masks.\"\"Thanks to them, like so many other patients, I am well now,\" she said. \"Tonight, we all owe them our gratitude, our admiration -- and in some cases, our lives.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)All newborns delivered to women with Covid-19 infections, confirmed or suspected, should be tested, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in new guidelines released Wednesday.\n\nInfants may be at a higher risk for severe forms of the disease, compared to older children, according to the CDC. But the data is still pretty limited, and what scientists know about these infections is based on a handful of case reports.The CDC said babies are most likely exposed to the virus through respiratory droplets from their mom or from other caregivers or visitors. There are some limited reports that they may be exposed to the virus right before or even during labor, but the science on that is still unclear, the federal agency said.Since there is still limited information about how frequently these cases occur, doctors should presume such newborns have an infection. These newborns should be isolated from other healthy newborns and they should temporarily be kept separate from their mothers to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus. If the mother's test results are negative, the CDC says the temporary separation can end.It's unclear when the optimal time to test is, but the CDC suggests they first be tested 24 hours after they are born and if the test is negative, doctors should test them again the next day. In parts of the country where available testing is limited, the CDC recommends these newborns should be prioritized. Newborns don't need a negative test to be discharged from the hospital.Read MoreIf infants do become infected, some of the Covid-19 symptoms are similar to what doctors have seen with adult patients -- fever, cough, breathing problems and stomach issues like diarrhea and vomiting. Infants may also appear lethargic. The CDC says the extent to which a Covid-19 infection contributed to these symptoms is still unclear, though, since these same symptoms can also be seen commonly in infants for other reasons.Much like with older children, the majority of infants who have tested positive for Covid-19 tend to be asymptomatic, or they have a mild form of the disease and recover without complication, according to the CDC. There have, however, been some cases where the infant had to be put on a ventilator.If there isn't room to separate a mother with an infection from the child, the CDC suggests the mother use a face mask and practice good hand hygiene. The CDC does not recommend masks for any child under the age of 2. Healthcare providers should use protective clothing and masks when handling the infants.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued more than 100 recommendations to the Smithfield Foods pork-processing plant on Thursday, as the facility works to reopen following a coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe facility, located in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, became one of the nation's largest Covid-19 hotspots before it closed earlier this month, with more than 783 employee cases and 206 cases stemming from employee contact, according to state health officials.A CDC team made its recommendations after touring the plant last week.Smithfield's managers told the CDC it has a number of changes planned, including requiring facemasks for all employees, increasing the number of hand sanitizers and adding plexiglass barriers where workers can't be spaced out.Still, 11 of the 15 pages in the CDC report include recommendations for further improvement, such as staggering shifts, more flexibility in break times and physical spacing.Read MoreIt notes, however, that \"recommendations are discretionary and are not required or mandated by CDC.\"Plant employees speak 40 different languages, managers say One part of the report focused on the poor communication between management and employees there, who speak 40 different languages, according to Smithfield's managers.Plant managers told the CDC team \"that communicating messages to their diverse staff presented challenges due to the number of languages spoken,\" according to the CDC's report. The languages spoken at the facility include English, Spanish, Kunama, Swahili, Nepali, Tigrinya, Amharic, French, Oromo and Vietnamese. If an employee was found to have a fever or symptoms consistent with Covid-19, they were given an informational packet in English only and instructed to return home, according to the report. Smithfield Foods announced April 12 that it would close the Sioux Falls location until further notice. The first case among employees was detected on March 24, the CDC report said.\"The plant informed us that all processing activities were completed on April 14, 2020,\" the CDC report said, \"and that the plant would be shut down indefinitely while Smithfield Foods continued extensive sanitation and modification efforts in the plant.\"The CDC team at the site was unable to obtain information on \"the workstations of confirmed positive cases,\" according to the report.It has requested that information from Smithfield, and said recommendations could change once that is received. The report also makes no mention of the source of the outbreak.The company is reviewing the report, said Keira Lombardo, executive vice president for corporate affairs and compliance at Smithfield Foods. \"We will thoroughly and carefully examine the report point by point and respond in full once our assessment is complete,\" Lombardo said in a statement.South Dakota's Department of Health 'working with Smithfield'Kim Malsam-Rysdon, the state's secretary of health, said at a press conference Thursday that CDC members weren't able to get the information on those specific workstations \"because there weren't workers at the plant\" while the CDC was there.The department has \"been working with Smithfield to identify where exactly in the plant those positive cases occurred,\" Malsam-Rysdon said. South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said the state's department of health will work with Smithfield to assist the company in implementing the CDC's recommendations \"so that they can safely reopen the plant as soon as possible.\"Releasing the CDC report was a priority so \"that we have an opportunity to get those folks back to work and to get this critical infrastructure business back online as soon as possible,\" Noem said at the press conference.\"I don't see any reason for there to be long delays, and we're hoping to partner with them to open it as soon as possible,\" Noem said.",

It is important to check with state and local health officials and other partners to determine the most appropriate actions while adjusting to meet the unique needs and circumstances of the local community,\" the workplace decision tree reads.Read MoreFor schools, the decision tree asks: \"Will reopening be consistent with applicable state and local orders? Is the school ready to protect children and employees at higher risk for severe illness? Are you able to screen students and employees upon arrival for symptoms and history of exposure?\" If the answer to any question is no, the CDC advises, do not open.For camps, the advice includes screening. \"If feasible, implement enhanced screening for children and employees who have recently been present in areas of high transmission, including temperature checks and symptom monitoring,\" the decision tree reads.\"Are you ready to protect employees at higher risk for severe illness?\" the mass transit tree asks.The decision trees are very similar, with small adjustments to account for the differences between daycare, for example, and restaurants.They stress flexible leave policies -- something public health experts say is vital to controlling the spread of infectious disease. US employment practices are frequently criticized because they discourage workers from taking sick days.Full guidance for the pandemic is on the CDC's website.

Since then physicians in other countries, including Italy and France, have reported clusters of similar cases.\"Beginning about four or five weeks ago, in Europe they stared to describe a form of what really sounded like toxic shock,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Burns of Children's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Burns has been coordinating a series of regular video chats among doctors around the world comparing notes on pediatric cases of Covid-19.\"There were just a few at first and then more,\" Burns told CNN.Read MoreAt first, the cases were believed to be Kawasaki disease, a rare, inflammatory condition that usually involves the major arteries and the heart. But there were too many cases for it to be Kawasaki, and the doctors agreed it was a different inflammatory syndrome. Many, but not all, of the children tested positive either for current Covid-19 infection, or a past infection.It's only rarely fatal and most children recover, Burns said.\"During March and April, cases of COVID-19 rapidly increased in New York City and New York State. In early May 2020, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene received reports of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome,\" the CDC health advisory reads.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said earlier Thursday that the state Department of Health was investigating 110 cases of the syndrome. \"It tends to present in children who were exposed to the Covid virus and actually now have the antibodies ... or still test positive for the Covid virus,\" Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. The CDC said it was still gathering information about the cases.\"There is limited information currently available about risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment for MIS-C. CDC is requesting healthcare providers report suspected cases to public health authorities to better characterize this newly recognized condition in the pediatric population.\"The advisory provides a case definition to guide doctors:An individual aged under 21 years presenting with fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation, and evidence of clinically severe illness requiring hospitalization, with multisystem (more than 2) organ involvement (heart, kidney, renal, respiratory, blood, gastrointestinal, dermatologic or neurological); ANDNo alternative plausible diagnoses; ANDPositive for current or recent SARS-CoV-2 infection by RT-PCR, serology, or antigen test; or COVID-19 exposure within the 4 weeks prior to the onset of symptoms Fever above 38.0\u00b0C (100.4F) for 24 hours or moreAbnormal blood tests including: an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), fibrinogen, procalcitonin, d-dimer, ferritin, lactic acid dehydrogenase (LDH), or interleukin 6 (IL-6), elevated neutrophils, reduced lymphocytes and low albumin Some individuals may fulfill full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease but should be reported if they meet the case definition for MIS-C Consider MIS-C in any pediatric death with evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection",

An informal panel of pediatricians organized by Boston Children's Hospital have dubbed the mysterious illness \"Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with COVID-19.\"The CDC warning will go out on the Health Alert Network (HAN) to thousands of physicians and other clinicians across the country, the agency spokesman said.Read More\"We will provide a working case definition of what cases look like,\" the spokesman said.Doctors will be asked to report cases to state and local health departments so that the CDC can learn about the syndrome.The CDC is working with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to get the definition of the syndrome -- which could be released Wednesday or Thursday, the spokesman added. Where cases have been reportedThe New York State Department of Health is investigating about 100 possible cases of the illness in children, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. The majority of the cases are in children between the ages of 5 and 9 (29%) and between 10 and 14 (28%) years old, state data shows. The governor announced last week that three youth had died because of the illness. \"We lost three children, (a) 5-year-old boy, 7-year-old boy and 18-year-old girl,\" Cuomo told reporters Tuesday. In Kentucky, Health Commissioner Dr. Steven Stack, announced the state is aware of two patients diagnosed with the syndrome. One case is a 10-year-old, who is critically ill in the intensive care unit and the second patient is a 16-year-old, who is doing well and is in a regular medical bed, Stack said.Stack said the 10-year-old patient is showing signs of improvement and has had some of the medications reduced, meaning that their body is showing signs of recovery.\"The children who get sick with this can have cardiovascular collapse and require supportive measures to maintain their blood pressure, or respiratory collapse requiring breathing support with a mechanical ventilator,\" Stack said.And Boston Children's Hospital spokeswoman Erin Tornatore told CNN Tuesday two children with the syndrome were hospitalized there, but neither was in intensive care.What the treatments includeLast week, the informal panel, called the International PICU-COVID-19 Collaboration, released a consensus statement defining the condition. Dr. Jeffrey Burns, chief of critical care medicine at Boston Children's Hospital, coordinates the panel.\"In some cases, children present with shock and some have features of Kawasaki disease, whereas others may present with signs of cytokine storm. In some geographic areas, there has been an uptick in Kawasaki disease cases in children who don't have shock,\" Boston Children's Hospital rheumatologist Dr. Mary Beth Son said.Kawasaki disease involves inflammation in the walls of medium-sized arteries and can damage the heart. A cytokine storm is an immune system overreaction that can cause widespread inflammation and organ damage.Treatments may include blood thinners and immune system modulators.\"To date, most children affected have done well. Treatments have included anticoagulation, IV immunoglobulin, IL-1 or IL-6 blockade, and corticosteroids. Some children have only needed supportive care,\" Boston Children's Hospital said on its website.\n\nCNN's Laura Ly, Rebekah Riess contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Dr. Troyen Brennan is chief medical officer and executive vice president of CVS Health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nSocial distancing has blunted the spread of Covid-19 and different parts of the country are starting to see a decrease in new cases. We have largely avoided overwhelming our health care system, and everyone is looking for ways to responsibly restart the economy.\n\nBut every health professional and most of the nation, it seems, understands that if we do not take precautions, we will be back to square one.We must get those with viral infection to remain at home even if they are asymptomatic, provide appropriate treatment for those early in infection and use hospital settings primarily for those with more severe symptoms. Broadly expanded, accurate and rapid testing is the only way to do that. This approach will bridge us to the time when we have a viable vaccine ready for mass distribution.Fortunately, the elements necessary to build this program are coming together rather quickly. States and the federal government will have to facilitate and integrate careful public health measures into testing protocols, but private companies have a significant role to play. We recently announced plans to offer self-swab tests in parking lots or at drive-thru windows at up to 1,000 CVS Pharmacy locations, with the goal of processing up to 1.5 million tests per month. We are also developing mobile solutions that will allow our health care professionals to serve businesses and community health centers and provide real-time results. Over time, we will move entirely to rapid testing, which allows for faster treatment and prevention of spread.Read MoreBut we will still need to dramatically increase capacity.Estimates on testing needs vary -- one report from a Harvard panel of experts suggests up to 20 million per day. This will likely cost billions, but in the context of keeping the economy moving, avoiding long-term unemployment and ensuring the health care system is not compromised once again by rising viral infections, it would be a bargain. Lawmakers are starting to focus on how to fund a much-needed surge in testing.Large-scale test sites like the ones CVS Health and other retailers are operating are serving a critical purpose, but we must move to more local solutions. We need a new approach to testing, which must include:Community-based testingCovid-19 disproportionately affects African-Americans and other minorities, which should be an important consideration in any testing solution going forward. Parking lot test sites are working well for now, but as we move into this new phase we need testing to be distributed throughout the community for ease of access and for equitable access. This includes tapping into retail networks that have scale and a high level of familiarity. Highly accurate testingTests that identify Covid-19 genetic material using mucus or saliva in large, central labs are the mainstay of testing, and very accurate. Going forward, we will also need to rely on both viral antigen tests via nose and throat secretions to identify infection and serology tests via blood to identify antibodies. In addition, tests should be able to identify both Covid-19 and influenza infections so we know which virus we are dealing with, especially in the fall. Rapid resultsWhile sending tests to labs and awaiting results will continue to be part of some testing solutions in the short term, rapid results should be standard practice by the fall, subject to availability of supplies. Getting results where you have been tested makes next steps clear.Reliable tracingResults should be shared with public health authorities immediately so they can engage in contact tracing and added to electronic medical records so a patient's physician can be involved in care. Results should also be transmitted to the federal government to develop a central clearinghouse for positive results.TreatmentMany medications are being tested to understand if they can be used to ameliorate symptoms early in the infection, forestalling more serious complications. For patients with more severe symptoms, Gilead's remdesivir has shown promise. Until a vaccine becomes available, having viable treatments on hand will be critical.We are all hopeful for a vaccine that could be universally administered before Covid-19 makes a potential return later this year. But we need to be realistic and prepared. We need to start planning now for rapid testing, fast treatment and contact tracing to ensure we can maintain public health and restart our economy as we move toward the beginning of this pandemic's end.",

        "body": "(CNN)Cats can infect other cats with the novel coronavirus, but they may not show any symptoms, according to a study published Wednesday.\n\nThe findings add to a growing body of research showing how cats, big and small, can contract the virus. But experts say there is no evidence felines are contributing to the spread of Covid-19.In the study, researchers infected three cats and found that all of them were shedding the virus after three days. When the infected cats were paired with healthy ones -- housed together for a few days -- the healthy cats developed the virus, too.None of the animals in the study showed any symptoms such as abnormal temperatures or substantial weight loss.The first two cats in the United States to test positive -- both New Yorkers -- showed mild respiratory symptoms, although both were expected to make a full recovery. Eight lions and tigers at the Bronx Zoo also tested positive.Read MoreThe team behind the new study, led by international virus expert Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Tokyo and scientists from the University of Wisconsin, said more research is needed to better understand whether cats could transmit the virus to humans as well. So far, there is no evidence that they can.\"Given the need to stop the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic through various mechanisms ... a better understanding of the role cats may play in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to humans is needed,\" they wrote in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.The American Veterinary Medical Association noted that the new research was conducted in a lab -- and it's unclear whether cats can be as easily infected in the real world. A small number of animals worldwide are confirmed to have the virus, the group said in a statement. \"There is no evidence to date that these relatively few naturally infected animals have played any role in transmitting COVID-19 to humans,\" it said.While officials are still learning more about coronavirus and pets, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends limiting interactions between pets and people or animals outside of a household.Keep cats indoors whenever possible, the CDC says, and walk dogs on a leash, maintaining a distance of at least six feet from other people and animals. The agency also recommends keeping dogs away from public places where large numbers of people and animals gather, such as dog parks.If someone is ill with Covid-19 -- whether suspected or confirmed -- officials recommend another member of the household care for pets. If that's not possible, people should wear cloth face coverings around animals, making sure to wash their hands before and after any interactions.And when people are sick, officials say they should refrain from petting or snuggling with their pets -- and avoid being kissed or licked by them.",

        "body": "(CNN)For the first time in three months, South Korean high school students are back in the classroom.\n\nBut in many ways, it's not schooling as usual.As high school seniors returned to school Wednesday, they had their temperatures checked, wore masks on campus, and sat at desks that were spaced apart, in line with commonplace social distancing practices.However, within hours of reopening, dozens of schools in Incheon, a city near the capital Seoul, were forced to shut again after two students tested positive for coronavirus.South Korea -- which has reported more than 11,100 coronavirus cases and 264 deaths -- appears to have its outbreak largely under control. Now, the country is trying to get back to something approaching normal life.Read MoreBut South Korea's experience shows that reopening schools doesn't mean a return to normal -- and carries continued risks. Around the region, other countries that have managed to control their outbreaks are facing similar questions when it comes to education.In New Zealand, which has been praised for its swift approach to controlling the outbreak, students around the country headed back to school on Monday after eight weeks at home. In parts of Australia, children are already back at school. In China -- where the first coronavirus cases were reported last year -- students began going back to school in March, according to state news agency Xinhua. Earlier this month, the Education Ministry said that about 40% of students were back in the classroom.It's a tricky subject -- even though coronavirus symptoms in children tend to be mild, some studies have suggested that kids can play a major role in spreading the virus to each other and to vulnerable adults, raising the risk of another wave of infections. A new normal for classroomsThe experience of students in Asia Pacific shows that even when countries reopen schools, that doesn't mean a return to the old ways.In South Korea, students aren't all heading back at once. South Korea's students haven't been in the classroom since before the spring break in February. Students normally go back to school at the start of March, but the start of the spring semester was delayed until early April, when students began the new school year with online classes. Wednesday was the first day back for senior high school students, but students from other grades will be returning over the next few weeks. By June 8, students of all ages are expected to be back at school. On Thursday, the country's Ministry of Education urged disease prevention inside and outside schools. In New Zealand, schools put in place new hygiene rules -- such as hand sanitizing before entering campus -- and kept students spaced out in the classroom, according to Radio New Zealand. Australia is so serious about hygiene that the government is providing an additional 10 million Australian dollars ($6.56 million) to help schools cover the cost of soap, hand sanitizer and classroom cleaning products. The risk in going backGetting children back into school is not without difficulties.In South Korea, dozens of schools opened on Wednesday, only to close again after two students tested positive for coronavirus in Incheon, a city near Seoul. Those cases are believed to be connected with an outbreak in Itaewon, a nightlife district in the capital, which has been linked to more than 200 cases. On Thursday, a high school in the South Korean city of Daegu sent students home and closed the school after a student tested positive, an official at the Daegu Metropolitan Office of Education said. According to the official, the student who tested positive was one of 17 who moved into the dorms a few days ago.Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) deputy director Kwon Jun-wook said Thursday that schooling is something that must take place alongside disease prevention. \"So we currently judge that it must continue in our current response regime, with the co-operation and participation of all our people,\" Kwon said. On May 13, authorities in Jilin, a northeastern Chinese city in a province of the same name that borders Russia and North Korea, issued a notice that all resumed classes would switch to online as the area battles with a rise in new cases. The risk in reopening after a lockdown is something experts and leaders around the region are well aware of.China's top respiratory expert, Zhong Nanshan, told CNN last weekend that the country is still vulnerable to another wave of deadly coronavirus infections. \"We are facing a big challenge -- it's not better than the foreign countries I think at the moment,\" he said.And when New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that the country was easing restrictions -- including allowing children to return to school -- she urged caution.\"We are asking you all to be incredibly careful as we get back to a new safer normal,\" she said on May 11. \"None of us can assume Covid isn't with us.\"\n\nCNN's Yoonjung Seo contributed to this story.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)CNN anchor Chris Cuomo battled the virus for weeks. Then his wife and son got sick. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta has a frank conversation with Chris about his personal experience with Covid-19 and the impact it's had on his family.\n\nYou can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.Chris Cuomo: I tested positive. Scary, yes, as you might imagine. So, let's focus, let's use this example of me having it as proof that you can get it, too, God forbid. We have to do everything we can to avoid being sick. We have to do it for ourselves, our families, and for those on the front lines who are saving the lives of people like me and many of you. Dr. Gupta: If you couldn't tell by now that's CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. Chris and I have been friends for a long time, and last month, he was diagnosed with Covid-19. And ever since then, he has been broadcasting his nightly show from his basement. It took weeks but he was eventually cleared to emerge from self-isolation.Read MoreIt's been a journey for Chris, no doubt. And we've been discussing that journey a lot on his show and on our own. Like a lot of people, I was worried about him, even giving him some advice -- as a doctor and a friend. Cuomo (from Cuomo Prime Time): Dr. Sanjay Gupta, our chief, is back. My brother, a North Star for many of us during this time. You were right when you told me that I would see a different side of this once the virus took root.Dr. Gupta: Chris, I mean look, I know you're a warrior, but you're allowed to take a day off. You know we love you. We think about you, and it's OK to take a day off.Cuomo: You're totally right. You've got to take care of yourself first. You can't take care of anybody else.Dr. Gupta: Since his initial diagnosis, Chris' wife, Cristina, and son Mario have also been diagnosed with Covid-19. Now that he's through the worst of it, I wanted to catch up and ask him about his experience with the virus. And also find out how he and his family are now doing. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\" Dr. Gupta: Let me ask you about you. What are your days like nowadays? You know, tell me everything. When are you waking up? What are you doing? How do you spend your time?Cuomo: Well, it's changing. This has been a transformative event for me. I've never been knocked on my ass like this before. I've had Lyme disease. I was diagnosed with PTSD. They put me on that pediatric dose of Celexa, you know, and I had to work through why I was having these dreams and all that stuff, but nothing like this. You know, a shivering mess for days where I was forced to be isolated and take stock in a way that I never had in my adult life. So I went from doing nothing all day except preparing to do that one hour of television, after which I would be a sweaty mess and fall down on the couch and basically lay there for like six hours and then get into some weird sleep cycle. Now, I am in the recovery phase, which I didn't know existed. And I am trying to be highly structured, so I wake up early. I write and I read. Then I'm trying to start upping my activity curve. I can do very little exercise. If I do too much, I heat up. And I start to get a wave of almost like kind of a mild nausea And now that I'm, um -- now that I don't have to be isolated. I'm waking the kids up in the morning for school, doing breakfast. Cristina is -- needs to sleep. It hits her hard at night. Her symptoms. She gets really bad sinus pressure at night and there are no great answers. And I am still warm. And they say I may be for weeks. But, I have a little bit more energy. I feel about 48% myself.Dr. Gupta: I can see you, obviously, the people who are listening to this podcast cannot, but you look you look a lot better. I mean, we we talk a lot. I see you a lot. You know, obviously just via screen like this. But you do look better. One thing I do want to say is that when we first talked about this, about you having a positive result on that on that test, I got to tell you, I was I was worried. And these aren't things that I told you while you were still dealing with this because I was modulating myself, even. So, the conversation I'm having with you now is a different conversation. Because I'd been reading stories about young people who had really no preexisting illness or anything and them getting really sick, Chris, and even dying. Now, am I going to share that with you on television? You know, as you're dealing with this. No, I'm not. Now, I don't think that that's not being honest. I think it's, it's modulating how I present things a little bit. But I got to tell you, I was I was worried about you. And there were times when you had these declines and your and your nights were terrible and your pulse oximetry, your oxygenation was a little lower than I would have, you know, liked. And I knew that you couldn't necessarily get to the hospital right away. So I was worried. And I I guess the question is, were you? Did you ever think that this was going to really go sideways on you? Cuomo: You know, there's so much of an unknown. Right? And what you keep relying on is perspective, that it's not supposed to be me. It's not supposed to be me. I was having those funky dreams that a lot of people have and I take a lot of comfort in the new Covid community that I got patched into through this. Of people -- it's so comforting, Sanjay, when somebody has had the same s**t that you have.Dr. Gupta: Right. Cuomo: You know what I mean? The commiseration thing is real, you know? Yeah. You got those crazy shakes? You bruise your leg yet, you know, banging your legs into each other? Yeah, I got that bruise. So then I go outside into the cold air. And because when you're sweating, man, there's nothing that feels as comforting as that. Now, the problem is you can only stay there for a couple of minutes because you're gonna start to shake. That was the worst. And then I got through it. Beautiful. So that was my journey. Dr. Gupta: And that is most people. I mean, I think it is worth reminding people in all of this that most people do recover. We're defining recovery still. But they do recover. They get out of the hospital. They obviously survive even if they're elderly, even if they have preexisting conditions. Why -- why didn't you just take some time off? Did you even take a day off? I can't remember. You hosted your show just about every night.Cuomo: I take off every day, Sanjay! I do, like, nothing all day long until, like, this week. I would just be preparing for one hour of television. The rest of the day, I would -- I'm laying down or doing breathing exercises or walking around my back yard. It is maddening how little I do. I've never been this sedentary in my life. Dr. Gupta: You're wearing a hat right now that says \"truth.\" And I have to say, I think it's a really -- I think it's a good hat for you because truth is always important. And I've been struck during this this particular story, and I will still call it a story or an episode, because I think it does have an end date at some point. But for this story, I think truth is particularly important because people don't always know who to trust right now. And when it comes to science and data and evidence, I feel like, as a medical reporter, I've had a luxury because I can always pivot to the data and the science and everything. And yet here with this story, sometimes even that has come under assault. Cuomo: I think that this is an awakening for the society, that government is not just something to disrespect and write off as a function of partisan politics. Partisan politics is too much a part of the equation, of course, but this is a reminder of, \"The institutions have to work.\"Dr. Gupta: I don't want to talk about the politics too much. I do want to just say this one point and that is that I don't think of myself as someone who necessarily shies away from politics, because I think sometimes it is part of the discussion, especially when you're talking about a big issue like this that requires governmental response. My concern sometimes is that it gets in the way. I -- there's real data to share. There's real trajectories to look at, to help educate people. And sometimes it does become a conversation about who did what wrong, when? All that sort of stuff. And I sometimes I just don't find it that helpful. But let me ask you this. Did this make you more interested in public service or politics? I mean, it is in your family's blood, obviously, your father, your brother. This episode now, has it changed how you feel about it? Cuomo: Here's what I would say, it definitely changed me in very significant ways. I was put into a position to think about things that I'd never thought about before. What matters to me. The reason that I thought you made the right move, not accepting Surgeon General. That is such a huge accolade. It is such a big deal because of your ability to connect with people and understand science. You are unique that way. But you didn't. And the reason it was the right move is because once you're in the game, you must play the game. I don't want to be any more subjected to the game than I am right now, and I think the mitigation effect of what you can get done versus what we can expose and push others to do militates in favor of staying out, for me personally. And I see you contextually that way, also. You would not have the reach that you have to discuss medical marijuana, Covid. You have more influence on the national dialog this way than you would if you were surgeon general. It's not for me. It has made me think more acutely about what my purpose is within journalism.Dr. Gupta: You know, it's interesting, Chris, is that you and I do talk on the phone a lot outside of the program and you're always asking questions. And it's worth pointing out to the audience that this issue of testing has come up a lot. But you were one of the first. I still remember this this call. You were one of the first to really, I think, highlight it from a inadequacy standpoint. We were focused on how does a test work, false, positive, false, negative rate, sensitivity, specificity, all those things we look at from a scientific perspective. But I think you widen the aperture quite a bit on this and said, \"Hey, wait, is there a more systemic problem here?\" And I think that does speak to your your wealth of contacts and your and your constant reading and things like that. And then I had a conversation with your brother about your mother, Matilda. And your brother passed Matilda's Law named for her obviously restricting movements and visits for New Yorkers over 70 years old. Same time you're doing that, that meant it would it would be hard for you to see her as well. Cuomo: Yeah, that's why he passed it. It was a power move, Sanjay. Cheap, cheap, sneaky. No, look. He was right to do it. He and frankly, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who's a longtime family friend. And they were both right. I was being hyper sentimental and protective of my mom. I want to keep her with me. I was always going to be exposed to this virus. There was no chance I wasn't going to be. I was sneaking around in too many hospitals. I'm trying to get a sense of where the PPE was going. How was it we kept having this disconnect and I wanted to see for myself what the burden was, so that people wouldn't be able to fake the funk with numbers about the reality for the workers. I was always gonna get exposed. It was just a matter of when. And again, I get sick pretty easy. You know, I'm not an iron man, you know? So they were right to move mom. Andrew was right to see the particular vulnerabilities of the elderly. We do live in fear of my mother getting sick. Why? Because they don't do well. That's why. Dr. Gupta: Well, I was really glad that that he did. And I'm glad that you talked about it, because my parents who live in Florida, they live in a community. And I was on the phone with them every day. How are you doing? You know, just just not even just physically, but psychologically. You know, you. I'm worried about this. You must be very worried about this. And I'm glad that that you that your brother did this and that you talked about it, because I think it was missing part of the story that the legislation was important. But I think the discussing of it was it was really important as well. Cuomo: Yeah. You know, there is a sensitivity. There is a balance. There's a vulnerability. But I made a decision with this that I'm not going to tell people that we've got to be in it together and that you got to have transparency, and then get sick and go hide. I personally was like, listen, you know, you're trying to give people insight into what this is about and what it isn't. Now you're living it, live it. This is this is circumstantial for me. I'm not supposed to be the story. I don't want to be the story. But this was unique because it's not like I just got the flu. It's like we really don't understand this. So I took the risk but I'm OK with the tradeoff because I know for a fact that it exposed me to people who were able to help me understand what I was dealing with and what was to come in a way that I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. So personally, it's been beneficial. And I know that it has been helpful to a lot of people. That they knew, \"Okay, so if I get this, I'm going to look like him. All right. I got it. That demystifies it. And hey, I'm dealing with the same thing he is. I'm going to try those exercises. You know? I'm going to try that. I'm going to see how that is. Oh, he's having those funky dreams, too, right? Oh, so he's doing compresses. You know, I never been thought of. I guess I do that with my kids. Let me try it.\" And that means a lot to me. Dr. Gupta: Part of the reason that we talked about this on television every night is because we're dealing with a new virus here. Nobody has the answers. So to hear firsthand from someone who's dealing with this, every detail matters to two clinicians who are trying to better understand this virus. We're all learning, but also the psychological part of it. Cuomo: That's the important piece! Mental health is a nightmare for us. Stigma. People don't want to talk about it. And I know, personally, that this definitely affected my head. And I'm telling you, this has put me in a funk. I'm not just sad, I'm not just down, but you start to get a withering resolve: I'll never be myself again. I'll never be 100 percent again, I'll never be what I was. Every day I'm going to wake up hot. Every day it's the same. Any change is incremental. I can't do what I want to do. I can't be who I want to be. And it cycles. And that is not feelings. That is not sadness. That is emotional illness, mental illness, and you have to deal with it. You've got to get therapy. I get therapy every two weeks. Now I'm doing it twice a week. Why? Got to talk to somebody who can process this s**t for me.Dr. Gupta: Let me ask you this. So how is Mario doing? Cuomo: Mario has got the same stuff Cristina has. Sinus pressure worse at night. No sense of taste and smell. Interesting parental point. Very different when a kid can't taste and smell versus an adult. Very disorienting to a kid. And they start to exhibit weird behaviors. My son is 14 and he is now trying to eat stuff that he shouldn't because he is so fascinated with his inability to taste. And it's also scary to a kid in the way that it isn't to an adult. But, like his mom, every day they're better. That he's sick, happens. The virus goes through families. Nothing unique. No woe is Cuomo. Everybody's going through this. We're no different. And if anything, we're on the lucky side. Dr. Gupta: As Chris has said countless times, he and his family are lucky, but his first-hand accounts of the virus and the harrowing symptoms, reflects what is happening to so many around the world. That is why it was so valuable to hear his insights and his personal experiences. We are all learning about this together. We do know that the virus is dangerously contagious, so we must do everything we can to protect ourselves, our loved ones, our healthcare workers, everyone in our community.The one thing we can all do to help out for now is to stay home and practice physical distancing.

        "body": "(CNN)An emergency proclamation issued Thursday in Stillwater, Oklahoma, requiring the use of face masks in stores and restaurants was amended Friday after threats of violence.\n\n\"In the short time beginning on May 1, 2020, that face coverings have been required for entry into stores/restaurants, store employees have been threatened with physical violence and showered with verbal abuse,\" Stillwater City Manager Norman McNickle said in a statement.\"In addition, there has been one threat of violence using a firearm. This has occurred in three short hours and in the face of clear medical evidence that face coverings helps contain the spread of Covid-19.\"Due to the threats of violence the city has decided to amend their emergency order but still want people to wear face masks whenever possible, the statement said. The proclamation issued Thursday required, among other things, businesses to require patrons to cover their faces to combat the spread of coronavirus. Read MoreBut on Friday, Mayor Will Joyce softened the rule to encourage, not require, face coverings, after several reports emerged of employees being verbally abused and being threatened with physical violence while trying to enforce the order -- all in just three hours of the rule going into effect.\"Many of those with objections cite the mistaken belief the requirement is unconstitutional, and under their theory, one cannot be forced to wear a mask. No law or court supports this view,\" said City Manager Norman McNickle in a statement. \"It is further distressing that these people, while exercising their believed rights, put others at risk.\"McNickle went on to explain the importance of face coverings in preventing the spread of coronavirus. The masks have been recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Oklahoma State Department of Health.\"It is unfortunate and distressing that those who refuse and threaten violence are so self-absorbed as to not follow what is a simple show of respect and kindness to others,\" he said. Still, the city is changing the rule, as officials \"cannot, in clear conscience, put our local business community in harm's way, nor can the police be everywhere,\" McNickle said.Since April 3, the CDC has recommended that Americans should wear \"cloth coverings\" in public places.The updated guidance was in light of new evidence that many people were spreading the virus asymptomatically -- meaning that even people not exhibiting symptoms were spreading it by coughing, sneezing or even simply talking in close proximity.\"The idea about the face mask is to prevent the virus from coming out of somebody's mouth and nose, mostly out of their mouth,\" said Dr. Joseph Vinetz, a professor in the infectious disease section at Yale School of Medicine, to CNN in April. \"They prevent somebody, when they talk or sometimes when they sneeze or cough, from expelling virus and leading to infection in other people.\"Masks, however, are not a substitute for social distancing, which is still required to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nCNN's Kristen Rogers contributed to this report.",

Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida and Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham of South Carolina were among the five lawmakers on Capitol Hill to announce positive coronavirus tests in March. Diaz-Balart was the first to announce that he had contracted the virus. \"Yesterday, my wife Tia and I visited (OneBlood) where I donated my plasma and she donated blood to help those with critical health conditions. I strongly encourage people who have recovered from COVID-19 to become a plasma donor -- someone's life could depend on it,\" the Florida lawmaker wrote on Twitter. Diaz-Balart first announced he tested positive on March 18. Cunningham, who announced on March 27 that he had mild coronvirus symptoms, also shared a message on Twitter encouraging those who have recovered from the virus to donate their plasma. \"I was incredibly fortunate to only have extremely mild #COVID19 symptoms and now I'm grateful for the chance to help out someone who is critically ill. If you've recovered from coronavirus, I encourage you to do the same!\" Read MoreIn coordination with the US Food and Drug Administration, the Red Cross has announced that they are seeking donors who are fully recovered from coronavirus to give plasma. The idea is that convalescent plasma, the liquid part of blood, from recovered patients contains antibodies that could help strengthen the immune response of other patients still battling infection. In mid-April, the FDA announced that patients who are fully recovered from Covid-19 for at least two weeks are encouraged to consider donating plasma.",

        "body": "(CNN)Hospitals across the United States are seeing fewer stroke and heart patients coming to their facilities for care -- and two new reports suggest that concerns around the coronavirus pandemic are keeping people from seeking the care they need.\n\nEarly research posted on Monday to the online health sciences server medRxiv found a nearly 18% drop in the number of of patients discharged from US hospitals with a primary diagnosis of stroke, and a more than 25% drop in the number of acute coronary syndrome cases in March of this year compared to March 2018 and March of last year. And a letter published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that the number of patients in the United States undergoing imaging for stroke evaluation has decreased by 39% since before the pandemic.\"These are stroke patients who need to be treated,\" said Dr. Greg Albers, director of the Stanford Stroke Center and professor of neurology at Stanford University in California, who was an author of the letter. 'People are more afraid of going to an ER than they are of having a stroke'Read More\"Our concern is that many people are more afraid of going to an ER than they are of having a stroke. This is a critical error because stroke treatments can be highly effective and the chance of being infected in an ER is minute,\" Albers said. \"It is very important that patients with symptoms of stroke call 911. If the stroke is causing disabling symptoms there's a huge advantage to getting it treated.\"Many heart patients in particular fear exposure to the coronavirus since underlying health conditions, including heart conditions and high blood pressure, can increase the risk of severe illness or even death from Covid-19.In early May, the American Heart Association urged people to call 911 if they experience any chest pain or heart symptoms, even amid the coronavirus pandemic.In that statement, the association referenced data from the ESO system that first responders use across the United States showing that there has been a decline of 13.1% in 911 responses for chest pain between January 1 and May 4. It also showed a 7% decrease in 911 responses for stroke symptoms. The overall decrease in 911 calls was 12.4%, averaged from January 1 through May 4, according to the data.As fewer people call 911 for heart attack or stroke symptoms during the pandemic, unfortunately, their delay in seeking care can lead to long-term health consequences, serious disabilities or even death, said Michele Bolles, Vice President for Quality and Health Information Technology at the American Heart Association and leads the national Get With The Guidelines program.\"In the case of a stroke, the longer you wait, the more brain damage and brain tissue is lost, and for a person experiencing a heart attack, the same is true -- time equals heart muscle -- and in those two incidences, time is critical. Every minute counts,\" Bolles said.\"What we may see is more patients with heart failure. Patients being diagnosed with heart failure down the road because they have had untreated mild heart attacks and didn't seek timely treatment during the lockdown,\" she said. \"And ultimately there are some cases where people will die at home because they didn't call 911 and didn't seek proper emergency care.\"Bolles added that calling 911 is safer than driving yourself to the hospital or having someone drive you to the hospital.\"With people driving family members to the hospital, it's possible that you may not make it. You could maybe pass out, you could crash your car. There are a lot of things that could happen when someone tries to drive themselves to seek emergency care,\" she added. \"The bottom line is to know the signs and symptoms of a heart attack and stroke and to call 911 as quickly as possible.\"'Your safety net is to call 911'Bev Pohlit, a 59-year-old mother of two sons in Sinking Spring, Pennsylvania, knows the dangers of waiting too long to seek medical care all too well.Had Pohlit waited any longer to seek care at the hospital for her severe asthma symptoms, she worries she could have had a heart attack or respiratory arrest.It was in early March when Pohlit experienced persistent tightness in her chest, but she avoided going to the hospital because she feared she would catch the coronavirus. As her symptoms continued, she went to a local urgent care instead -- but the medical team there told her that she really needed to go to the emergency room.\"I was so scared,\" said Pohlit, who has had one heart attack.Pohlit drove to the hospital, which she said was only about five miles away. During that drive, tears streamed down her cheeks.\"I was flipping out,\" Pohlit said. \"I called my husband and I said 'I'm on my way to the ER.' I said,'You don't need to come.' I said stay at work and I'm going to be OK, because I didn't want him to go into that environment.\"When Pohlit arrived at the hospital, she told staff that she was a heart patient who is also asthmatic -- and that she had concerns about being exposed to the coronavirus.\"They immediately put me aside, not with the general public,\" Pohlit said, adding that her blood pressure rose and her heartbeat increased due to her stress. While in the hospital's triage unit, Pohlit said that there was a curtain between herself and another patient who was coughing. She feared this patient could be sick with Covid-19 and was allowed to wait in the hallway until she was admitted to the emergency department. Pohlit then was evaluated for her symptoms and after being admitted, she said that her fear faded away. \"They were very honest with all of my questions and telling me that they would not put me in an area that would expose me to Covid,\" Pohlit said. \"I felt safe the whole time.\"Doctors at the hospital diagnosed a severe asthma attack.\"I was thankful that my asthmatic attack didn't cause me to have a heart attack,\" Pohlit said. \"You can't tell the difference between the two because a severe asthmatic attack gives you tightness in the chest, shortness of breath,\" she said, adding that women tend to have different heart attack symptoms than men.Symptoms of a heart attack include chest pain, shortness of breath or nausea, and women are more likely than men to have additional symptoms such as unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting. About every 40 seconds someone in the United States has a heart attack, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.While in the hospital, Pohlit received medication for her symptoms and, once stable, she was allowed to go home.\"When you have asthma and you're not getting the proper airflow, that could cause a lot of other medical issues and one is a heart attack. That is the reason I went to the hospital,\" she said. Pohlit added that if she had called 911 instead of taking herself to the hospital, even more steps could have been taken to ensure her exposure to the coronavirus was limited -- and she hopes that other patients can learn from her experience.\"I came in through the front door. If you call 911, they bring you in the safe way,\" Pohlit said. \"Your safety net is to call 911 because they have the equipment and technicians right there with you to help you get into the hospital.\"'Some patients ... were not seeking medical care'As the coronavirus pandemic continues, researchers are now learning more about how fears around Covid-19 are leading to rapid decreases in heart-related admissions to hospitals.The pre-print paper, posted on Monday to the online health sciences server medRxiv, included data on hospitalizations at 65 hospitals in the United States between February and March in 2018 through 2020. Neurologist Dr. Adam de Havenon of the University of Utah and colleagues across the country took a close look at patients' diagnoses and billing codes. They included 51,246 strokes and 36,551 acute coronary syndrome cases, or conditions associated with sudden reduced blood flow to the heart, among other diagnoses.The team compared the data in 2020 with the monthly averages from 2018 and 2019. They found a rise in stroke and acute coronary syndrome cases starting in February compared to previous years. Hospitalizations involving stroke rose nearly 10% and those involving acute coronary syndrome rose by 12.1%. Then in March 2020, those hospitalizations fell -- by 18.5% for stroke and 7.5% for acute coronary syndrome.\"Because the most likely explanation is that some patients with stroke and ACS were not seeking medical care, public health messaging should include reminders that emergent care for acute cardiovascular and neurologic symptoms should not be postponed during a pandemic,\" de Havenon and colleagues wrote.In the New England Journal of Medicine letter published on Friday, researchers from the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and Stanford University in California found a 39% drop in the number of patients getting brain scans for stroke symptoms. \"We were very surprised to see that many people of all ages, and even those with severe strokes, were not presenting to the hospital for evaluation and treatment. Even in states with few Covid cases, patients were hesitant to be seen in ERs,\" Albers said. \"Not only are patients afraid to go in but some physicians have been hesitant to send patients to the ER. Even paramedics may be concerned.\"",

        "body": "London (CNN)A small but rising number of children are becoming ill with a rare syndrome that could be linked to coronavirus, with reported cases showing symptoms of abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac inflammation, UK health care bosses and pediatrics specialists have warned.\n\nOn Sunday, the Paediatric Intensive Care Society UK (PICS) tweeted an \"urgent alert\" from the National Health Service England about a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children presenting \"overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters\" -- with some of the children testing positive for Covid-19. The urgent alert, sent to UK general practitioners by National Health Service (NHS) England warned that over the last three weeks, \"there has been an apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multisystem inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions of the UK,\" the Health Service Journal first reported Monday. The alert added: \"There is a growing concern that a [covid-19] related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK, or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infectious pathogen associated with these cases,\" HSJ added.In a statement sent over the weekend to medical professionals who look after critically ill children, PICS said \"the cases have in common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe Covid-19 in children. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation.\" Read MoreKawasaki disease, also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is a rare childhood illness that causes the walls of the blood vessels in the body to become inflamed. The group said that while there had been \"very few cases\" of critically unwell children with Covid-19 admitted to pediatric intensive care units in the UK and around the world, they were aware of a \"small number of children nationally\" who fit the clinical picture described in the NHS alert. There are still a lot of unknowns when it comes to Covid-19, but in a report released in April, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that children diagnosed with coronavirus in the United States typically have mild cases of the virus. The number of Covid-19 cases among children remains small and while some children and infants have been sick with Covid-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date, according to the CDC.Health care professionals urge calm Health care professionals have reassured parents that the risk of children becoming severely ill with the virus remains low. \"Thankfully Kawasaki-like diseases are very rare, as currently are serious complications in children related to Covid-19, but it is important that clinicians are made aware of any potential emerging links so that they are able to give children and young people the right care fast,\" Professor Simon Kenny, NHS national clinical director for children and young people said in a statement sent to CNN. In response to the reports, Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health said that although a small number of children can become severely ill with Covid-19, it is \"very rare,\" with evidence showing that children appear to be least affected by the virus.\"However our advice remains the same: parents should be reassured that children are unlikely to be seriously ill with Covid-19 but if they are concerned about their children's health for any reason, they should seek help from a health professional,\" Viner said. Dr. Tina Tan, professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine, said that the NHS England alert was important information to have here in the United States.\"I think it's really important that an alert like that goes out, not to alarm anybody but to have people be aware of the fact that this can happen. There have been an increased number of cases like this reported in Italy as well as Spain. Here in the US, I think we're just starting to see it,\" Tan told CNN Monday.\"Here in Chicago at Lurie Children's Hospital, we are just starting to see an increase in the number of older adolescents that are being hospitalized with fairly severe Covid disease that is requiring treatment,\" Tan said. \"Here in Chicago, some of the kids have some of the underlying conditions that would predispose you to getting more severe Covid disease, such as obesity and hypertension.\"Tan added that racial disparities are also emerging among Covid-19 cases in children.\"Out of Los Angeles they were reporting that younger African-Americans and Latinos were being affected by Covid more severely and actually being hospitalized,\" Tan said.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Prison and jail populations across the United States are becoming a breeding ground for the coronavirus, sickening thousands of inmates and detainees as well as the staff and employees that work in the facilities.\n\nWhile measures have been put in place to try and stop the spread the virus, it is difficult to contain such a contagious illness in congregate settings where people are forced to live, work and eat in close quarters.More than 2,300 cases across three prisonsAcross three state prison facilities in Ohio, more than 2,300 inmates have tested positive, with 1,858 testing positive at one prison alone.On Saturday the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction reported more than 1,400 inmates had tested positive at the Marion Correctional Institution, the Pickaway Correctional Institution and Franklin Medical Center.Read MoreThe department said in a statement to CNN that several mitigation measures had been put in place, including isolating infected inmates, performing more disinfecting cleaning sessions and canceling all visitations and volunteer activities.Despite efforts to stop the spread, more than 950 new cases were reported Sunday across those inmate populations, with at least 700 more inmates testing positive at the Marion facility alone, the ODRC website reportedLate last week, ODRC tested all staff and inmates at the three facilities after initial results came back with positives, spokeswoman JoEllen Smith told CNN in an emailed statement.\"Because we are testing everyone -- including those who are not showing symptoms -- we are getting positive test results on individuals who otherwise would have never been tested because they were asymptomatic,\" Smith said.A total of 152 inmates tested positive in one dorm, 60 of them were asymptomatic, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said during a Friday press conference.Five ODRC inmates who tested positive for coronavirus have died but no additional information on their deaths was immediately available.Four detainees from one jail have diedIn Illinois, a fourth detainee of Cook County Jail died Sunday, a press release from the Sheriff's Office said.To help fight the spread of the virus the jail released almost a fourth of its population. Of the roughly 10,000 detainees previously housed in Chicago's Cook County Jail only 4,200 remain in custody.Part of the decrease can be attributed to bail reform, which cut the jail's initial population by almost half. But 1,300 more inmates were released in the last month.\"We want to make sure that we're creating conditions whereby people who don't need to be there aren't there and the people who are there have optimal conditions for their health and safety,\" Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said.Karl Battiste, 64, died at John H. Stroger Jr. Hospital where he was receiving treatment after testing positive for coronavirus. His cause of death is pending autopsy, according to the release.A total of 215 detainees in custody of the jail are currently positive, including 21 who are being treated at local hospitals, according to the release. It also said 180 have already recovered.But detainees aren't the only ones infected. A total of 191 correctional officers have tested positive and 34 other Cook County Sheriff's employees have also tested positive for coronavirus, the release said.\n\nCNN's Brad Parks, Omar Jimenez, and Chuck Johnston contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)An influential coronavirus model often cited by the White House is now forecasting that 134,000 people will die of Covid-19 in the United States, nearly double its previous prediction.\n\nThe model, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, previously predicted 72,433 deaths as of Monday morning.Relatedly, a Trump administration model projects a rise in coronavirus cases and deaths in the weeks ahead, up to about 3,000 daily deaths in the US by June 1, according to an internal document obtained by The New York Times. Over the past week, about 2,000 people died daily in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The sharp increases in the two models are tied to relaxed social distancing and increased mobility in the US. States across the country -- including Florida, Colorado, Indiana, Nebraska and South Carolina -- have eased restrictions in an attempt to revive a sputtering economy and calm restless residents.The projections make clear that these reopenings come with fatal risks.Read More\"It's simple logic,\" CNN's senior medical correspondent Elizabeth Cohen said. \"When you tell people, 'Hey, you can go to bars, you can get your nails done, you can go to a restaurant,' those numbers are going to go up.\"The novel coronavirus's incubation period -- or the time from exposure to developing symptoms -- ranges from two to 14 days, according to the CDC, and the virus can even spread among people who show no symptoms at all. With widespread testing still limited, the consequences of these reopenings may not be evident for several weeks.Ali Mokdad, a professor of Health Metrics Sciences at IHME, told CNN's John King on Monday that there are \"several reasons\" for the increased projections.\"One of them is increased mobility before the relaxation, premature relaxation, of social distancing,\" he said. \"We're adding more presumptive deaths as well, and we're seeing a lot of outbreaks in the Midwest, for example.\"He said multiple variables impact infections -- like heat, testing capacity and population density -- but \"the most important one is mobility.\"Right now, he said, \"we're seeing an increase in mobility that's leading to an increase in mortality, unfortunately, in the United States.\"In addition, IHME director Dr. Christopher Murray said there is a \"longer tail of deaths,\" meaning some states will see a slower decline in deaths. Coronavirus has killed 68,285 people in the US and infected more than 1,171,000 others, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.President Donald Trump had previously said he expected 65,000 Americans to die, but on Sunday night, he revised that estimated death toll up to 80,000-90,000 people. It may not be the last upward revision; Dr. Deborah Birx, a White House coronavirus task force official, said projections have shown between 100,000 to 240,000 American deaths, even with social distancing.Other reopenings across the USAmong the other reopenings that started Monday:-- In Colorado, offices can reopen at 50% capacity with other guidelines, including allowing 6 feet between employees' desks and increased cleaning. Still, the state encourages businesses to allow telecommuting when possible.-- In Florida, the first phase of reopening begins. That phase allows elective surgeries, and restaurants can open for outdoor dining with 6 feet between tables and indoor seating at 25% capacity. Shops can reopen at 25% capacity. Other businesses -- including bars, gyms and hair salons -- will remain closed.-- In Nebraska, most churches, salons and restaurants can reopen.-- In South Carolina, the \"work-or-home\" order is being made voluntary and restaurants can begin outdoor dining.-- In Vermont, Gov. Phil Scott expects thousands of residents to return to work after an executive order that allows them to operate with new safety rules. Manufacturing, construction and distribution businesses can operate with 10 or fewer employees.-- Stay-at-home orders also expire Monday in Kansas and West Virginia.Even in reopening states, officials continue to recommend people stay at least 6 feet away from others, wear a cloth face mask outside the home, wash their hands frequently and avoid touching their face.The public pressure to ease restrictions is rising even in states with significant outbreaks. This weekend, thousands gathered in California to protest coronavirus restrictions, leading to 32 arrests at the state capitol.New York cases declining, but others going upIn some states, the number of coronavirus cases continues to decline, while other areas face challenges.California is \"days, not weeks\" away from beginning to lift restrictions to the state's stay-at-home order, said Gov. Gavin Newsom. But that likely won't happen across the state. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he does not think the city will reopen earlier than May 15.Other parts of California are already reopening. In Northern California, restaurants, salons, spas, tattoo parlors, shopping malls and gyms will all be open to residents of Yuba and Sutter counties.New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo reported that the number of intubations in the state hit hardest by coronavirus is down, and the total number of hospitalizations is below 10,000 for the first time since March.Still, he has expressed frustration with the slow decline in cases, especially compared with how rapidly cases increased initially.\"We're on the other side of the mountain ... (but) the decline from the mountain is not as steep as the incline,\" he said.But the improvement does not mean the nation can let down its guard.Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said numbers in his city are going up, and he is concerned about relaxing restrictions.\"We're still very much in the beginning days of coronavirus,\" Walsh said.White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci also warned that lifting measures prematurely could lead to a rebound of the virus that could put the US in the \"same boat that we were a few weeks ago.\"And a second round of the virus, he said, is inevitable. Its severity will depend on how prepared the nation is, he said.People flooded parks and beachesAmid relaxed restrictions and a heat wave, police had challenges at some outdoor spaces, including a lack of social distancing and limited use of face masks.For example, the Miami Beach Police Department announced it would South Pointe Park again until further notice due to non-compliance.Across Miami Beach over the weekend, more than 7,300 warnings were issued for failure to wear a face covering, according to police. More than 470 warnings were issued for failing to social distance, and more than 1,300 people were asked to leave parks after closing. In New York, where parks were full of socially distanced sunbathers this weekend, Gov. Cuomo said Sunday that not wearing a mask in public is \"disrespectful\" to others. To solve that, New York City is distributing 7.5 million face coverings at various locations around the city, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday morning.Five million three-ply non-medical masks and 2.5 million cloth face coverings will be distributed wherever social distancing guidelines are enforced, including grocery stores, public parks, and the Staten Island Ferry. The face coverings will also be made available at New York Housing Authority sites and city-provided meal program sites.In California, anger is rising at the governor for keeping some beaches closed. Two beach cities in Southern California voted to file an injunction late last week against the governor's order to temporarily close all beaches in Orange County.\n\nCNN's Jim Acosta, Nikki Carvajal, Sara Murray, Holly Yan, Jamie Gumbrecht, Laura Donlan, Kristina Sgueglia, Chuck Johnston, Alta D.

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)As the world continues to fight the coronavirus pandemic, a message from health officials has been consistent and clear: stay home.\n\nYet in the case of a life-threatening medical emergency such as heart attack or stroke, the American Heart Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians and several other medical groups are urging people to still call 911 and go to the hospital. In those emergencies, according to doctors, it's OK to leave home.In a joint statement on Wednesday, the eight medical groups noted concerns that some people with symptoms of heart attack, stroke and cardiac arrest are avoiding the hospital due to coronavirus fears. But they said doing so could be deadly.\"What we've seen over the course of the last six to eight weeks is that there are decreasing numbers of heart attacks and strokes showing up at US hospitals. That has also been reported in other places around the globe that have experienced Covid-19 epidemic,\" said Dr. Robert Harrington, interventional cardiologist and president of the American Heart Association, who was among the authors of the joint statement. The statement described that hospitals are following protocols to sanitize facilities and keep Covid-19 patients away from other patients.Read More\"We want to make sure now that as we're seeing those decreased numbers of heart attack and stroke patients that we call public awareness to this, that we call public attention to this, that this really is important from an overall public health perspective,\" Harrington said.Even as the coronavirus overwhelms the health care system, patients are still encouraged to call 911 if they experience symptoms of stroke -- such as sudden weakness, numbness or confusion, or symptoms of a heart attack such as chest pain, shortness of breath or nausea, according to the statement.Women are more likely than men to have additional symptoms such as unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting. About every 40 seconds, someone in the United States has a heart attack, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Outside of such emergencies, the guidance to stay home and social distance still stands.\"We don't want patients to come to the hospital who are not acutely ill,\" Harrington said. \"Many cardiac conditions can be handled with a phone call, with a video visit to their provider. What we're really talking about is the onset of unprovoked severe symptoms that come on and are unremitting.\"Living with heart failure during a pandemicDoctors at some Los Angeles County hospitals say people are waiting too long to seek medical treatment -- even including those infected with the coronavirus -- over fears of catching Covid-19.For instance, Cedars-Sinai has seen its patient volume drop significantly and is now at half capacity. Its Covid-19 patient volume has been stable for two weeks with about 120 to 130 patients fighting the disease. But even with the coronavirus patients, Cedars-Sinai's emergency room is seeing about half the volumes that it normally would.\"Right now, we're taking care of about 400 or so non-Covid patients,\" said Dr. Jeff Smith, chief operating officer of Cedars-Sinai Hospital. \"We're still caring for three- to four-times as many non-Covid patients as we are Covid patients but we still have a lot of capacity because patients have chosen to avoid the hospital.\"People who have serious heart conditions are among those at higher risk for severe illness from Covid-19 due to underlying medical conditions.\"I know there's been a dramatic decrease in the amount of cardiac patients and stroke patients because people are just too afraid to go to the hospital, and I can't say that it's not warranted fear. I think that it is,\" said Stayc Simpson, a survivor of heart failure based in Miami.\"I just don't know where the line is -- at what point is it now time to go to the hospital,\" she said. \"If you're feeling like you're going to have a heart attack you'll know the feeling, you'll know the difference between it. Call 911. If worst case scenario, at least EMS can tell you -- yes this is a reason to go to the hospital or no it is not.\"Simpson, 53, had a health scare of her own in mid-March and her husband rushed her to the hospital for care. What she experienced when she arrived was not what she expected.Simpson, founder and director of the gymnastics center GYMagination, suddenly awoke from slumber that morning in March with an unusually quick beating heart rate. Having had heart failure since 2010 as a side effect of chemotherapy, she knew this feeling.\"I woke up and I told my husband to call 911,\" Simpson said. \"I checked my heart rate. It was 145.\" A normal resting heart rate typically is 60 to 100 beats per minute. Her blood pressure was also high. When Simpson and her husband arrived at the hospital, Simpson said that she was asked the standard questions to screen for Covid-19. Did she have a cough? Yes, but it was due to her heart failure. Had she traveled outside of the country? No. Had she been exposed to someone suspected of having Covid-19? Simpson hesitated.\"The mayor of Miami was the first person diagnosed in Miami. My best friend works in his office. So the answer I had to answer was yes ... I have been in contact with somebody who has been exposed but does not have it,\" Simpson said. \"They immediately took me away from my husband and put me to the Covid area of the hospital.\"Simpson was put in a room with other patients but a curtain separated them.While in that room, a medical care team tested Simpson for Covid-19. Six days later, her test results came in as negative.In the hospital, as morning turned to night, \"all together it was eight hours when the ER doctor came back. She said, 'Listen I'm just going to discharge you to go home because I think you would be better to self-quarantine at home right now than be here,'\" Simpson said, adding that her symptoms had subsided.\"She said the cardiologist on call will not come down to see you and she will not admit you because they're afraid of you having it and exposing people,\" Simpson said. \"By that point my vitals were back to normal, and they thought it might be a reaction because I had started an antibiotic the day before.\"After arriving at the ER around 10:30 a.m., Simpson said she was released by 8 p.m. that evening.Since then, Simpson said that she has had three similar incidents but has spoken to her cardiologist instead of going to the hospital -- and that experience has her remaining even more vigilant with tracking her health than she was before.A health app on her smart phone helps her track her heart rate. She regularly checks her blood pressure. She has had video checkups with her cardiologist from home.\"Tracking yourself, having a way to be able to keep track of your health, having good communication with your doctor -- those are the three essential things right now to be able to hopefully help yourself,\" Simpson said. \"And then to also know the signs of a heart attack and then to know the signs of a stroke.\"Concerns around giving birthPatients with symptoms of heart attack and stroke are not the only ones who appear to be avoiding the hospital due to concerns about being exposed to the novel coronavirus.Some pregnant women might be questioning their original plans to give birth in a hospital and there have been reports of increasing inquiries from moms-to-be considering giving birth at home because of coronavirus fears.In response, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released a statement on Monday reassuring pregnant women.\"Obstetrician-gynecologists see firsthand the stress and uncertainty facing pregnant people, families, and their support networks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this includes questioning the settings in which to give birth,\" ACOG President Dr. Maureen Phipps said in the statement.\"However, even during this pandemic, hospitals and accredited birth centers remain the safest places to give birth,\" she said in part. \"Physicians, certified nurse-midwives and certified midwives, and the entire health care team will work to ensure that precautions are taken to make labor and delivery safe, supportive and welcoming for their patients.\"Many hospitals have made an effort to separate Covid-19 patients from others seeking care.\"Hospitals have done a very good job of being able to segregate the groups of patients into various care units,\" said Harrington of the American Heart Association.In Los Angeles, both Centinela Hospital Medical Center and Cedars-Sinai have separate areas of their facilities dedicated to treating Covid-19 patients and both hospitals want people to seek out medical attention before their health deteriorates\"It really just comes back to if you have an urgent or an emergent need, we can care for you safely at the hospital,\" said Smith, of Cedars-Sinai. \"And you should come.\"\n\nCNN's Stephanie Elam and Madeline Holcombe contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Engaged in December and married by May, coronavirus shaped our relationship ... and our wedding\n\nBy Ivan Watson, CNN\n\nUpdated 0020 GMT (0820 HKT) May 8, 2020\n\nWe are publishing personal essays from CNN's global staff as they live and cover the story of Covid-19. Ivan Watson is a senior international correspondent for CNN in Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong (CNN)\"Can we take our masks off?\" I ask, as my bride and I get into position.\n\n\"You may,\" responds a Hong Kong official, who is still wearing his mask. Moments later, Rana and I exchange rings, sign government documents, and share a brief kiss. Amid the uncertainty of the coronavirus pandemic, Rana and I have just gotten married. On the other side of the planet, our families and friends in the US, Lebanon and elsewhere watch the little civil ceremony in Hong Kong streamed live on Instagram, sprinkling the video with hearts and emojis and other social media expressions of happiness.Before leaving the wedding registry, we put on his and hers surgical masks adorned with the titles \"Mr.\" and \"Mrs.\"Read MoreThis was not what we expected, when I first asked her to marry me on a freezing night in New York City last December.At the time, we were both jet-lagged after the long flight from Hong Kong, where we live and work. We were also deliriously happy, posing in front of a glowing fountain alongside my sister and brother-in-law, who conspired with me to take surprise photos of the occasion.Basking in that happy moment, we had little clue that a deadly new strain of pneumonia had just been discovered in a city called Wuhan in China -- and the next four and a half months of our lives became our Engagement with Coronavirus.Neither of us are strangers to crisis.Rana grew up in Beirut in a civil war. At a young age, she suffered the loss of her father, one of many tragic victims of that conflict.While my childhood was much more comfortable, 20 years of reporting overseas exposed me to the grim realities of war, natural disaster and political instability. Still, neither of us had ever been confronted by a modern-day plague of global proportions.The wake-up call came at the end of January, when the Hong Kong administration canceled schools, shut down public recreation centers and issued work-from-home orders to civil servants. The coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan had spread across China, and the first cases had been detected in the semi-autonomous cities of Hong Kong and Macau.Hong Kongers didn't mess around. Immediately, the whole city started wearing masks.We did too, when we went to the Births, Deaths and Marriages Registrations Office in early February to apply for a date to get married. Friends and family back home called to express concern about our health. But they spoke about the epidemic as if it was some distant threat, an \"Asian\" problem that would never reach their shores.As Rana became more and more worried, I remained naively optimistic -- until a reporting assignment in South Korea at the end of February. At that stage, South Korea had the most confirmed coronavirus cases outside mainland China. In early March, thousands of Koreans were testing positive on a daily basis. Governments increasingly imposed international flight restrictions. Seemingly overnight, my hotel in Seoul became eerily empty.On March 10, the only way to get from South Korea back home to Hong Kong was to fly absurdly long distances via London. On the flight from South Korea, CNN cameraman Tom Booth and I were shocked to see British Airways crews operating without any protection. No one checked our temperature during the layover at London's Heathrow Airport. Britain apparently behaved as if this deadly disease wasn't happening.Upon arrival in Hong Kong, health authorities put me on two-week mandatory medical surveillance. I was to check my temperature twice daily and report immediately if I came down with symptoms. Though authorities advised against it, Rana insisted on staying by my side throughout the 14 days. Fortunately, neither of us got sick.Making the best of itThen, throughout March, Covid-19 spread like wildfire across the Middle East, Europe and North America. Suddenly, Rana and I were far more worried about our parents in the US and Lebanon, than we were for ourselves in Hong Kong.For two people who have lived almost all of our adult lives overseas, a sickening realization set in -- we could no longer count on jumping on a plane to fly home to our loved ones in the event of an emergency. Yet amid the anxiety and fear, a silver lining emerged.In this pandemic, we had each other. Social isolation meant a pause in business travel and long work deployments. With our little rescue cat, our small family settled in for weeks of working from home in pajamas followed by cozy home-cooked dinners.The coronavirus forced us to stop and count our blessings. The entire world has been taught a giant lesson in humility, a reminder that we are subject to forces and events that we cannot control. Nothing -- neither our health, the roof over our heads, nor the food on our table -- can be taken for granted.At the same time, life must go on.\"After all, your grandparents got married during World War II,\" my mom pointed out.She is very right. My grandparents, two refugees from the civil war in Russia, started a family amid the horrors of Nazi-occupied France. Compare that to me and Rana, who spent much of our engagement on the couch watching \"Tiger King\" (among other things).So far, we have had it so easy. A week before the wedding, however, disaster struck. Rana's 84-year old grandmother suffered a stroke. She was taken to intensive care in Beirut and had brain surgery.There was nothing we could do. Even if there was some way to fly to Lebanon, Rana would not dare exposing her family if she picked up an illness on the plane.Thankfully, Rana's teta stabilized after the operation. She's a tough lady.Finally, our wedding day arrived in May. We wore surgical masks with \"bride\" and \"groom\" written on them in marker to the registry.The city's coronavirus guidelines allow up to 20 guests at a wedding. We had eight. There is no time for vows to be exchanged during the 15-minute civil ceremony -- although in some ways, we didn't need them. After our engagement with coronavirus, we know we will be there for each other, no matter what the future may bring.",

        "body": "(CNN)Scientists are learning more each day about the mysterious novel coronavirus and the symptoms of Covid-19, the disease it causes.\n\nFever, cough and shortness of breath are found in the vast majority of all Covid-19 cases. But there are additional signals of the virus, some that are very much like cold or flu, and some that are more unusual.Any or all symptoms can appear anywhere from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Here are 10 signs that you or a loved one may have Covid-19 -- and what to do to protect yourself and your family.1. Shortness of breathRead MoreShortness of breath is not usually an early symptom of Covid-19, but it is the most serious. It can occur on its own, without a cough. If your chest becomes tight or you begin to feel as if you cannot breathe deeply enough to fill your lungs with air, that's a sign to act quickly, experts say. \"If there's any shortness of breath immediately call your health care provider, a local urgent care or the emergency department,\" said American Medical Association president Dr. Patrice Harris.\"If the shortness of breath is severe enough, you should call 911,\" Harris added.The CDC lists other emergency warning signs for Covid-19 as a \"persistent pain or pressure in the chest,\" and \"bluish lips or face,\" which can indicate a lack of oxygen.Get medical attention immediately, the CDC says.2. FeverFever is a key sign of Covid-19. Because some people can have a core body temperature lower or higher than the typical 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius), experts say not to fixate on a number.CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who is battling the virus from his home in New York, is one of those people. \"I run a little cool. My normal temperature is 97.6, not 98.6. So, even when I'm at 99 that would not be a big deal for most people. But, for me, I'm already warm,\" Cuomo told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN Town Hall.Most children and adults, however, will not be considered feverish until their temperature reaches 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius).\"There are many misconceptions about fever,\" said Dr. John Williams, chief of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.\"We all actually go up and down quite a bit during the day as much as half of a degree or a degree,\" Williams said, adding that for most people \"99.0 degrees or 99.5 degrees Fahrenheit is not a fever.\" Don't rely on a temperature taken in the morning, said infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventative medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville. Instead, take your temperature in the late afternoon and early evening.\"Our temperature is not the same during the day. If you take it at eight o'clock in the morning, it may be normal,\" Schaffner explained.\"One of the most common presentations of fever is that your temperature goes up in the late afternoon and early evening. It's a common way that viruses produce fever.\"3. Dry CoughCoughing is another common symptom, but it's not just any cough.\"It's not a tickle in your throat. You're not just clearing your throat. It's not just irritated,\" Schaffner explained.The cough is bothersome, a dry cough that you feel deep in your chest.\"It's coming from your breastbone or sternum, and you can tell that your bronchial tubes are inflamed or irritated,\" Schaffner added.A report put out by the World Health Organization in February found over 33% of 55,924 people with laboratory confirmed cases of Covid-19 had coughed up sputum, a thick mucus sometimes called phlegm, from their lungs. 4. Chills and body aches\"The beast comes out at night,\" said Cuomo, referencing the chills, body aches and high fever that visited him on April 1. 'It was like somebody was beating me like a pinata. And I was shivering so much that ... I chipped my tooth. They call them the rigors,\" he said from his basement, where he is quarantined from the rest of his family.\"I was hallucinating. My dad was talking to me. I was seeing people from college, people I haven't seen in forever, it was freaky,\" Cuomo said. Not everyone will have such a severe reaction, experts say. Some may have no chills or body aches at all. Others may experience milder flu-like chills, fatigue and achy joints and muscles, which can make it difficult to know if it's flu or coronavirus that's to blame.One possible sign that you might have Covid-19 is if your symptoms don't improve after a week or so but actually worsen.5. Sudden confusionSpeaking of worsening signs, the CDC says a sudden confusion or an inability to wake up and be alert may be a serious sign that emergency care may be needed. If you or a loved one has those symptoms, especially with other critical signs like bluish lips, trouble breathing or chest pain, the CDC says to seek help immediately.6. Digestive issuesAt first science didn't think diarrhea or other typical gastric issues that often come with the flu applied to the noval coronavirus, also known as SARS-CoV-2. As more research on survivors becomes available, that opinion has changed. \"In a study out of China where they looked at some of the earliest patients, some 200 patients, they found that digestive or stomach GI (gastrointestinal) symptoms were actually there in about half the patients,\" Gupta said on CNN's New Day news program.Overall, \"I think we're getting a little bit more insight into the types of symptoms that patients might have,\" Gupta said.The study described a unique subset of milder cases in which the initial symptoms were digestive issues such as diarrhea, often without fever. Those patients experienced delays in testing and diagnosis than patients with respiratory issues, and they took longer to clear the virus from their systems.7. Pink eyeResearch from China, South Korea and other parts of the world indicate that about 1% to 3% of people with Covid-19 also had conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye. Conjunctivitis, a highly contagious condition when caused by a virus, is an inflammation of the thin, transparent layer of tissue, called conjunctiva, that covers the white part of the eye and the inside of the eyelid.But SARS-CoV-2 is just one of many viruses that can cause conjunctivitis, so it came as no real surprise to scientists that this newly discovered virus would do the same.Still, a pink or red eye could be one more sign that you should call your doctor if you also have other telltale symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.8. Loss of smell and tasteIn mild to moderate cases of coronavirus, a loss of smell and taste is emerging as one of the most unusual early signs of Covid-19.\"What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on New Day.\"It may be linked to loss of taste, linked to loss of appetite, we're not sure -- but it's clearly something to look out for,\" Gupta said. \"Sometimes these early symptoms aren't the classic ones.\"\"Anosmia, in particular, has been seen in patients ultimately testing positive for the coronavirus with no other symptoms,\" according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery.A recent analysis of milder cases in South Korea found the major presenting symptom in 30% of patients was a loss of smell. In Germany, more than two in three confirmed cases had anosmia.It has long been known in medical literature that a sudden loss of smell may be associated with respiratory infections caused by other types of coronaviruses, so it wasn't a surprise that the novel coronavirus would have this effect, according to ENT UK (PDF), a professional organization representing ear, nose and throat surgeons in the United Kingdom.Is there anything you can do at home to test to see if you're suffering a loss of smell? The answer is yes, by using the \"jellybean test\" to tell if odors flow from the back of your mouth up through your nasal pharynx and into your nasal cavity. if you can pick out distinct flavors such as oranges and lemons, your sense of smell is functioning fine.9. FatigueFor some people, extreme fatigue can be an early sign of the novel coronavirus. The WHO report found nearly 40% of the nearly 6,000 people with laboratory confirmed cases experienced fatigue.Just a few days into his quarantine, Cuomo was already exhausted by the fevers and body aches the disease brings. \"I'm so lethargic that I can stare outside, and, like, an hour-and-a-half goes by,\" Cuomo told Gupta on Anderson Cooper 360. \"I think I took a 10-minute nap, and it was three and a half hours.\"Fatigue may continue long after the virus is gone. Anecdotal reports from people who have recovered from Covid-19 say exhaustion and lack of energy continue well past the standard recovery period of a few weeks.10. Headache, sore throat, congestionThe WHO report also found nearly 14% of the almost 6,000 cases of Covid-19 in China had symptoms of headache and sore throat, while almost 5% had nasal congestion. Certainly not the most common signs of the disease, but obviously similar to colds and flu. In fact, many symptoms of Covid-19 can resemble the flu, including headaches and the previously mentioned digestive issues, body aches and fatigue. Still other symptoms can resemble a cold or allergies, such as a sore throat and congestion.Most likely, experts say, you simply have a cold or the flu -- after all, they can cause fever and cough too. So what should you do?\"At this moment, the current guidance -- and this may change -- is that if you have symptoms that are similar to the cold and the flu and these are mild symptoms to moderate symptoms, stay at home and try to manage them\" with rest, hydration and the use of fever-reducing medications, said the AMA's Harris.That advice does not apply if you are over age 60, since immune systems weaken as we age or if you are pregnant. Anyone with concerns about coronavirus should call their healthcare provider, according to the CDC.It's unclear whether pregnant women have a greater chance of getting severely ill from coronavirus, but the CDC has said that women experience changes in their bodies during pregnancy that may increase their risk of some infections.In general, Covid-19 infections are riskier if you have underlying health conditions such as diabetes, chronic lung disease or asthma, heart failure or heart disease, sickle cell anemia, cancer (or are undergoing chemotherapy), kidney disease with dialysis, a body mass index (BMI) over 40 (extremely obese) or an autoimmune disorder.\"Older patients and individuals who have underlying medical conditions or are immunocompromised should contact their physician early in the course of even mild illness,\" the CDC advises.To be clear, you are at higher risk -- even if you are young -- if you have underlying health issues.\"People under 60 with underlying illnesses, with diabetes, heart disease, immunocompromised or have any kind of lung disease previously, those people are more vulnerable despite their younger age,\" Schaffner said.A history of travel to an area where the novel coronavirus is widespread (and those parts of the world, including the US, are going up each day) is obviously another key factor in deciding if your symptoms may be Covid-19 or not.How to be evaluatedIf you have no symptoms, please don't ask for testing or add to backlog of calls at testing centers, clinics, hospitals and the like, experts say.\"We do not test people with no symptoms because it's a resource issue,\" Schaffner said about the assessment center at Vanderbilt. \"However, we are emphasizing that people who have this small cluster of important symptoms -- fever and anything related to the lower respiratory tract such as cough and difficulty breathing -- reach out to be evaluated.\"If you do have those three signs, where should you go?\"If you have insurance and you're looking for a provider or someone to call or connect with, there's always a number on the back of your insurance card; or if you go online, there is information for patients,\" Harris said.\"If you don't have insurance, you can start with the state health department or the local community health centers, those are officially known as federally qualified health centers,\" Harris advised, adding that some states have a 1-800 hotline number to call.\"If there is a testing and assessment center near you, you can go there directly,\" Schaffer said. \"It's always good to notify them that you're coming. Otherwise, you need to call your healthcare provider and they will direct you what to do.\"\n\nCNN's Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Coronavirus testing in the United States is disorganized and needs coordination at the national level, infectious disease experts said in a new report released Wednesday.\n\nRight now, testing is not accurate enough to use alone to make most decisions, including who should go back to work or to school, the team at the University of Minnesota said. \"It's a mess out there,\" Mike Osterholm, head of the university's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP), which issued the report, told CNN.\"Testing is very, very important, but we're not doing the right testing.\"The number of tests that have been completed -- numbers widely reported by states and by the White House -- show only part of the picture, the report reads.Read More\"The data is really kind of screwed up,\" Osterholm said. \"It's because the public health system is overwhelmed.\"The report has some specific recommendations for diagnostic tests that check to see if someone is currently infected with coronavirus.Testing is most useful for clinical care of patients, for disease surveillance and contact tracing and for monitoring frontline workers such as emergency responders, doctors and nurses who may have been exposed, the report recommends. People with symptoms should also be tested, it says.But coronavirus testing is not accurate enough yet to use in many other ways, the CIDRAP team said.It recommends against: * Universal testing in hospital settings* Testing in schools or other low-risk settings* Widespread community-based testing* Antibody tests to decide who goes back to work* Immunity passportsIt might be useful to test asymptomatic people in long-term care facilities in some cases because they are likely to have many cases, the report said. \"Asymptomatic shedding of the virus may be detected with a molecular test (which looks for the virus itself) or an antigen test (which looks for an immune response to the virus). It is not yet clear where, when and how asymptomatic individuals should be tested.\"The report also says that antibody tests should be used only with caution. These tests check the blood for evidence of an immune response to the virus, and indicate that someone has been infected for some days or has even cleared an infection. They are most useful for identifying donors of plasma used to treat patients or for deciding on how to manage patients when standard diagnostic tests are negative, the report says.It's not clear if antibody tests are useful for testing of health care workers to determine immune status, according to the report. \"We believe that greatly expanding SARSCoV-2 testing is a critical element in our response to COVID-19,\" the report reads. \"For testing to be maximally effective, coordination across the system and across jurisdictions is necessary. Ideally, this requires federal guidance, leadership and support, with strong jurisdictional buy-in at the state and local levels.\"The report calls on the US Department of Health and Human Services to appoint a panel to oversee and organize testing. \"The panel should include representatives from public health, clinical laboratory, and medicine; the laboratory testing research and development, marketing, and product support industries; ethicists; legal scholars; and elected officials,\" it says.Osterholm noted that some states are combining data from diagnostic tests and antibody tests to make estimates about how many people have been infected. The Food and Drug Administration advises against using tests in this way and so does Osterholm. \"You need to do the right test at the right time to get the right result,\" he said. \"Nobody is thinking through that.\"Plus, there's not enough coordination to ensure that states have the testing supplies they need. This is a system and if a system breaks down anywhere, it breaks down everywhere,\" Osterholm said.\"What good are the test results if you can't trust them?\"",

        "body": "Dr. Andrew Chang is a cardiology fellow physician at Stanford University Medical Center. Dr. Michele Barry is the Director of the Center for Innovation in Global Health at Stanford University. The views expressed here are theirs. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN)In our current moment of social distancing and necessary medical triage, millions of Americans are going without medical treatment, both preventive and elective. Those with pre-existing and undiagnosed chronic diseases throughout the country will not get care -- and some will die -- from lack of attention and treatment due to Covid-19. Many of them will never have even been infected by or shown symptoms of the virus -- but their neglected illnesses must be accounted for when taking stock of its devastating toll on our society.\n\nOver 800,000 Americans suffer a heart attack each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which amounts to roughly one case every 40 seconds. Yet, as was noted recently by Dr. Harlan Krumholz in the New York Times, doctors in Europe and the US have been asking: \"Where have all the heart attacks gone?\" While Covid-19 cases have been surging throughout the world, physicians in Italy and Spain are reporting 40 to 70% reductions in major heart attack admissions, while cardiologists in Boston, Seattle, Minneapolis and Cincinnati have also been surprised by the 40% decline in presentation of the most severe heart attack patients at their hospitals.It is too early to draw definitive conclusions about these numbers until more comprehensive data is available, there is a general unease around the cardiology community about this drop. On one hand, optimists have posited that people may be resting more, smoking less, facing less particulate matter with diminished pollution and avoiding stressful situations due to social distancing policies -- leading to fewer actual heart attacks. Others, however, worry that what is actually happening is that some cardiac patients, afraid of being exposed to coronavirus, may be avoiding hospitals, minimizing their symptoms and staying at home.Indeed, The Economist has reported that Bergamo province in Italy has tabulated 2,420 more deaths last month than in March of 2019 -- but less than half of these additional deaths were listed as due to Covid-19 infection. One cannot help but wonder how many of these casualties were those who failed to seek care from non-coronavirus illnesses and died at home instead. It stands to reason that some of the mortality totals we are attributing to Covid-19 may actually be an underestimation of the true magnitude of the crisis.Read MoreThe avoidance of health care settings is not a problem unique to patients with heart disease. For the roughly half million Americans on biweekly dialysis for kidney failure (according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases), or the 650,000 the CDC estimates are receiving chemotherapy for cancer, shelter-in-place is not an option. They require these lifesaving therapies at special infusion centers or dialysis units for continued survival. Nevertheless, some of these patients may be choosing to postpone or avoid treatment altogether to avoid contracting Covid-19 at these facilities from other ill individuals. Health system-level issues also contribute to the misery of people living with chronic disease. Those newly diagnosed with cancer may have to suffer the double anxiety of their new, deadly diagnosis while experiencing delays in the initiation of chemotherapy, radiation therapy and curative surgery. For those whose cancers have spread too widely and are no longer responsive to chemotherapy, experimental drug trials are their only hope for prolonging life. Because of Covid-19, these clinical trials, which were their only chance for a miracle, are being indefinitely postponed or canceled.Furthermore, fear of contracting Covid-19 from health care settings has led to a major reduction in blood donations throughout the country. This has far reaching implications beyond patients with cancer or hematologic disorders who require regular blood transfusions to support their blood counts. This also means that there are far fewer lifesaving red blood cells, platelets and plasma products available for surgical patients and trauma victims, who may require emergency transfusions in the emergency department or operating room.Even the search for provisional Covid-19 treatments is generating new risks for chronic disease sufferers. Hydroxychloroquine, prematurely touted by the president as a potential antiviral breakthrough, has a well-known side effect of increasing deadly irregular heart rhythms. Furthermore, the drug, which has yet to be proven to be efficacious in treating coronavirus, is an important medication for treating autoimmune disorders such as lupus. Patients with autoimmune diseases who have relied upon hydroxychloroquine for years to control their life-threatening conditions are now at risk of finding themselves without the medicine, as it is being redirected to the coronavirus effort.Psychiatric patients, many of whom suffer from drug and alcohol addiction and homelessness, are a particularly vulnerable group in this pandemic as well. Social isolation can lead to dangerous self-medicating behaviors such as excessive alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse. Domestic violence victims, trapped in their homes with their abusers, are reporting incidents at higher rates. Ominously, research has shown associations between economic recessions, as threatened by this epidemic, and substantial increases in suicides. For health care providers hoping that these effects will last only for the duration of the pandemic, emerging reports suggest that the effects of the Covid-19 epidemic will continue to be felt for years following control of the virus. Heart attack patients, if not treated in a timely manner, can develop debilitating chronic heart failure. Psychiatrists and therapists are bracing themselves for the wave of mental health trauma sustained from first responders and front line health care providers, many of whom will have had to watch healthy young patients and their colleagues succumb to the disease. Among those spared from coronavirus infection, reduced physical activity from limited access to gyms and exercise equipment (combined with dietary shifting to unhealthy food choices to save money) may lead to obesity and other metabolic disturbances, potentially manifesting as future heart attacks, strokes, and diabetic complications. When this pandemic abates, these cases of disability and death from chronic disease will likely not be counted among the casualties of Covid-19, since most of them will never have contracted the virus itself. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that the crisis contributed in some way to their suffering. To truly determine the magnitude of this disaster, it is thus critical that health researchers and physicians devote attention and funding now to studying these buried cases as the data arrives, incorporating their toll into the final epidemic body count. In addition, the medical community needs to be prepared for a potential surge in non-Covid-19 chronic disease complications in the weeks and months to come when the immediate threat from coronavirus contagion subsides. Only by preparing ourselves for this flood of collateral victims will we avoid getting swept away by the pandemic's second, silent wave of non-communicable diseases.",

All were under the age of 50, and all had either mild symptoms of Covid-19 infection or no symptoms at all.\"The virus seems to be causing increased clotting in the large arteries, leading to severe stroke,\" Oxley told CNN. Read More\"Our report shows a seven-fold increase in incidence of sudden stroke in young patients during the past two weeks. Most of these patients have no past medical history and were at home with either mild symptoms (or in two cases, no symptoms) of Covid,\" he added.\"All tested positive. Two of them delayed calling an ambulance.\"Other doctors have also reported that people are reluctant to call 911 or go to emergency rooms because of the pandemic.It is not common for people so young to have strokes, especially strokes in the large vessels in the brain.\"For comparison, our service, over the previous 12 months, has treated on average 0.73 patients every 2 weeks under the age of 50 years with large vessel stroke,\" the team wrote in a letter to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine. That's fewer than two people a month.A stroke in a large blood vessel causes severe damage if it is not removed right away. At least one patient has died, and others are in rehabilitation facilities, intensive care or in the stroke unit. Only one went home but will require intense care, Oxley said.\"The average person who has a large vessel stroke is severely impaired,\" Oxley said. \"It means it a bigger clot. It includes one of the largest arteries in the brain.\"Brain cells die when blood flow is stopped, and the longer it's blocked, the wider the damage in the brain. Quick treatment is vital. \"The most effective treatment for large vessel stroke is clot retrieval, but this must be performed within 6 hours, and sometimes within 24 hours,\" Oxley said.Oxley said his team wanted to tell people to watch themselves for symptoms of coronavirus infection and to call 911 if they have any evidence of stroke.\"Up until now, people have been advised to only call for an ambulance with shortness of breath or high fever,\" he wrote.The easy memory device for stroke, he said, is \"FAST\": F for face drooping, A for arm weakness, S for speech difficulty and T for time to call 911.",

        "body": "(CNN)The new coronavirus can infect organs throughout the body, including lungs, throat, heart, liver, brain, kidneys and the intestines, researchers reported Wednesday.\n\nTwo separate reports suggest the virus goes far beyond the lungs and can attack various organs -- findings that can help explain the wide range of symptoms caused by Covid-19 infection.The findings might help explain some of the puzzling symptoms seen in coronavirus patients. They include blood clots that cause strokes in younger people and that clog dialysis machines, headaches and kidney failure.Covid-19 is classified as a respiratory virus and is transmitted through respiratory droplets, but it can also sometimes cause diarrhea and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Researchers have found evidence of the virus in the stool of patients, and warn that it can be transmitted via what's known as the fecal-oral route. For one study, Jie Zhou and colleagues at the University of Hong Kong wanted to see how well the virus can flourish in the intestines. They grew intestinal organoids -- lab dish versions of the organs -- from both bats and people. They showed the virus not only lived in these organoids, but replicated.Read More\"The human intestinal tract might be a transmission route of SARS-CoV-2,\" the team wrote in their report, published in Nature Medicine.They also found virus capable of infecting cells in stool taken from a patient with Covid-19.\"A 68-year-old female patient presented with fever, sore throat and productive cough and developed diarrhea after admission to Princess Margaret Hospital,\" Zhou and colleagues wrote. \"We isolated infectious virus from her stool specimen,\" they added.\"Here we demonstrate active replication of SARS-CoV-2 in human intestinal organoids and isolation of infectious virus from the stool specimen of a patient with diarrheal COVID-19.\"Separately, a team at University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany performed autopsies on 27 patients who died from Covid-19. They found the virus in a variety of organs.\"SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in multiple organs, including the lungs, pharynx, heart, liver, brain, and kidneys,\" they wrote in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine.The virus seemed to do especially well in the kidneys, they wrote -- something that might explain the high rate of kidney injury seen among Covid-19 patients.The ability of the virus to attack various organs might aggravate pre-existing conditions, they added. People with heart disease, diabetes and kidney disease are especially vulnerable to the new coronavirus.",

        "body": "(CNN)Government records reveal how supply shortages, lapses in care, a lack of transparency and inadequate infection control precautions are fueling the spread of Covid-19 within America's nursing homes.\n\nTroubled facilities and highly rated nursing homes alike have been struggling, with overwhelmed workers trying to identify, isolate and treat patients with the disease on top of their already demanding jobs. Measures aimed at protecting residents from the spread of the disease, meanwhile, have left them even more vulnerable and closed off from the public. As a result, government watchdogs say it is becoming easier for substandard care to go unchecked and for some facilities to keep dangerous secrets. \"There are no tests,\" a nurse at a Michigan facility told a state health department employee at the end of March, according to a government report, recounting how they were expected to take care of a unit full of pneumonia patients known as the \"Covid unit\" and had brought their own medical supplies for residents. \"I have one (resident) who is actively dying right now.\" After announcing its first positive case of coronavirus, town officials in Massachusetts publicly condemned a local nursing home when the fire chief noticed a spike in calls from the facility but couldn't find out what was going on inside the walls. Read MorePolice reports obtained by CNN through a public records request show how there had been warning signs about trouble brewing within a massive New Jersey long-term care facility -- including multiple calls to police and reports of alleged patient neglect -- for days before police discovered more than a dozen bodies in a makeshift morgue.Many of the country's nursing homes were already understaffed and frequently cited for lax infection control before coronavirus began to spread. Now staff are risking their own health and often lacking access to the supplies and testing they need as they care for a population at high risk of dying from the disease.State long-term care ombudsmen, who are tasked with protecting residents, told CNN there are not enough eyes on these facilities at a time when oversight is needed the most.Routine health and safety inspections have been suspended by the federal government to protect against any additional exposure to workers and residents. A CNN review of more than 100 inspection reports documenting visits still taking place, and complaint information gathered from state ombudsmen, provides a snapshot of serious problems during this pandemic -- including unacceptable care and failures to take steps to stem spreading infections. Families, who are often the ones keeping tabs on their loved ones' care and in some cases even supplementing that care, have been restricted from visiting facilities in an attempt to slow the spread. CNN spoke with family members of nursing home residents in four different states who said they had struggled to get them tested for the virus or receive any updates about their conditions -- and in some cases facility officials had kept vital information from them. One woman said she resorted to calling 911 herself to get her very sick father, who she said tested positive for coronavirus, admitted to the hospital -- where she said he remained as of Thursday in critical condition.On Sunday, the federal government announced a new rule requiring nursing homes to report Covid-19 cases to residents and their families and the CDC. Ombudsmen say it remains to be seen how -- and how aggressively -- this will be enforced by state inspectors. And even when facilities are cited for severe violations, critics have long argued that government penalties are too low to discourage the worst behavior.\"I'm concerned about neglect, poor care, rights being violated and abuse right now,\" said Patricia Hunter, the long-term care ombudsman for Washington state, where the first nursing home outbreak publicly unfolded.Repeated calls More than a week before the Andover Subacute and Rehab Center II in New Jersey made headlines with the discovery of 17 bodies in the facility's morgue on April 13, there were signs of a deepening crisis, according to police reports obtained by CNN.Repeated calls to police were made. There were calls about patients with symptoms such as a high fever or respiratory distress. One resident was taken to the hospital, reports show; another call was cancelled even though the patient had been in \"full code\" -- meaning they were in need of resuscitation. It's unclear if a third ever made it to the hospital. Police also responded to a fire alarm there, but when they arrived, the report states, they were told it was a false alarm and that maintenance had it under control. And three days before the bodies were found, reports show county health officials told police they had been fielding complaints about understaffing, a lack of protective equipment and patient neglect -- including allegations that some residents weren't being fed.Even after the police discovered the extent of deaths at the facility (which they said at the time weren't necessarily all linked to Covid-19), frantic calls to police continued. A resident said he wasn't being allowed to call his family, though staff claimed to police it was because it was after hours. Other callers said the facility was in desperate need of more protective gowns and body bags, and a state senator reported there was no staff at the facility. One resident was sent to the hospital with hypothermia when the facility's heat reportedly stopped working, a report shows, though staff later told police the heat was working. As public scrutiny intensified, a nurse reported receiving threats.The state has since said more than 30 of the facility's residents have died of Covid-19 and there have been more than 100 confirmed cases. The facility owner said in a statement that staff had notified state authorities when \"there was a tragic surge in patient deaths,\" with 15 patients dying in a matter of days. He said employees tried to work with funeral homes to transport the deceased residents but were \"left to manage these fatalities as best they could.\" He added that resident safety was paramount at the facility, which had faced challenges related to a lack of protective gear and staffing complications after workers also became ill. In an earlier statement, a facility attorney said that nursing home officials were confident that any future review by the state of what had occurred \"will confirm that the facility has been addressing the unprecedented challenges from this pandemic appropriately.\"New Jersey has become a Covid-19 hotspot, reporting more than 2,500 confirmed and suspected deaths and more than 13,000 cases in hundreds of state long-term care facilities. Another New Jersey facility with a high number of coronavirus cases is the Lakeland Health Care Center, where Denise Jorgensen's 78-year-old father had been rehabbing a broken hip. She said she and her brother were kept in the dark about her father's fever for days. It was around then a doctor told them he suspected their father had Covid-19 but the facility had run out of tests, according to the family. They said they only learned there had already been deaths in the facility when a mayor wrote a letter to borough residents saying there was a \"major Covid-19 outbreak\" and that eight residents had died of Covid-19.Jorgensen said she couldn't get through to anyone at the facility until 2 a.m. and was told not to be upset about the letter. She said around eight hours later, she learned that her dad had passed away. A facility official said he could not comment on specific individuals but that the facility has been \"fully transparent in our reporting to state and local officials, accepting of their input and compliant with their recommendations.\"While state data shows there have been 19 Covid-19 deaths at the facility, borough documents tracking coronavirus at the Lakeland nursing home report 21 deaths specifically from the disease but say that 35 residents have died. On the day Jorgensen's father passed away, there is a note in the borough's records saying there were no test kits available. \"I don't know what is going on in these nursing homes, but they are not being truthful with the families,\" she told CNN. \"And since we can't visit or get in touch with anyone they are getting away with it.\"'It feels horrible'An analysis of the limited nursing home inspections that have occurred nationwide since last month shows failures in care may have caused Covid-19 to spread to both staff and employees. The reports detail supply shortages, failures to report Covid-19 infections and exposure to authorities, nurses not adequately monitoring potential symptoms of the disease and staff not properly wearing masks. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal agency that regulates nursing homes, instructed state officials in March to stop conducting routine health and safety inspections in order to protect residents. Instead, they have focused on inspecting facilities to check for infection control measures and investigate reports of \"immediate jeopardy\" situations -- which CMS defines as meaning residents are at risk of serious injury or death. In a review of recent inspection reports and enforcement letters obtained from the agency, CNN identified seven nursing homes that had been cited with the most serious violations related to Covid-19. Around 100 facilities had been cited for \"deficiencies\" specifically related to infection control since March 14, according to a separate spreadsheet provided by CMS.At the Advantage Living Center in Roseville, Michigan, for example, a federal inspection report from the end of March recounts a litany of missteps. In one case, a nurse working the night shift found a patient who was \"gray, kinda pale\" and rapidly declining, saying that no one had given the resident the fluids they were supposed to have received. \"Their mouth was so dry, they couldn't even talk,\" the nurse said. They then transferred the patient to isolation.When the inspector asked why this resident with Covid-19 symptoms wasn't transferred to the hospital sooner, the assistant director of nursing replied that the staff was overwhelmed. \"I mean, they are taking care of so many people.\" One nurse said the patient's deteriorating condition hadn't been better documented because the facility had been short staffed and very busy and most likely forgot, the inspector wrote.The resident later died at the hospital. Though they were still awaiting test results, doctors told the family they suspected it to be related to Covid-19, according to the report. The inspection report documenting the patient's care detailed other problems at the facility. Nurses reported bringing in their own medical supplies to treat residents, such as thermometers and blood pressure cuffs because the home didn't have what they needed. The report also found inadequate monitoring of patient conditions, understaffing and failing to properly isolate residents with suspected Covid-19 -- with a delay as long as nine days.\"It feels horrible,\" a nursing assistant reportedly told the inspector when asked about whether staff were able to meet the needs of residents.The Advantage Living Center did not respond to a request for comment from CNN, but provided a plan of correction in the inspection report -- without admitting to the allegations made. It said that medical records showed the resident received fluids at the time they had been ordered and that employees have been retrained on a number of practices such as proper PPE usage. The facility said it had utilized temporary staffing and that facility-provided medical equipment was being used. Employees were also being \"re-educated on Covid-19 as information emerges and trends are identified, including the rapid change in condition and rapid deterioration that can occur for residents with symptoms.\" 'We can't trust them'Born during the 1918 flu pandemic, 101-year-old Jean O'Brien's health had already begun to decline as she struggled with the social isolation of being stuck in her room at the Four Chaplains Nursing Care Center in Westland, Michigan.Family members worried that the virus would be a death sentence if she caught it, but fortunately -- as far as they knew as of early April -- there hadn't been any coronavirus cases in the facility yet.Then her daughter, Megan O'Brien, said her family learned from nurses on April 11 that the nursing home would be opening its doors to Covid-19 patients. O'Brien, her eight siblings and many nieces and nephews rallied together to call employees at the facility and its corporate owner, as well as government officials -- demanding more information about how residents would be kept safe. At that time, her biggest concern was the virus entering -- and then spreading throughout -- the facility. But she soon learned it already had. After appearing on the local news, O'Brien received an alarming message from Trace Fryz, whose mother was also at the facility. Fryz's mother had tested positive for Covid-19 and died from the disease at a hospital weeks earlier. Fryz told O'Brien that it appeared the facility had not been forthcoming about Covid-19 deaths. In an interview with CNN, Fryz said she first learned that her mother's facility had multiple coronavirus cases from an ER doctor treating her mother when she was rushed there after falling unconscious at a dialysis appointment.O'Brien said the facility continues to deny it has had any deaths related to the disease. After finally getting her mother tested, with the help of separate hospice employees, O'Brien said the family learned on Tuesday that her mother had tested positive. They had been preparing to pull her from the home and care for her in a local Airbnb, and the family is now trying to figure out how to proceed, saying there have just been \"too many lies from the facility.\" \"We can't trust them,\" she said, adding that she is angry at the facility's corporate owners, not its workers who she believes are still trying to take good care of her mother. \"We would have taken her out weeks ago.\"The administrator at Four Chaplains told CNN that all she could say was that the facility was not accepting new Covid-19 patients. She referred all questions to its corporate owner, NexCare Health Systems, which did not respond to repeated inquiries. The state department of health said it had only just begun to collect data on Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes and suggested contacting the local health department. A Wayne County spokesperson told CNN that the facility currently has four Covid-19 deaths and 32 cases entered in a state database but said he would be unaware of any deaths where a resident hadn't been tested for the disease. 'Ticking time bomb'As the virus has spread across the country, government watchdogs have been logging complaints from families, residents and employees about issues similar to those detailed by federal inspection reports.In addition to the many reports of understaffing, PPE shortages and a lack of transparency, state ombudsman offices told CNN they have received complaints about patients being unfairly evicted and concerns from nursing home employees who have reported being worried they will be punished for speaking out about problems. \"Our program has been inundated with calls,\" said Salli Pung, the Michigan state long-term care ombudsman, adding that she received more than 200 calls related to Covid-19 in March alone. \"We continue to be very concerned about the overall lack of oversight in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities.\"Several offices noted concerns that nursing homes were not being forthcoming with information about Covid-19 cases in their facilities. Advocates for long-term care residents said there is a short-term financial incentive to downplay infections since a publicized outbreak could result in families removing their loved ones and hurt future business. An outbreak could also open the doors for inspectors to cite a facility for numerous other violations such as understaffing. In Virginia, state ombudsman Joani Latimer said one family member recently told her office that a nursing home resident had worsening Covid-19 symptoms but was not being tested or sent to the hospital. So the family member pulled the resident from the facility and drove them there, and a test came back positive. The family is now attempting to provide care at their home, Latimer said.She said that the unraveling of nursing homes under the stress of a pandemic like this was a \"ticking time bomb,\" given the staffing crisis that already existed in long-term care facilities. \"Until we fully examine and address that problem, we put our residents at risk.\"Hunter, the Washington state ombudsman, has had the opposite problem when it comes to complaints. During more normal times, the office's phone rings around 50 to 80 times a week, with callers reporting dangerous situations within facilities or other problems that warrant further investigation, among other calls. But now, as visits from family and local watchdogs that often lead to complaints have been mostly cut off, her office has only been getting around 25 calls a week. \"I have never witnessed the phone go silent and that is virtually what has happened,\" said Hunter, who has been the state ombudsman for more than eight years. 'Sudden rush of patients'Scott Wodzinksi, the fire chief in the 10,000-person town of Littleton, Massachusetts, began noticing a sharp uptick in calls for service at the Life Care Center of Nashoba Valley at the end of March -- reporting that his department had responded to the facility 18 times in a week. Suspecting coronavirus could be the culprit, he and other town officials who were attempting to respond to the crisis and keep tabs on the situation say they were stonewalled when they tried to get answers from the nursing home. They wanted to know how many of its 100 or so residents were sick with the virus -- information that was vital for the first responders. A public controversy ensued, with the town claiming the facility initially turned down the help of the National Guard -- which had been summoned in early April to conduct testing and ended up being let into the facility a couple days later. The town asked the state health department to intervene. And with the help of lawmakers, they then sent a letter to the corporate owners of the facility, Life Care Centers of America, the same company that owned the nursing home in Kirkland, Washington -- the site of the nation's first outbreak. The Kirkland facility faces a federal fine of more than $600,000 for alleged failures if it does not correct the problems found. The town's letter criticized the company for its \"apparent lack of readiness or responsiveness to the COVID-19 threat\" and stated that in both cases, administrators \"did not provide adequate notification to authorities.\"Tim Killian, a crisis management spokesman hired by Life Care, said the company is confident that both the Nashoba Valley and Kirkland facilities had been in complete compliance with state and federal regulations. He said the company had hoped the federal government would have recognized that what happened in the Kirkland facility was \"a unique situation.\" About the Nashoba facility, he said the company shared the town of Littleton's concerns but had been in touch with local and state health officials as soon as a positive test was received -- adding that Life Care had welcomed the help of the National Guard. \"To us it's this unfair environment where the public has somehow come to believe that nursing homes are to blame, that this was caused by us and not something that happened to us,\" he told CNN, noting how facility workers had now been receiving death threats. \"It was probably inevitable that Covid was entering our building as it has entered most nursing homes.\"CMS said an investigation at the Life Care Center of Nashoba Valley is ongoing and could not comment further. As of April 13, the most recent data provided by the facility, the majority of its residents tested positive for Covid-19 and there had been 14 deaths.Do you have anything to share about Covid-19 in nursing homes?

(ret) is the senior medical and policy adviser at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research and a clinical professor at Tufts and Georgetown University Schools of Medicine. She served as a medical officer in the administrations of four US presidents, including as US assistant surgeon general, the first deputy assistant secretary for women's health, chief of the Behavioral Medicine and Basic Prevention Research Branch at NIMH and as a White House health adviser. The views expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinions at CNN.\n\n(CNN)As the Covid-19 pandemic overwhelms communities across the US, many of us in the scientific and medical fields can't help but remember the early days of the AIDS epidemic. In the 1980s, HIV was a mysterious, deadly new virus spreading quickly across our country. Fear and misinformation fueled outbreaks. Hotspots cropped up in New York City and California.\n\nI remember the devastating impact of the epidemic at its start: once people who were otherwise healthy began dying rapidly, the stigma surrounding the illness increased, and the government was slow to respond. Without medications to treat the illness, the only tools to help prevent it were individual behavioral changes. My work at the National Institute of Mental Health then was to stimulate a scientific research agenda on behavior change strategies, convene the first National Institutes of Health (NIH) conference on women and AIDS and contribute to the first Surgeon General's report warning all Americans about this new infectious disease.Around this time, Dr. Anthony Fauci was at another NIH institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, working to discover drugs to treat and prevent HIV/AIDS.Initially, the research community failed to recognize women as an important group to study. As a consequence, clinical trials of HIV/AIDS medications and preventive interventions excluded them. We continue to pay the price for this public health oversight: women now represent nearly 52% of people living with HIV globally. The disease disproportionately affects women of color: in 2018, 79% of new HIV diagnoses among women in America were racial and ethnic minorities.Now, we're seeing similar events unfold with the Covid-19 pandemic. Once again, the government is responding slowly. Once again, vulnerable populations -- particularly people of color and the poor -- are dying at higher rates. Once again, we find ourselves needing to modernize our health systems and mobilize the research community to develop effective testing, treatment, and prevention strategies. And once again, the response has failed to account for important differences based on sex when it comes to Covid-19's impact in America.Read MoreMy work at the NIH, and my time as the country's first deputy assistant secretary of women's health, helped move women to the forefront of our nation's health care agenda. A new field emerged to study sex differences from the cellular level to the social and environmental factors that influence health and disease. We now understand how fundamental these differences are to the way an illness progresses and to the effectiveness of treatment and preventive interventions.When it comes to Covid-19, biological sex differences in the immune and endocrine systems may help explain the more severe cases and higher death rates in men. Sex chromosomes and hormones influence the immune response to microbes, and women in general mount stronger immune responses to infections and vaccinations. Studies on mice infected with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus suggest estrogen may have protective effects. For example, the female sex hormone lessened lung damage during a cytokine storm, a fatal overreaction from the body's immune system in response to infection, by de-escalating this immune response. In the same study, female mice died at nearly the same rate as male mice when their ovaries were removed or estrogen receptors were inhibited. While it is a long way from a mouse to a woman or man in determining the mechanisms of a disease, animal studies can help us understand the role sex differences in hormones and the immune system play in the symptom presentation, severity of disease and death rates.Women may also have increased immunity following infection. A comparison of 331 patients in Wuhan, China, found that in the most severe cases, higher levels of antibodies were found in women compared to men after recovering from Covid-19. The research has not yet been peer reviewed, and we need more studies that look into this correlation, which could potentially have a profound effect as scientists scramble to find effective treatments. While biology may be protective for women as a result of immunological or hormonal factors, they experience the devastating social and economic consequences of Covid-19 more acutely. A recent report indicates that women are 16% more likely than men to say that the pandemic has had a negative impact on their mental health. Reports of domestic violence are also on the rise -- which disproportionately affects women as victims -- with some local news outlets reporting a 46% increase in calls to the police in the US. During the lockdown in Hubei, China, police in Jianli County reported triple the number of domestic violence cases in February compared with the same period the previous year.Furthermore, more women than men are on the front lines of the health care response to Covid-19. According to the US Census Bureau, women represent 76% of all health care workers and 85% of all registered nurses, behavioral and home health aides. In some states, health care workers comprise 20% of all coronavirus cases and many of them are dying from this disease.Women have also been hit hard by unemployment resulting from Covid-19. In the US, women accounted for nearly 60% of the 700,000 jobs lost in March alone, according to estimates from the Institute for Women's Policy Research.What's more, the economic repercussions of the pandemic could have a lasting impact on women in the workforce and as caregivers. Our government must mobilize to respond to those hit hardest economically and focus efforts on getting women back to work safely with equal pay and hazard pay for essential workers.Women's reproductive health services, including access to contraception, are also in danger. In Texas, abortion was listed as a nonessential procedure that could be postponed until the governor revised the order after a legal battle. Iowa, Ohio, Arkansas and Alaska have also imposed restrictions on the medical procedure during the pandemic.We've also seen emerging data that indicates the coronavirus disproportionately affects people of color, as well as older people. Regrettably, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, most countries including the US still do not report data disaggregated by age, sex, race, or ethnicity, with the breakdowns listed side by side so they can be compared.In response to congressional oversight, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has now added racial/ethnic data by age where available from the states. However, it should be noted that this important racial data is missing for 64% of reported cases. The CDC is not yet including side-by-side data on these three key demographic factors for comparison. Additionally, there is an alarming omission of biological sex in the key chart of demographic factors.While HIV and the novel coronavirus differ in many respects, we can apply the lessons we learned from HIV to this deadly new pandemic. As we race to find effective treatments and a vaccine, the inclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials is critical. More research must be conducted to look into the potential impact of sex, along with other demographic factors, on Covid-19 patients. It is also imperative to study these demographic factors together to better understand the mechanisms of coronavirus infection, its clinical course and the safety and effectiveness of interventions. In the meantime, the research data collected on the biological, social, and environmental risk and protective factors around the world must be broken down and analyzed across these demographic categories.In fighting Covid-19, women and minorities must also be involved in the design and implementation of coronavirus response plans. It is a cornerstone of helping to curb the devastating impact of this disease on the health and economic well-being of women -- and men -- in our country.",

        "body": "(CNN)Call it your cohort, your pod, your bubble, your squad, or your quaranteam.\n\nWhatever you call it, forming a group to go through the next few months could be key to getting through the summer with your mental health intact.Social distancing guidelines are expected to be in place throughout the summer, according to Dr. Deborah Birx, a top official on the White House Coronavirus Task Force, but experts say hunkering down with others could be a next step as governments begin to lift some restrictions.\"We had this issue forced on us early in the pandemic as we were going to discharge a patient,\" said Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Medical Center.Some people had families at home, but some were facing recoveries alone. Whether you've been infected or not, though, finding ways to maintain (a few) in-person human relationships is one recommendation Griffin has for everyone.Read MoreHere are some things to consider as you think about creating, and sustaining, your bubble during the pandemic -- but make sure you check what official guidance is where you are before making any moves. Lay down the ground rules\"You don't want it to get too big,\" Griffin said. \"Just about 10 people or less. Beyond that, the risk is an issue.\"You'll need people who are trustworthy, so picking people you like just because they're fun at parties might not be a useful metric when picking your group members.\"This is a slightly expanded approach to social distancing that is tolerable and may be what saves us,\" Griffin said. \"We need to prevent the virus from erupting with the ferocity that it did in March.\"One unchecked symptom or one misguided adventure and somebody can get infected with the coronavirus, the virus that causes Covid-19. You're only as safe as the group member least likely to stick to the rules.If and when someone is showing symptoms, it's vital to isolate him or her in a separate room, not let them access common areas such as the kitchen, and especially make sure nobody in the group tries to dip their toe in the water with social interactions outside the bubble.Because many people are contagious even before symptoms appear, if a pod or bubble is hanging out regularly, it could likely mean that multiple members are already infected even if only one has a semblance of a cough.If one member gets sick, \"Consider yourself probably infected,\" Griffin said.Your family can join on with another familyDepending on your current living situation, your bubble will look a little different from other people's bubbles.\"The smallest version of this is two families who decide to form a slightly enlarged social cohort,\" Griffin said.That decision can often be \"kid-based,\" he noted, as children who can't see friends and classmates are some of the most susceptible to the disruptions and cabin fever caused by social distancing and shelter-in-place orders.Griffin said he and his family joined up with another family they know, choosing them because they both have young children around the same age who get on well together.Beyond that, as you're solidifying your cohort or bubble, be mindful about what you might need during the pandemic. Think about who has skills or resources that complement yours or your family's strengths. It could be as simple as picking a family with a backyard pool so your kids can do cannonballs together while you lay in the sun with a novel.You can share movies, music, books, games or anything else that might make the summer a little more endurable. (People willing to share is another quality that could help a potential bubble partner family stick out.)Singles friends can shack up togetherSome of the people most emotionally at risk due to shelter in place orders are single people living alone.\"You can only Skype and FaceTime for so long before it has an impact on your mental health,\" Griffin said.So don't be hard on yourself if you're getting stir-crazy. Expanding your in-person interactions judiciously is perfectly okay. He recommended that singles form groups of three or four and move in together if it's possible. Charles Lichaa and Lo Noulinthavong, two 30-year-old best friends and co-workers living in the Los Angeles area, formed a \"quaranteam\" when Noulinthavong starting bunking with Lichaa.Beyond providing social engagement, it's important to delegate general tasks and share responsibilities across group members so you're not so overwhelmed.One way Li and Noulinthavong did that is by cooking lunches and dinners together.\"It's been going well so far,\" Li said in mid-April. \"We're both fairly good cooks, so we've been able to expand the complexity of the dishes we make with an extra helping hand.\"Find somebody to go steady withIf you don't have a significant other within your pod, and want a quaran-sweetie to drink quarantinis with, this is the time to commit. Illicit adventures out to look for a special someone are one of the surest ways to burst the bubble and undermine the whole concept.\"If you have a boyfriend or girlfriend, they should be in the same cohort,\" Griffin said. And during the pandemic, monogamy is essential.\"For public health reasons, that's the model we have to go with,\" Griffin said. \"Dating is a tremendous way for this to spread.\"Embrace new forms of social organizationIn a new paper, sociologists at Oxford University explain that the quarantine bubbles work because of what they term a \"network approach\" to social distancing.Viruses spread when people infect others in their network. So they argue society can work to flatten the rising curve of new infections if people keep distance between groups of individuals. It's the same logic just as preventing the spread of coronavirus by limiting interactions between individuals themselves.\"There must be a middle ground between all of us staying at home and all of us meeting the people we want in the ways we want to,\" said Per Block, the study's lead author and a sociology research lecturer at Oxford. \"Our main aim here is to give people guidance on how they can structure their social surroundings so that hopefully in a year's time we are there, and not that people at some point just give up completely on social distancing, and that we are back in a second wave by the end of the year and have to start this whole staying at home business all over again.\"\n\nCNN's Saba Hamedy and Angela Dewan contributed to this story.",

        "body": "(CNN)Dr. Ami Mac was hospitalized in March with symptoms identical to Covid-19.\n\nThe 44-year-old doctor in Palo Alto, California, has an underlying immune deficiency, but has \"never had shortness of breath before,\" she said. Her test came back negative for coronavirus. But whatever has been plaguing her, Covid-19 or some other respiratory condition, resulted in two trips to the hospital. She's nervous about her future during the pandemic, and she recently contacted her friends to discuss her own end-of-life decisions, she said. In the past, she's had these kinds of discussions with patients many times.\"We don't want to want to feel guilty for making those decisions for them. It breaks families apart,\" Mac said. \"It's kind of silly for me not to have prepared with all the things I've seen.\"Read MoreNow she feels the need to confront the questions herself, and she's appointing her parents to make decisions on her behalf should she become unable to do so.Mac's conversations with those close to her parallels those of frontline health workers, patients and their families, and really, anyone who thinks the pandemic could affect them. Many more people have been forced to think about their own mortality sooner than they would have imagined.On April 30, her 44th birthday, she called an attorney about creating an advance directive and a will. \"I'm planning on moving forward with having that drafted and properly managed,\" Mac said.These life-or-death decisions are marked by a sea of of medical and legal paperwork. Here's what you need to know in order to start putting your plan in place.There's a spike in people writing out their wills\"People know now they need these documents,\" said Renee Fry, founder and CEO of Gentreo, a company that enables people to create and store a number of critical legal documents, including those that appoint health care proxies, delineate advance directives and spell out a last will and testament.She said that amid the pandemic, the platform has recently seen a 223% increase in the past month in users creating paying memberships.On top of that, users' age distribution has \"changed dramatically,\" she said. Prior to the pandemic, a typical user creating a will and other documents was between 50 and 67 years old. Now new sign ups come from \"across the age spectrum,\" ranging from ages 28 to 72.In this time of social distancing, she and her colleagues frequently field questions about whether documents can be witnessed remotely. Many states have emergency orders allowing people to witness documents electronically, or deeming estate planning an essential service.\"People don't fully appreciate what failure to be plan would mean for them,\" said Mary Kate D'Souza, Gentreo's chief legal officer. \"It can create a legal morass that you're just not prepared for.\"It's a time to have meaningful conversations with loved onesThe most important thing, experts noted, is that if you're apprehensive about end-of-life planning, you don't have to get everything perfect on the first go. You have every opportunity to come back to these documents as often as you need or want to in order to make adjustments.It could be at major life milestones, including your wedding, the birth of a child, a divorce or a new diagnosis. It could also be an annual check-in.\"The joy and meaning and purpose of it is to talk about it with your loved ones,\" said Adam Hayden, a 38-year-old philosopher living with brain cancer. \"This is an act of love.\"Hayden frequently writes and speaks around the country about the need to confront the most essential end-of-life questions.At age 34, he was diagnosed with glioblastoma, which carries with it a 15- to 18-month median survival time. Each year since then with his wife and three kids has been a blessing. \"I will happily update my documents each year,\" he said.For many, end-of-life planning can feel morbid. To ease the awkwardness, the Coda Alliance, a group that seeks to empower people to take ownership of end-of-life conversations, created a \"Go Wish\" card game for families to play together.Another way to ease into the conversation is with the Five Wishes workbook, which helps structure necessary decisions on one's physical, emotional, mental and spiritual needs. Appointing a health care proxyThe first step is to appoint a health care proxy, someone who can make decisions or sign documents for you if you become incapacitated.It's imperative that you have someone you trust who can do those things for you, said Liz Salmi, who herself has been living with brain cancer for 12 years. At age 29, she appointed her boyfriend of one year (now her husband) to be her decision maker while she was being wheeled into an emergency brain surgery.\"The hardest part is the health care proxy,\" Salmi said. \"When you're young, you don't think about these things. But families can be torn apart by what happens.\"In appointing your personal proxy, you need someone whose values are aligned with your own. If you want to be taken off a respirator or a feeding tube, you need someone who can strongly advocate that position for you if you reach a point when you can't.Salmi's advance directive gives concrete examples.\"CPR won't cure brain cancer,\" she said, so she rules out lifesaving measures in some circumstances. On the other hand, \"If I fall into a frozen lake, I would be OK with CPR.\"Salmi has worked in the health care field, focusing on palliative care and electronic health records. Coupled with her own experience as a chronic cancer patient, she's spent more than a decade thinking deeply about how to get these questions right.After examining dozens of examples, Salmi ultimately made her own advance directive and put it on her website for anyone to see. And she pointed to the American Bar Association's website as another resource for finding estate planning forms focused on health care proxies and advance directives.\"It's not a medical document,\" Salmi said. \"It's a quasi-legal document.\" She recommended that people keep a hard copy and their own electronic copy of their documents, because they don't automatically transfer in electronic health records.Outside of health care settings, you'll need a power of attorney document, which would enable a friend or loved one to make financial and legal decisions on your behalf.Beyond managing your bank accounts and property, it's now increasingly important to think about how someone will manage your digital footprint after you die.\"I want my LinkedIn page deleted,\" Salmi said. And when the time comes, she wants her Facebook page turned into a memorial page.Creating your advance directiveYour advance directive spells out your wishes on whether doctors should try to resuscitate you or keep you alive if you're at the edge of death. For Covid-19, that might specifically include guidance about ventilators and assistance with breathing. More broadly, that can also address such concerns as artificial nutrition and hydration.It's impossible to know which health care decisions you or a proxy will be forced to make in the future, especially if you're young and healthy. But Hayden's and Salmi's experiences living near the shadow of death help light the way.The advance directive is the \"shortest way to guarantee what (someone wants) will happen with their treatment,\" Hayden said.He explained that legal experts commonly prepare power of attorney documents, rather than medical experts. But based on his years of living through the complex technical aspects of a terminal diagnosis, he advised people creating advance directives now to talk about their documents with their doctors as well.\"Even if you think you're providing the support you think you need, it may not be useful in a medical context,\" Hayden said. He appointed his wife as his proxy, but his guidance is that she can make the decisions in partnership with a physician, because the intricacies of brain tumors can't always be predicted in a standard legal contract.Failing to create a plan not only subverts your own wishes. It can cause pain years after your death in those you love as they fight about the right thing to do. In the absence of a formulated plan, many families are at risk of fracturing on divisive questions about whether or not a family member should receive certain lifesaving treatments or whether doctors should use measures to prolong someone's life.Facing the decisionBack in Palo Alto, Mac is leveraging her experiences as a physician into making all these decisions for herself, should things go downhill for her. Prior to entering into biomedical research at Stanford University, she treated patients in a Detroit hospital, where she frequently saw young people who had been in car accidents or who suffered gunshot wounds as a result of gang violence. They hadn't always identified someone to make decisions on their behalf.\"It's kind of silly of me to not have prepared with all the things I've seen,\" she said. \"I told my parents I need to get this handled.\"Following her flu and respiratory episodes recently in the emergency room, she's been experiencing new neurological symptoms, including dystonia, a movement disorder. And whether or not her breathing issues were a false negative for Covid-19, she's still worried about her body's inability to create certain immune cells.As she ventures further into the unknown, though, Mac can have some assurance that others with chronic diseases have had to stare down these demons and learn that the decisions can actually create peace in the midst of this present global chaos.\"Now is the time to start having these conversations,\" Salmi said. \"Use what's happening in the news as a trigger.\"",

        "body": "Critics said the flu kills more than coronavirus. Why that's not a fair comparison -- and now, it's not even true\n\nStory by Holly Yan, CNN\n\nAnimations by Jessi Esparza, CNN\n\nUpdated 1129 GMT (1929 HKT) May 1, 2020\n\n(CNN)It's a popular argument heard at protests denouncing state shutdowns, fueled by those who say news outlets are overreacting to coronavirus:\n\nThe flu kills more people than coronavirus. Why shut down the economy for this? But the US death toll from coronavirus this year has exceeded 62,000, surpassing the high-end estimate for flu deaths since October. And coronavirus has killed at a much faster rate than the flu, claiming all those lives in just three months.Here are several reasons why coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu -- and why extra precautions are needed:Coronavirus is much more contagious than the flu Read MoreResearch shows a person with the flu infects an average of about 1.28 other people.But a person with novel coronavirus infects an average of about 2 to 3 other people. And this coronavirus is so new, it's not clear whether it would dissipate in summer, or by how much. But the fact that it kept spreading in the Southern Hemisphere during its summer months suggests warm weather won't slow its spread.Coronavirus has killed at a much faster rateFrom October 2019 to early April 2020, the flu killed an estimated 24,000 to 62,000 people in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those numbers are preliminary, and the CDC said it stopped updating its preliminary estimates for this flu season on April 4. If 62,000 people died from the flu between October 1 and April 4, that means the US had an average of about 331 flu deaths a day.By contrast, coronavirus killed more than 62,850 people in the US from the first known death in February through the end of April.So from February 6 through April 30, an average of more than 739 people died per day from coronavirus in the US.Coronavirus can be spread for many days without symptomsWith the flu, the incubation period is relatively short. People typically start feeling sick one to four days after infection, with symptoms often showing up within two days, the CDC says. That means people who get sick from the flu will know they're sick fairly soon and will likely stay home, avoiding contact with others.But the incubation period with coronavirus is about three to 14 days, and \"symptoms typically appear within four or five days after exposure,\" according to Harvard Medical School.\"We know that a person with COVID-19 may be contagious 48 to 72 hours before starting to experience symptoms,\" Harvard experts write. \"Emerging research suggests that people may actually be most likely to spread the virus to others during the 48 hours before they start to experience symptoms.\"If true, Harvard said, \"this strengthens the case for face masks, physical distancing, and contact tracing, all of which can help reduce the risk that someone who is infected but not yet contagious may unknowingly infect others.\" It's easy for asymptomatic carriers to infect others, said Anne Rimoin, an epidemiology professor at UCLA's School of Public Health.\"When you speak, sometimes you'll spit a little bit,\" she said. \"You'll rub your nose. You'll touch your mouth. You'll rub your eyes. And then you'll touch other surfaces, and then you will be spreading virus if you are infected and shedding asymptomatically.\"You can get a flu vaccine but not a coronavirus vaccineExperts say the number of flu deaths could be drastically reduced if more people got flu shots. Even if you get a flu vaccine and later catch the flu, the symptoms are usually less severe. Yet about half of Americans don't get vaccinated, including most children who die from the flu.But with coronavirus, there's no option to get a vaccine. At the earliest, it'll be months before a coronavirus vaccine might become publicly available.",

        "body": "(CNN)For months, parents have been counting their blessings amid reports that the novel coronavirus generally seemed to spare children.\n\nAs the outbreak spread to the US, data from Chinese health officials showed children did not seem to be catching the virus in the same numbers as adults. If they did, they were not developing severe symptoms.Now, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is warning of disturbing signs that that may not be entirely true.A 5-year-old boy in New York City died Thursday from coronavirus-related complications, Cuomo said in a press conference Friday afternoon, adding that the state's health department is investigating \"several other cases that present similar circumstances.\"\"This would be really painful news and would open up an entirely different chapter, because I can't tell you how many people I spoke to who took peace and solace in the fact that children were not getting infected,\" Cuomo said. \"We thought children could be vehicles of transmission ... but we didn't think children would suffer from it.\" Read MoreThe governor didn't name the child.But the boy's death comes as New York state is seeing evidence that coronavirus can cause severe illness in children, Cuomo said.There are 73 pediatric patients across the state who display symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome, Cuomo said. \"We were led to believe that the good news about this virus was that it doesn't affect children ... now we have a new issue that we're looking at, which is something we're just investigating now,\" he said.Health officials believe it may be linkedIn an advisory sent to health care providers earlier this week, state officials said dozens of children in New York have been hospitalized with a condition doctors described as \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\"New York City had alerted Monday that 15 patients between 2 and 15 were hospitalized over the past three weeks with the Covid-related syndrome. Most of them tested positive for coronavirus or had positive antibody tests.Some of the children had persistent fever, toxic shock syndrome, and features similar to Kawasaki disease, the state health advisory said.Kawasaki disease causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart. While it's usually treatable and most children recover without serious problems, it can also be deadly. It mainly affects children under 5.Symptoms include a high temperature lasting over five days along with a rash, swollen neck glands, dry cracked lips, swelling of the hands and feet, and redness in both eyes.Not just New YorkThe Kawasaki-like symptoms have appeared in children elsewhere. Seattle has reported a case along with a team at Stanford Children's Hospital in California.In the UK, pediatric specialists recently warned that a few children were becoming ill with the rare syndrome that could be linked to coronavirus. Experts there said abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac inflammation are common in those cases.Similar cases have been reported in Italy and Spain.Hospitalizations flat A total of 216 people across New York state died from coronavirus Thursday, Cuomo said in a press conference Friday afternoon, referring to the statistic as the \"most important and also the most painful.\"The number of new COVID hospitalizations has been flat over the past few days, he said.\"We would have hoped to see a steady, sharp decline in those numbers ... that's not what's happening, it's more flattening out.\"Overall hospitalization and intubation rates are down, Cuomo said.\n\nCNN's Mallory Simon, Jamie Gumbrecht, Joe Sutton, Faith Karimi and Hollie Silverman contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Cyclone Amphan made landfall in eastern India on Wednesday afternoon local time and began sweeping north, leaving at least 12 dead and destroying thousands of homes just over the border in Bangladesh.\n\nThe cyclone hit land near Sagar Island in West Bengal, India, at around 5 p.m. local time Wednesday (7.30 a.m. ET) and began tracking north toward the Indian city of Kolkata, home to approximately 14 million people, with wind speeds of up to 160 kph (100 mph), according to data from the US Joint Typhoon Warning Center. The state of West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said at least 12 people had died in eastern India, with one young girl in the Howrah district dying after a wall from her house collapsed. Banerjee added that the other deaths occurred in North and South 24 Parganas districts, but was unable to provide any further details.She said the disaster was bigger than Covid-19, adding that it would take \"three to four days to assess the damage.\"Read More\"The whole of the southern part of the state has been affected. We are shocked,\" the chief minister said Wednesday at a news conference.\"The cyclone has affected the electricity supply and destroyed many houses, bridges and embankments,\" she added.According to Banerjee, about 500,000 people have been evacuated to shelters by the state administration. Efforts to evacuate millions of people in India and Bangladesh have been complicated by the coronavirus pandemic, as relief teams grapple with how to get people to safety while also protecting them against the risk of Covid-19. Bangladesh Oxfam director, Dipankar Datta, told CNN's Hala Gorani during an interview on Wednesday that thousands of makeshift homes in Bangladesh have been uprooted due to the cyclone.He said that he did not expect the storm to hit the refugee camp in Cox's Bazar, which is home to nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees and has been a source of concern to aid workers after Covid-19 cases were identified there last week.Amphan became the strongest storm ever recorded in the Bay of Bengal on Monday night, but has since weakened into the equivalent of a strong Category 2 Atlantic hurricane. The storm could still wreak devastation, however. Its cloud field is 2,800 kilometers (1,740 miles) long from tip to tail -- that's the equivalent of the distance from Lisbon to Warsaw. There's also a risk of powerful storm surges of up to 5 meters (16.4 feet), that could inundate low-lying coastal areas and be catastrophic for millions of people. In the areas under threat from the cyclone many villagers live in temporary homes with thatched or tin roofs.Heavy rain is also likely to lead to flash flooding across the region through Thursday morning. The storm is expected to weaken significantly as it continues to push inland across eastern India and Bangladesh and dissipate by Friday. Up to 33.6 million people in India could be exposed to the storm's powerful winds, according to the US Pacific Disaster Center (PDC). In Bangladesh, 8 million could be in its path, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) said.On Wednesday, Bangladesh raised its cyclone warning for the port towns of Mongla and Payra, which are in the storm's path, and 11 districts to danger signal 10 -- its second highest alert level. Meanwhile, the Indian Coast Guard has deployed 20 disaster relief teams along the country's eastern coast to carry out search and rescue operations at short notice, a spokesperson for India's Ministry of Defence said on Twitter.Since Amphan is a large storm and spent multiple days at the equivalent of a Category 3 to 5 strength, the surge will be more significant than that of a typical Category 2 storm when it hits, meteorologists predict. The U-shape of the coastline around the Bay of Bengal and the low-lying delta region make the area prone to storm surge flooding.Before it weakened on Wednesday, Amphan became just the second super cyclone to hit the Bay of Bengal since records began. During the last super cyclone in 1999, nearly 15,000 villages were affected and almost 10,000 people were killed.Mass evacuations underwayRelief teams are rushing to evacuate people in low-lying coastal areas in both India and Bangladesh.By Wednesday, Bangladesh had evacuated 2.4 million people, according to Enamur Rahaman, the State Minister for Disaster Management and Relief, who said evacuees from coastal areas would be relocated more than 12,000 cyclone shelters.The Bangladesh Disaster Management Ministry said there is capacity nationwide for 9.1 million people to be safety housed in cyclone shelters while maintaining social distancing, as thousands of schools and government buildings are used for this purpose.\"(The government has) increased the evacuation shelter capacity, so that people can be taken to these shelters and ensure the physical distance,\" said Achala Navaratne, spokesperson for the American Red Cross in Bangladesh.\"They have also asked people to come with their own masks, make sure that if there are people that are showing any symptoms then to make sure they are in different shelters, not in the same shelters as the others.\"In India, by Wednesday morning, more than 430,000 people had been evacuated in the states of Odisha and West Bengal states, according to India's National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF). In West Bengal cyclone shelters can normally house 500,000 people, according to the NDRF, but because of social distancing rules, that number had been reduced by more than half to just 200,000.Fishermen have been warned to remain onshore and not sail out for the next 24 hours by the Indian Meteorological Department.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the country's emergency response measures on Monday night, ahead of the storm's landfall in India. After the meeting, Modi said on his official Twitter account that evacuation plans had been discussed, as well as other emergency response measures. \"I pray for everyone's safety and assure all possible support from the Central Government,\" he said.Coronavirus pandemicThe storm comes as India and Bangladesh struggle to bring local coronavirus outbreaks under control. India passed more than 100,000 confirmed infections on Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University, and recorded its largest single-day spike on Wednesday with 5,611 new cases.Meanwhile, Bangladesh's infection count is rapidly rising, with more than 1,300 new cases on Sunday, its biggest rise to date. In total, the country has recorded 23,870 confirmed infections, according to Johns Hopkins. The countries will face as a double challenge, as emergency workers have to carry out difficult work with masks, gloves and visors, evacuating people who may already have the virus.Pradeep Jena, special relief commissioner for Odisha state, said emergency services had to balance saving lives from the cyclone with saving lives from the coronavirus. \"We have to strike a balance between the two and evacuate people wherever it is extremely essential, otherwise people are better off in their own homes,\" he said.Jena said in evacuation centers, they were trying to keep the elderly and pregnant women separate from the rest of the population and were working hard to obtain adequate soap.\"Social distancing is definitely a very good concept but enforcing it in the strictest possible manner in a disaster situation may not always be possible,\" he said.Snigdha Chakraborty, the Bangladesh manager for aid organization Catholic Relief Services, said people in the storm's path are worried about how they can ride it out while practicing social distancing. \"They're stressed. They are worried about going to evacuation centers. And they are also worried about maintaining physical distance,\" she said. The problem is particularly acute in Cox's Bazar, which is home to nearly 1 million Rohingya refugees, many who fled violence in neighboring Myanmar. The first known Covid-19 cases were confirmed in the camp last week and with the storm now imminent, the two disasters could make for a devastating combination. Though Cox's Bazar is on Bangladesh's east coast and further from the storm, Chakraborty said the camp could be affected.Bangladesh's state minister for disaster management and relief Md. Enamur Rahman said evacuating the camp, was \"not that important\" as the warning signal for the area was at 6, a relatively manageable level.\"Evacuation is still not that important and [there] are many cyclone center[s] around the Rohingya camps[,] so if the direction of cyclone changes toward Cox's Bazar and Chittagong then they would be evacuated,\" he said on Wednesday.One human rights advocate said that a novel coronavirus outbreak in the camp would be a \"nightmare scenario.\"\"The prevalence of underlying health conditions among refugees and the deteriorating sanitary conditions sure to come with the looming monsoon and flooding season make for a witch's brew of conditions in which the virus is sure to thrive,\" said Daniel P. Sullivan, who works for the US-based organization Refugees International.\n\nSalman Saeed and Abir Mahmud in Bangladesh, and CNN's Rebecca Write and Brandon Miller contributed to this article.",

        "body": "(CNN)Every US state is in some stage of reopening. But the Covid-19 data that underpins decisions about what to open, and how to do it, is all over the place.\n\nData accuracy questioned. Increasingly, facts are in dispute. And it's not just sketchy numbers from China and Russia. Read this from CNN's alarming report on how data in two US states is different:Florida and Georgia, two states that were among the first to announce the reopening of businesses and public spaces, have come under scrutiny for the accuracy and transparency of their reporting on Covid-19 cases.In Florida, Rebekah Jones, the official behind the state's \"dashboard,\" a web page showing the number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, said she was removed from the project and questioned the state's commitment to accessibility and transparency, according to Florida Today.And in Georgia, data tracking Covid-19 cases has come under question after a misleading chart was posted on the Department of Public Health's website with the dates out of order, suggesting cases were declining over time, according to an article by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Read MoreData not shared is dangerous. Virus researcher Dr. William Haseltine was on CNN Wednesday arguing we have to see actual data about the company Moderna's vaccine trials and, separately, about the experimental drug remdesivir as a treatment.In this era, as everyone races to figure out a vaccine and treatments, he said, we're seeing science by press release.Here's an excerpt of his CNN interview, or you can read what he wrote in The Washington Post:\"It is dangerous because you don't know what has happened...\"It's absolutely equivalent to a CEO of a publicly traded company saying we have had a fantastic quarter, and nobody gets to see the numbers...\"Would you believe a CFO with a lot of shares in that company... or would you like to see the numbers?\"Well, science and medicine has people's lives at stake, not just money at stake... The fundamental aspect of science is being able to reproduce somebody's results. You know what they did, you get the same result. That is the fundamental building of trust in medicine and science.\"Speaking of, vaccine czar will donate stock windfall -- When Moderna released its press release saying it saw good results but without releasing data to go with them, the man President Donald Trump appointed to take part in his vaccine Manhattan Project had a very good day financially. But that's a huge conflict of interest. Moncef Slaoui, who once sat on Moderna's board and is now attached to Trump's \"Operation Warp Speed,\" will divest his millions in stock options at Moderna and donate profits from last week to cancer research.CDC vs. White House, continued. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert Redfield's position is increasingly uncertain after his standoffs with Dr. Deborah Birx, of the White House coronavirus task force.The CDC finally released another version of its recommendations for distance (we'll look in-depth at schools tomorrow), but it left out any recommendations for churches, some of which have been vocal about defying the government.Separately, a CDC case study of a church in Arkansas shows how a church service can be a perfect spreading event. From the CDC case study: \"Among 92 attendees at a rural Arkansas church during March 6--11, 35 (38%) developed laboratory-confirmed Covid-19, and three persons died... An additional 26 cases linked to the church occurred in the community, including one death.\"How CDC was sidelined -- Officials at CDC spoke out in a new CNN investigation:Rising tensions between CDC leadership and the White House over the perception that the agency has been sidelined has been a developing story in the media for weeks. But now, mid- and higher-ranking staff members within the agency -- six of whom spoke with CNN for this story -- are starting to voice their discontent. Those six spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\"We've been muzzled,\" said a current CDC official. \"What's tough is that if we would have acted earlier on what we knew and recommended, we would have saved lives and money.\"Keep it cleanIn the factory -- Two positive Covid-19 tests forced Ford to close a Chicago plant just one day after opening it. The shutdown lasted from Tuesday afternoon to Wednesday.The company is mandating temperature checks for all employees and tests for those with symptoms. Trump will visit a Ford plant in Michigan tomorrow. Masks are required there. I'll bet you Trump doesn't wear one.In the air -- JetBlue announced it's going to keep its no middle seat policy through July 6. Several airlines say bookings are showing improvements, but there are a patchwork of airline rules. United is partnering with Clorox to clean its planes.On the rails -- New York City is using black lights to clean subways.Trump does what he doesOn Tuesday, I predicted in this newsletter that in the very near future, Trump would say something completely outlandish.On Wednesday, he threatened states that might expand vote-by-mail because of the pandemic, which he sees as a Democratic conspiracy against him, and he pushed (again) a baseless conspiracy theory involving MSNBC host Joe Scarborough.Which I point out not as a I told you so, but rather as proof that it happens every single day without fail.He could win! -- Trump has a convincing path to reelection, detailed by CNN's Harry Enten's close read of current and historic polling.He could lose! -- But here's an election model based on economic indicators from Oxford Economics that suggests he'll lose in a landslide.So who the heck knows.A new word for the dayIn a press conference on Wednesday, Nancy Pelosi said she's talked to doctors to figure it out and she thinks the President might be a \"confabulator.\"I like that word -- \"confabulator,\" although neither Pelosi nor I are psychiatrists, so it's inappropriate for her to offer a diagnosis.Here's a definition for \"confabulation\" from Dictionary.com: Psychiatry. The replacement of a gap in a person's memory by a falsification that he or she believes to be true.Trump keeps calling people crazy -- Pelosi is looking for psychiatric terms for Trump, but he keeps using mental health pejoratives to insult other people. \"Psycho,\" \"nuts,\" \"crazy.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Deaths across America spiked as Covid-19 began its spread, and many were never attributed to the new coronavirus, researchers reported Monday.\n\n\"Notable increases\" in deaths were seen in March and early April, the team led by the Yale School of Public Health found. This was especially true in New York and New Jersey, states hard-hit by the pandemic. The study was first reported by the Washington Post.Using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the team found about 15,000 excess deaths from March 1 to April 4. During the same time, states reported 8,000 deaths from Covid-19. \"That is close to double,\" Dan Weinberger, who studies the epidemiology of infectious diseases at Yale, told CNN.The team could not show whether the increased deaths were due to coronavirus, Weinberger said. But there are strong indications that they were. For instance, the team also looked at data on doctor visits.Read More\"What we see is that in many states, you see an increase in influenza-like illnesses, and then a week or two later, you see an increase in deaths due to pneumonia and influenza,\" Weinberger said. \"It provides some confirmation that what we are seeing is related to coronavirus.\" Plus, in especially hard-hit states such as New York and New Jersey, where coronavirus is known to have spread widely and infected many people, overall deaths were far in excess in what would normally have been expected in March. \"In New York City, this discrepancy was even more stark, with three to four times as many excess all-cause deaths as pneumonia and influenza deaths,\" the team wrote.Some states, such as New York, seemed to keep up with the Covid-19 deaths. The state reporting of deaths in the pandemic closely tracked what the Yale team found. But others did not.\"For instance, California had 101 reported deaths due to COVID-19 and 399 excess pneumonia and influenza deaths,\" the team wrote in a preprint published online in MedRxiv (pronounced Med Archive). The new coronavirus causes respiratory disease, and deaths would presumably be listed among the regular reports of deaths and illness from pneumonia and influenza. But doctors are increasingly reporting other, sometimes fatal, symptoms from Covid-19, including strokes, kidney failure and heart damage.Patients already weakened by pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and heart disease may have had a death listed as being due to one of those causes, rather than coronavirus. Plus, it's possible that coronavirus lockdowns would have led to a lower-than-average death rate. For instance, if fewer people were driving, traffic deaths could be expected to fall, Weinberger said.So Weinberger's team looked at both deaths from pneumonia and influenza, and deaths from all causes.\"We decided to look at all deaths from pneumonia, or all deaths overall, and see how those numbers were changing,\" Weinberger said.The CDC tracks deaths from pneumonia and influenza by the week, and compares them to a baseline of deaths to keep tabs on the annual epidemic of seasonal flu. Separately, the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the CDC, keeps data on all reported deaths.The Yale-led team subtracted the expected number of deaths for each week from the total number of deaths that were actually reported, and counted the extra as Covid deaths.\"Many states experienced a notable increase in the proportion of total deaths due to P&I (pneumonia and influenza) starting in mid-March through March 28 compared to what would be expected based on the time of year and influenza activity,\" the team wrote in their report.Weinberger's team found evidence that people were dying as states struggled to find out if the virus had even arrived in their regions. \"In some states, such as Florida and Georgia, the increase in deaths due to pneumonia and influenza preceded the widespread adoption of testing for the novel coronavirus by several weeks,\" they wrote. The researchers said their work shows it may be more accurate to estimate Covid deaths, rather than try to count each and every positive test.\"Given the lack of adequate testing and geographical variability in testing intensity, this type of monitoring provides key information on the severity of the epidemic in different geographic regions,\" they wrote.\"It also provides some indication of the degree to which viral testing is missing deaths associated with COVID-19 directly or indirectly.\"Some public health experts have said Covid-19 was almost certainly spreading in the United States in January and perhaps as early as December, long before the U.S. reported the first official death. Some state and local health officials are going back to see if people who died in January and February may have in fact been infected with coronavirus. Officials in California said last week that a 57-year-old woman who died February 6 had been infected with Covid-19 and was actually the first recorded death in the US from the virus. Before that announcement, the first coronavirus death in the US was thought to be that of a man in Washington on Feb. 29.",

        "body": "(CNN)As politicians begin hashing out the next coronavirus relief bill, a debate is brewing over whether businesses should be protected from lawsuits related to Covid-19 outbreaks.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is pushing for liability protections for business in the next Senate bill, a step he sees as crucial to protect employers who reopen during the crisis. He described their inclusion as a \"red line\" in an interview with Fox News Radio. In response, Democratic leaders have voiced concerns that such legal changes could make conditions less safe for workers. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters Tuesday, \"I don't think at this time of the coronavirus that there is any interest in having any less protection for our workers, in fact, even more.\" Major business groups are spearheading the push for political action to limit Covid-19 liability claims. Thomas Donohue, CEO of the US Chamber of Commerce, told CNN his group planned to work \"very aggressively\" with Congress to create a stopgap for pandemic-related class actions lawsuits.The National Association of Manufacturers is asking Congress to limit state and federal lawsuits against essential manufacturers. In a set of policy recommendations, the association proposed limiting claims to instances where the manufatcurer had \"actual knowledge\" an employee would be exposed to the virus and \"acted with reckless indifference or conscious disregard as to whether they would contract it.\" Appearing on CNN, Matthew Shay, the president of the National Retail Federal said he also believes some liability protections should be put in place for companies who are following appropriate guidelines. Read More Walmart is already facing a wrongful death suit in Illinois, brought by the brother of an employee who allegedly died from Covid-19-related complications. The legal complaint alleges several employees were showing signs and symptoms of the virus. In statement, Walmart said it mourns the loss of two employees at the store involved. It also took action at the time to reinforce cleaning and sanitizing measures, the company said, and that the store passed \"a third-party safety and environmental compliance assessment as well as a health department inspection.\"Winning a court case against a company for damages related to a Covid-19 infection could be difficult for several reasons. First, employees or customers would need to prove where they were infected, and that the company was negligent in some way, said Eric Swan, a defense lawyer at Lathrop GPM who works with Fortune 500 companies. However, Swan believes these challenges won't stop suits from being filed. Many cases may be brought in an attempt to force companies \"into a position where it just makes more economic sense to settle,\" he said. Swan is advising companies that are worried about legal issues involving reopening to follow all state and local guidelines, and to be stringent about social distancing and disinfection processes. Also, he adds: document everything. Many employee claims related to contracting Covid-19 will be covered by worker's compensation laws and never end up in court, said Cynthia Estlund, a professor at New York University Law School who specializes in labor and employment issues. Worker's compensation is set up by states to create a standard process to provide cash for people who get injured at their place of work. Employees must prove their claim is work-related (for example, they contracted Covid-19 at work), but don't need to prove that employers acted negligently in order to collect money. However, the level of cash benefit under worker's compensation is capped. Estlund said some states limit the worker's compensation system to accidents only, giving lawyers more room to try and make a claim in court, where they can recover larger damages for issues including for pain and suffering. Unions and labor groups are concerned that any congressional action to limit company liability could put workers at risk. Jona Rosen, associate general counsel for the AFL-CIO, said the union opposes such proposals as they diminish employers' responsibility to provide a safe environment for workers during the crisis. She said the deadly outbreaks among meatpacking workers and transit workers reveal the \"insufficient protections and insufficient concerns about the health and safety of people working in these jobs.\" She added that the lack of detail in current proposals for legal changes to liability made it difficult to comment at this point.The idea of limiting business liability is so broad that, it's difficult to assess the impact until specific legislation is proposed. Lawmakers could choose to ban lawsuits related to business Covid-19 exposure, move liability to the government itself or set up a set scheme for compensation. One potential model Swan pointed to is the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. Created in the 1980s, it compensates individuals who experience an injury as a result of a vaccine but protects vaccine makers from litigation that might threaten their operations. If Congress does move forward with a plan, Estlund said it needs to get the details right. \"You wouldn't want to create a license to not be careful,\" she said.\n\nCNN's Julia Chatterley, Ted Barrett and Alex Rogers contributed to this report",

        "body": "(CNN)Delirium, confusion and agitation may be common in severe coronavirus infections while patients are hospitalized, according to a new review of studies published Monday.\n\nLong-term psychiatric problems after battling Covid-19 may not occur in the majority of patients, although much more research is still needed, the study said.\"Our analysis of more than 3,550 coronavirus cases suggests that most people will not suffer from mental health problems following coronavirus infection,\" said coauthor Jonathan Rogers, Wellcome Turst clinical doctoral fellow at University College London, in a statement. The study, which was published in the journal Lancet Psychiatry, looked at 72 different studies on two historical coronaviruses, as well as current studies on Covid-19, trying to hone in on any links between the diseases and psychiatric problems.Information on post-recovery of patients is scarce at this time, so the study had no data on the long-term mental impact of Covid-19, and only 12 low- to moderate-quality studies on hospitalized patients to analyze, seven of which have not been scientifically vetted.Read MoreIn addition, the study only looked at severe Covid-19 cases in which individuals have been treated in a hospital, and therefore doesn't address the possible impact of milder or asymptomatic cases of the disease.Therefore, the review has many limitations, researchers said. Outside reviewers agreed.\"This is not just because the data is of poor quality, but also because Covid-19 survivors may suffer from different physical and mental problems even after recovering from the acute phase,\" said Dame Til Wykes, who is vice dean of psychology and systems sciences at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience at King's College London. \"They also return to a different environment -- with a continuing 'stay at home if you can' message, potential financial worries and a much-reduced social support network,\" said Wykes, who was not involved in the study. \"These additional social effects may double the mental health difficulties. Alternatively, the fact that we are 'all in this together,' may provide community support, which can lessen the psychiatric effects.\"A look back at MERS and SARSBesides the newly hatched novel coronavirus, there are actually six additional coronaviruses that infect humans. Four of those six cause the common cold.Two more can be deadly. MERS-CoV is the villian behind Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, which has killed over 800 people worldwide since it first appeared in 2012.SARS-CoV causes a serious form of pneumonia that can also be life-threatening. Globally, it killed 774 people between 2002 and 2004. No other cases have been reported worldwide since. To put that into context, the global death toll of the novel coronavirus since it burst on the scene in December is over 300,000 and climbing.In this review, researchers looked back at studies about the mental impact of both SARS and MERS on patients after they recovered, using those to try and estimate the potential impact of Covid-19.Based on that, the study said doctors should be aware of the possibility of depression, anxiety, fatigue, post-traumatic stress disorder and rarer neuropsychiatric syndromes in the longer term.\"The study makes the assumption that it is reasonable to gather together studies from the other two major coronavirus epidemics of the last 20 years -- SARS and MERS -- and to combine these with the relatively limited data so far available about the effects of Covid-19 upon mental health,\" said Tom Dening, a professor of dementia research at the University of Nottingham who was not involved in the review.\"It is probably legitimate to do so, but a casual glance at the paper may suggest that the paper is mainly about Covid-19, whereas most of the data come from the earlier virus outbreaks,\" he added.Those results from previous studies are concerning, said Michael Bloomfield, who heads the Translational Psychiatry Research Group at the University College London.\"Of particular cause for alarm is the finding that a third of patients from previous epidemics experienced post-traumatic stress disorder and it seems reasonable to anticipate similar rates of PTSD from Covid-19,\" Bloomfield said.Why would mental issues occur?As to why mental health problems might occur, the researchers pointed to a variety of factors. Some could be directly related to the virus, like an immune response. But patients could also have \"concern about the outcome of their illness, stigma and amnesia or traumatic memories of severe illness.\"Other mental health problems could also arise during an epidemic, the researchers said, even in people never exposed to the virus. That makes it difficult to know whether psychiatric problems seen in MERS and SARS patients were specific to the disease -- or whether they affected the population at large.\"Both the infected and non-infected population might be susceptible as a result of certain experiences, such as widespread anxiety, social isolation, stress in health care workers and other essential workers, and unemployment and financial difficulties,\" the study said.Rogers said that more data is needed on psychiatric symptoms associated with Covid-19. Monitoring patients for those symptoms, he said, should be a routine part of care.David Nutt, who heads the Centre for Neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial College London, said he's already seen patients express a need for psychological assistance after recovering from Covid-19.\"Many infections leave a psychiatric legacy. I have already had several patients email me asking for support after their recovered depressions have returned following Covid-19 infection,\" Nutt said. \"After the 1957 UK flu epidemic, a number of cases of severe and treatment-resistant depression emerged.\"And then there's the reality of spending time in an intensive care unit and the mental fallout from that experience, Dening said.\"Previous research has indeed shown that rates of PTSD are high -- approaching 50% after prolonged ICU admissions from whatever cause, and especially after mechanical ventilation,\" he said. \"As is pointed out, most people will not develop major mental health symptoms, but for those that do, the impact may be life-changing.\"",

        "body": "New York (CNN Business)As hospitals worldwide face severe shortages of health professionals, people are being called off the sidelines to help COVID-19 patients -- even those with little to no experience in treating infectious diseases.\n\nTo train thousands of doctors and nurses with expertise in other areas such as knee surgery or neurology -- and retired practitioners reentering the medical field -- some hospitals are implementing an unlikely method: virtual reality simulations.At Cedars-Sinai hospital in Los Angeles, more than 300 doctors have learned skills, such as how to assess a patient's symptoms or perform CPR while wearing protective gear, through VR. \"It feels like you are in the room with a patient,\" said Russell Metcalfe-Smith, the director of the Women's Guild Simulation Center for Advanced Clinical Skills at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, which has been rapidly training staff for COVID-19. \"Based on the decisions you make in the simulation, one direction will lead to another. We have [doctors] jump quickly into a virtual environment like this to get them to where they need to be.\" Doctors and nurses at hospitals nationwide are undergoing a variety coronavirus-specific trainings right now, including how to correctly put on and take off protective equipment, how to utilize ventilators that are typically only used by critical care staff, learning new guidelines around concepts such as basic CPR and life support, and managing a diagnosis.Read MoreBut because time and resources are limited, the door has opened for technologies like VR to fill in the gaps. Considering how the medical industry has long been an early adopter of VR, from using it as distraction therapy for medical procedures or even at the dentist, to a training method for surgeons, it's a natural place for hospitals to turn.\"We've found it very valuable to observe a [doctor's thinking] process -- and it's all been done with social distancing,\" Metcalfe-Smith said. \"Because we can't get large groups together right now, we've had to rely on technology like this to give the same experience -- and we're grateful for that.\"The hospital uses software from startup Virti, which provides detailed feedback and metrics on which procedures medical professionals may need more practice with. Cedars-Sinai started using the program in January but rolled it out to more health professionals in mid-March as the outbreak spread.\"We wanted the exercises to embody what is happening in the real-world right now,\" said Virti founder Dr. Alex Young. \"One simulation puts the user alone in an isolation room, where they can see nurses and doctors come in and out, so they can get an idea of how scary it is for patients. It's easy to forget the basics of communicating through the masks, so scenarios like this help with bedside manner.\"The company signed up 70,000 new users in the past three weeks across hospitals and universities in the US, UK and Israel. Typically, trainees learn in environments watched by evaluators and their peers behind a glass wall. In such a scenario, a mannequin, controlled remotely, acts as the patient. But a virtual simulator lets medical professionals practice the skills they need through a VR headset or a tablet, at the hospital or at home.Boston-based Oxford Medical Simulation is also focused on improving the decision-making process for practitioners in emergency situations. Its scenarios range from how to efficiently and safely put on protective gear to more intensive situations with sick patients. In one of Oxford's simulations, a nurse, in the form of an avatar, hands the user a file with a brief history of the virtual patient. The doctor or nurse is then required to assess his or her symptoms, making decisions in real time based on how the patient reacts; they may need to check the stomach or the lungs or make fast judgment calls if someone vomits up blood, has a seizure or gasps for air. Oxford's scenarios aren't necessarily COVID-19-specific, but represent what any medical professional may encounter in an emergency.\"The concept is so doctors and nurses can make mistakes in virtual reality and learn from them,\" said founder and chief medical officer Dr. Jack Pottle, who launched the service in 2018. \"Some physicians are coming directly from medical school and thrown into practice, or are retired doctors and nurses not necessarily trained in the areas needed for safely treating people with COVID-19. These simulations help get them up to speed and feel more confident about it, too.\" Even before the pandemic, schools were using these tools to train the next generation of medical professionals. Some schools, including New York University, Middlesex University and University of New England, have adopted similar programs with nursing students to get them ready for graduation. \"Before we closed for the semester, we had labs open with eight Oculus Rift headset setups,\" said Dawne-Marie Dunbar, the director of the Interprofessional Simulation and Innovation Center at the University of New England. Students are still required to remotely complete Oxford's simulations through a mobile phone or tablet after they learn about certain conditions in virtual class.\"We prefer to have them in headsets because it's more immersive, but many are accessing the program on a mobile device right now,\" she said. \"It's still a key way to teach skills they will have to perform often or give them exposure to high-risk conditions that need to be managed correctly.\"Early clinical research on VR training has determined the tools could be effective in decreasing injury, speeding up processes and improving overall results. According to a 2018 study published in the Journal of Advances in Medical Education & Profession, people trained by VR had \"lower performance errors and higher accuracy compared to those trained by conventional approaches.\" However, it added that the technology should be used as a complementary tool to traditional methods and more research should be done on the topic.\"We've had an overwhelmingly positive response to the training,\" said Carol DerSarkissian, a clinical assistant professor of emergency medicine at New York University Langone Medical Center, which is currently using Oxford's platform to train students. \"Part of becoming a good doctor is the experience of taking care of similar cases over and over and learning from each one. [The simulations] help with new skills and build their confidence before entering the frontlines -- and allow for that opportunity without putting anyone at risk.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Doctors in Italy have become the latest to raise the alarm over a worrying spike in children getting sick with a rare but serious inflammatory syndrome they say is tied to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA new study, published in the medical journal The Lancet on Wednesday, found a 30-fold rise in the number of cases of the syndrome in the Bergamo province of Italy shortly after the coronavirus pandemic spread to the region.The findings of the Italian doctors are similar to the observations made in recent weeks by health officials in the United States. Doctors in the United States are investigating cases of the syndrome in at least 150 children, most of them in New York. At least 17 states and Washington, DC are checking into suspected cases, according to a CNN survey.The syndrome, now frequently referred to as \"multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children,\" resembles another childhood condition known as Kawasaki disease which typically affects children under the age of five. The disease causes inflammation in the walls of medium-sized arteries and can damage the heart. While the new syndrome also involves inflammation, infectious disease experts say it is different from Kawasaki disease. Symptoms include persistent fever, rash, red eyes, inflammation and poor function in one or more organs.Read MoreThe research team at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, Italy looked at the cases of children diagnosed with Kawasaki disease and the new \"Kawasaki-like\" disease at the hospital between January 1, 2015 and April 20, 2020.The researchers found that while only 19 children had been diagnosed with the condition in the area in the five years preceding the middle of February, there were 10 cases diagnosed since then, all between March 17 and April 14, which was after the coronavirus pandemic spread to the region. That spike represents a 30-fold increase in the disease's incidence rate, according to the study.Eight of those 10 children tested positive for the novel coronavirus, although the researchers warned that the two negative results could have been false negative and one of the two negative patients was tested just after receiving a high dose of immunoglobulin, which could have affected the result.The researchers found some differences in the two groups of patients. The children admitted after the Covid-19 outbreak started were sicker and showed more severe symptoms. Six of the 10 had heart complications, compared with just two of the 19 admitted before the pandemic. Half of the new patients also had signs of Kawasaki disease shock syndrome, which is something the doctors have not seen in any of the pre-coronavirus cases.The kids who got sick with the syndrome since the pandemic started were also older, around age seven and half on average, compared with the earlier patients whose average age was just about three years old.The study had some limitations, including that it was conducted among patients in Bergamo, Italy. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a much larger sample of people from other regions around the world.Yet while the researchers warned the number of cases was very small and further research was needed, they said the rise of cases after the coronavirus pandemic began warrants further study.\"This condition might be serious and requires prompt and more aggressive management,\" the researchers said. \"Future research on the cause of Kawasaki disease and similar syndromes should focus on immune responses to viral triggers.\"The findings in the new study appear to be consistent with reports of other children having multisystem inflammatory syndrome around the world, including in South East England.\"Evelina London Children's Hospital has more than 50 children with a similar syndrome and whilst very few tested positive for the virus on swabs the majority of the children tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies when subsequently tested, suggesting their disease is associated with exposure to the virus,\" Dr. Julia Kenny, a consultant in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Evelina London Children's Hospital, said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Wednesday. \"These children have also shown significant cardiac symptoms and have proved difficult to evaluate clinically, often appearing less unwell than their very abnormal blood tests and cardiac investigations would suggest,\" said Kenny, who was not involved in the new study.\"As this new syndrome has only been identified in the past four weeks, it will be vital to learn more about its presentation and treatment, and to establish how the disease mechanism is linked to COVID-19 which has pre-dominantly affected adult patients to date,\" she said.The researchers in Italy, as well as health officials elsewhere, have stressed the disease remains extremely rare and that the novel coronavirus overall affects young children less than adults. Typically children with Covid-19 may only have mild symptoms.In general, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children appears to be a post-viral syndrome, said Dr. Jeffrey Burns, a critical care specialist at Boston Children's Hospital who has been coordinating a global group of doctors who compare notes on the condition.\"This multisystem inflammatory syndrome is not directly caused by the virus,\" Burns told CNN. \"The leading hypothesis is that it is due to the immune response of the patient.\"Most children are not seriously affected by the syndrome, Burns said. Most don't even need treatment in the intensive care unit, he said, although a very few have died. \"We do have proven treatments that we can use and are using,\" he said. They include blood thinners and immune modulators.Burns believes more cases will turn up as Covid-19 affects more people. It's a rare condition, but rare consequences of viral infections are seen more often when millions of people are infected.\"We can expect that each of the epicenters will see clusters of these emerging roughly four to six weeks later,\" Burns told CNN.\"It makes sense that it emerged in New York first because New York had the largest and most severe outbreak (of Covid-19), followed by New Jersey and, unfortunately, Boston.\"\n\nCNN's Vasco Cotovio, Maggie Fox and Michael Nedelman contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Enforcing social distancing isn't easy, even when you're simply trying to serve people ice cream.\n\nThat's what Cape Cod's Mark Lawrence learned when he reopened his Polar Cave Ice Cream Parlour on May 8. Customers frustrated with wait times and social distancing requirements harassed employees. A 17-year-old worker quit, and Lawrence decided to shutter the shop just one day later.\"People have forgotten how to treat other human beings in the six or seven weeks that they've been confined to their homes,\" Lawrence told CNN affiliate WFXT. \"They have no clue how to respect other human beings.\"It's just the latest incident in a string of bad behavior since the pandemic began. In March, a violent fight broke out in a San Francisco grocery store as shoppers scrambled to stock up on essentials. On April 30, a man shoved Austin, Texas, park ranger Cassidy Stillwell into a lake after the ranger politely asked a crowd to disperse. Read MoreBut while there's no excuse for dangerous behavior, psychologist Vaile Wright said it's understandable that some are struggling to contain their tempers. It's a difficult time.\"You just have a lot of people that are frustrated, that are angry,\" said Wright, the senior director of health care innovation at the American Psychological Association. \"Those are the type of emotions that I think lead us to act out.\"What if you're the pandemic jerk?Even the most committed non-jerks can snap under stress. Sometimes, the jerk is you. \"Stress can lead somebody to be irritable, so can anxiety,\" Wright said. \"You're just on this short fuse.\" As people cope with lost wages, uncertainty, grief and other challenges of the pandemic, Wright noted that keeping feelings in check can be hard.\"Things that maybe before, if you felt more emotionally in control, you would have a more measured behavioral response, right now that short fuse might make you jump to acting in ways that possibly you wouldn't under more normal circumstances,\" she said. Wright cited a meta-analytic review published in The Lancet, which found that papers on the psychological effects of quarantine reported symptoms of post-traumatic stress, confusion and anger.\"With isolation and quarantine, the longer it goes on, the more significant the psychological distress results from it,\" Wright said. While the pandemic is currently a fact of life, Wright said taking care of ourselves can help keep an even keel. \"We need to be eating healthy, getting some activity, getting sleep and staying connected to others. We really have to maintain that foundation,\" she said. \"Without that foundation, it just becomes so much harder for us to feel in control of our thoughts and our feelings and our behaviors.\"If you do start to boil over, Wright suggested using classic temper-control strategies such as counting to 10. Other APA-recommended anger management techniques include taking deep breaths, visualizing a relaxing experience and finding a calming word or phrase to repeat.Ready to try it out? Take some long, slow breaths while saying \"take it easy,\" or \"relax.\" It actually works.Once you have a moment to pause, Wright recommended taking some time to think through what you're really angry about. It's likely that your frustration stems from the pandemic itself, rather than the individual you're upset with in the moment. By recognizing that, Wright said it's easier to avoid lashing out.\"You're not angry at the park ranger,\" she said, referring to the Austin man who was shoved into a lake last month. \"You're angry at the lack of control.\" Encountering a pandemic jerk in the wildOf course, losing your temper isn't the only way to be a jerk during a global pandemic. With the heightened risk of infection, simply standing too close or failing to practice proper hygiene can put others' lives at risk. That's being a pandemic jerk, too. From pedestrians who won't make space on the sidewalk to #nomask refuseniks, encounters with pandemic jerks are a nearly universal Covid-19 phenomenon. Sightings of pandemic jerks are commonly reported as Twitter rants, or via heated 911 calls reporting the neighbors for throwing parties or playing volleyball.Etiquette expert Lizzie Post, co-president of the The Emily Post Institute, said that our strategies for dealing politely with strangers must adapt to the situation at hand. \"Safety is going to be what determines our appropriate behavior,\" said Post, who is etiquette maven Emily Post's great-great-granddaughter. Still, she said it's still essential to respond thoughtfully when we see something we don't like. \"It doesn't just give us license to be rude,\" she said. When it comes to maintaining proper social distancing, Post suggested starting by asking yourself what you can personally do to improve the situation -- even if the other person does not appear to be doing his part. If you can get enough space by moving to the other side of the sidewalk or grocery aisle, for example, that's a good alternative to confronting a stranger.Post recommended practicing some lines in advance, in case you do need to speak up. That way, you'll be prepared and more likely to stay calm in the moment. In a blog post on coronavirus etiquette, The Emily Post Institute suggested the phrases \"Pardon me, while I try to keep 6 feet away,\" or \"Sorry, just trying to keep distance.\"In the end, said psychologist Wright, we need to remember that we can't control other people's behavior. \"You getting worked up because somebody isn't doing what you want them to do? That's not going to change the situation.\"Don't be a jerk to your friendsAs some states loosen guidelines on social distancing, there's a new ambiguity to social situations, too. Lizzie Post noted that navigating friendships and communities where individuals have varied comfort levels, vulnerability and exposure requires an extra dose of tact.In Post's home state of Vermont, for example, the most recent guidance from Governor Phil Scott allows for socializing with a \"trusted household.\" That calls for a novel kind of conversation between friends. \"It's totally OK for you to be honest,\" Post said. \"Don't feel like someone else's level of protection or socialization needs to be yours.\" If you want to get together with a friend, she suggested that you start with a phone call. \"The first question is 'Is there a way that either of us feel comfortable doing that?'\"After making your own needs known, Post said it's helpful to make clear that you're open to accommodating your friend. \"I close it by saying, 'If you're comfortable with that, great. If you're not, let me know what you would be comfortable with.'\"If your friend responds by suggesting a video chat instead, be gracious. You'll be affirming that you care about her needs more than any particular get-together. \"State your boundaries, state your comfort levels and respectfully offer to let the other person operate within their own [comfort zone],\" Post said. What to remember about pandemic jerksWhether you're keeping your own temper in check, or working to address a problem with a stranger or friend, Post and Wright agreed that compassion is a key ingredient.\"We don't really know what the other person's situation is,\" Wright said. \"We don't really know why they're doing what they're doing.\" Recognizing that others are struggling can help us cut people some slack, even if we don't like what we see. Post said that perspective goes both ways. \"It's kind of this endless cycle,\" she said. \"You're trying to be on your best behavior, and trying to be compassionate and patient with other people's not-best behavior.\" Wright added that she hoped the pandemic would offer Americans the chance for some reflection, too. \"We don't have to like that this current situation is happening, but it is happening,\" she said. \"Where we need to get to is remembering that we're all in this together.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)A growing number of children are showing up at New York hospitals with troubling new symptoms that state health officials believe could be linked to coronavirus.\n\nIn an advisory to health care providers, state officials said 64 children in New York have been hospitalized with a condition doctors described as \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\" New York City had alerted Monday that 15 patients between ages 2 to 15 were hospitalized over the past three weeks with the Covid-related syndrome. Most of them tested positive for coronavirus or had positive antibody tests. The symptoms to watch forSome of the children had persistent fever, toxic shock syndrome and features similar to Kawasaki disease, the state health advisory said.Read MoreKawasaki disease causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart. While it's usually treatable and most children recover without serious problems, it can also be deadly. It mainly affects children under age 5.Symptoms include a high temperature lasting over five days along with a rash, swollen neck glands, dry cracked lips, swelling of the hands and feet, and redness in both eyes.Kawasaki is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in the United States, with complications that include coronary artery enlargement and aneurysms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While older adults are mostly at risk for severe coronavirus, children can also get infected, health officials said. The new syndrome has appeared in children elsewhere. Seattle has also reported a case along with a team at Stanford Children's Hospital in California. In the UK, pediatric specialists recently warned that a small number of children was becoming ill with the rare syndrome that could be linked to coronavirus. Experts there said abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac inflammation are common in those cases. Similar cases have been reported in Italy and Spain.\n\nCNN's Jamie Gumbrecht, Joe Sutton and Hollie Silverman contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Dozens of Rohingya refugees stranded at sea for weeks are being quarantined for coronavirus on a remote island in the Bay of Bengal after docking in Bangladesh on Saturday.\n\nThe 29 refugees, mostly women and children, were taken to the cyclone-prone island Bhashan Char -- also known as Thengar Char -- in order to protect the sprawling refugee camps of Cox's Bazar from the spread of Covid-19, Bangladesh Naval Lieutenant Abdur Rashid told CNN. Cox's Bazar, home to nearly one million Rohingya refugees, has been in strict lockdown since early April -- only very limited movement is allowed within the squalid cluster of makeshift camps. The refugees now on Bhashan Char were among hundreds of Rohingya Muslim refugees trapped at sea for weeks in \"appalling conditions\" after trying to flee to Malaysia, according to a statement from the European Union. The stateless ethnic minority are not recognized as citizens by their home country of Myanmar, despite tracing their roots there for centuries. Bangladesh has taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees who fled on humanitarian grounds, but they are not afforded any rights there and are confined to refugee camps. Authorities are still investigating where the group sailed from.Rashid says the group -- which includes 19 women, five men and five children -- are not believed to be ill with the virus that has killed almost 250,000 people worldwide.Read More\"They do not have corona symptoms, but the investigation and medical tests are underway,\" Rashid said.Bangladesh Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner Mahbub Alam Talukder confirmed that 29 people were \"sent to Bhashan Char by the Bangladesh military\" where they have access to medical facilities, food and water. It is not clear if they will be returned to the mainland after a quarantine period, or if they will remain there, Talukder added.They are the first Rohingya refugees to be sent to the island. The government has been building facilities there for several years, with the plan to relocate thousands of people from Cox's Bazar, though no timetable has been set.Many of them fled from Myanmar to Bangladesh to escape a violent military crackdown in 2017, which led the International Court of Justice in The Hague to order Myanmar to protect the Rohingya population from acts of genocide. The Myanmar government has denied committing genocide, but has admitted that some soldiers carried out war crimes. Multiple attempts at repatriating the refugees to Myanmar have failed, partly due to fears among the Rohingya population that they'll be targeted again. The United Nations is also concerned about its lack of access to the areas of return.CNN was unable to reach the Bangladesh Foreign Ministry for comment.Uninhabited low-lying islandMoving the Rohingya refugees to Bhashan Char is also problematic. The UN says more time is needed to assess the safety of the uninhabited low-lying island, as it often becomes partially submerged during monsoon season, which is rapidly approaching. On Monday, Myanmar's state-run newspaper the Global New Light of Myanmar warned that an area of low pressure in the Bay of Bengal and Andaman Sea is forecast to intensify into a depression over the next few days, bringing heavy rain. \"The UN's longstanding position is that comprehensive technical and protection assessments to evaluate the safety and sustainability of life on Bhasan Char are essential before any relocations to the island take place,\" said Louise Donovan, from the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Cox's Bazar. \"The UN has long been prepared to proceed with onsite assessment work.\" As of Friday, as many as 800 Rohingya refugees were believed to be stranded on boats in the Bay of Bengal, according to Amnesty International.The group issued an open letter urging governments in the region to allow them to dock on humanitarian grounds. \"The COVID-19 pandemic cannot justify states' refusal to allow Rohingya to disembark,\" the letter says. \"Forcing refugees to remain on boats also poses risks to their right to health and potentially their right to life.\"The European Union also urged governments in the region to \"conduct a search and rescue operation and to find a solution for their safe disembarkation.\" Louise Donovan from UNHCR said any refugees arriving in Cox's Bazar would be given a \"full medical screening\" before being quarantined for 14 days. \"The public health imperatives related to the Covid-19 pandemic and the need to protect people seeking refuge are not mutually exclusive and can be met together,\" Donovan added.'It's like deja vu to 2015'The crisis risks repeating a similar situation in 2015, when thousands of Rohingya refugees were stranded at sea for weeks. Eventually, countries including Indonesia and Malaysia allowed them to land.\"It's like deja vu to 2015,\" Yanghee Lee, the former UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Myanmar, said in an interview with CNN on April 28, before her tenure added. Last month, UNHCR says 30 Rohingya refugees died at sea after a boat \"ran out of food, water and fuel during a nearly two-month long journey at sea.\" Almost 400 others were rescued by Bangladeshi authorities and medically screened and quarantined on their arrival, the UNHCR added.\"The survivors include a large number of women and children. They are all in weak physical condition, many are dehydrated and malnourished and in need of immediate medical attention,\" the UNHCR statement said. It added that there was no evidence that anyone on board had contracted Covid-19.\"I understand there are some boats full of Rohingyas who are not being allowed to enter or dock in the neighboring ASEAN countries,\" Yanghee Lee said. \"I would really like to appeal to the leadership of those respective governments, that there are ways of letting them in and to quarantine.\"However ASEAN countries appear reluctant to take in the refugees, as border restrictions tighten to control the spread of the coronavirus.Malaysia, which is often the target destination for Rohingya boats, blocked one vessel from entering on April 17 after the government closed borders to foreigners due to Covid-19, according to comments from Malaysian Home Minister Hamzah Zainudin, published by Malaysian state news agency Bernama on Thursday.\"The Home Ministry wants to emphasize that the authorities will always be prepared to prevent any intrusions on its borders and territorial waters,\" Hamzah said, adding that Malaysia distributed food supplies on humanitarian grounds, before escorting the boat out of the country's waters.",

        "body": "(CNN)As nearly all US states ease coronavirus restrictions, university leaders struggling with when to reopen campuses are turning to federal officials for answers and reassurance on testing availability.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has sickened more than 1.3 million people and killed over 84,000 in the United States, according to the Johns Hopkins University. After weeks of stay-at-home orders to combat the spread, at least 48 states will be partially reopened by early next week even as experts warn that a lack of social distancing and inadequate testing will lead to higher death tolls. Meanwhile, division remains over decisions to reopen, with health experts sparring with federal lawmakers over testing to track down and stop the spread of infections. And in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court struck down the governor's stay-at-home order, ending public health restrictions put in place to stop the virus from spreading. Universities struggle with reopening Read MoreLooking for guidance on how and when to bring back students to campuses where social distancing is a challenge, university officials held a session with the White House on Wednesday, said Michael Lovell, president of Marquette University in Milwaukee. University leaders on the call wanted to see a \"very clear\" set of guidelines outlining what it means to safely reopen campuses, Lovell said. They stressed the need for guidance from the federal government and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure students' safety. \"It's very, very important for us as campuses to have the resources we need to be able to open the campus and stay safe. And so that includes new protocols around social distancing but also testing and tracking students and others within the campus to ensure that people are safe,\" Lovell said.The Vice President's office provided a readout of the call linking to the CDC guidance from March, which does not discuss how to reopen campuses in the fall. The CDC told CNN it's considering updating the guidance to focus on reopening.Marquette plans to allow students back on campus in the fall. If there are more coronavirus infections, the university will be ready to adapt, including keeping options open on both in-person and online classes, Lovell said.Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House's coronavirus task force, has said schools should not expect a coronavirus vaccine or widely available treatment by fall. In California, most students in the state's two main university systems will likely not return this fall. The California State University system plans to cancel nearly all in-person classes through the fall semester, Chancellor Timothy White said.The University of California, which has 10 campuses statewide, is considering a mixed approach where some students go to classrooms and labs while others remain remote. Wisconsin's highest court rules against the governor The decision on whether to reopen remains divisive. In Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court overturned the stay-at-home order issued by the governor, calling it \"unlawful\" and \"unenforceable.\" In a win for the state's Republican-led legislature, the court ruled that Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' administration overstepped its authority when it extended the order to May 26. Lawmakers argued the order would cost residents their jobs and hurt many companies. The ruling leaves the state in chaos, the governor said. \"Now we have no plan and no protections for the people of Wisconsin,\" he added. Experts and lawmakers argue over leadershipMonths into the pandemic, testing remains a crucial point of contention between experts and officialsA panel of top health experts Wednesday sparred with lawmakers on the House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis over testing, tracing and targeted containment of the virus. \"Testing was the fundamental failure that forced our country to shut down,\" testified Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \"Testing tells us who has the disease and who doesn't. And testing is the cornerstone of controlling every single disease outbreak. It was inadequate testing that precipitated the national shutdown.\"Jha slammed the government response, warning that the nation's testing capabilities are not there yet. \"I believe we need federal leadership,\" he said. \"The institute that I run has calculated that the US needs more than 900,000 tests every day to safely open up again. We're doing about a third of that.\"Republican lawmakers pushed back.\"I'm sorry, but we shut the economy down to flatten the curve, to not max out our ICU bed capacity and our ventilator capacity, period. It wasn't an absence of testing that caused us to shut down the economy. We shut down the economy to save lives, American lives, because of the ICU and ventilator issue,\" said Rep. Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee. Other health experts on the panel, including former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb, agreed that testing is one of the keys to safely reopening society.Cases of mysterious illness in kids extend to 17 statesAs the death toll grows nationwide, officials are grappling with the effects of the virus on children. Hospitals and clinics in at least 17 states have reported cases of a mystifying condition that seems to be affecting children after coronavirus infections. Cases in at least 150 children are under investigation, most of them in New York. The condition appears to be a post-viral syndrome in children, said Dr. Jeffrey Burns, a critical care specialist at Boston Children's Hospital. \"This multisystem inflammatory syndrome is not directly caused by the virus,\" he added. \"The leading hypothesis is that it is due to the immune response of the patient.\"Symptoms include persistent fever, inflammation and poor function in organs such as the kidneys or heart. Children may also show evidence of blood vessel inflammation, such as red eyes, a bright red tongue and cracked lips, said Dr. Moshe Arditi, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.Not all of the affected children have tested positive for the coronavirus. Study provides new details on air droplets Researchers are still learning new things about the virus. A new study reveals regular talking releases small respiratory droplets that linger in the air for at least eight minutes, potentially explaining why coronavirus spreads faster in confined spaces. The study published Wednesday used laser light to examine the small fluid droplets emitted through human speech. \"These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,\" the study says. It's from researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, along with the University of Pennsylvania. The researchers concluded that such particles could be inhaled by others and lead to new coronavirus infections.\n\nCNN's Shelby Lin Erdman, Maggie Fox, Matthew Hoye and John Bonifield contributed to this report.",

They had all tested negative twice before being allowed back on board before this latest incident of testing positive again for the virus.This latest development is in addition to five other sailors aboard the ship that CNN reported earlier this week who had also again tested positive after being thought to be clear of the virus.The carrier is heavily screening crew members for reports of symptoms. Some of the now 13 sailors who have retested positive in fact had reportedd symptoms to the medical crew, the official said.Politico was the first to report on the eight additional sailors.Read MoreThe official said it is not clear if sailors have somehow been re-infected or if very low levels of the virus have remained in their bodies and testing had not caught it.More than 1,000 of the aircraft carrier's nearly 4,900-member crew had tested positive for coronavirus following an outbreak aboard the ship.After evacuating some 4,000 sailors from the ship to Guam, the Navy had been retuning sailors to the ship following a period of quarantine and isolation in the hopes of getting the aircraft carrier to sea as soon as possible.",

    "Emergency doctor: We need help before it's too late": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Tsion Firew is an emergency medicine doctor based in New York. She is an ardent advocate for the advancement of high-quality global emergency medicine, an adviser to the Ethiopian Ministry of Health and a member of its Covid-19 Response Team. The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN)Last weekend, I was on CNN discussing the importance of supporting the mental and emotional health of medical professionals. I likened this pandemic to an invisible bomb going off in our emergency departments.\n\nTwenty-four hours later, I learned about the death of my colleague, Dr. Lorna Breen. A day later, I learned from media reports that she had died by suicide. It was a one-two punch, like she died twice. Lorna had survived Covid-19 earlier this month. As her physical symptoms got better, the mental toll of the pandemic continued to get worse. And so I spent Tuesday, my birthday, mourning the most recent devastating loss of a colleague, a friend. And as I mourned, I reflected.The world is hailing medical professionals as heroes, and don't get me wrong: The public praise has been a welcome shift. Our jobs were harrowing long before this crisis and will remain so long after we return to some semblance of normalcy. I am grateful for the acknowledgment. But Lorna's untimely death is painful evidence of the hidden battle that so many doctors, nurses and frontline workers are fighting right now. A battle that words of praise, welcome though they may be, simply cannot overcome.Read MoreI see it unfold in front of me every day in my emergency department here in New York City. It's not the first time I've worked in challenging circumstances. I saw many tragedies working as a volunteer medic in Iraq over my four weeks on the front line with US-backed Iraqi soldiers. But I never imagined a future where I would care for so many colleagues unable to breathe, presumably due to coronavirus infection.We treat everyone as if they have it -- that's what risk mitigation calls for. I treated a friend's critically ill father and, atop an already-terrifying situation, initiated difficult end-of-life-care conversations. He survived, but the discussions of whether to intervene and how far under such duress leave scars.I hadn't conceived of counseling a nurse I know in my department through despair and helplessness after she infected her mother with the virus. Her mother also survived and left the hospital after several days of oxygen therapy, but the trauma of her guilt will endure and take much, much longer to heal. I never thought I'd become infected myself. To make matters worse, I didn't have access to testing when I fell ill. Fortunately, my symptoms were such that I could convalesce at home -- chills, body aches that turned to an unrelenting headache and then exhaustion -- and return to work a week later. No shortness of breath, no ventilator. Lucky.I couldn't imagine that I'd see such an alarming number of elderly and nursing home patients dying at rates that none of us had ever experienced. I never thought that patients' families would be barred from visiting their dying loved ones; that I would give them updates over the phone and offer up last-minute video calls to say goodbye. How does one prepare to facilitate a FaceTime goodbye?We are facing death at such an accelerated rate that the word unprecedented isn't adequate, isn't enough. It is like nothing any of us could have prepared for. To deepen the trauma, many health care workers were promised personal protective equipment that never arrived. My ED has been very well-stocked, but other hospitals in New York City and across New York City continue to experience shortages. We put ourselves and our loved ones at risk every time we go to work and we rely on PPE to keep us safe, to reduce our families' risk. We stretch to physical and mental limits beyond imagination. The next day, we surpass those limits. And we need help.In Iraq, we provided trauma care under immense levels of stress, often with limited access to regular resources. Prior to our deployment, we received training on what to expect and how to manage the mental and emotional strain of health care in a warzone.Warzone medics return home likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related physical ailments. The long-term risks are real and well-documented. They are at much higher risk of self-harm and are more prone to substance abuse and depression. Now, amid the Covid-19 pandemic, health care professionals across the globe are faced with extraordinary levels of pressure not so different from a war zone. The trauma of this crisis is creating a new generation of veterans of a war at home, each of whom is serving our country and needs our support. But with the current capacities of our institutions, and the cultural stigmatization of mental and emotional health issues, we as a country are not prepared to support them. The unfortunate truth is that the United States has never adequately provided treatment for mental and emotional health challenges, such as PTSD, for brave citizens who put their country before themselves. As we begin to imagine a post-Covid-19 America, we must do better by all of our veterans, including the hundreds of thousands of health care workers who have borne the trauma of this pandemic. That starts by destigmatizing mental health issues and making it easier for physicians, nurses and others to seek out the resources they need. As I grieve the loss of Lorna and so many patients, I recognize how fortunate I am to have been trained in conflict medicine, to have received the guidance I did when so many have not. I am keeping my head down, but my eyes are wide open. Medical professionals are indeed heroes, but we are also human. Many of us are suffering beyond anything we are able to articulate and the weight of this moment is heavy upon our shoulders.Heed our call. The front line of this pandemic needs mental health resources and emotional support to process the destruction we cannot prevent, we cannot fix. The next wave is coming. We need help before it's too late for more of us.",

        "body": "(CNN)A mysterious illness that's affecting children and could be linked to the coronavirus has left officials alarmed and searching for answers as infections increase.\n\nDoctors are referring to the condition that has hospitalized dozens of children as \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome,\" and health officials believe it could be linked to coronavirus. Three children have died because of it in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.New York is investigating if the cases contradict the belief that children are less at risk for coronavirus and what other hospitals should look out for, Cuomo said.Here is what you need to know:What are the symptoms?Read MorePediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome doesn't show the hallmarks of coronavirus in the children who have been diagnosed, Cuomo said. It presents symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome.Kawasaki disease causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart. It produces a high temperature lasting over five days, a rash, swollen neck glands, cracked lips, swelling of hands and feet, and redness in both eyes.Children under age 5 are most commonly affected; and while it can be deadly, it is treatable. Kawasaki is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in the United States, with complications that include coronary artery enlargement and aneurysms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Toxic shock syndrome, meanwhile, is caused by a toxin produced by some forms of staphylococcus bacteria and involves fever, shock and problems with several body organs, according to the US National Library of Medicine. The difference in symptoms could be attributed to pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome being a second phase of the coronavirus illness, pediatrician Dr. Glenn Budnick said on CNN Newsroom Saturday. \"Your immune system is overreacting to the virus, and because these are inflammatory diseases, this overreaction can cause a Kawasaki-like disease,\" Budnick said.How widespread are the infections?New York state's health department is studying the cases of 73 children, Cuomo said Saturday..Most of them tested positive for coronavirus or had positive antibody tests.Elsewhere, Seattle has reported a case in a healthy teenager who developed shock symptoms that sent him to the intensive care unit, according to CNN affiliate KIRO. A team at Stanford Children's Hospital in California has also reported a case.Similar cases have been reported internationally. A small number of children in the United Kingdom have recently become ill with the rare syndrome that could be linked to coronavirus, pediatric specialists said. Cases like those have been reported in Italy and Spain as well. Abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms and cardiac inflammation are common in those cases, UK experts said.What are officials saying?While cases remain only in the dozens, Cuomo is urging vigilance.\"It's still very much a situation that is developing, but it is a serious situation,\" Cuomo said.New York's Department of Health is communicating with the CDC and federal officials over the cases, and the CDC has asked the state to develop national criteria so the healthcare professionals around the nation know what to look for, he said.To understand the situation better, the department of health is working with the New York Genome Center and Rockefeller University to conduct a genome and RNA sequencing study, Cuomo said. The potential risk for children comes at a time of heightened anxiety as coronavirus has killed more than 78,000 people nationwide. \"We were laboring under the impression that young people were not affected by Covid-19,\" Cuomo said. \"We're not so sure that that is the fact anymore.\"\n\nCNN Faith Karimi and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Exclusive: She's been falsely accused of starting the pandemic. Her life has been turned upside down\n\nStory by Donie O'Sullivan, CNN Business\n\nVideo by Richa Naik and John General, CNN Business\n\nPhotographs by Heather Fulbright, CNN\n\nUpdated 1417 GMT (2217 HKT) April 27, 2020\n\nMaatje Benassi, a US Army reservist and mother of two, has become the target of conspiracy theorists who falsely place her at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, saying she brought the disease to China.\n\nThe false claims are spreading across YouTube every day, so far racking up hundreds of thousands of apparent views, and have been embraced by Chinese Communist Party media. Despite never having tested positive for the coronavirus or experienced symptoms, Benassi and her husband are now subjects of discussion on Chinese social media about the outbreak, including among accounts that are known drivers of large-scale coordinated activities by their followers. The claims have turned their lives upside down. The couple say their home address has been posted online and that, before they shut down their accounts, their social media inboxes were overrun with messages from believers of the conspiracy. \"It's like waking up from a bad dream going into a nightmare day after day,\" Maatje Benassi told CNN Business in an exclusive interview, the first time she has spoken publicly since being smeared online. As the coronavirus has spread around the world, so has misinformation about the disease. Technology giants have touted the steps they are taking to combat coronavirus misinformation, but these efforts have failed to help the Benassis. The family's suffering highlights the potential for blatant falsehoods to be rewarded and amplified by social media platforms. It also serves as a powerful reminder that misinformation online, however wild or obviously untrue it may seem, can have real and lasting consequences offline. Read MoreMaajte and her husband Matt are still active in their government jobs. Maajte is a civilian employee at the US Army's Fort Belvoir in Virginia where she works as a security officer. Matt, a retired Air Force officer, is a civilian employee with the Air Force at the Pentagon. Despite working for the US government, the couple are experiencing the same feelings of helplessness familiar to others who have been the target of harassment and misinformation. \"I want everybody to stop harassing me, because this is cyberbullying to me and it's gone way out of hand,\" Maajte said while fighting back tears. Matt has tried to get the videos taken down from YouTube and to prevent their spread online. The couple said they contacted an attorney, who told them there was little that could be done, and local police, who told them much the same. Origins of a coronavirus conspiracy theory Conspiracy theories are not dissimilar to viruses, in that they evolve and mutate to spread and survive. Before Maatje Benassi became the main protagonist in this conspiracy, variations had circulated online for months. In the early weeks of the coronavirus, conspiracy theorists began claiming, without evidence, that it was a US biological weapon. Later one member of the Chinese government publicly promoted the notion that the US military brought the virus to China. US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said it was \"completely ridiculous and it's irresponsible\" for someone speaking on behalf of the Chinese government to promote such a claim. It wasn't until March, months after the first reported coronavirus cases in China, that conspiracy theorists turned their focus to Maatje Benassi. The baseless theory began with her participation in October in the Military World Games, essentially the military Olympics, which was hosted by Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus outbreak began last year. Maatje Benassi competed in the cycling competition there, suffering an accident on the final lap that left her with a fractured rib and a concussion. Despite the crash, Benassi still finished the race, but it turned out to be the start of something worse. While hundreds of athletes from the US military took part in the games, Maatje Benassi was plucked out of the group and given a starring role in the conspiracy theory. Perhaps the most prominent cheerleader of the idea that Benassi had a role in the imaginary plot to infect the world is George Webb, a prolific 59-year-old American misinformation peddler. Webb has for years regularly streamed hours of diatribe live on YouTube, where he has amassed more than 27 million views and almost 100,000 followers. In 2017, CNN revealed how Webb was part of a trio of conspiracy theorists that pushed a false rumor about a cargo ship with a \"dirty bomb\" that was set to arrive at the Port of Charleston in South Carolina. The bomb never materialized, but the claims did lead to parts of the port -- one of the biggest in America -- being shut down for a time as a safety precaution. Until recently, Webb said, his YouTube videos included advertisements -- meaning the platform, which is owned by Google, was making money from Webb's misinformation, as was Webb himself. Webb even claimed that the Italian DJ Benny Benassi, whose 2002 song \"Satisfaction\" became a worldwide sensation, had the coronavirus and that he, along with Maatje and Matt Benassi, were part of a Benassi plot connected to the virus. (Benny told CNN Business he has never met Maatje and Matt, and they said that as far as they know, they are not related. Benny pointed out that Benassi is a very common last name in Italy.) Benny Benassi told CNN Business he has not been diagnosed with the coronavirus. Like artists around the world, he canceled his concerts because of social distancing and travel restrictions. (Webb previously claimed the DJ is Dutch, he is not.) In a phone interview with CNN Business on Thursday, which he livestreamed to his followers on YouTube, Webb offered no substantive evidence to support his claims about the Benassis and said he considered himself an \"investigative reporter,\" not a conspiracy theorist. He also said that YouTube recently stopped running ads on his videos after he began talking about the coronavirus. Webb said he had normally made a few hundred dollars a month directly from YouTube. YouTube confirmed to CNN that it was not currently running ads on Webb's channel, but it declined to say whether ads appeared there in the past or provide details on how much money his channel may have made. A company spokesperson said YouTube was committed to promoting accurate information about the coronavirus. The company removed some threatening comments about the Benassis that had been posted under Webb's videos when asked about them by CNN Business. YouTube also said it had removed some videos posted by Webb in the past.False theories online spark real world concerns While the allegations about the Benassis may be wildly untrue, the threats they face and the fear they feel are very real. Matt Benassi said he fears this could \"turn into another Pizzagate,\" referencing another baseless conspiracy theory that claimed a pedophilia ring that somehow involved Hillary Clinton, among others, was operating out of a Washington DC pizzeria. The fringe theory didn't receive much mainstream attention until a man showed up at the pizzeria in late 2016 and fired an assault weapon, saying he was there to investigate \"Pizzagate.\" \"It's really hard to hold him [Webb] accountable,\" Matt Benassi said. \"Law enforcement will tell you that there's nothing that we can do about it because we have free speech in this country. Then they say, 'Go talk to a civil attorney,' so we did. We talked to an attorney. You quickly realize that for folks like us, it's just too expensive to litigate something like this. We get no recourse from law enforcement. We get no recourse from the courts.\" Matt Benassi said he has complained to YouTube but even when the company does take videos down it can take days for it to do so. By that time, a video can go viral, and the damage is done. Worse still: videos Webb has posted to YouTube that are removed are often re-uploaded to the platform. In China, the YouTube videos attacking the Benassis are uploaded to popular platforms there such as WeChat, Weibo, and Xigua Video and are translated into Chinese, according to an analysis by Keenan Chen, a researcher at First Draft, a non-profit that researches disinformation. The Benassis' experience is unfortunately not unique, said Danielle Citron, a professor of law at Boston University School of Law and a MacArthur Fellow who studies online harassment. Faced with \"cyber mobs,\" as Citron describes them, law enforcement often can't or won't investigate. As for the likes of YouTube, Citron said the law has to change: \"Right now, they're totally immune from legal liability under federal law. And so they can just walk away.\" Whatever happens next, \"the damage is done,\" according to Maatje Benassi. \"I know it [will] never be the same. Every time you're going to Google my name, it will pop up as patient zero.\"",

    "Executive mom: I was already juggling a lot, then Covid-19 hit": {

        "body": "Giovanna Gray Lockhart is the chief strategy officer at The Riveter, an online community and content company for the 75 million working women in the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN)On March 14, it began with just a headache and fatigue. I'm a 39-year-old mom of two small children and work as an executive at a start-up company, so if I'm tired and my head hurts, it's not a cause for concern -- it's just regular life.\n\nMy beloved grandmother had just passed away, too, so I thought perhaps the symptoms were also related to the stress of my life and the sadness I was feeling. That sadness extended beyond what was happening in my own life too as I watched the news of coronavirus-related deaths unfold in China and Italy.While I was practicing social distancing, I couldn't isolate from my family. That just isn't possible. Small children want their mommy, especially when their routines are disrupted and their teachers and friends can only be accessed by screens. They're looking to you to make sense of it all, and your job is to consistently remind them that they are safe -- even when you are sick and questioning the safety of your family.It is also not possible to isolate from work when you're trying to lead your company through a revenue-reducing pandemic. So I worked, I took care of my family and I went to the grocery store. I worked through the illness because I wasn't totally sure that I had the coronavirus. I figured the mental fog I was experiencing was a result of all the stress at work and the uncertainty of how long we would all be stuck at home. As the days went on, my fatigue got worse. I was on Zoom calls all morning (both for my own work and my kids' school), and then by 2 p.m. I couldn't keep my eyes open and would have to sleep for several hours in the afternoon. For me, this was so much more intense than the normal feeling that comes with juggling my daily responsibilities.Read MoreAnd then other things started happening to my body. At night, I would have these intense lower back and leg aches. I had a heaviness in my chest, as if someone was sitting on it. It reminded me of when I delivered my son via cesarean section and the obstetrician said to me, \"Now it's going to feel like an elephant is sitting on your chest as I dislodge his head from your ribcage.\"I developed a persistent rash on my shins and was out of breath when I went up and down the stairs. My fever never went above 101, and even that only lasted for three days. I had a burning sensation in my sinuses as if I had gotten water up my nose in the pool. Then 10 days later, while making my family dinner one night, I realized I couldn't smell the onions cooking in the pan. I Googled, I told friends. I found one article about how some Covid-19 positive patients were experiencing loss of taste and smell, but those patients were in the hospital and gravely ill. My worry increased, but what could I do?I was in touch with my doctor throughout this time. Each time I experienced a new symptom, I would email her. I wanted to go in and see her in person, but shelter-in-place orders meant I had to rely on telemedicine. I'd asked if it was the coronavirus. She didn't think so. I didn't have a dry cough or high fever and I hadn't traveled recently. And even if I thought it might be, without severe respiratory issues I couldn't get a test and there wasn't anything to do except rest and stay home. By the first week of April, my energy started to come back and I felt mostly better. I even apologized to my colleagues during one Zoom meeting: \"Hey guys, thanks for being patient with me while I wasn't feeling well these past few weeks. I'm back now and fully present.\"Truthfully, that was a lie. I was still experiencing shortness of breath and a tightness in my chest, mostly at night when the chaos of the day was over. Maybe it had not gone away? I read the articles about people in their 30s and 40s dying of strokes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finally listed many of the symptoms I had had on their official list. So, I figured I had it and that was it. But my doctor said, \"We need to run some tests. It sounds like you definitely had it.\"On May 5, I had a CT scan of my lungs, an electrocardiogram, a full panel of blood work and was given a clean bill of health. I tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies. I also learned that the likely culprit of my continued shortness of breath and tightness in my chest was anxiety. Now, before Covid-19, I had anxiety, which I manage with medication. During this time, I reached out to my psychiatrist and she said many of her patients were experiencing new and stronger anxiety but that it was important to rule out any medical issues first. If I had not had access to great health care, I would still be wondering. A recent Lean In study found that physical symptoms of severe anxiety during the pandemic have been experienced by 25% of women, compared with just 11% of men. The study also found that women who work full-time and are also mothers and partners are \"more than twice as likely as men in the same situation to feel that they have more to do than they can possibly handle (31% vs. 13%).\" For me, the illness, while working and raising a family through a pandemic, was a lot. And I know that other women are also feeling the pressure to successfully wear different hats -- and then apologize if something fails for reasons out of their control. Under ordinary circumstances, this is a challenge, but things are magnified now.These aren't normal times, so we need to give women the space to feel more comfortable in giving themselves grace and with asking for help.Along with this, testing is so crucial. The fact that many still can't access Covid-19 and serology tests is not OK. If you think that you have or had the coronavirus and you are in an area where you can access a test, I encourage you to do so.And if you are experiencing anxiety symptoms, talk to someone and don't be afraid to ask for medication. Women are excellent at advocating for others, but we need to advocate for ourselves, too. Everything will truly fall apart if we don't.",

        "body": "(CNN)Parents, hospitals and clinics should expect to see more cases of a mystifying condition that seems to be affecting children after a bout with Covid-19, doctors said Wednesday.\n\nThe condition, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, appears to be a post-viral syndrome, said Dr. Jeffrey Burns, a critical care specialist at Boston Children's Hospital who has been coordinating a global group of doctors who compare notes on the condition.Doctors are investigating cases in at least 150 children, most of them in New York. But a CNN survey finds hospitals and clinics in at least 17 states and Washington, DC are checking into suspected cases.\"This multisystem inflammatory syndrome is not directly caused by the virus,\" Burns told CNN. \"The leading hypothesis is that it is due to the immune response of the patient.\"Symptoms include persistent fever, inflammation and poor function in organs such as the kidneys or heart. Children may also show evidence of blood vessel inflammation, such as red eyes, a bright red tongue and cracked lips, said Dr. Moshe Arditi, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.Read MoreDr. Ngozi Ezike, director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said it's a complicated disorder.\"It's a spectrum of disorders, and so in some cases you'll have the individual have coronary artery involvement. Sometimes they don't,\" Ezike told a news conference.A delayed response to infectionNot all of the affected children have tested positive for the coronavirus, but reports from Europe and from several cities in the United States show a link.\"There seems to be delayed responses to Covid infections in these kids,\" Arditi said.Burns believes more cases will turn up as Covid-19 affects more people. It's a rare condition, but rare consequences of viral infections are seen more often when millions of people are infected.\"We can expect that each of the epicenters will see clusters of these emerging roughly four to six weeks later,\" Burns told CNN.\"It makes sense that it emerged in New York first because New York had the largest and most severe outbreak (of Covid-19), followed by New Jersey and, unfortunately, Boston.\"Most children are not seriously affected by the syndrome, Burns said. Most don't even need treatment in the intensive care unit, he said, although a very few have died. \"We do have proven treatments that we can use and are using,\" he said. They include blood thinners and immune modulators.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is preparing a Health Alert Network notification to send to doctors across the country, a CDC spokesman said. Burns said the World Health Organization is also working to define the syndrome and alert doctors so they will know what to look for and how to treat it.\"This new entity has some similarities to Kawasaki disease,\" Arditi told CNN. \"But there are a lot more features that are consistent with toxic shock syndrome, such as multi-organ system involvement and severe abdominal involvement with diarrhea,\" he added.It will be important to study, because the response could help explain why children are so much less likely to be severely affected by Covid-19 than adults are, said Burns.\"Understanding the child's immune response could be a key to vaccine development and could also be a key to therapy for adults to understand why children are able to fight (Covid-19) off so well,\" Burns said.Doctors find suspected cases in 17 statesCNN has contacted departments of health, hospitals and state officials around the country to get a sense of how many children are affected, and where.Some state health departments told CNN that they are waiting for the CDC alert. \"We are working with the CDC on a case definition and are looking into possible cases, but won't have more until the CDC finalizes its definition,\" a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Health said.\"We don't believe this syndrome is very common, but several cases have been reported elsewhere in association with Covid-19,\" said Dr. Paul Cieslak, medical director for infectious diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority Public Health Division. \"This syndrome appears to be an uncommon but serious complication of Covid-19 in children.\"Connecticut Governor Paul Mounds said the syndrome would be trackable illness in the state. The Department of Public Health \"sent this out to all the Connecticut pediatric health systems to make sure that they are reporting if these cases are occurring in their facilities, so we can be able to track it and handle it accordingly,\" Mounds said Wednesday.States reporting cases include: CaliforniaDelawareIllinoisKentuckyLouisianaMassachusettsMichiganMinnesotaMissouriNew JerseyNew YorkOhioOregonPennsylvaniaTennesseeUtahWashington\n\nCNN's Rebekah Riess, Gisele Crespo and Amanda Watts contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)The US Food and Drug Administration will now require antibody test makers to promptly seek FDA authorization, as the agency aims to rein in unproven and fraudulent tests that have flooded the market.\n\nThe new policy, announced Monday, requires commercial manufacturers to submit emergency authorization requests, along with validation data for their antibody tests, within 10 business days. The FDA is also setting specific performance recommendations for all test developers. The agency also said it has the capability, working with the National Cancer Institute, to independently validate antibody tests on the market.Read More The move to require authorization reverses a policy the FDA put in place in mid-March, which loosened approval standards and allowed companies to sell antibody tests, also known as serological tests, without providing evidence that the tests worked. With the coronavirus spreading across the US, the aim was to get antibody tests on the market. But the decision was a trade-off, FDA officials acknowledged, and putting the priority on early access to antibody tests came at the expense of assurances that the tests were reliable. \"We are continuing to adapt our approach based on real-world experience and data and so, as FDA has authorized more antibody tests and validation data have become available, including through the capability at NCI, the careful balancing of risks and benefits has shifted from where it was in mid-March,\" said FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen M. Hahn. \"This has all informed the changes to our policy regarding antibody tests.\" Antibody tests are used to check for prior Covid-19 infection and can provide a better sense of how much of the population has already been infected and might have some immunity to the virus. It's still not clear whether the presence of antibodies means someone is immune or how long that immunity might last. But as companies rushed to market after the FDA's March announcement, it quickly became clear that many of the tests were unreliable. A number of tests had high rates of false positives, which could give people a false sense of security by leading them to believe they have already been infected and have immunity from the virus. Other companies marketed tests that they falsely claimed were FDA-approved or FDA-authorized. Some companies falsely claimed the antibody tests could be used to diagnose Covid-19 or could be used for at-home testing. \"We unfortunately see unscrupulous actors marketing fraudulent test kits and using the pandemic as an opportunity to take advantage of Americans' anxiety,\" wrote Dr. Anand Shah, the FDA's deputy commissioner for medical and scientific affairs and Dr. Jeff Shuren, the FDA's director of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health. The two FDA officials wrote, \"flexibility never meant we would allow fraud.\" By also moving to independently validate antibody tests, the FDA will have better data to decide whether to authorize the test, work with the test developer to sort out fixes for the test or block the test from marketing in the US. If commercial manufacturers who are currently marketing tests fail to submit EUA approvals, \"we intend to share this information publicly,\" Shah and Shuren wrote. The move comes after House Democrats raised concerns last month about inaccurate antibody tests, noting that FDA officials admitted at the time that the agency wasn't able to validate tests that were on the market. An FDA official stressed that all antibody tests have limitations and should only be used with experts who understand the tests. The tests should be taken into account along with clinical symptoms and prior diagnostic testing, the official said. Without those factors, it may be prudent to use two antibody tests, according to FDA officials. To date, at least 10 antibody tests have been authorized under an individual EUA, most within just the past few days, and over 200 antibody tests are currently the subject of a pre-EUA or EUA review.",

        "body": "(CNN)The experience of taking an Uber is about to change.\n\nBeginning Monday, Uber drivers will be required to take selfies in the app to verify they are wearing a mask or face covering before they are able to pick up passengers, the company announced on Wednesday. That is just one part of an interactive checklist drivers will have to complete each time they go online to accept rides. Other requirements include confirming they do not have symptoms, sanitize their vehicle regularly and wash their hands. Riders will also be required to confirm that they are wearing a mask or face covering before hailing a car, but there is not a selfie component. Instead, the company is relying on drivers and riders to keep each other accountable.\"Things are going to look a little different for both riders and drivers,\" said CEO Dara Khosrowshahi on a press call Wednesday, referring to the new Uber process as \"your second first trip.\" Read MoreAs parts of the United States begin to reopen for business, Uber (UBER) -- like its rival Lyft and other travel companies -- is taking new measures as it anticipates a ramp up in ride requests. Several airlines, whose core business has also been badly hurt by the pandemic, similarly have said passengers are required to wear masks. However, enforcement is difficult after the plane is boarded.\"We have put in several checks and balances because this is something that is really shared accountability,\" said Uber's head of safety products, Sachin Kansal, in an interview with CNN Business this week. \"If the driver approaches and the rider sees the driver is not wearing a mask, they can cancel the trip. They don't have to get in the car.\" The company said there will be no penalties for such cancellations.After a ride, if a driver or rider gives a low rating, for example, they'll be asked for feedback, which includes a new tag: \"no face cover or mask.\" Kansal said the company will follow up with drivers and riders when this tag is selected.\"If we see repeated violations by the same person, whether it's a rider or driver, we may take additional steps including taking them off the platform,\" Kansal said. He declined to go into details of how many violations might contribute to a removal. CNN Business was first to report last week that Uber executives had recently approved the new face-covering policy and that it was expected to be introduced in the US and other countries soon. Uber said its policy will be effective in the United States, Canada, India, as well as most of Europe and Latin America.Days after the CNN Business report, Lyft announced it would soon require drivers and riders to self-certify they are taking certain precautions, including wearing a mask or face covering, before they're able to accept or request riders. It is not yet clear when the new policy will roll out.\"We wanted to get something out as fast as possible,\" Kansal said, when asked why Uber is not introducing a similar tech-based enforcement on the rider side. Uber has a mechanism for drivers, Kansal said, because of Real-Time ID Check, an in-app feature that has been available for years and prompts drivers to take selfies to compare biometric information to verify their identity. That underlying infrastructure made it easier to implement the new policy, he said, noting that the mask selfie doesn't replace ID check. In some cases, drivers will be asked to take a selfie without a mask, followed by a mask selfie. Uber, which is no longer running its carpooling service \"Uber Pool\" globally, is also adding other precautions. On UberX, Uber's standard service, it is reducing the number of people allowed in a vehicle, from four passengers to three now. When riders confirm they are wearing a mask, they will also see recommendations to avoid sitting in the front seat and to open windows for ventilation, which is guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.n, which is guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (Lyft plans to implement similar precautions.)In a blog post on Wednesday, Khosrowshahi said the new Covid-19 changes will be in effect through the end of June, and then will be revisited based on local conditions. The company also said it has allocated $50 million to purchasing supplies like masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, and disinfectant sprays and wipes for drivers.",

        "body": "(CNN)Three families are suing a home for seniors in Atlanta after the deaths of elderly residents who tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe lawsuits allege that the home -- where at least 16 residents have died -- failed to take precautions necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19 among residents and staff at the assisted-living facility.\"From what we've seen this is the worst single outbreak at an assisted living facility, that we know of, in Georgia,\" said Fulton County Commissioner Marvin Arrington at an April 17 news conference.Four lawsuits were filed in Fulton County State Court Thursday against Arbor Terrace at Cascade, its corporate owners and management alleging gross negligence and wrongful death in connection with the deaths of four residents, including a married couple. The lawsuits seek undetermined damages. CNN reached out to the company that manages Arbor Terrace at Cascade for a response to the lawsuits. Read MoreJudd Harper, president of Atlanta-based The Arbor Company, referred CNN to this statement, which reads: \"To prepare for the pandemic, we closed the community to all visitors on March 11th and implemented safety measures recommended by the CDC and local health authorities. These continued safety measures include daily symptom screening of all staff and residents and the required use of PPE.\"\"Despite all of our pandemic readiness and heightened efforts, this is a disease that disproportionately impacts the elderly and those with severe underlying medical conditions,\" Harper said in the statement.Additionally, Harper said in an April 20 letter to Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms that after a resident tested positive for Covid-19 on March 26, the facility had \"immediately put the community in quarantine\" and rolled out a detailed plan to contain the spread of the virus, including providing \"adequate PPE supplies,\" enhanced cleanings and PPE training for staff, as well as \"daily symptom screening of all staff, residents, and visitors.\" Harper also thanked the state for its help, noting the National Guard had \"provided cleaning for the community on two separate occasions.\"Harper acknowledged that despite these steps and an additional cleaning by a private company, 29 residents and 34 of the 80 staff members at Arbor Terrace at Cascade had tested positive for the virus by April 6, according to the letter. A post on the Facebook page of Commissioner Joe Carn, who represents Fulton County's 6th district, confirms the number of infections at the facility.According to the lawsuits, staff at Arbor Terrace failed to comply with restrictions put in place by the facility by \"failing to wear Personal Protective Equipment.\" Asymptomatic staff also continued working at Arbor Terrace after they'd been exposed to Covid-19, according to the lawsuits. The lawsuits also allege Arbor Terrace and its employees failed to \"restrict visitation by individuals from outside the facility. Roderick Edmond, the attorney representing the plaintiffs, says family members also told him, \"they saw the staff going in the residents' (rooms) without gloves and face masks.\" When asked about Edmond's allegation and the specifics of the lawsuits, the company that manages Arbor Terrace referred back to the statement from Harper. Dr. Kathi Earles, a member of the Fulton County Board of Health, told CNN after the April 17 news conference that there had been an \"unacceptable\" communication issue between the facility and the families. \"Today (April 17), the individuals who have loved ones at Arbor Terrace received a detailed letter stating what is going on. But this is the first detailed letter that they have received,\" Earles said. \"They have had to call, they have had to speak to the manager directly, they've had to get groups together, they've have to consider going to the media to receive the information that they need to receive about their loved ones. That is unacceptable.\"Kelli Luneborg-Stern, a spokeswoman for Arbor Terrace, told CNN Saturday that facility had sent more than 14 letters to residents and their families detailing precautions the facility has been taking. CNN has not seen the letters.Edmond, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he had known Ernestine Mann, one of the residents who died, for his entire life. Mann was a well-respected and active member at his church, he said. \"These people worked their whole lives and were in their golden years,\" and did not deserve to die like this, he said. \"It's sad. These families need to have accountability.\"\n\nCNN's Lindsay Benson contributed to this report.",

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will self-quarantine for two weeks after he was exposed to a person at the White House who tested positive for Covid-19, a CDC spokesperson confirmed to CNN.Officials will not identify the person to whom Hahn or Redfield were exposed. However, Katie Miller, the press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence, tested positive on Friday. She is known to often be in the White House coronavirus task force meetings.Read MoreTo err on the side of caution, Fauci said he is doing what he calls a \"modified quarantine,\" meaning he will stay at home and telework, wearing a mask continually, for 14 days. He said he might also go to his office at the National Institutes of Health where he is the only one there. He also will be tested every day, he said, noting he was tested yesterday and was negative.If he is called to the White House or Capitol Hill, he will go while taking every precaution, he said.Fauci is expected to testify at a Senate hearing about the coronavirus next week. Redfield and Hahn will now testify by video conference, the committee's chairman, Sen. Lamar Alexander, confirmed on Saturday.Fauci, though, is expected to attend while wearing a mask, a source in Alexander's office told CNN. If circumstances change and Fauci needs to testify remotely, the committee will accommodate that due to the unusual circumstances.Meanwhile, the White House sent out an email to all staff on Friday titled, \"Strong Precautions We Are Taking,\" about the measures the White House is taking to prevent the spread of coronavirus in the wake of Miller's positive test, an official said. The note mostly discussed maintaining maximum telework for staff, reporting travel and monitoring one's own symptoms, according to a copy reviewed by CNN. The memo said \"high-touch points\" in the White House and Eisenhower Executive Office Building, an office building near the White House where many staffers work, will receive \"heightened levels of cleaning.\" The day before the memo, on Thursday, White House staff received a different memo informing them that they would be asked, upon entry, about their symptoms, in addition to the temperature checks required for admission to the White House complex. Anyone who acknowledged having the symptoms may be pulled for further screening or barred entry, that memo said. Neither memo mentioned anything about wearing facemasks.This story has been updated with information about Fauci, Redfield and Hahn testifying before a Senate committee next week.\n\nCNN's Sarah Westwood, Greg Clary and Dana Bash contributed to this story.",

        "body": "(CNN)The first wave of emergency medical technicians who contracted Covid-19 and survived are now returning to the job, armed with a first-hand understanding of the disease and a new empathy for the patients.\n\n\"I was able to be more in touch with my patients who called, because I knew exactly how they were feeling,\" said firefighter/EMT Shantice Samuels, who has just returned to work in Washington, DC, after recovering from a case herself.\"The toughest symptom for me was the shortness of breath, and the body aches,\" she told CNN affiliate WJLA.\"When they're talking to people, the questions they ask put them in better tune with what's going on,\" said Assistant Fire Chief John Donnelly of the District of Columbia Fire & EMS Department, who has also recovered. \"The other thing that they're able to do is provide assurance to somebody and say, I've survived this, you can relax, we're going to get you help, these are the things that are going to happen next.\"And it goes beyond understanding a person's symptoms, said Capt. Chris Warner, who tested positive with a scratchy throat and a splitting headache, but has since gone back to work with the Fairfax County Fire & Rescue in Virginia.Read More\"I have a greater sense of appreciation for not only, what is the patient going through, but their family, and also the concerns of coworkers,\" he said.He also got a stark reminder of the danger for first responders of getting infected.\"It was a sobering moment,\" said Warner. \"You know the possibility is there, but for someone to say your test came back positive ... was definitely unnerving.\"The risks for first responders like EMTs are considerable. Any patient they treat could be a carrier who infects them with the disease. At least 10 New York firefighters with coronavirus have died, and several thousand more have gotten sick.\"There's so many of my coworkers who have fallen ill,\" said FDNY paramedic Aline Bocanegra Reich. \"Me, my partner, many people from my station, my captain -- there's just so many people.\"She is now back at work, after fighting through a tough bout herself.\"I have never been sicker in my whole entire life,\" she said.She is one of more than 3,000 FDNY personnel who have tested positive -- endured the symptoms, gone through isolation and beat the disease -- and are already back at work.It is widely assumed that patients who recover gain at least some immunity to Covid-19 as a result of fighting it off, as they do with many other communicable diseases. If survivors have some protection against getting sick again, that would make them the ideal frontline responders, instead of others who would face a higher risk of infection.But the World Health Organization a week ago warned that it's too early in the pandemic to determine whether survivors really do have immunity. Until that's proven, recovered firefighters are assigned no differently from any other, said Donnelly, who is one of 57 DC firefighters who have returned to work after battling coronavirus.\"To watch them go right back out, like they hadn't missed a step, and I know inside they had to be worried about it,\" said Donnelly. \"It was a little emotional for me.\"And for better or for worse, each one who returns, now knows from personal experience what they are facing. Samuels' partner at Engine Company 32 in Washington, DC, EMT Traes Ceasar, was the department's first Covid-19 case and is back at work.\"My first call was a Covid case,\" Ceasar told WJLA. \"You know, they just threw me right in. I was like, let's go!\"",

        "body": "A version of this story appeared in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here.\n\n(CNN)Recently, CNN wrote about an alarming drop in the number of reports of child abuse and neglect during the coronavirus shutdown.\n\nTo find out more about the long-term effects of the pandemic on children, I talked to Dr. Nadine Burke Harris, who is the surgeon general of California and in that position is deeply involved in that state's aggressive response to the coronavirus. I wanted to talk to Harris in particular because she is in a cross-pressured spot. Her career achievement is bringing attention to the effects trauma in kids has on their lifetime health. (If you want to learn more about that, watch her TED Talk, \"How childhood trauma affects health across a lifetime.\" It's been viewed many millions of times.) But her current job involves a shutdown policy that creates a perfect environment for that very trauma, which raises the question of whether state officials are weighing child welfare with stopping the spread of the disease.One thing you need to know before reading further: The professional shorthand for childhood trauma is ACEs, or \"Adverse Childhood Experiences.\" Kids get a score depending on how many adverse experiences they encounter and there is a correlation between a higher score and worse health later in life. The touchstone for this work is a study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Kaiser Family Foundation. An edited version of our Q-and-A, conducted via telephone, is below:Read MoreZW: I was going to write about how this coronavirus shutdown will mark a whole generation of kids. But your specific area of interest is how childhood traumas affect long-term health. Is that going to happen because of this as well?NBH: I understand your question, but there are two parts to it that I want to clarify. When we look at the adverse childhood experiences identified in the CDC Kaiser study, they include 10 criteria including physical, emotional, sexual abuse; physical and emotional neglect; or growing up in a household where a parent was mentally ill, substance dependent, incarcerated; where there was parental separation or divorce; or domestic violence. So those are the 10 ACE criteria.And what we see is that the more of those a person has experienced, the greater their risk for lifelong health, mental health and behavioral problems. The reason for that is because the repeated activation of the stress response can lead to disruption of the stress response which disrupts brain development, the immune system and hormonal system.Now, what we're seeing in the Covid pandemic is that intimate partner violence is increasing, substance use is increasing, mental health disorders are increasing. And because of that on the one hand, we are seeing an increase in the traditional ACEs and that's of really significant concern.But to the other point that you're making -- everyone's stress-response system is activated right now. Right? And that's for kids and adults.What we understand about the way in which activation of the stress response system leads to long-term health risks, there's one piece of that that's really, really important -- which is that if kids get adequate buffering caregiving, that can biologically buffer that stress response and prevent those harms.And so one of the most important things that we see right now is the importance of that stable and nurturing relationship and environment for kids.ZW: But they're not in school. They can't go to community centers. Is there a universe of kids that's essentially being swept under the rug during during this pandemic?NBH: So, to your point, that is of great concern. What we've seen in the state of California has been -- actually while we've seen reports of all of these other ACE indicators increasing -- the reports of child maltreatment have fallen from 40% to 50% state-wide since the shelter-in-place order was implemented.Now what we think that reflects is that children are not coming into contact with the safe adults who would be making those reports. So we don't think child maltreatment is going down. We think that it's likely following the trends of these other indicators and probably going up.But the concern there is that it's going unreported. So, yes there is real concern about kids being at increased risk.ZW: You're the surgeon general for California and you must have some input into or at least be privy to some of the decision-making that goes on with shelter-in-place orders. To what extent are these unintended consequences being taken into account by the decision-makers right now?NBH: Well, you know, certainly when we're thinking about the remain-at-home order we are thinking about all of these things. We're thinking about the economic impact, right. We're thinking about these stress-related secondary impacts. We're thinking about safety and well-being and looking at the death toll related to the the virus. So all of this is being considered.ZW: What should states be doing to reach kids that are not being encountered by the normal mandatory reporters?NBH: So some of the things that we have been encouraging folks to do have been, for example, if you're a trusted adult in a child's life, continue to reach out, even if it's sending a text or by FaceTime. If it's grandparents connecting in the lives of children, coaches, faith leaders -- we're trying to encourage everyone who has a role to be reaching out to others and not just to the kids themselves. But also to their caregivers who may be struggling.We've also made available on the state's COVID19.ca.gov website a whole series of hotlines and warm lines including the teen crisis line, including the National Domestic Violence hotline, and the suicide prevention hotline -- all of these different resources so that folks can readily reach out and access help if they need it.ZW: You are perfectly formed as a doctor and a public advocate for this moment because you were talking about this specific issue long before this pandemic hit, and now you're in a position to do something about it, at a moment when it would seem to be the worst nightmare for you that we can't reach these children right now. How have you processed that?NBH: Well, I think I try to be a solutions-oriented person.And I'm definitely focused on how we utilize the resources that we have. And so one example is, and I have to say it is actually incredibly timely that the state of California just launched an initiative called ACEs Aware.It's a state-wide program to train primary care clinicians to screen for adverse childhood experiences in both children and adults and respond with trauma-informed care support and solutions.It's one of the pieces that are really powerful. And not only are we offering training and support for clinicians to do this work, but we're also providing reimbursements. So we're paying providers to do this and it could not be more timely. Because right now as kids are out of school, they're not being seen by their teachers or their coaches.The American Academy of Pediatrics actually last Friday announced their recommendation that pediatricians resume in-person visits for well-child exams. So we recognize that doctors and other frontline healthcare clinicians can be an important bridge between kids and getting the services and resources that they need. And our doctors in California are now screening for adverse childhood experiences. So that's really important. And in fact, as a state, we issued guidance to both adult- and child-serving health practitioners to say there is going to be an increase in stress-related chronic disease all the way from high blood pressure to diabetes to substance use and depression.ZW: How important are schools specifically in trying to identify and mitigate these? Is it overstating to say that schools are the single most important identifier?NBH: One of the things that I want to clarify is that while we are training doctors and other health providers to screen, we recognize the role of schools and the educational environment.Everyone has a position to play. And so we recommend that doctors and health providers screen, but educators are in the position of providing the daily doses of nurturing, buffering interaction that are actually healing for kids.And from that standpoint, our educational community has among the most vital roles to play.And that requires our educational institutions to be trauma sensitive and trauma informed to know how to recognize that when a child is demonstrating, for example, poor impulse control or angry outbursts, that those may actually be symptoms of a child who has an overactive stress response because of the adversity that they've experienced.I think that educators have this really important role to play of recognizing that and then connecting that child with family services that are healing as opposed to further punitive or stigmatizing responses.ZW: We're doing this interview and I'm home. My kids are outside. This shutdown is going to be harder on communities that don't have those luxuries. Is this just going to compound the nature of being at-risk, if that's the right term?NBH: One of the things that we're seeing right now with the Covid pandemic is that black and brown communities are being disproportionately impacted by Covid-19 in terms of infection rates and death rates.And part of that has to do with the fact that we recognize that there's an increased risk of exposure. So black and brown folks are overrepresented among frontline workers that are really essential workers like, for example, grocery store clerks or bus drivers, folks who are in the service sector.In addition, when I talk about the overactivity of the stress response as a result of ACEs that lead to changes in brain, immune and hormonal function, that biological process is known as the toxic stress response.And what we know about that is that the higher the total dose of adversity someone has experienced in their life, the greater the risk of someone having a toxic stress response.One of the things my office is trying to understand is whether or not the cumulative dose of adversity -- so we recognize that the cumulative dose of adversity for black and brown individuals on average as a population tends to be higher in part because of the historical discrimination that has limited access to certain neighborhoods educational opportunities, job opportunities, but also because the experience of discrimination is in and of itself an adversity that is also a risk factor for toxic stress.It's not one of the traditional ACEs because it wasn't one of the criteria that they looked at in the study, but we do recognize that it is an adversity that increases the risk of this topic stress response.And one of the concerns is that this may be playing a role in the increased vulnerability of black and brown communities to Covid and the increased mortality rate.So when you ask the question around -- which communities are going to be more impacted? -- we believe that communities that experience high doses of adversity have greater vulnerability during this time.ZW: Is there anything else you'd like to tell our readers?NBH: I think the thing that just comes to mind for me is that when most people think about the impact of stress, they think about anxiety or depression or substance abuse, of the mental and behavioral health consequences.The research and literature that my team has worked on has shown that after natural disasters, some of the things that we see are increased risk of heart attack and stroke, increased risk of diabetes and poor diabetes management, increased risk of high blood pressure.As our health care system is responding to the Covid pandemic, I think it's just as important for us from a health care standpoint to be looking at the secondary impacts of the Covid pandemic -- stress and the increases in stress related chronic disease -- as it is for us to be looking at Covid infection itself.",

        "body": "New York (CNN Business)Just days after reopening its American assembly plants, Ford temporarily shut down two separate factories because employees tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nOne plant in Chicago that builds the Ford Explorer, the Lincoln Aviator and the Ford Interceptor police car stopped operations Tuesday afternoon after two employees tested positive for Covid-19. Then, Ford's plant in Dearborn Michigan that makes its bestselling F-150 pickup, shut down Wednesday. Both plants, as well as other Ford plants across four Midwest states -- restarted production Monday after suspending production for about two months because of health concerns. This week's stoppages were expected to be brief -- the Chicago plant was back in operation Wednesday morning, and the Dearborn plant is expected to resume operations later Wednesday night. Still, the temporary shutdowns are a sign of the difficulty of operating factories while complying with enhanced safety measures put in place to deal with the pandemic.The Chicago assembly plant briefly suspended production a second time Wednesday afternoon, because of a shortage of parts from a supplier, according to Ford. The Ford Chicago plant is expected to resume production Wednesday evening. Read MoreEven the partial-day shutdowns at random plants demonstrates how difficult it will be for automakers to resume operations while dealing with the pandemic, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor & economics at the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank. She said many of the auto plants that restarted operations in Asia have been forced to close, at least temporarily.\"There are three things that have to all come together. You have to have a healthy work force, a healthy supply chain and healthy demand,\" she said. \"It's not just flip a switch and everything is as it was. It's very complicated.\"Ford began screening employees' temperatures when it reopened its plants, and it requires medical tests for workers who exhibit symptoms. The two positive test results in Chicago came back on Tuesday, prompting an afternoon shutdown. The end of the day shift and part of the night shift were lost.\"When two employees who returned to work this week tested positive for Covid-19, we immediately notified people known to have been in close contact with the infected individuals and asked them to self-quarantine for 14 days,\" said Kelli Felker, a spokesperson for Ford. \"We also deep cleaned and disinfected the work area, equipment, team area and the path that the team member took.\"The same procedure was followed at Dearborn Truck when the positive result came back Wednesday, she said.Felker said the affected employees worked in a separate building about a mile from the main assembly line at the plant. But because parts from those employees' building are needed at the main assembly line, the entire complex was shut down. Ford has about 5,800 employees at the Chicago assembly complex. A separate Chicago stamping plant with just more than 1,000 employees remained open. It has 4,400 employees at Dearborn Truck.Felker said Ford is confident that the infected employees at both plants had the virus before they returned to work because of coronavirus' incubation time.\"Our protocols are in place to help stop the spread of the virus,\" she said.The United Auto Workers union, which represents hourly workers at Ford (F), General Motors (GM) and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), issued a statement about the situation in Chicago: It \"continues to aggressively monitor the implementation of health and safety protocols to protect our member, their families and their communities.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)General Motors and Ford laid out plans for restarting their US factories while, at the same time, attempting to protect workers from the coronavirus.\n\nBoth companies detailed how they would thoroughly clean facilities and allot extra time between work shifts to do so. The automakers said they will also screen employees with questionnaires before they leave for work and temperature checks as they enter a plant or other facilities. Employees who have recently been exposed to someone with the coronavirus or exhibit a high temperature or other Covid-19-related symptoms will be sent to local clinics for testing before they are allowed to return to work. While in factories, employees will work at least six feet apart from one another whenever possible, the companies said. Employee workstations will be separated by clear plastic panels. Workers will also wear surgical-style face masks and clear plastic face shields whenever they're required to work close to one another.These practices are based on the experiences the companies have had at their factories in China and, in GM's case, Korea. Ford executives said 90% of the employees at their plants in China, which started reopening in mid-February, have now returned to work. Ford also recently reopened a plant in Thailand that it operates with Mazda.Read More\"Absolutely I would feel comfortable sending my family to work at Ford,\" said Jim Farley, Ford's chief operating officer, when asked how confident he felt in the steps the company was taking.Both Ford (F) and GM (GM) have also been operating a few plants in the US in order to make personal protective equipment and ventilators for healthcare workers. Ford has also been manufacturing face masks for its own workers around the world. Both companies also have some warehouses operating to distribute parts for repairs. Workers at those US plants have also been trying out the safety protocols and equipment that will go into wider use in the US as factories reopen.Employees at Ford's currently operating US plants will be sharing their experiences with other employees. Among other things, they will describe what it's like working with masks and face shields on and the best ways to wear and use them, said Kiersten Robinson, Ford's chief human resources officer. Both companies will also make changes to how \"common areas,\" such as dining areas, are used in order to keep employees apart from one another.GM expects to restart operations in mid-May, according to an executive familiar with the plans. A Ford executive declined to provide a specific timeframe for restarting the company's factories, but said decisions for each factory will depend on local conditions and requirements. The company said it is closely monitoring conditions in areas where it has factories.The United Auto Workers Union, which represents assembly line workers at Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler (FCAU), is asking for more coronavirus testing of employees.\"Our position is that we employ as much testing as is possible at the current time and commit to full testing as soon as it is available,\" UAW president Rory Gamble said in a statement.Additional reporting by Cristina Alesci.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)A Republican senator who is also a medical doctor described on Tuesday how his office could come back to work next week when the Senate reconvenes amid the coronavirus pandemic, saying he could keep a \"skeleton crew\" that closely follows federal social distancing guidelines.\n\n\"If you're willing to maintain social distancing with a skeleton crew at most at work, I think it can be done safely. But you have to be careful,\" Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, told CNN's David Chalian on an episode of \"The Daily DC\" podcast. Cassidy said he's told some of his staff that there will be certain people who will need to come in to work, and that \"6 to 8 feet\" will need to be maintained between those in the office, which would mean \"folks in adjacent cubicles or people whose backs are to each other should not be there at the same time.\" \"So we're going to have a pattern, a schedule by which people who must come in come in, but are still able to maintain social distancing. It just takes some forethought,\" he said. The Senate is set to reconvene on May 4, though the Democratic-controlled House on Tuesday scrapped plans to also return that same day. Cassidy said in his interview that \"there is a lot to be gained by face-to-face interaction, even if you're wearing a mask.\" Read More\"Senators will be able to kind of see each other and have a better sense as a group of what thoughts are,\" he said. Asked about his thoughts on having temperature checks conducted on people entering the Capitol complex to detect potentially infected people, Cassidy said he's not opposed to it, but that he's concerned the measure offers \"a false sense of security.\" \"That's not where I draw my security from,\" he said. \"You can have no symptoms whatsoever and still spread\" the virus. The senator also said that office meetings that are typically done in person will need to be conducted virtually. \"In a normal Senate, there's always people coming to visit. A group of 20 might come to visit, a group of 10, a group of three, and you'll sit down with your staff and meet with them. Those meetings will not occur. They will take place by Zoom,\" Cassidy said, referring to the videoconferencing app.\n\nCNN's Will Cadigan contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Getting to medical appointments during a pandemic\n\nBy Katia Hetter, CNN\n\nUpdated 1038 GMT (1838 HKT) May 11, 2020\n\n(CNN)Going to the doctor or pediatrician wasn't so complicated just a few months ago. Neither was a trip to the dentist or the veterinarian.\n\nWould your blood pressure be too high? Would your child cry at the shots? Would Fido bark at a cat in the waiting room? Even getting a cavity filled is more difficult now that concern over the coronavirus influences every decision leave the house. Anxiety is keeping adults and children alike out of medical offices, leading doctors to worry that people aren't taking care of their non-coronavirus illnesses and prompting pediatricians to express concern over dropping numbers of vaccinated children. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced a \"notable decrease\" in the number of vaccines ordered through a federal program that immunizes half of all kids in the country, the agency said Friday. \"As social distancing requirements are relaxed, children who are not protected by vaccines will be more vulnerable to diseases such as measles,\" the CDC's Dr. Jeanne Santoli and colleagues stated last week. Read MorePeople are staying away from the hospital, too, even when they shouldn't -- such as in the case of a heart attack, stroke or other emergency. The American Heart Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians and other major medical groups joined together in late April to urge people to still call 911 and go to the hospital. Avoiding the doctor's office and the hospital due to fears of coronavirus could be deadly. You can still get to some of your most common medical appointments with protections to keep everyone as safe as possible. How to visit the (grownup) doctorFirst call your doctor to discuss your condition. Some concerns can be addressed over the phone, but you won't know if you don't call. \"For chronic medical issues or for issues that really are non-urgent, we also encourage patients to call their doctors first,\" said Dr. Patrice Harris, an Atlanta psychiatrist and president of the American Medical Association. While some conditions may be diagnosed easily through a telehealth appointment to avoid a medical office, some chronic health conditions may require an in-person visit for an in-person exam, blood work or X-rays. READ MORE: Getting to the doctor during a pandemicHow to visit the pediatrician Children got into scrapes that required visits to the pediatrician before the pandemic. Skateboard accidents and bike falls are still occurring, coronavirus or not. But kids who spending more time at home are also getting into more trouble at home, including accidental poisonings due to the powerful chemicals people are using to clean their homes to kill the virus. \"Kids are getting into things while parents are trying to work,\" said Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician at Georgia's Children's Medical Group. \"The supervision may not be the same during the day, and everyone's a little bit off their routine.\" Poison control is still available by phone and online throughout the coronavirus crisis.Many pediatricians are now offering telemedicine appointments, meaning a trip to the doctor's may not be necessary. If you have a hospital emergency, head to the children's hospital first if there's one in your area. They are less likely to be crowded with Covid-19 patients. Lots of parents are delaying vaccines, and that's not a good idea for children 2 years old and under, Dr. Shu said. Regular checkups and early vaccines protect against measles, polio and diphtheria and other life-threatening diseases. Some vaccines for older children can be delayed a bit but consult your doctor to be sure. READ MORE: Getting to the pediatrician during a pandemicHow to visit the hospitalIf you're struggling to breathe or having a heart attack or stroke, you or your loved one should call 911 and get an ambulance or get to the hospital immediately. Despite an influx of Covid-19 patients, hospital staff are concerned about the cases they are not seeing anymore. If you think you might need to head to the hospital but feel well enough to call your primary care doctor, do so. \"Patients shouldn't need to make decisions alone about whether their problem is urgent or emergent,\" said Harris, the AMA president. \"Please don't let the pandemic stop you from reaching out to your physician,\" Harris said. \"You don't want symptoms to go unreviewed and then turn out to be worse later.\"READ MORE: Getting to the hospital during a pandemicGetting to the dentistPutting off the dentist may be your best option right now. The CDC recommends that dentists should put off \"elective procedures, surgeries and non-urgent dental visits,\" allowing only emergency visits for now. That's because the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration includes dental health-care providers in the \"very high exposure risk\" category. Even recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) don't fully protect people against tools considered routine in dentistry that can send droplets of saliva through the air (and potentially carry the virus). Emergencies include a fractured tooth, swelling or pain that can't be managed without over-the-counter medications, said dentist Matthew Messina, the clinic director at Ohio State Upper Arlington Dentistry and a spokesperson for the American Dental Association.The increased risk means it's critical to take care of your teeth throughout the coronavirus pandemic, and to see providers only in case of real emergencies.READ MORE: Getting to the dentist during a pandemicVisit the veterinarianThe advice is the same for animals as humans: Start with a call to your veterinarian to see if your visit can be handled via phone call or telehealth; note that laws differ by state, and some vets aren't allowed to offer telehealth. If you must go in, you might not actually go with your pet into the office. Rabies shots, kitten and puppy vaccines and emergency visits are all considered essential care, but pet owners should still call their vets' offices first. READ MORE: Getting to the veterinarian in a pandemic\"We've numbered the parking lots at all the hospitals and we'll tell clients to pull in space one, space two, space three. When they've done that, they call us and one of the technicians goes out with gloves and a mask and brings the pet into the clinic,\" Atlanta veterinarian Will Draper told CNN. \"Then we will either video conference with them while they're in the car or just call them on the phone and discuss what we've found and our recommendations for their pet.\"Want to go someplace else?After all of those appointments, where else do you need to go? We know not everyone can stay home, but the best way to curb the spread of Covid-19 is to do so when possible.That's true even now that many US states are starting to reopen. But if you must go out, read CNN's Scottie Andrew's piece on how to go restaurants, beaches and parks, gyms, salons, airports and polling places.\n\nCNN's Sandee LaMotte, Kristen Rogers, Ryan Prior, Maggie Fox, Jacqueline Howard and Jen Rose Smith contributed to this story.",

        "body": "Going anywhere during a pandemic is difficult but getting to medical appointments is even more fraught. Whether you need to get to the pediatrician, dentist, vet, internist or hospital, this five-part series from CNN Science and Wellness has you covered.\n\n(CNN)On Easter Sunday, as much of America faced another day in quarantine, Kathryn Pettus of Centreville, Virginia, woke up to a terrible toothache.\n\n\"I was having some pain,\" she said. \"With the pandemic I said, 'I'll just have to wait until everything's over.'\" That Sunday, though, the pain became extreme. When she found a dentist who could see her, she learned she needed an emergency root canal. As part of the country's response to the Covid-19 crisis, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that dentists put off \"elective procedures, surgeries and non-urgent dental visits,\" allowing only emergency visits until the threat subsides.That's because dental work could place dentists and dental hygienists at risk for Covid-19 infection, according to the US Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).Read MoreThe government agency includes dental health-care providers in the \"very high exposure risk\" category. Routine dental tools such as air-water syringes can send droplets of saliva through the air, potentially carrying the virus with them. Even recommended personal protective equipment (PPE), such as face shields and gowns, do not fully safeguard against infection.The increased risk means it's critical to take care of your teeth throughout the coronavirus pandemic, and to see providers only in case of real emergencies. If you do experience an emergency, as Pettus did, you'd likely see some new procedures to protect both patients and providers. Here's what you need to know.What is an emergency?There's no fixed definition of a dental emergency, said dentist Matthew Messina, the clinic director at Ohio State Upper Arlington Dentistry and a spokesperson for the American Dental Association. Messina said issues that may require immediate care include a fractured tooth, swelling or pain that can't be managed with over-the-counter medications.\"If someone has a little sensitivity from a small cavity,\" he noted, \"that would probably be postponed until after the restrictions are lifted.\"The most important thing, he said, is to start by calling your dentist, who may be able to offer care via telehealth. \"A lot of times, some really useful things can be taken care of over the phone,\" he explained. How should you care for your teeth? If you do have a minor issue such as a cavity, Messina said you should simply care for the tooth with healthy brushing. \"It's always best for us to reconfirm our commitments to the 'healthy four,'\" said Messina. That means brushing your teeth at least twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste, plus daily flossing and a healthy diet. \"Those things put us in the best shape to not let anything get worse,\" he said. While it's widely known that avoiding sugary food and drink is good for your teeth in the long term, Messina said that cutting sugar, even temporarily, can help maintain good dental health while postponing regular dentist visits.Bacteria are always present in the mouth, said Messina and eating sugar amounts to feeding them. \"The bacteria metabolize sugars, and the byproduct of that is acid,\" he said. \"Acid bathing the teeth is what dissolves away the enamel -- the hard outer covering of the tooth -- and that's what causes cavities.\"In addition to cavities, dentists also routinely check for signs of oral cancer and other issues. If you need to put off an office visit, Messina suggested monitoring your mouth for any changes. \"If you have something in your mouth that you think is different, like a lump or bump, a white spot, a red spot, anything like that, don't wait,\" said Messina. \"If there's something that you're not sure is right, that's something you want to contact your dentist about.\"What if you grind your teeth?Another risk to your teeth during the coronavirus pandemic is teeth grinding or clenching, which can be aggravated by stress, said Messina. \"Right now we have perceived stress,\" he explained. \"Clenching and grinding tends to be one of the things that the body does to relieve that level of stress.\" If you notice that you're waking up with a sore or tired jaw, you may be clenching or grinding your teeth as you sleep. If gone untreated, that can eventually result in cracked, worn-down teeth.\"One of the ways to respond to stress is to go for a walk, go for a run or do something active,\" said Messina. Another option Messina recommended to treat soreness and tension associated with grinding is to massage the sides of your face or to press a warm washcloth against jaw muscles. How are dentists adapting to Covid-19?When dental offices eventually reopen for routine care, they'll be following directives from governors, state health departments and state dental boards. In the meantime, Messina said that dentists are looking to the American Dental Association and the CDC for guidance in responding to Covid-19. If you do need to visit a dentist for urgent care, he said you'd likely see measures put in place to protect both patients and providers from Covid-19. Those measures include social distancing, screening for Covid-19 symptoms and enhanced hygiene. \"Most offices are using efforts to socially distance the patients,\" said Messina. \"We want to minimize patients in a group in our reception area.\" Those efforts may include having patients wait outside in cars, for example, so they can enter the office one at a time.When Pettus arrived at the dentist for an emergency root canal on Wednesday, she filled out a form that asked about potential coronavirus symptoms and exposure. In the procedure room, she said, the dentist and dental assistant wore doubled surgical masks, as well as protective gowns. In conjunction with that additional protection, Messina noted that some offices are using CDC-recommended face shields. When it comes to other precautions, such as respiratory hygiene and sterilization, Messina said that dental offices have practiced these measures for years.\"Our existing universal precautions provide safety for patients and healthcare providers as well,\" said Messina. \"Universal precautions have been the standard for dental offices since long before it became cool.\"",

Whether you need to get to the pediatrician, dentist, vet, internist or hospital, this five-part series from CNN Science and Wellness has you covered.\n\n(CNN)It had been three weeks of gradually debilitating, searing pain before Johnny Staggs decided to call his local clinic for advice.\n\nAs a bariatric patient, Staggs, a 43-year-old food stamp office employee in Tennessee, had a history of dealing with hemorrhoid flare-ups, but they usually abated after a few days. He'd use over-the-counter pain medications, which alleviated the discomfort within a few hours, so there was no need to talk with his physician about it. This time around, the medicines did nothing for his pain. It worsened to the extent where he was practically on his knees at work instead of sitting. He had to nearly stand up to watch a movie with his wife one Sunday. Housework he needed to complete went undone. He took OTC medications to get through the day, and evening versions at night since he couldn't sleep well because of the pain. Eventually, Staggs had to take a few days off work here and there, but ultimately he had to return once he ran out of sick leave. Even there, he was falling behind. Since the pain started up again in early March, Staggs debated whether he should request an appointment with his clinic. Read More\"My biggest concern was thinking, you know, you just hear in the news about how everyone's rushing in to get tested for the coronavirus and everything,\" he said. \"And my thought was my issue overall seems so minor compared to if I took a spot [from] someone who had a more serious concern.\" But he also feared that leaving his pain unchecked would grow into a graver problem -- or an emergency. This internal dilemma is one many may face right now as they weigh the risk-to-benefit ratio of visiting their doctor's office. Here's what physicians say you should consider when you're debating with yourself over an appointment. Deciding whether to visit your doctorSince states differ in which medical services are available and when varying services will be reopening, there's no one-size-fits-all answer for whether someone should visit the doctor, said Dr. Gary LeRoy, a family physician in Ohio and president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. If you're thinking of scheduling an appointment or if you have one coming up, call ahead to have a clear understanding from your physician's office about what the plan is for appointments and whether staff is available, he said. \"For chronic medical issues or for issues that really are nonurgent, we also encourage patients to call their doctors first,\" said Dr. Patrice Harris, an Atlanta psychiatrist and president of the American Medical Association. \"Each patient is unique, and so once they call their doctor's office, their doctor will be able to determine if they need to come in or if they can be managed using telehealth.\" If you have a chronic health condition such as diabetes or cardiac issues, it's more important to visit your doctor since he or she may have to examine you in ways that can't be done via a telehealth appointment, LeRoy advised. \"If it's a chronic thing you may say, 'Well, I'm a diabetic; it's just a routine diabetic six-month check-in.' Well, there's a lot of things that go into this routine visit that I'll ask the patient or make routine observations about,\" LeRoy said. \"Or maybe we need to do labs at that six-month visit. So you can't assume that just because it's a routine visit that you can just put it off even longer.\"So find out what it was that your physician wanted to do that they can't do over the telephone.\" It's especially critical for those with chronic conditions and compromised immune systems and older adults to follow up with their doctors regarding in-person appointments, LeRoy said, since those factors make someone at high risk for more serious illness from coronavirus. If you have serious symptoms of Covid-19, you can call your personal physician for guidance on getting to the hospital for testing. What to know about telehealth appointmentsTelehealth appointments have charges attached to them, LeRoy said, so they may not be an option for you if you're running low on income or if you've lost your insurance. Insurance may cover part of the cost, and out of pocket they usually cost around $60, but your doctor's office can explain your specific options. Whether you can opt for a telemedicine appointment depends on the nature of your medical issue, LeRoy said. Again, if you have a chronic condition that requires labs, monitoring or injections, talk with your doctor about whether a virtual visit is suitable for you. If you've noticed a change on your body, such as a concerning blemish or lump, it probably can't be evaluated via telemedicine, LeRoy said. That's because your doctor may have to touch it to determine whether there's a problem. If you're not tech-savvy or if you live in a rural area with weak internet connection, you can ask whether your doctor is holding appointments over the phone, Harris suggested.Some states have restrictions on services that can be offered virtually. If you're looking to get a prescription medication refilled, ask your doctor if that refill requires an in-person visit. Out of desperation, Staggs finally called his clinic on March 25. After waiting on hold for hours, he was told he'd be placed in a queue for a virtual appointment at 10:30 p.m. that night. But the delay went into the early morning hours and the appointment never happened, so he decided to visit the clinic later that day. How to be safe at the doctor's officeSome physicians' offices have made adjustments to their waiting and examination rooms to keep everyone involved safe, LeRoy said. Medical staff have moved furniture apart for proper distancing, wiped down doors and supplies to manage surface contamination and are wearing masks and gloves (as usual) to prevent spreading. \"You should make sure that you have some sort of face covering when you go in there,\" he said. You can wear gloves, LeRoy said, but realize you can still pick up the virus and touch your face. Avoid touching your face and adjusting your glasses, and learn how to remove contaminated gloves without compromising your hands. You should also carry hand sanitizer that you'll rub into your hands before and after you wear gloves. If you've touched your credit card while wearing gloves, use the hand sanitizer to cleanse your card, too. In a clinic he remembered as usually fast-paced, Staggs was the only patient in the office at that time. The staff was diligent in their protective measures.\"When I walked in, there was a strong smell,\" he said. \"You could tell that every chair had been wiped down recently.\" For his paperwork, the receptionist handed him a pen after wiping it down with a Lysol wipe. Everyone was wearing a mask. A nurse practitioner examined him, saw his pain and referred him to a specialist who was still taking patients and could see him a week later. She wiped down the door after he left the room. Staggs saw a gastroenterologist, who quickly realized Staggs' problem was much worse than Staggs thought and out of his purview. So he requested that another specialist see him that same day. After describing his pain to a colon and rectal surgeon, Staggs learned he had an anal fissure, a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus. If it wasn't for the pandemic, the surgeon would've operated on him that same day. But the operation was considered an elective surgery, so the surgeon gave Staggs a cream to use for two weeks before a follow-up appointment. Just as every other method had failed, so did the cream. \"Because that wasn't working, he had to do a justification for surgery to get it approved from the board,\" Staggs said. \"And they were actually able to get me approved. My surgery was [April 22] at 7:30 in the morning. At 8:30 in the morning, I was awake from surgery, and I felt like a new person.\"The guidelines for safety are meant to accomplish three major goals, Harris said. Two are ensuring physicians maintain access to care for their patients while decreasing the risk of spread of Covid-19. But overall, physicians don't want their patients to feel alone, Harris added. \"We want our patients to know that we are there for them,\" she said. \"We also don't want our patients to feel they have to make these decisions alone, and that they can call us so we can continue in the shared decision-making process.\"",

        "body": "Going anywhere during a pandemic is difficult but getting to medical appointments is even more fraught. Whether you need to get to the pediatrician, dentist, vet, internist or hospital, this five-part series from CNN Science and Wellness has you covered.\n\n(CNN)Earlier this month, Dia Sue-Wah-Sing faced a dilemma.\n\nThe 41-year-old living in Toronto had a history of kidney stones. She had been feeling some renal colic symptoms recently, a type of pain that can indicate the stones are worsening.But during the coronavirus pandemic, routine medical appointments get a little more complicated. Was it worth it to go in? \"It was a solid 'maybe,'\" she said.On April 15, she had a six-month follow-up appointment for a kidney ultrasound at Toronto Western Hospital. Although other hospital departments weren't seeing patients during the pandemic, radiology was still open -- with strict social distancing rules.If her kidneys went unchecked, she worried there was a possibility she'd end up in the ER in June passing kidney stones.Read MoreMany of us will face our own version of Sue-Wah-Sing's decision in the coming months. So here's what you you need to know if you're going to the hospital, clinic or doctor's office in the time of coronavirus.Call your doctor first\"Emergencies still continue to happen,\" said Dr. Patrice Harris, president of the American Medical Association. During the pandemic she advised patients to still call 911 for urgent needs, particularly chest pain or stroke symptoms.Beyond that, though, Harris cautioned that there's no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach\" when assessing whether or not you should go for an in-person hospital visit.That's likely to be determined by your individual case, the health care available in the patient's area and the severity of the Covid-19 environment in your region.But Harris noted there was still one constant through all of that: shared decision-making. \"Patients shouldn't need to make decisions alone about whether their problem is urgent or emergent,\" she said.Certain new symptoms or follow-ups for existing conditions might warrant starting with a telehealth appointment with your doctor. If it turns out you need to go to the hospital, call the hospital ahead of time to learn which entrance to use to avoid areas where Covid-19 patients are receiving treatment.\"Please don't let the pandemic stop you from reaching out to your physician,\" Harris said. \"You don't want symptoms now to go unreviewed and then turn out to be worse later.\"Decide with your doctor whether you should seek care in person or onlineIn the US, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has published a tiered framework to help explain how hospitals can still offer certain in-person services during the pandemic.In the first tier, the guidelines recommend postponing in-person hospital visits for routine primary care, preventive medicine and services such as supervised exercise therapy. In the second tier, initial visits for services such as evaluation of nonurgent symptoms consistent with Covid-19, pediatric vaccinations or early childhood care can be done via telehealth, with subsequent follow-ups at appropriate care sites. The third tier describes the most acute issues, and the government's framework recommends proceeding directly to in-person hospital or clinic visits. In these instances, CMS urges patients to seek in-person care if forgoing it would result in harm.One immediate rule of thumb to determine is whether you'd be capable of calling for help later if you don't now, said Doug Lindsay, a personal medical consultant who advises patients on how to seek care for complicated conditions. If there's a likelihood of heart attack, stroke or severe injury, get the patient to the emergency room.\"If you're struggling to breathe, then you want an ambulance because the ambulance is a mini-hospital,\" Lindsay said. \"If you're just sick, then have someone drive you.\"If you're unsure whether it's the right move to go to the hospital, calling the doctor's office or their after-hours exchange can help get you answers before setting out into an uncertain situation.\"You should be calling their exchange and talking this through,\" Lindsay said. \"There's nothing new about calling that [number].\"Stay protected, and physically distanced, at the hospitalHospitals can be busy, high-traffic areas with lots of people, which is why Lindsay advised patients to lower risk by seeking care at smaller clinics or urgent care centers, rather than sprawling hospital centers.And if you're choosing between urgent care clinics, look for one that provides X-rays in-house. That way you don't have to take the risk of a second trip to another health facility.When you walk in to a clinic or hospital, you're likely to have your temperature taken or to be asked questions about your symptoms. This is designed to screen out whether you might have Covid-19.When Sue-Wah-Sing walked into Toronto Western for her kidney ultrasound, she was given a yellow \"PASS\" sticker signifying she cleared the hospital's Covid-19 symptom screening. And while the hospital has seven entrances, it had kept only four open to be able screen each person entering the building.Patients weren't allowed to bring visitors with them, unless they were providing translation or another essential service. And the hospital's food court was still serving food, but it had taken away the chairs and tables so people couldn't congregate there to eat.On the way up in the elevator, she saw three pairs of little yellow feet painted on the floor, showing both the number of people allowed in the cramped space and how they could position their bodies each 6 feet away from each other.Finally, in the radiology department's waiting room, groups of five seats were all roped off, so that patients could maintain social distancing by only sitting in every sixth chair.After seeing all the extra measures in place, Sue-Wah-Sing said she felt being at Toronto Western Hospital during the pandemic was actually \"one of the safest places to be.\"After Sue-Wah-Sing underwent the ultrasound in the Toronto hospital, she went straight home to have a telehealth appointment with her doctor to discuss the results.Prioritize your own healthStart out with keeping a daily log of your symptoms. One key part of deciding whether to go to the doctor is to keep a log of your symptoms every day, noting how severe they are along with where you were or what you were doing as the symptoms came on.\"Every doctor tells every chronic disease patient to do that,\" Lindsay said.Understanding her past health challenges and knowing how to monitor her own symptoms was key to Sue-Wah-Sing making the right call to go the hospital.It was a risk to go in, especially at this phase of the pandemic, she said. She would have considered canceling the six-month follow-up had she been symptom-free. And her symptoms were still mild enough that she felt she could have afforded to wait a few more weeks for the ultrasound if it had already been scheduled further out.\"But it was totally worth it,\" she said. \"If it had ended up being a stone, I'd have been in the ER.\"",

        "body": "Going anywhere during a pandemic is difficult but getting to medical appointments is even more fraught. Whether you need to get to the pediatrician, dentist, vet, internist or hospital, this five-part series from CNN Science and Wellness has you covered.\n\n(CNN)It was after midnight when Leslie Rowe woke up on April 11. Her 9-year-old son, Zaiden, was in tears, saying he had an intense pain in his groin.\n\nAt any other time, said Rowe, who lives in Collierville, Tennessee, she would have headed straight to the emergency room. \"He was crying, he was in pain,\" Rowe said. \"I was scared.\"But Rowe's family has been practicing strict social distancing since March 13. With close relatives whose preexisting conditions make them especially vulnerable to Covid-19, she's even limiting trips to the grocery store as much as possible.Rowe called the emergency room at Spence and Becky Wilson Baptist Children's Hospital in Memphis, then decided it was time for Zaiden to go in. While Rowe stayed at home with her toddler, Zaiden's father took him to the children's hospital's emergency room.Dr. Jennifer Shu, a pediatrician at Georgia's Children's Medical Group, said Rowe made the right call by reaching out to a children's hospital. Read More\"If you can take them to a children's ER, that's the best way to go,\" Dr. Shu said. \"Coronavirus isn't hitting children as severely as it is adults. At least in our area, that means that children's hospitals are way less busy than the adult hospitals.\"As Americans adjust to social-distancing during coronavirus, many are wondering how best to care for their children's medical needs. \"A lot of them are just nervous about going out because they don't want to be exposed to anything,\" Dr. Shu said. \"They're being very cautious, which is great.\" But Dr. Shu also said that some medical issues require a face-to-face visit and doctors are taking measures to ensure patient safety at offices and hospitals. For midnight emergencies, routine care, wellness checkups and more, here's what you need to know. What should you do during a medical emergency?For urgent issues, Dr. Shu said parents should still call 911 or go straight to the emergency room, preferably at a children's hospital.In less pressing cases, she suggested starting with a call to a primary care provider, who can help determine next steps. \"Your primary care doctor is considered your medical 'home,'\" she said. Like other medical providers, many pediatricians are now offering telemedicine via video call or telephone. Even if you end up going to the office or to the emergency room, calling first can help ensure you find the appropriate care. In the weeks since coronavirus quarantines have begun, Dr. Shu said that one common problem is accidental poisoning. \"Kids are getting into things while parents are trying to work,\" she said. \"The supervision may not be the same during the day, and everyone's a little bit off their routine.\" Poison control is still available by phone and online throughout the coronavirus crisis.In addition to poison cases, Dr. Shu said her office has seen lots of household injuries. Kids are swallowing coins or falling down inside and outside the house. Some, she said, are getting hurt while riding bicycles and skateboards. Those injuries are normal, said Dr. Shu, whose own daughter needed an ER visit after falling and cutting her arm three weeks ago. \"If you're trying to work,\" she said, \"try having a little bit of extra supervision on your children.\"What if your child has symptoms or is feeling sick?If your child is experiencing symptoms, Dr. Shu recommended starting with KidsDoc Symptom Checker, a website operated by the American Academy of Pediatrics. There, parents can get reliable info on everything from stomachaches to sprains. \"Let's say [they have] a minor fever for just a day,\" Dr. Shu said. \"If the child is doing otherwise well, they may be able to manage that fever at home for another day or two.\" The next step is to call your doctor to see whether the issue can be diagnosed via telehealth or requires an in-office visit. Dr. Shu noted that at her clinic, a telemedicine call followed by an in-office appointment within 24 hours would likely be billed as a single doctor's visit.Despite the dangers of coronavirus, and the challenges of parenting during quarantine, Dr. Shu said that it also means kids are shielded from some common illnesses. \"People aren't traveling as much,\" she said. \"They're not mixing germs as much.\" It's a silver lining to all that social distancing and handwashing: In the time since the quarantine began, Dr. Shu's office has seen far fewer cases of influenza, strep throat, stomach ailments, measles and whooping cough.Managing vaccines and annual check-ups during coronavirus With a 4-month-old baby and a 6-year-old at home, Lauren Bachan of San Jose, California, was concerned about the risk of contracting Covid-19 at a doctor's office. Still, when her baby's regular vaccinations were due, she decided that delaying would be far more dangerous. \"I don't know if she's going to catch Covid,\" said Bachan. \"But if she catches measles she could die.\" When it comes to children who are 2 years old and under, Dr. Shu agreed that it's essential to attend regular checkups and scheduled vaccinations. The vaccines administered at that age protect against life-threatening diseases including measles, polio and diphtheria. Not only that, pediatricians use regular visits with children 2 and under to check vision, screen for autism and monitor development of speech and walking. \"It's something we want to get on the radar early so we can intervene if necessary,\" Dr. Shu said. For some of the CDC-recommended vaccines, children get additional booster shots at 4, 11 and 16 years old, Dr. Shu said. In a situation where seeing a provider is difficult or risky, Dr. Shu said it's perfectly fine to delay some shots. \"There's a one- or two-year leeway where you can wait a little while,\" she said. For older kids who don't need vaccines, Dr. Shu said annual checkups can often be postponed as well. \"Those kids typically come in because they need to get checked out before they go to summer camp or do sports,\" she said. \"Those aren't happening anyway, and we feel that we can delay those.\" If you're considering putting off booster shots or annual checkups, it's still a good idea to check with your health care provider.What can you expect at the doctor or emergency room?When Rowe's son, Zaiden, arrived at the emergency room in Memphis, Tennessee, he and his father had their temperatures screened before they got to the front desk.Both father and son were wearing masks -- Leslie Rowe has been working overtime to sew fabric masks for her community. After the temperature screening, they spent a few hours at the hospital making sure Zaiden was okay. All of the providers they interacted with wore masks and gloves. Those are just some of the measures that hospitals and pediatricians have put in place to protect patients and staff from Covid-19, Dr. Shu said.\"We're looking to the CDC (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) for guidance on precautions to take in the office to prevent the spread of illness,\" Dr. Shu said. That guidance includes extra sanitization and maintaining social distancing as patients arrive and wait for providers. Pediatric offices are also following advice from the AAP, which includes best practices for preventing the spread of Covid-19. \"Rather than coming to the front desk, they check in from their cars,\" Dr. Shu explained. \"We have rooms that are dedicated to sick people that well people don't ever go in. And we're really limiting the time that they're in the actual office.\"With those precautions in place, Zaiden got the care he needed then returned home, where he's now recovering with his family. That meant his mom could get back to sewing masks. So far, she's made 360. \"I just leave them in a basket at my front door for people to pick up,\" she said. \"They can actually pick them up and drop them off at our local hospital,\" Rowe said. \"Beyond that, I just pray for the people that are in contact with the virus.\"",

He said numbers increased during the lockdown because health workers were able to \"aggressively\" trace and test contacts of infected persons.Akufo-Addo said the government has begun using drones to transport samples to laboratories to improve turnaround time and it planned to scale up rapid tests across the country.Authorities have been able to map cases and identify potential hotspots to detect asymptomatic cases to minimize the spread, he said.\"The majority of those infected in Ghana have mild to no symptoms at all, whilst a very small number have required hospital treatment of which nine persons with underlying illness have died,\" the president said.Ghana is the first to lift movement restrictions among a dozen countries in Africa that have imposed such strict measures to contain the spread of the virus.Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda have announced lockdown extensions of at least two weeks as cases continue to rise.",

It is fast, it is easy,\" he said. \"It is so fast and so easy that even a governor can take this test.\"Cuomo then stood and introduced Dr. Elizabeth DuFort, decked in full personal protective equipment, including a gown, gloves and mask. DuFort put a long swab, known as a nasopharyngeal swab, deep into Cuomo's nose for about five seconds.\"That is the whole test. I'm not in pain. I'm not in discomfort,\" he said afterward. \"You don't even have to be New York tough to take that test.\"The swab is just the first part of the diagnostic PCR test, the most common and most accurate test for determining whether someone is infected with the novel coronavirus. To complete the test, that swab sample would then be sent to a lab with access to a test kit to determine if the novel coronavirus is present. In general, the entire testing process takes a day or more.Read MoreCuomo said New York, the epicenter of the American coronavirus outbreak, has more than 700 testing sites across the state and met its target of 40,000 tests per day. As a percentage of its population, New York has tested more than any other state, Cuomo said. Still, he said, there is more testing capacity that is going unused.\"We have more sites and more testing capacity than we're using,\" he said.In New York, testing is available to anyone who thinks they have a Covid-19 symptom or anyone who has had contact with a person known to be positive with Covid-19. Tests are also available for essential workers who interact with the public as well as anyone who would return to work in the state's Phase 1 reopening, which includes workers in construction, agriculture, manufacturing and some retail.Cuomo said increasing testing will ensure that the state is able to monitor and control the virus's spread and mitigate any outbreaks.\"The more tests, the better for the state, the better for society, the better for your family, the better for you,\" he said.Parts of upstate New York began to reopen on Friday after meeting seven criteria based on declining cases, hospital space and testing and contract tracing capability. New York City has met just three of those seven metrics as of Sunday.\n\nCNN's Kristina Sgueglia and Sheena Jones contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Teen activist Greta Thunberg is urging the world to listen to scientists as she describes the devastating impact the coronavirus pandemic is having around the world.\n\n\"During any crisis it is always the most vulnerable people who are hit the hardest, and that is children,\" she said.\"Especially in the global south, people in the poorest parts of the world, especially people living in conflict zones and refugee camps,\" she added.Appearing on a CNN Coronavirus Town Hall, hosted by Anderson Cooper and CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Thunberg addressed misinformation around the disease, including how it was originally believed that Covid-19 affected only elderly people.\"Yes, this does affect elderly people a lot, but we also have to remember that this is also a children's rights crisis,\" she warned, \"because children are the most vulnerable in societies.\"Read More\"Children do get the virus and they also spread it.\" A role model for many young people around the world, 17-year-old Thunberg self-isolated from her family earlier this year after believing she had contracted the virus -- although she has never been tested.She explained that in her home country of Sweden, \"you don't get tested unless you are in need of medical help.\" Thunberg self-isolated anyway because, she said, it was \"the right thing to do.\"\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nThe last two weeks I've stayed inside. When I returned from my trip around Central Europe I isolated myself (in a borrowed apartment away from my mother and sister) since the number of cases of COVID-19 (in Germany for instance) were similar to Italy in the beginning. Around ten days ago I started feeling some symptoms, exactly the same time as my father - who traveled with me from Brussels. I was feeling tired, had shivers, a sore throat and coughed. My dad experienced the same symptoms, but much more intense and with a fever. In Sweden you can not test yourself for COVID-19 unless you're in need of emergent medical treatment. Everyone feeling ill are told to stay at home and isolate themselves. I have therefore not been tested for COVID-19, but it's extremely likely that I've had it, given the combined symptoms and circumstances. Now I've basically recovered, but - AND THIS IS THE BOTTOM LINE: I almost didn't feel ill. My last cold was much worse than this! Had it not been for someone else having the virus simultainously I might not even have suspected anything. Then I would just have thought I was feeling unusually tired with a bit of a cough. And this it what makes it so much more dangerous. Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don't know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups. We who don't belong to a risk group have an enormous responsibility, our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others. Please keep that in mind, follow the advice from experts and your local authorities and #StayAtHome to slow the spread of the virus. And remember to always take care of each other and help those in need. #COVID #flattenthecurve\n\nA post shared by Greta Thunberg (@gretathunberg) on Mar 24, 2020 at 8:22am PDT\n\nDespite having had what she describes as mild symptoms, she posted about her experience on social media to raise awareness about the virus and the appropriate action to take.\"Many people don't even notice that they have symptoms and then they might spread the virus without even knowing it,\" she said.\"So we have to be extra careful, because our actions can be the difference between life and death for many others.\"Thunberg is best known for her environmental activism, leading climate strikes around the world -- strikes that have now gone online.On Global Earth Day last month, April 22, she was awarded a $100,000 prize for her climate activism by Human Act, a Danish worldwide development organization. She subsequently donated that money to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), launching a campaign specifically aimed at safeguarding children's rights and welfare during the coronavirus pandemic.The money will be used by UNICEF's coronavirus emergency programs to provide supplies like soap, masks, hygiene kits and gloves, she explained.\"We're talking about washing our hands and staying home but for many people in the world, they do not have access to clean water or sanitation, to soap,\" she said.\"They may not even have a house to stay home in.\"\"That's why we need to help the people who are most vulnerable to this crisis in ways that we might not think about in the global north,\" she added.Greta Thunberg: The teenage old soul of the climate crisisDespite sounding the alarm over the virus, Thunberg said she does see a silver lining to all this.\"People are starting to realize that we are actually depending on science and that we need to listen to scientists and experts.\"And I really hope that stays,\" she said, adding that she hopes it will apply to other crises \"such as the climate crisis and the environmental crisis.\" Thunberg's appearance on CNN's Coronavirus Town Hall drew criticism from some, who accused her of not being an expert on the virus. However, the teen herself clarified on Twitter that she was never appearing as an expert nor is she one. Rather, she is an activist with a large following of young people and is trying to shine a light on the impact this virus will have on future generations.",

        "body": "Atlanta (CNN Business)Prices for supermarket staples, including eggs, meat and cereal soared last month in the largest one-month spike in close to fifty years, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Overall, food prices climbed an average of 2.6%, the highest increase since February 1974.\n\nThe price index for eggs climbed more than 16% -- the biggest increase for any food item.As consumers are buying more groceries and eating at home more often, David Ortega -- a food economist and associate professor at Michigan State University -- says he thinks it's less of an issue of grocers taking advantage of the current market environment, and more a symptom of current market conditions. \"For the most part, it's supply and demand issues here, at play,\" Ortega told CNN. \"What we're seeing here is economic forces at play, but also the resiliency of our food system to be able to provide food at a reasonable price.\"CNN reached out to several grocery store chains to ask about consumer concerns around rising prices at the supermarket.Read MorePublix, one of the largest grocery store chains in the southeast, said in a statement to CNN, \"In some instances, there have been price increases from manufacturers. We work extremely hard to negotiate pricing with our suppliers, so that we can offer the best price to our customers. To mitigate price increases during difficult times such as these, we also try to absorb as much of the increase as we can before having to pass along an increase to our customers.\"The National Grocers Association, a trade association that represents independent areas of the food industry, said in a statement that \"as costs rise from producers and the supply chain, our members are following the same pricing structures and policies as they always have.\"\"Grocers are working with their suppliers to mitigate price increases to the best of their ability and keep prices as steady as possible, but processing plant disruptions along with the surge in demand will have an impact on costs of goods and in turn consumers may experience higher prices on some products,\" it said.Ortega said while the Covid-19 pandemic has been a shock to the food supply system, the economic forces at play are working as they should be. \"We are seeing the supply chains and markets adjust and it can be concerning for some, of course, but it is a short term reaction to a very significant shock.\"While economists attribute the swell in grocery prices to supply and demand issues, coupled with changing human behavior, some have publicly questioned whether price gouging could be a factor in some cases. Attorneys general from 11 midwestern states have asked the US Department of Justice to investigate potential price fixing among meatpacking companies during the pandemic. This is not a new accusation but President Donald Trump said last week he had asked the DOJ to look into the claims. In April, the Attorney General of Texas sued the country's largest egg producer, Cal-Maine Foods, for allegedly raising the price of one dozen eggs by 300% in one year's time. Cal-Maine Foods issued a statement in response saying it \"strongly denies these allegations\" and that it \"has not exploited this tragic national pandemic for gain.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)When a half-dozen inmates reported in for their prison jobs in Nebraska in late March, they found themselves with a new assignment: turning vats of ethanol into 2,500 gallons of coronavirus-killing hand sanitizer, for a wage of $1.08 an hour.\n\nBut while their work has helped the state government stave off a sanitizer shortage, the inmates on the production line -- and more than 5,000 others in prisons around Nebraska -- are banned from using the hand gel they helped make, according to the state corrections department. They're not alone. Even as correctional facilities have emerged as some of the country's largest sources of coronavirus outbreaks, hand sanitizer is still considered contraband in all federal prisons as well as state prisons in more than a dozen states, a CNN review of department policies found. \"They have the capability to protect us, but they are failing to do it,\" Ryan Kubik, an inmate at the Nebraska State Penitentiary, told CNN. He said he was \"scared to death\" of catching the virus in his overcrowded prison. \"People are going to die in here.\" Hand sanitizer has long been banned in most prisons due to its alcohol content, based on fears that inmates would drink it or use it to start fires. But during the pandemic, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended that correctional facilities \"consider relaxing restrictions\" on alcohol-based sanitizer \"where security concerns allow.\" A CDC spokesperson said that the extent to which the rules could be relaxed \"will depend on the security level of the facility and other aspects of the operational environment.\" Read MoreMany states have followed the advice: At least 30 corrections departments are allowing inmates to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer, either letting prisoners have their own bottles or dispensing it to them in a more controlled method. Most had banned the substance before the pandemic broke out. But 17 state corrections departments -- including six of the 10 with the largest inmate populations -- said they were maintaining their bans for now, many arguing that the alcohol in sanitizer made it a safety risk. And inmates in federal prisons around the country are also prohibited from using hand sanitizer, the federal Bureau of Prisons said in a statement. Many of the prison systems that ban sanitizer, which include Texas, Florida, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Georgia, said they are providing inmates free soap and other toiletries and reminding them about the importance of washing their hands frequently. And in North Carolina, Minnesota and Tennessee, alcohol-based hand sanitizer is banned but inmates are provided alcohol-free sanitizer, officials said -- even though the CDC recommends using sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume to kill the virus that causes Covid-19. A North Carolina corrections department spokesman said state medical experts had found their alcohol-free solution to be effective, while a Minnesota spokesman said that officials were still considering whether or not to switch to alcohol-based sanitizer.\u202f The restrictions on sanitizer remain in place even as the virus has spread like wildfire through prisons around the country. With inmates packed into crowded, often unsanitary housing units, and access to medical treatment limited, correctional facilities are becoming deadly hotspots, experts say. As of last week, more than 14,500 inmates around the country had tested positive for Covid-19 and at least 218 had died of the disease, according to a count by The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news website. Several thousand prison staffers have also tested positive and more than a dozen have died, the tally found. While some states have begun to release certain inmates to make social distancing easier in their facilities, criminal justice advocates argue that far more needs to be done. \"We have corrections staff and detained people dying from Covid-19 today all over the country, and probably tens of thousands of infections we don't know about,\" said Homer Venters, the former chief medical officer for New York City's jail system, which includes Rikers Island. Hand sanitizer is \"one of the most basic tools identified by the CDC, so there's no excuse for not implementing it,\" he said. Many of the states that have relaxed their policies have opted for compromise solutions where inmates only have controlled access to alcohol-based sanitizer. Last month, Nevada corrections officers provided some offenders bottles of sanitizer on a trial basis, \"but within a few hours, two offenders drank their hand sanitizer and got sick,\" department of corrections spokesman Scott Kelley said. \"NDOC had to confiscate all of the bottles.\" Now, staffers carry around one-gallon bottles of hand sanitizer, Kelley said, and \"provide offenders two to three squirts, under supervision.\"\u202fMaking sanitizer but banned from using it As sanitizer has flown off store shelves in the newly germophobic world beyond prison walls, some state leaders have turned to inmates for help dealing with potential shortages. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has touted his new \"New York State Clean\"-branded sanitizer bottled by prisoners, unveiling stacks of jugs from behind a curtain at one of his daily press conferences in March. But after activists pointed out that the inmates who made the gel weren't allowed to use it, the state's corrections department said it would make the sanitizer available in prison common areas. Some Texas inmates have also been working to repackage hand sanitizer, and Maryland inmates are helping bottle sanitizer, spokespeople said, even though both states ban prisoners from using the substance. Both states said they were providing inmates with soap. In Nebraska, a small group of inmates with a less restrictive security level have been helping produce and bottle alcohol-based sanitizer, which will be used by prison staff and other state employees, the state corrections department said. Inmates are provided free soap and easy access to water, the department said. The sanitizer operation has paused for now after meeting its initial goal, said Jeremy Elder, the department's deputy director for industries, but inmates could make more if the need arises. Other inmates are still making masks and gowns. Elder said inmates who handled the ethanol used to make sanitizer did so under close supervision, and that it made sense for alcohol-based sanitizer to be banned in prisons. \"It's a pretty big concern, especially when you have people with a substance abuse history,\" he said. \"There's a very strong mixture of alcohol in it.\" But David Fathi, the director of the ACLU's National Prison Project, called the sanitizer bans an \"exceedingly unfortunate\" example of prison leadership \"fixating on the minor risks at the expense of paying attention to much more significant risks.\" \"If prisoners can be around gallons of hand sanitizer when they're making it, why can't they have a little tiny bottle in their cell for personal use?\" he asked. \"We should be doing everything in our power to slow the spread of the virus.\" Family members of inmates in Nebraska's overcrowded prisons -- which hold about one and a half times as many inmates as they were designed for, according to state data -- say they're worried corrections officials aren't doing enough to protect their loved ones. \"I don't think they're taking it seriously,\" said Kelly Peterson, whose fianc\u00e9, Jason Bradley, is serving an 18-month sentence for making terroristic threats, according to state records. Peterson, who runs a Facebook group for inmates' relatives, said she'd been getting \"three or four calls a day from mothers who are telling me their guys inside are sick.\" She called the alcohol-based hand sanitizer ban \"ridiculous.\" While no Nebraska inmates have tested positive for Covid-19 so far, four prison staffers have. Kubik, who is serving a 5-to-10 year sentence for drug possession, argued that the department is not testing enough inmates, even those who show symptoms. A state corrections department spokesperson did not respond to requests about the department's testing of inmates. Kubik said there are 112 inmates living in his housing unit, which was designed for 75 people, and sharing just seven sinks. He said having access to alcohol-based hand sanitizer would be helpful in an environment where he sleeps arm's length away from other inmates and \"social distancing does not exist.\" \"There's no way to keep this environment clean and sanitary,\" he said. \"I feel like cattle in a feedlot waiting for my turn to die.\" Soap may not be enough, experts saySeveral of the corrections agencies that ban inmates from using sanitizer point out that the CDC recommends washing hands with soap and water as the best way to kill the virus. Some of the states with the largest inmate populations, such as Texas, Florida and Pennsylvania, say that the free soap and other toiletries they're providing inmates go far enough. \"Some hand sanitizers are flammable, thus creating a security concern,\" said Susan McNaughton, a spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections. \"We have educated inmates about how to properly wash their hands and given them free bars of antibacterial soap. We also provide them with cleaning supplies to keep their cells clean.\" Still, experts and advocates for inmates' rights said they worried that soap isn't enough in all prisons. Venters, the former Rikers Island medical chief, noted that sinks in some correctional facilities are often broken or limit the amount of water they let out at a time, making it difficult for inmates to scrub their hands for the recommended 20 seconds. Venters warned that outbreaks could have a big impact outside prison walls, potentially overwhelming smaller hospitals near remote prisons and putting correctional staff and their families at risk. \"Slowing the infection behind bars both saves lives inside the prison and flattens the curve outside for the community,\" he said. And some family members of inmates say official policies aren't always carried out. The Florida Department of Corrections said in a statement that soap is \"available in inmate restrooms\" and \"replenished as needed.\" But Jill Trask, whose husband Joel is an inmate at Lake Correctional Institution near Orlando, said he told her prisoners there are currently only given one small bar of soap a week. She said she had hoped to send him a supply of hand sanitizer and was surprised to find out that it was banned. Joel, who was convicted of aggravated assault for firing a shot at two teenagers, according to court records, has severe diabetes that makes him especially vulnerable to the virus, his wife said. The facility is filthy and social distancing is all but impossible, she added. \"Their punishment is time, not death,\" Jill said. \"I literally have a grown man on the phone crying from fear.\" Patchwork of restrictions Some inmates have turned to the courts for help improving hygiene in their facilities. Two elderly Texas inmates sued their state prisons department in March, asking for hand sanitizer, face masks and more soap and paper towels, along with stepped-up social distancing practices. In the lawsuit, the inmates' lawyers called Covid-19 a \"ticking time bomb\" for the state prison system. But while a federal district court judge ruled in their favor, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals last month temporarily blocked his order from going into effect. The state government had argued that it was doing enough to address the threat of the disease in its prisons. For now, inmates face a patchwork of rules on hand sanitizer use from state to state. In Montana, hand sanitizer is banned at the state's prison for men, but it's dispensed regularly to inmates at the prison for women, a spokeswoman said. In Arkansas and North Dakota, inmates can't have their own sanitizer, but corrections officers carry it and can give some to inmates. Meanwhile, shortages have gotten in the way of some states' plans to offer inmates sanitizer. Kansas prisons plan to provide it to inmates in a controlled manner, but sanitizer supplies are currently back ordered, a spokesman said. Randall Liberty, the Maine Department of Corrections commissioner, said his state had moved swiftly to scrap all restrictions on hand sanitizer use by inmates -- part of a response to the virus that he credited with preventing any confirmed infections among the state's approximately 2,000 prisoners. \"I think we need to use all the tools that we have available to prevent the spread of Covid-19 in our facilities,\" Liberty said in an interview. \"We've had no problems so far.\"",

        "body": "He signed up for a coronavirus vaccine trial using a method that's never been used in humans. Here's why.\n\nBy Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent\n\nUpdated 9:58 PM ET, Fri April 24, 2020\n\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Despite all his medical knowledge, 31-year-old medical student and Ph. D. candidate Sean Doyle couldn't know for certain all the risks of the injection he had just received in his right shoulder at Emory University Hospital. Yes, of course he was told of the potential side effects, such as soreness in his arm, a fever, malaise. But when you are among the first people in the world to receive a vaccine injection, the real answer about the risks is simply \"we don't know.\"\n\nIn fact, it's those very questions that he is helping us answer. Sean is helping all of us figure out if it is safe, by putting up his hand first and volunteering. With that injection, Sean had become a critical part of the fastest moving vaccine trials in the history of the world, a vaccine for Covid-19.During a pandemic, the urgency is understandable. In just a few months, the virus has spread to nearly every corner of the globe and sadly taken more lives than several wars or natural disasters combined. It is also true that no one on the planet is immune to this; such is the nature of a novel or new coronavirus. As you process all that, remember that last Thanksgiving, this wasn't even a real concern for human beings, and not even a topic of idle conversation. And, now it is the only thing being discussed in hospitals, boardrooms and at kitchen tables every night, often by Zoom. So, yes. The urgent pace is quite understandable but we have to make sure we can sprint, while also not tripping, falling and getting hurt. When I sat outside with Sean recently at Emory School of Medicine in Atlanta, where he is studying and I am on the neurosurgery faculty, it may have appeared to be just another meeting between student and teacher. If you looked a little closer, however, you would've noticed that we were sitting several feet apart, masks tucked around our necks, raising our voices a bit to make sure we could be heard. I really wanted to understand how Sean had decided to volunteer for an experimental vaccine. I wanted to understand how he processed and assessed risk. As a dad, I wanted to know what his parents thought.Read MoreIt was no surprise to me that, despite the fact he hadn't been born yet, Sean was familiar with the story of the swine flu vaccine of 1976. In January of that year, a new or novel virus began spreading at Fort Dix in New Jersey. Fearful that this new virus might cause a pandemic like the one in 1918, the United States rushed a vaccine through development. Within a year, nearly 25% of Americans had been vaccinated, around 45 million people. Without enough time to perform adequate safety trials, however, devastating side effects started to emerge. Hundreds of people developed Guillain-Barre syndrome, a paralysis that starts in the feet and slowly marches up your body. Several people also died, and for some, a fear of vaccination remains to this day. \"That was definitely a concern,\" Sean told me, \"potentially developing things like Guillain-Barre. It is a risk.\"With this particular vaccine, no one knows what the chances of that are. But those potential risks are outweighed, I think, by the potential benefits of this vaccine, because right now there are no great preventative measures for containing this virus.\" A bold timetable for a challenging diseaseDr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar focused on emerging infectious disease at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University, notes the timeline for this vaccine is quick compared to others. U.S. health officials have said a vaccine could be ready in 12 to 18 months -- lighting speed in the world of vaccine development.\"Vaccine development is usually measured in years and sometimes even decades,\" Adalja said. \"And there are some infectious diseases for which we have no vaccine after decades and decades of work, like HIV or hepatitis C, for example.\"\"The only way that we're going to really contain this virus is with the vaccine,\" Adalja said.Dr. Peter Hotez, a leading expert on infectious disease and vaccine development at Baylor College of Medicine, believes the 12-to-18-month timeline may be wishful thinking.\"I can't think of another example where things have gone that quickly,\" Hotez said. The quickest vaccine ever developed was against mumps. After vaccine inventor Maurice Hilleman isolated the mumps virus from his 5-year-old daughter in 1963, it sped to market in four years. Doing that in a fraction of the time would be a challenge, Hotez believes.\"We're certainly trying, I mean, our scientists are working day and night in the lab now,\" he said.When side effects mean giant setbacksSafety is always paramount, but especially with vaccines. Unlike therapeutics, which are often first trialed in people with the late stage of a disease, vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent the disease. The risk of causing illness or even death in an otherwise healthy person haunts everyone involved in the coronavirus response.Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies programme, said in a briefing last month that time is needed to test the new vaccines.\"Many people are asking, 'Well why do we have to test the vaccines? Why don't we just make the vaccines and give them to people?' Well the world has learned many lessons in the mass use of vaccines and there's only one thing more dangerous than a bad virus, and that's a bad vaccine,\" Ryan said. \"We have to be very, very, very careful in developing any product that we're going to inject into potentially most of the world population. We have to be very, very, very careful that we first do no harm. So that's why people are being careful.\" The 1976 swine flu vaccine debacle is one of the best-known instances, but there have been more recent failures. In 2017, a campaign to vaccinate nearly 1 million children for mosquito-borne dengue virus in the Philippines had to be stopped because the vaccine actually raised the risk of severe dengue infection in some people. Ten children died.In the rush to protect kids against an infection that makes 400 million people sick and kills 22,000 every year globally, officials ignored warnings that the vaccine should only be used in people who have already been infected once. Dengue is actually caused by four different viruses and the first infection is usually mild, while the later infections are more dangerous. In this situation, vaccinating people who had never been infected sometimes raised their risk of complications if they were then infected with a different strain.The earliest vaccines, such as the smallpox vaccine used for hundreds of years, involved inoculating people with a real, live, virus in the hope that a controlled dose and infection would provide immunity. It was a gamble, and many people became very ill or died from such attempts.Later vaccines used related but less harmful viruses. In the 20th century, scientists learned how to kill or weaken viruses and bacteria in the lab and use those to vaccinate.Hotez believes safety controls are better now, but the timeline still presents a challenge.\"The question is, will a year to 18 months be adequate time to monitor for safety?\" he asked.Can we hijack genetic material to get a vaccine faster?Typically, vaccines are first tested in the lab and then in animals before they get to the three-stage clinical trials stage. Phase I clinical trials look at whether the vaccine is safe in a few people. The second phase involves more people, who are often given varying doses to test whether the vaccine causes the desired immune response and which dose might work best. The third and final phase gathers data on whether the vaccine really protects people, usually in real-life conditions.Because coronavirus is such an overwhelming threat, this careful and ponderous timeline is being compacted enormously. Vaccines started human testing just months into the pandemic, and some tests are being run simultaneously on humans and animals. Remember, vaccines work on a simple principle: priming the body's immune system to recognize, attack and neutralize a bacterial or viral infection.Vaccine makers got a head start on a Covid-19 vaccine because work had already started on vaccines against two related coronaviruses: severe acute respiratory syndrome or SARS, which infected about 8,000 people and killed close to 800 before it was stopped in 2004, and Middle East respiratory syndrome virus or MERS, which causes occasional outbreaks.So scientists already knew a great deal about the mechanism by which this particular virus used its spike protein to enter human cells and how to inhibit that process.One new approach relies on using genetic material that looks like bits of a microbe and that stimulates the body to produce an immune response. There's no chance of accidental infection, because no virus is actually used. For coronavirus, one hope is that using messenger RNA -- the genetic material that directs cells to produce something -- will offer the quickest and safest path.In this case, the RNA vaccine would stimulate cells to make those spike proteins that look like pieces of coronavirus. If it works properly, upon being exposed to those engineered fragments of the virus, the body would be taught to recognize them, and be prepared to defend against them if there was a future attack or infection. RNA vaccines are quick and relatively easy to make, which is why they are already being tested in people. All a lab needs is the genetic sequence of the virus. But no such vaccine has ever been approved for use in the population. Another, more time-tested approach to fighting coronavirus employs viral vector vaccines. These use viruses harmless to people, genetically engineered to carry bits of the target virus -- in this case, the Covid-19 virus. The harmless virus causes a symptom-free infection, and the immune system learns to recognize the harmful genes.But while the technology means quick progress, Adalja said they are also still new.They can fail, or produce unexpected side effects.When it comes to RNA vaccines, \"there is no precedent yet for them being approved for use and, and we don't know everything about them in terms of how they're going to behave in large numbers of people and what the side effect profile they might be,\" Adalja said.It's something that Sean Doyle has considered not only now, but once before as well. Back in 2017, he raised his hand to be among the first to be injected with the Ebola vaccine. He was a first-year medical student at the time, and watched as the first patient in the United States was treated at his medical school, Emory. Sean remembers exactly what led him to participate.\"I remember the fear that was surrounding both the outbreak in West Africa,\" he said. \"The fear for the folks there and their health, but also fear about whether or not the virus could get out from West Africa and spread to other places around the world.\"And while the outbreak was contained before the vaccine trial began, he knew taking part of the trial meant if it ever happened again, there could be a vaccine that would hopefully be deployed quickly.Then, like now, Sean knows it's volunteers like him who put themselves at risk for the greater good -- whatever that entails.\"There were conversations that I had with friends and family,\" he said. \"They all expressed concerns about getting an experimental vaccine like this where no one knows what the side effects might be. But they trusted my judgment.\"\n\nCNN's Mallory Simon contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)The White House has rolled out a plan to reopen the country, but some state officials say they're ignoring the directives, while others rush to reopen before health officials -- and even the administration's three-phase plan -- say it's wise.\n\nThen there are city, county and other local leaders who wield their own authority over parts of the pandemic response, from lockdown enforcement and remote schooling to contact tracing and public transit -- sometimes at odds with the marching orders of those above them.It's clear America's governments aren't singing in the same choir. As states and cities reopen with uneven parameters, the country risks seeing a repeat of episodes it saw earlier in the pandemic.In February, New Orleans went ahead with Mardi Gras and Miami Gardens, Florida, hosted the Super Bowl, only to say later the events helped spread the virus. New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell is among many local politicians who criticized the federal government's guidance in the early days of the pandemic.Read MoreThe blame game is still being played by officials at all levels of government, but when it comes to protecting residents, who really is in charge?\"It's the federal government whose hands are tied,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"Local governments have that capacity. They have the best idea of what's going on in a community. ... They're on the ground.\"A World Health Organization epidemiologist concurs, saying Wednesday that integral to reopening is knowing where the infections are, how far they've transmitted and whether they're under control.\"It's not a one-size-fits-all, and what countries need to do -- and what decision-makers need to do -- is to evaluate the situation in their countries at the lowest administrative level as they can to determine what can be lifted where and when,\" WHO's Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove said. Locals are hamstrung in certain respects. They can't shut down an airport or develop their own test kits without federal approval, for instance. Also complicating matters for local governments is that \"some states give more authority to cities and counties than others,\" said Elizabeth Kellar, public policy director for the International City/County Management Association.\"There's sometimes tension between the governor's preference and the local government's situation on the ground,\" she said. Look no further than Atlanta, where Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms is \"at a loss as to what the governor is basing this decision on\" and is exploring whether she can legally institute rules for her city that conflict with Gov. Brian Kemp's order to reopen parts of the state's economy, she told CNN. So, when the different levels of government are operating from different, or conflicting, playbooks, what is a city or county government to do? What can residents demand?Quite a lot, experts say, and that may be important as some states reopen, or if Covid-19 resurges, or in the event of another novel outbreak. Here's what they advise:Shut down events where distancing is unlikelyCantrell has a point when she says federal guidance didn't point to a need to shut down Mardi Gras. On Fat Tuesday, February 25, President Donald Trump said coronavirus was \"very well under control in our country.\" The next day, he predicted cases would drop to zero within days. About a week later, as warnings about the spread of Covid-19 grew more dire, Miami asked the Ultra Music Festival to postpone the electronic dance music party, which it did, and Austin, Texas, put the kibosh on South by Southwest. Certain gatherings are more conducive to spreading a respiratory virus, and Adalja believes Miami and Austin made the right calls, he said.\"It doesn't take a lot to understand mass gatherings like Mardi Gras are a focal point for spread,\" he said. Trace and trackThis is most important at the outset of an outbreak. Optimally, a testing dragnet would be launched, but when testing faces federal approval and supply chain hurdles, delaying implementation as it did in the United States, knowledge is key, Kellar said. Local health workers should catalog every person who has Covid-19 and everyone they've been in contact with, as well as identify every place an infected person visited.The latter is especially important because those locations \"become areas where when symptoms develop, they know to self-quarantine and get tested,\" Kellar said. Signs should be placed on the doors of those locations, explaining the date and time the patient tested positive, she said. EducateIf there is one facet of pandemic response where locals face no limitations, it's educating the public. Beach Cities Health District, which serves the California cities of Hermosa Beach, Manhattan Beach and Redondo Beach, counts preventative and community health among its primary missions. So when coronavirus hit its radar in January, it began asking residents to exercise caution. \"We wanted to get the word out early. That's the business we're in,\" district CEO Tom Bakaly said. Within weeks, it began a dialogue with city, education and business leaders and started issuing advice on how residents could protect themselves. It isn't just about washing hands and social distancing, either. The district's website also includes information on which restaurants offered takeout, stretches to keep the back limber after working at a dining table all day and other ways to improve happiness during the self-isolated life. It also links residents with experts in regular online chats, which served to both educate and connect. \"Worry, stress and feeling disconnected is something we know our community is experiencing, which is why we wanted to tailor or information around that,\" Bakaly said. Jump on the mythsJust as important as disseminating good information is snuffing out bad information and scams, Kellar said. In addition to informing the public of the latest news on prevention, treatments and vaccines, it's important to explain: No, those theories you read on Facebook about garlic or booze preventing Covid-19 have no merit. And that robocall you received trying to sell you low-cost Covid-19 insurance? Hang up. Keeping everybody safe is the practical and common sense mission, she said, but \"there's a lot of noise, I think, that can get in the way of using that common sense,\" she said.Thomaston, Maine, and other jurisdictions across the country experienced some of that noise when residents received texts saying someone they knew had contracted Covid-19 and urged them to get tested. \"DO NOT click the link!\" the Thomaston Police Department warned residents, explaining the text was a scam aimed at opening \"a gateway for bad actors to find their way into your world.\"Combating the myths can be a little more problematic when leaders are providing different guidance to their constituents.\"We certainly have not spoken with one voice as a nation, and that's a challenge,\" Kellar said. CoordinateCities and counties, especially those where residents cross local borders for work, shopping or recreation, should form regional groups to fine tune their response and recovery. Local demographics and geography are crucial factors in determining how to combat a virus. It's also important to consult with state and federal partners, but as Covid-19 has shown, that's not always possible for local leaders. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declined multiple requests for an interview about how the agency teams with and advises local governments during a pandemic, but its gateway for public health professionals explains how CDC provides data, tool kits, communication tips, case studies from similar jurisdictions and \"an informal sounding board\" to discuss issues. Maximize the message's reachLocal newspapers are useful in spreading information, and local broadcasts are \"terribly important,\" Kellar said, while social media \"is a curse and a blessing.\"Yet just like determining which businesses are essential, one size does not fit all cities, she said. Are all the languages spoken in a community covered? Are pockets of poverty better reached by public access channels or by local network affiliates that broadcast over the air? Can shelters or community groups help spread the word to the homeless?Beach Cities Health District did something that's almost unheard of in 2020: Staffers picked up the phones. Aware it might have issues reaching its older residents, the district -- which converted its entire staff to coronavirus-related tasks last month -- expanded its call center and touched base with seniors to check on their health and provide them the district's hotline number. \"It was important to us to just check in with everybody,\" Bakaly said. \"At a time when we're asking people to physically distance, we want to make sure they stay connected.\"Protect the most at-riskThough information showed coronavirus was hitting China's elderly and smokers the hardest, it seemed less discriminate when it hit American shores, where different health factors are at play. It's important to know which health factors most affect your community, experts says. Age is one important factor. Local leaders can protect children by shutting down schools and moving to remote learning. In some cities, leaders have shut down playgrounds or removed basketball hoops in public parks. Protecting the elderly may mean curbing visitation at retirement homes, or asking grocery stores to designate special times for them to shop. As for the impoverished, leaders should realize the problems inaccessible health care pose -- not just during the pandemic, but historically, Kellar said. If a lack of money or insurance prevents someone from going to the doctor, she or he might not even know they have a preexisting condition that could make Covid-19 deadlier, she said. Bolster suppliesIn South Dakota, local governments in rural pockets of the state lack resources and rely heavily on state government. The state's health systems have been good at spreading important information, but information is but one part of an effective response, said Dr. Robert Summerer, president of the South Dakota State Medical Association.\"As we prepare for a higher volume of patients, we want to make sure we have the appropriate supplies,\" he said, adding that having critical care staffing in place is also important. As the state-v.-state scramble for personal protection equipment and ventilators has shown, a state should have equipment in hand before it needs it, Summerer said, raising questions of storage -- and of waste, if the supplies come with an expiration date. There needs to be a plan in place beforehand, he said. Make telemedicine easyAlso important for those in far-flung locales is access to doctors, a problem only exacerbated during a pandemic when medical professionals might find themselves overwhelmed. Telemedicine can help, though there are limitations to examining patients via laptops or phones. \"Telemedicine is exploding,\" Summerer said. \"That's an area that we're really going to see grow during the epidemic.\"State and federal legislation can help, he said, as there are concerns about ensuring doctors and staff are paid properly and patients' privacy is protected, as well as licensing and record-keeping requirements. Put the right people in chargeThis one seems simple, but politics tends to muddy even the most facile of notions. Just like an emergency manager would be handed the reins during a hurricane, someone with expertise in public health or epidemiology needs to be in charge during a pandemic -- and leaders should be looking at success stories on the West Coast and abroad to determine what works and what didn't, Kellar said. Some examples might be South Korea's broad testing initiative that experts say hastened the flattening of the curve in the country, and California's early stay-at-home order or its rapid procurement of medical equipment, which is said to have saved lives. \"That health officer needs to be in charge,\" Kellar said. Local governments enjoy more public trust than do state or federal governments, she said, so they need to be careful not to betray it. Information should be straightforward, easy to digest and never sugarcoated. Don't try to scare people, either, she said. You don't want residents to tune out. \"The places that have done better had residents listening, and doing what needs to be done,\" she said.Set a good exampleLeaders lead not just with words but with actions, whether it's coughing into their elbows or social distancing during briefings.Kellar pointed to Norwood, Massachusetts, where town manager Tony Mazzucco and 10 other officials self-quarantined in their homes after attending an event where someone had Covid-19.Mazzucco later shared his own positive test and regularly updated the media on his condition and quarantine, advice from local and state health officials and Norwood's plan of action, which included disinfecting town hall. In Montgomery County, Maryland, County Executive Marc Elrich has repeatedly provided positive examples for his community, including posting a YouTube tutorial of himself \"clumsily making his own mask\" from an old purple T-shirt, Kellar said. \"It helps when local leaders also model what needs to be done,\" she said. \"They wear their masks when they're out.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A month after announcing that all nonessential health care should be delayed amid the coronavirus pandemic, the Trump administration released recommendations on restarting elective surgeries and procedures.\n\nResuming these surgeries on an outpatient basis is part of the administration's phase one plan to reopen the country and get Americans back to work. But before phase one can start, a state or region would have to have a downward trajectory of documented and potential coronavirus cases for two weeks and hospitals would have to have a robust testing program in place.The postponement of elective surgeries has delayed many patients' ability to get needed care and has wreaked havoc on hospital finances, forcing some to furlough employees and cut pay and hours -- even for emergency room doctors in areas without many cases.Congress set aside $100 billion for hospitals and health care providers to make up for lost revenue and cover additional expenses to combat the outbreak as part of its $2 trillion relief package. Lawmakers are looking at funneling billions more to the sector in their next bill.Restarting elective procedures will be determined on a state and local basis, and hospitals must meet certain criteria, said Seema Verma, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Read MoreFacilities must evaluate and prioritize what care should be given, screen staff and patients for symptoms, including temperature checks, and have sufficient personal protective equipment and other supplies on hand. Social distancing and sanitizing protocols should be in place.Also, when adequate testing capability is established, patients should be tested before care and staff should be regularly screened by lab tests.And conditions should be continuously evaluated since these procedures may have to halt if a surge in coronavirus cases takes place.The recommendations are generally in line with a road map released last week by four medical industry groups, including the American Hospital Association. It also stressed the importance of having a sustained reduction in cases, an adequate supply of staff, supplies and beds, availability of testing and the prioritization of cases, including cancer and transplants.The governors of several states, including Texas, Alaska, Oklahoma and West Virginia, have recently announced the loosening of restrictions on elective surgeries as part of the effort to reopen their states.",

        "body": "(CNN)Public health officials studying the Covid-19 outbreak among members of a Washington choir found numerous ways the virus could have spread, according to a report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAuthorities interviewed all 122 members of the Skagit Valley Chorale, which met every Tuesday for 2.5 hours before the outbreak. They focused on two rehearsals held March 3 and March 10 in Mount Vernon, Washington.The report said 53 people were sickened and two died -- and all but one attended both rehearsals. The report said Thirty-three cases were confirmed, the report said, and 20 people had probable infections.There were 61 people at the March 10 rehearsal, including one member who reported having had cold-like symptoms. That person tested positive for Covid-19 and was the first case identified by health authorities, according to the report.That person attended both practices but didn't start showing symptoms until March 7.Read MoreCounty officials issued social distancing recommendations on March 10, but most people were probably not yet aware of them, according to a statement from Skagit County Public Health.No one reported physical contact between the attendees at the practices, but they sat close together. The report said the chairs were 6-10 inches apart, but there were empty seats between some of the members. The choir broke into two groups for part of the practice. Members moved closer together for that 45-minute session, they said.\"The act of singing, itself, might have contributed to transmission through emission of aerosols, which is affected by loudness of vocalization,\" the report said. The report also said that some people, known as superemitters, release more aerosol particles during speech than their peers.There was also a 15-minute snack break with cookies and oranges. Members moved the chairs before and after the rehearsal and congregated around a chair rack, the report said.\"This underscores the importance of physical distancing, including maintaining at least 6 feet between persons, avoiding group gatherings and crowded places, and wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain during this pandemic,\" the report said.Attendees developed symptoms between one day to 12 days after the March 10 practice, the report said.Most of the singers were women (84%) and their median age was 69, the report said. Only 32% reported having underlying health conditions.The choir emailed members March 15 to let them know that some people had gotten sick. Many had self-quarantined by the time health officials contacted them, and the report said this may have mitigated further spread.The study was conducted by Skagit County Public Heath officials and published in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.",

        "body": "(CNN)As coronavirus test kits were malfunctioning in public health labs across the country, Dr. Robert Redfield repeatedly assured his fellow task force officials in February that the problem would be quickly solved.\n\nThe White House had little reason to doubt Redfield. His agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, had a storied history as the preeminent testing authority.Even as the problem persisted and days stretched into weeks, Redfield and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar -- then the lead of the coronavirus task force -- provided \"assurances it was being dealt with,\" a senior administration official said. Most other members of the recently created White House task force -- officials from the chief of staff's office and the National Security Council -- weren't public health experts. They placed their faith in the nation's top health officials. \"When the CDC, who was has always been able to handle these things -- when they tell us they have this thing under control, who are we to say, 'You double PhDs, MDs who have been doing this for years, no you're wrong,'\" said the administration official.Read MoreIt took roughly three weeks to sort out the failed test kits, far longer than the CDC had anticipated. Along the way, regulators would discover the lab producing the test kits was contaminated, likely causing the tests to malfunction, according to a senior administration official. Officials would scramble to cobble together a solution to get diagnostic tests to the states. And throughout it all, the deadly virus ---- far more contagious than health experts initially thought -- was spreading across the country, largely undetected.In addition to squandering time on the flawed test, federal officials failed to ensure there would be ample testing supplies to support the effort, established such restrictive testing guidelines that sick people were being denied tests, and did not fully enact a 2018 agreement with public and private labs aimed at quickly enlisting their help in such a health crisis. By the time commercial labs were brought into the effort, the demand for tests was so high that backlogs further delayed results, CNN found. The Trump administration's failure to quickly scale up testing would continue to cripple the US response to the pandemic for months. Even now -- three months after the first detected case of the coronavirus in the US -- testing remains a key challenge to President Donald Trump's push to reopen the economy. \"There's very little that has gone well. Actually, I'm not sure what has gone well,\" said Scott Becker, who heads a national association of health labs and has been deeply immersed in the response to the crisis. \"It's just been a continuing cascade of challenges.\"Caitlin Oakley, an HHS spokeswoman, defended testing efforts under Azar.\"Secretary Azar responded with urgency at every step of the response and continues to do so,\" she said in a statement to CNN. Any insinuation that he didn't is \"just plain wrong and disproven by the facts.\"A CDC spokesman said Redfield did not offer any assurances about how long it would take to fix the testing problem because the CDC didn't know what was causing it at the time.This account of the administration's struggle to build a widespread testing infrastructure is based on documents from public records requests, internal records from a private testing facility obtained by CNN, and interviews with current and former government officials, public health experts, doctors and scientists.The test fails Public health officials were eagerly awaiting the CDC test kits when they were shipped out Feb. 6.In Orange County, Calif., staffers in the public health lab worked over the weekend to get the test up and running. They quickly grew frustrated, realizing they couldn't validate the test.\"Lab networks talk,\" said Dr. Matt Zahn, medical director for the communicable disease control division of the Orange County Health Care Agency. \"We were all talking to each other around the country saying there is a problem here. What wasn't clear is what the solution to that would be.\"Zahn knew the virus was likely circulating in the community because California has a lot of travelers to and from Asia. His mind drifted to worst-case scenarios.\"If a virus gets into healthcare facilities, gets into hospitals, gets into nursing homes -- that was our major concern,\" he said. \"It was just really tough.\"Within days of shipping out the tests, the CDC began getting reports that they weren't functioning properly. By Feb. 10, more than half the states were reporting problems with the test kits, a federal official said.The CDC notified the Food and Drug Administration about the problem and began consulting with the FDA on ways to fix it.In the meantime, the only way to test a coronavirus patient in the US was to collect a sample and send it to the CDC for testing. On average, the official said in those initial testing days it took \"three to four days\" to get a result back to the person who took the specimen.Leadership vacuumIt was the sort of problem that Trump boasts he's well-suited to solve: Test kits desperately needed to track and help control the rapidly spreading coronavirus were partly tangled in government red tape that needed to be cut. The clock was ticking.Lives were on the line.But for weeks, the President, who casts himself as a take-charge, hands-on, problem-solver-in-chief continued to publicly downplay the entire coronavirus threat even as the debacle over a botched government test played out.There was a leadership vacuum in the West Wing as acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney had fallen out of favor with Trump, but his replacement, Mark Meadows, had not yet been named.The result was no early, coordinated push from the White House to scale up testing, perhaps by pursuing alternatives, like authorizing the test the World Health Organization had distributed to other countries or soliciting help from labs in commercial, hospital or university settings. In fact, the government had a signed agreement to deal with just such a crisis. In 2018, on the heels of the Zika virus scare, officials realized the need to engage commercial labs in testing at the outset of an outbreak. But the pact was not enacted to speed up testing in the early stages of the Covid-19 response. As for the President, he was still in denial and publicly predicting the virus would \"miraculously\" go away. Sleepless nightsBecker, CEO of the Association of Public Health Laboratories, was having trouble sleeping.He had been \"peppering CDC constantly\" for an update on when new tests for the virus would be distributed.He's been on calls with the CDC since before the initial roll out.\"We all knew there was a problem,\" Becker recalled in an interview with CNN.\"It was desperation. We have to break through this,\" he recalled thinking as the delay continued. \"I was panicking. I was just trying to rack my brain, thinking about 'what can we do?'He woke up on Sunday, Feb. 23 with \"a crazy idea\": To write the FDA and seek permission for the labs he represents to \"create and implement\" their own tests.\"We recognize the gravity of the current Covid-19 situation across the globe,\" Becker and a colleague wrote to FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn the following day. \"Hence this extraordinary and rare request.\" Two days later, Hahn effectively greenlit Becker's proposal, allowing his group's labs to apply to design a test under one blanket application as opposed to having to file them separately.FDA officials insist that the labs had always had the ability to create their own tests. But FDA regulations, specially imposed once a state of emergency had been declared, proved daunting to commercial and clinical labs. Around this same time, Redfield, the CDC director, appeared before a Congressional subcommittee. In prepared remarks, he talked about the CDC's testing rollout earlier that month and acknowledged \"an issue with one of the testing components was discovered.\"He did not detail the problem or say what caused it, according to the statement, but told committee members his agency was \"working on remanufacturing the test kit.\" ContaminatedBehind the scenes a more troublesome issue was emerging: In its rush to create tests, the CDC had done so in one of its laboratories rather than one of its manufacturing facilities, compromising the manufacturing process, according to administration officials. \"CDC did not manufacture its test consistent with its own protocol,\" an FDA spokesperson said.FDA officials were getting mixed messages in mid-February about why the CDC test kits were malfunctioning. At first it appeared to be a manufacturing issue, but then the CDC suggested it could be a problem related to the test design, according to two FDA officials.That was worrisome to the FDA. On Feb. 22, a diagnostics expert at the agency, traveled to Atlanta and spent a couple of days at the CDC labs trying to figure out what was going on.According to an administration official, the FDA determined contamination was most likely occurring during the manufacturing process and that was causing the tests to malfunction. CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said the matter is being investigated. \"Routine quality control measures aim to identify these types of issues. Those measures were not sufficient in this circumstance, and CDC implemented enhanced quality control to address the issue and will be assessing this issue moving forward,\" Haynes said. Another federal official conceded: \"There was a rush to get kits out to the states, that might have led to some of the mistakes that were made in our lab, that's fair.\"In the final days of February, the FDA and the CDC worked out two solutions.The test kits the CDC already manufactured had three components, the third of which was malfunctioning. But the tests worked using two of the three components. So, the CDC and the FDA instructed states to use the original CDC test, but eliminate the test's third component.The CDC would also work with an outside manufacturer, IDT, to remanufacture test kits to be shipped to public health labs across the country.\"There's no question mistakes were made in the labs. And then you couple that with the regulatory process. It explains the weeks delay,\" the federal official said.\"That's the way it is.\"Everyone stays on this callAlarmed by the delay in getting tests up and running, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, asked for administration officials to convene by phone on Feb. 27, according to a senior administration official.Azar's chief of staff made clear to the call's participants -- which included FDA Commissioner Hahn, CDC Director Redfield, and other senior FDA and HHS aides -- that everyone was staying on the call until they could figure out a way to solve the testing shortage, the official said. A solution emerged: Loosen the FDA regulations to pave an easier path for outside labs to jump in on coronavirus testing.The FDA announced the change Feb. 29, effectively opening the floodgates for clinical labs to ramp up their coronavirus testing efforts.\"The FDA's regulations have not hindered or been a roadblock to the rollout of tests during this pandemic,\" Hahn said in a March 30 statement.Invisible enemyThe delays in coronavirus testing would prove costly.Many officials initially underestimated how contagious the coronavirus would be. Initial guidelines from the CDC called for screening patients for travel only from Wuhan, China, which immediately raised red flags with other public health officials.\"We will be instructing our healthcare providers to ask about any travel from China as we expect this to broaden in the very near future,\" Arkansas Secretary of Health Nathaniel Smith wrote to other state health officials across the country on Jan. 21 -- the day the first US case of the coronavirus was reported. It was one of the thousands of emails obtained by CNN in public records requests.The CDC was slow to broaden its geographical screening guidelines to include the rest of Asia as well as Europe. And its list of symptoms didn't account for gastrointestinal distress, loss of taste and smell or eye infections that some coronavirus victims would wind up presenting with. Experts were learning new information about the virus in real time, but some say the CDC was slow to adjust.\"The definition of who could be tested was pretty tightly drawn,\" said William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt University School of medicine and longtime CDC adviser. \"The CDC really persisted, from my point of view, considerably too long with that very narrow focus.\" A federal official defended CDC, saying agency officials based their decisions on data they had at the time.Even as it became clear the virus was spreading person-to-person in the US, Redfield said January 30, \"the immediate risk to the American public is low.\"Meantime, flights began arriving in the US, evacuating Americans from China. An outbreak emerged at a nursing home near Seattle, killing dozens of people associated with the facility. And the US began bringing home Americans stranded on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which had been ravaged by the coronavirus.\"It was just sad,\" Jeffrey Engel, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists said, reflecting back on the initial testing failures in February. \"I'm thinking if we had had that testing capacity that we had all hoped for two weeks earlier and shown community transmission, say in Seattle, we would have saved lives in that nursing home. I mean that's possible.\"So far, more than 40,000 have died from the coronavirus in the US, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\"This invisible enemy is tough and it's smart and it's vicious,\" Trump said Friday. 'We did a lot'Some health officials said there was almost certainly going to be a shortage of testing, even if the CDC hadn't stumbled so severely at the outset.\"There's quite a bit of discussion of, 'oh we missed the boat on being able to do any kind of containment,\" said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. \"I'm afraid we would have been behind on the containment one way or another.\"The US needed to dramatically scale up the workforce surrounding its testing infrastructure, Plescia said, to contact those who are infected and the people they came into contact with. That capacity wasn't available in state and local health departments in February and March, he said.As Trump agitates to reopen the economy, the White House is pushing a variety of strategies to help track the virus. It is setting up surveillance systems -- similar to those used to track flu outbreaks -- to monitor vulnerable communities for coronavirus. And it is aiming to ramp up antibody testing to determine who has already been exposed to the virus.But the White House is buckling under pressure from expectations the President set -- publicly.\"Anybody that wants a test can get a test,\" Trump said in a March visit to the CDC, surprising even some CDC officials.Now Trump is looking to shift the testing burden -- and blame -- to the states, insisting they have enough testing capacity to reopen, even as governors say they're still facing shortages of testing ingredients like swabs and reagents.Republican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said it's \"absolutely false\" that governors have plenty of tests and aren't doing their jobs. Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam called Trump's testing capacity claims \"delusional.\"Becker, the health labs CEO, said Saturday that he sees things \"easing up a bit,\" but that daunting challenges remain.For example, he said, his group recently received some 200,000 swabs for testing. The problem, he said, was that they'd requested 2.5 million.\"It's getting brighter,\" Becker said, referring to a light at the end of the tunnel. But, \"I still think we're at least a month away.\"Confronted during a recent White House briefing with the administration's failure to quickly ramp up testing, Trump insisted he and his team had not squandered key weeks in the month of February.When a reporter pressed for details of what had been done, Trump provided none.\"A lot. A lot,\" he said April 13. \"We did a lot.\"On Sunday, Trump turned to Twitter defend his efforts yet again.\"I am right on testing,\" he wrote.\n\nCNN's Kaitlan Collins, Bob Ortega, Curt Devine, Drew Griffin, and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)The constant stress of living in the age of coronavirus is affecting more than your mental health and emotional coping abilities. It's likely taking a toll on your body as well.\n\n\"We're living in a sea of stress hormones every day,\" said stress management expert Dr. Cynthia Ackrill, an editor for \"Contentment\" magazine, produced by the American Institute of Stress.\"We're not designed for a constant application of these chemicals,\" Ackrill said. \"The stress hormone cortisol just ravages our bodies when it's dumped into our system repeatedly.\"Designed to keep you functioning throughout the day, cortisol levels are meant to rise in the morning and decrease as the day lengthens. The hormone's purpose is to maintain blood sugar levels to keep your brain and muscles functioning and suppress non-vital systems like digestion that might drag your energy down. But when triggered by a stressful occurrence, cortisol levels suddenly spike, and can take hours to dissipate. If that stress is constant, those levels don't drop, leading to cortisol malfunction and a disease-causing boost in inflammation. Read More\"Inflammation is behind diabetes. Inflammation is behind heart disease. It's behind all of the autoimmune diseases. It's behind asthma and allergies, and the list goes on,\" Ackrill said.If you're genetically at risk or you already have an inflammatory condition, today's constant stress may well trigger or worsen your symptoms.\"The predispositions that people have, whether it is asthma or a history of migraine or underlying cardiovascular risk factors, stress on all of those are so much more acute now,\" said Kaufmann, who is now the associate dean for research and Innovation at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. \"People have daily stress and often times they don't have any control over it. That's when stress has its greatest impact,\" said neuroscientist Peter Kaufmann, former deputy chief of the Clinical Applications and Prevention Branch of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. Not dealing with that stress, he said, can even be deadly.\"In our work, we found that people who show physiological responses to mental stress have about a two- to three-fold higher mortality over the following five years,\" Kaufmann said.Here's how stress may be impacting five of your body's key systems.Your heartTension can directly increase heart rate and blood flow, and causes the release of cholesterol and triglycerides into the blood stream. Blood pressure can skyrocket from acute stress and may stay high as that stress continues.Yet hypertension and other heart disease symptoms are silent, with no real signs that you might be entering a danger zone. Some of our not-so-wonderful coping mechanisms, such as eating comfort food, drinking alcohol and smoking cigarettes or marijuana, can also raise our risk. Then there's the very real fear that we may lose someone we love to the coronavirus, or perhaps we already have. All of that can create a perfect storm of physical malfunction that may even shorten our lives.Kaufmann points to a recent study which showed how mental stress can cause a fall in cardiac ejection fraction -- a measure of how well your heart's main chamber pumps blood.\"The amount of blood that is pumped out by the heart with each stroke is reduced, and that fall is associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks, death, and unstable angina that requires hospitalization,\" Kaufman said.There's even such a thing as a stress-related heart attack, often called \"broken heart syndrome.\" It occurs when the heart is stunned by sudden stress, and its left ventricle weakens. \"That has been shown to be triggered by severe acute events, such as the sudden loss of a loved one or an earthquake,\" Kaufmann said. \"I think some of the post 9/11 cardiac events would fall in that category.\"In most cases, when the acute emotional stress dissipates, the heart recovers and goes back to its normal shape.\"But I've had patients who have developed acute congestive heart failure, life-threatening arrhythmias, even death from this condition,\" said New York cardiologist and author Dr. Sandeep Jauhar in a prior CNN interview. \"I think it's the clearest example of how our emotional lives directly affect our hearts.\"Your skinOne of the largest organs of the body, your skin is exquisitely sensitive to stress. \"The relationship between mind and skin is essential and undeniable,\" said dermatologist Dr. Alan Friedman, who is the interim chair of dermatology at the George Washington School of Medicine and Health Sciences.\"Stress absolutely exacerbates primary skin diseases from acne to psoriasis,\" Friedman said, \"It can 'wake up' chronic viral infections like herpes simplex [cold sores] and herpes zoster [shingles].\"Dermatologists across the country that CNN spoke to report increasing telehealth calls since March on such stress-related skin conditions as ache, eczema, psoriasis and shingles, a painful, blistery rash that can develop after having chicken pox.There's also an increase in calls from people experiencing the impact of increased hand washing and the wearing of personal protective equipment such as masks and gloves.\"Allergic contact dermatitis is huge right now where members of the public are now wearing gloves and masks they are not normally used to wearing,\" said Plano, Texas dermatologist Dr. Seemal Desai, who is on the board of directors for the American Academy of Dermatology.\"It's really quite alarming and disturbing how many skin conditions I'm seeing that are probably aggravated by stress and distress from the coronavirus,\" Desai said. \"It's out of control.\" Your lungsHaving chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is a key underlying health condition that puts one at higher risk for a more severe case of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. A group of diseases that cause airflow blockage and breathing issues, COPD includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Nearly 16 million Americans have COPD, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Stress and anxiety can cause shortness of breath, leading \"COPD symptoms to become worse and lead to further anxiety, faster breathing and fear,\" says the National Emphysema Foundation on its website.\"We tend to not breathe as well when we're stressed in general, so our oxygen exchange is worse. There's also a panic on top of it, which makes it worse,\" Ackrill said.Asthma is another underlying health condition that puts one at higher risk for a more severe case of Covid-19. Here again, stress is a common trigger for an asthma attack, and it can make existing symptoms worse. In fact, the stress a parent feels has even been linked to an increased risk for asthma in their children. One study looked at how parental stress affected the asthma rates of young children and found those with stressed out parents had a substantially higher risk of developing asthma.\"During an asthma attack it's almost like breathing through a straw because that inflammation is restricting the airway,\" said allergist Dr. Lakiea Wright in a prior CNN interview.\"You can imagine if a virus that causes extra inflammation gets in there, then that's going to be worse,\" said Wright, who specializes in allergies and immunology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. \"Those are the patients who might end up on ventilators to help with breathing because Covid-19 is doing a lot of damage in the lungs.\"Your brainStress is considered one of the most common triggers for headaches -- not just tension headaches, but migraines as well. Migraines are debilitating attacks that can level a person for hours to days with intense, throbbing pain, nausea and vomiting. According to the Migraine Research Foundation, the condition is the third most prevalent illness in the world, affecting 39 million men, women and children in the United States and one billion worldwide. Stress can cause migraines, the pounding pain creates more stress, and the circular pattern can make it tough for headache and migraine sufferers to cope.Chronic inflammation from stress can also affect the brain itself, shrinking or negatively affecting parts of the brain linked to memory, motivation and mental agility. That can lead to depression, anxiety and other mental disorders, which in another circular fashion are then made worse by stress.Chronic levels of cortisol can affect other chemicals in the brain which modulate cognition and mood, including serotonin, which is important for mood regulation and well-being. Elevated cortisol levels can also interfere with sleep, a key necessity for a happier, healthier attitude.Your gutOne thing stress doesn't do -- it doesn't cause peptic ulcers. That turned out to be a myth when science found this common type of ulcer is actually caused by a bacteria in the gut called H. pylori. Science estimates almost half of the world's population has H. pylori but not everyone gets an ulcer.However, stress can make ulcers worse. In fact, it can boost pain, bloating, nausea and other stomach discomfort from nearly every gastrointestinal complaint. First, we often overeat when tense, choose fatty comfort foods, overuse alcohol or smoke. All of those can increase chronic heartburn or gastroesophageal reflux disease, called GERD. Stress can affect how quickly food moves through the body, thus possibly causing gas, diarrhea and constipation. And for people with irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease or Crohn's disease, stress can increase their painful symptoms, such as cramping and diarrhea. Fight back against stressOne of the single best things to do to overcome stress is exercise. Exercise can create an anti-inflammatory response, improves mood, cognition and your physical health.Staying socially connected to friends and family -- a challenge while we are socially distancing -- is another great way to battle stress. Mindfulness and meditation are other key ways to ease tension, along with calming physical activities such as Tai Chi, yoga and gentle stretching.Those methods often teach deep breathing, another key way to reduce stress that can be used in the moment. To do it properly, breathe through your nose, hold it and then exhale very slowly out through your mouth like you're breathing through a straw.\"And when you breathe slowly out, you improve your whole picture of life and you reduce your nervousness,\" said trauma counselor Jane Webber, a professor of counselor education at Kean University in New Jersey, in a prior CNN interview.Webber also recommends cracking a smile. Watch funny movies, listen to comedy routines, ask everyone you talk to on the phone to tell you a joke. \"Remember, you can't be anxious and smile at the same time. That's a physiological thing,\" Webber said.Finally, do not hesitate to reach out for help, experts say. Cognitive behavioral therapy, a form of talk therapy that focuses on specific thoughts and actions, has been shown to help reduce stress when practiced with a therapist, Kaufmann said. \"It really takes people through mental exercises to understand whether or not certain kinds of reactions are appropriate under the circumstances and whether they have alternatives,\" he said.\"Without that cognitive aspect where people actually think about what's going on in their lives, you can't deal with the bigger issues simply by telling yourself to relax because those issues are going to continue,\" he added.If this worldwide epidemic can help us begin to talk about our stress and take action, that would be good news, Ackrill said.\"For decades we've swept stress under the carpet,\" she said. \"And without a model in our mind of what it was and without specific skills or resources to deal with it, most of us felt shame that we weren't dealing with stress well.\"Shame compounds it,\" Ackrill added. \"But I think now it may finally become a safe topic. I think it may finally safer to be vulnerable. And boy, do we need that. We need people to talk about it.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)When it comes to the coronavirus, South Australia ought to now be considered among the safest places in the world. That was the message from one of the country's leading public health officials this week, as much of Australia began the slow process of easing restrictions.\n\nThat many Australians now find themselves in such an enviable position would have been unthinkable only a month ago, during which time nationwide daily infection rates reached into triple figures. But on Friday, the entire country reported just 16 new cases, a sharp decline from a peak of 460 new infections on March 28.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday the National Cabinet will meet on May 8 to consider easing lockdown measures, bringing forward the discussion from the week beginning May 11.\"Australians have earned an early mark,\" Morrison said. \"We need to restart our economy, we need to restart our society.\" In some states, the curve has completely flattened: Queensland hasn't reported any new cases since Monday, and South Australia has seen no new infections for more than a week.Read More\"No more cases in South Australia. This is a landmark for us,\" South Australia Chief Public Health Officer Nicola Spurrier said with a big smile during a press briefing on Wednesday.The southern state of 1.6 million people, home to the country's fifth most populous city Adelaide, has reported 438 confirmed Covid-19 cases, with only 14 remaining active cases and four deaths, according to the SA government.\"I think many people are surprised in Australia at how well we have done. Really, when you look across all the states and territories, this is the safest place to be in the world, perhaps other than New Zealand,\" she said.Neighboring country New Zealand recently achieved its ambitious goal of \"eliminating\" the coronavirus, meaning that while the daily infection rate has yet to reach zero, the country is able to track the origins of each new case.In total, Australia, which has a population of around 25 million people, has reported 6,762 confirmed cases. Ninety two of those cases have resulted in death, and 5,720 have since recovered, according to the federal health authority. \"We're continuing to do very well around Australia to suppress the virus and we have well and truly flattened the curve of cases and new infections,\" said a spokesperson for the Australian Department of Health in a statement Thursday to CNN.\"Safety has been our fundamental focus and the success of our suppression strategy has meant Australia is in a very similar (place) to New Zealand, which has stated its strategy is aimed at elimination.\"Some Australian states have already started to begin the process of easing restrictive measures and social-distancing rules. West Australia and South Australia relaxed the limit on public gatherings, up from two people to 10 people. In Western Australia, which saw several \"zero-case\" days in the past week, national parks reopened on Friday, and nearly 60% public school students have returned for the start of a new term. In the remote Northern Territory, where no new cases have been reported for three weeks, residents will be able to use public swimming pools, waterparks, go fishing with friends and play golf starting from Friday. The state has also laid out plans to restart its economy, allowing restaurants, pubs and gyms to reopen on May 15 and lifting the remaining restrictions on June 5.Restrictive measuresAustralia's success in taming the outbreak started with early measures to bar entry from high-risk areas. On February 1, Australia joined the United States in closing its borders to all foreign visitors who had recently been in China, where the outbreak was first reported in December last year.As the virus spread and outbreaks flared beyond China, Australia barred entries from Iran, South Korea and Italy in early March, before closing its borders completely to all non-citizens and non-residents on March 19.But the country has also had its shares of missteps. On March 19, it allowed more than 2,600 passengers to disembark from the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney, despite multiple previous outbreaks elsewhere in the world involving cruise ships. Over 600 cases and 15 deaths have since been linked to the ship, according to public broadcaster ABC.As the number of cases soared in late March, Morrison announced on March 22 all bars, clubs, cinemas, gyms and places of worship would be closed indefinitely, while restaurants and cafes would be restricted to take-away only -- but supermarkets, clothing stores, chemists and beauty salons would be allowed to remain open.\"What we're doing is closing down gatherings in pubs and clubs and things of that nature, we're not putting in place lockdowns that would confine people to their home,\" Morrison said at the time.The state of Victoria closed schools, and some states, such as West Australia and South Australia, closed their borders, requiring anyone to enter to go into two weeks of quarantine.By the end of March, authorities imposed stricter social-distancing rules, limiting public gathering to two people from the previous 10. People were urged to stay home and only go out if it is \"absolutely essential,\" such as shopping for food, exercising, and for medical reasons. Ever expanding testingWhile closure of businesses, schools, travel restrictions and social distancing rules are common measures adopted by many governments around the world, Australia also paired these restrictions with widespread testing.To date, more than 570,000 tests have been conducted across Australia, according to the Department of Health.In comparison, the United Kingdom, with a population more than 2.5 times of Australia, has carried out 763,387 tests.On March 25, Australian expanded its testing criteria to include all health care workers, aged care workers, prisoners and people in other identified hotspots who have fever or acute respiratory symptoms. Previously, only people who recently returned from overseas or who had come into contact with a confirmed coronavirus case could be tested.Last week, the criteria was further expanded to anyone displaying even the mildest symptoms for Covid-19, Federal Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy announced.\"Anybody with acute respiratory symptoms, cough, sore throat, runny nose, cold symptoms, flu-like symptoms, can get tested,\" Murphy said at a press conference Friday, according to ABC.On Monday, Murphy said Australia will start testing asymptomatic cases for the first time \"to be absolutely sure that we are capturing every case that we can and that we're not missing cases.\"Drawing ire from BeijingWhile Australia appears to be successfully containing the coronavirus, it has become embroiled in a diplomatic spat with China after it demanded an international inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak.The bipartisan push for a global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, including China's handling of the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan, begun last week, with Foreign Minister Marise Payne urging China to allow transparency in the process, according to ABC.The push quickly drew the ire of Beijing, which slammed the move as \"political maneuvering.\"In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Chinese Ambassador Jingye Cheng even warned of an economic backlash if Australia continued its push for an independent inquiry, suggesting that the Chinese public may boycott Australian products or decide not to visit Australia in the future.A day after Cheng's stern warning, Morrison vowed to continue to push for the inquiry at a press conference on Wednesday, calling it a \"fairly obvious and common sense suggestion.\"\"This is a virus that has taken more than 200,000 lives across the world. It has shut down the global economy. The implications and impacts of this are extraordinary,\" he said.\"It would seem entirely reasonable and sensible that the world would want to have an independent assessment of how this all occurred, so we can learn the lessons and prevent it from happening again...I believe there will be support for at the right time, to ensure we do that,\" added Morrison.",

        "body": "(CNN)Less than a month ago, India's future looked dire.\n\nExperts predicted that the country could expect millions of coronavirus cases. Doctors warned that India needed to prepare for an onslaught of cases that could cripple the country's ill-equipped health system. Onlookers worried that the virus could spread like wildfire through India's slums, where residents live in cramped quarters and basic sanitation often isn't available. But so far, the world's second-most populous country appears to have avoided the worst. As of Tuesday, India had reported 31,360 coronavirus cases and 1,008 deaths, or about 0.76 deaths per million. Compare that to the United States, where the number of deaths per million is more than 175. Some experts say that India's relatively positive numbers suggest the country's nationwide lockdown to halt the spread of Covid-19 could be working -- for now. Read More\"India didn't wait for the problem to escalate,\" India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on April 14, as he extended the country's 21-day nationwide lockdown until May 3. \"Instead, as soon as the problem appeared, we tried to stop it by making swift decisions. I can't imagine what the situation would have been had such quick decisions not been taken.\"But the reality behind India's numbers is more complicated -- and experts caution that it is too early for India to congratulate itself. \"At least in this round, it appears that the virus has not been able to damage as much as been feared,\" Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India, a nonprofit that works on training, research and policy development. \"I don't think we can say that we have completely closed the book on this.\"How swift were Modi's decisions?On March 24, Modi announced that the country was going into a three-week lockdown.The scale of it was unprecedented. India has a population of 1.3 billion, and the only country with a bigger population -- China -- had imposed citywide lockdowns, but never a nationwide one. It was a high-stakes decision. Going into lockdown meant millions of daily-wage workers would be deprived of an income. But not imposing a lockdown risked overwhelming India's health care system. One model estimated that without social distancing measures, about 150 million people in India would be infected by June. On Friday, India's top pandemic official said that the country would have had more than 100,000 cases by now if it weren't for the lockdown. India moved into lockdown relatively quickly -- it was announced when the country had reported 519 coronavirus cases. By comparison, Italy waited until it had more than 9,200 coronavirus cases before it went into a nationwide lockdown, while the United Kingdom had about 6,700. Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, a non-profit research organization with offices in Washington, D.C., and New Delhi, said the decision to impose a lockdown promptly, even when case numbers was low, had likely reduced contact rates significantly.Following the lockdown, thousands of migrant workers attempted to leave India's major cities after the restrictions left them without jobs. That prompted fears that the migrants could spread the virus, with some officials in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh even spraying returning workers with disinfectant -- an ineffective approach to controlling coronavirus. Around a week after the lockdown began, two people had died from coronavirus in Mumbai's densely packed slums. Following the second death, several of the man's family members had been tested and placed under home quarantine, and the block of 300 homes and 90 shops that make up his neighborhood have been sealed off. By the time the lockdown was imposed, India had already taken other measures. On March 11, India suspended all tourist visas, and announced that all travelers who had been in the most-affected areas of the world in the past few weeks would be quarantined for at least 14 days. From March 22, all international commercial flights were banned from landing in India and all passenger train services in the country were suspended.The United States, by comparison, has restricted foreigners traveling from China, Iran, and certain European countries, but there is no blanket ban on foreigners entering the country.What if the numbers aren't right?As with every country, our understanding of the outbreak is only as good as the numbers we have available. And that depends on testing. According to India's Health Ministry, the country has conducted more than 625,000 tests as of Sunday -- more than South Korea, which has been praised for its approach to testing.When public health experts are assessing how aggressively a country is testing, they don't look at the total numbers alone -- instead, they often look at the country's test positivity rate. If a large proportion of the tests are coming back positive, that suggests that only the most serious cases -- such as those in hospital -- are being tested. According to Mike Ryan, the executive director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programs, a good benchmark is to have at least 10 negative cases for every positive one. Around 4% of India's tests are positive, according to data from India's Health Ministry -- well below that benchmark. It's also a significantly lower rate than the US, where the rate is about 17%, according to data from Johns Hopkins University (JHU). It's also lower than the UK, where the rate is around 21%, based on government data. Another useful measure is the proportion of cases that are fatal. In India, about 3% of cases have died, compared with more than 13% in Italy, the UK and France, according to JHU. That suggests that India is testing people besides those with the most serious symptoms. But India's testing rate is extremely low per capita. Only about 48 out of every 100,000 people have been tested, compared with around 1,175 in South Korea and 1,740 in the US. Samir Saran, the president of the Observer Research Foundation, says India has ramped up its testing capabilities dramatically -- but he's still not happy with the numbers. While other experts say that widespread community testing would be impractical and a waste of resources, Saran says that's something India needs to look at, given it has large swathes of the population who travel between regions for work. While India may not be testing enough, Reddy says, doctors are probably catching most of the moderate and serious cases. If there was a huge surge in Covid-19 cases that weren't being caught by testing, then hospitals would be crowded with cases and there would be a spike in influenza-like symptoms in the community, he said. For now, there's no indication of either. However, there is a growing body of evidence that Covid-10 causes symptoms far beyond influenza-like symptoms. Could more people be dying than we know?Even when India isn't facing a pandemic, only about 22% of all registered deaths are medically certified. That means that, in the majority of deaths, the official cause of death has not been certified by a doctor.And there's already evidence that some deaths may be flying under the radar. A resident doctor at one of the main government hospitals in Mumbai said last week that when dead bodies were brought into the hospital, they didn't test them for coronavirus, even if they suspected that was how patients died. \"If the personal history shows that the person came in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus, we dispose of the body in the same way that we would for Covid-positive patients,\" said the doctor, who asked not to be named as they were not authorized to speak to media.But, experts say, at this stage, it doesn't look like there is a huge flood of coronavirus deaths.\"Even if we are not testing enough and are not discovering enough, there are not enough bodies being piled up in hospitals or in ICUs or in mortuaries ... to suggest we are in the midst of something really dramatic at this stage,\" said Saran.Even so, the true count of Covid-19 deaths will only come much later, when we are able to compare statistics from this year with past years, said CCDEP's Laxminarayan. When did coronavirus take hold?India's swift policy measures only tell part of the story. Even before India's lockdown, coronavirus was present in the country, the country had reported some coronavirus cases, but not many. On January 30, India reported its first case -- a student who had been studying at Wuhan University in China. It was around the same time that the UK, France, and Italy also reported their first cases, although their coronavirus outbreaks followed dramatically different trajectories. All three countries now have well over 100,000 coronavirus cases. Experts still aren't sure why the virus would have shown a different pattern of spread in India. One possible reason, said Reddy, is that coronavirus may thrive in colder conditions, meaning that it might not spread so efficiently in India, where temperatures are often more than 30 degrees Celsius (96.8 degrees Farenheit). But scientific evidence so far contradicts this idea. The World Health Organization says the evidence so far shows the virus can be transmitted in all areas, including those with hot and humid weather. The US's National Academy of Sciences committee said the data is mixed on whether coronavirus spreads as easily in warm weather as it does in cold weather. Another possibility, Reddy said, is that India's population may be less susceptible due to the country's policy of universal Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. BCG -- which was developed to fight tuberculosis -- is being studied in clinical trials around the world as a possible way to fight the novel coronavirus. However, the WHO notes that there is no evidence that the BCG vaccine protects people against infection from coronavirus, and the WHO does not recommend the vaccine as a prevention against Covid-19. But for now, more evidence is needed. \"We do not know what is the factor that has helped us,\" Reddy said. Will a 40-day lockdown be enough?Even if India's outbreak is comparatively small, it's not yet time for celebration.There's a huge diversity of opinion about what will happen when India lifts its lockdown on May 3 -- whether cases will then skyrocket, or if the lockdown will have succeeded in restraining numbers.\"A surge is going to happen ... as soon as we go back from the nationwide lockdown. That is my hunch,\" said Oommen Kurian, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. \"India has successfully hit a pause button. But the problem now is we cannot be on pause forever.\"The determining factor will likely be what restrictions are still in place when the lockdown lifts. As Reddy put it: \"It's not as though tomorrow we declare victory and then we get back to normal.\"Experts say that social distancing will need to be maintained, although some states with fewer cases may be able to ease restrictions. Uttar Pradesh -- India's most populous state with 200 million residents -- has extended a ban on public gatherings until the end of June.Laxminarayan warned that if social distancing and hygiene measures \"are not taken seriously, we will have a serious issue that the health system is not equipped to handle.\"One thing that won't work in India is an age-specific lockdown, where elderly stay inside and the young are allowed to go back to work. Around the world, the elderly have been at a higher risk of dying from coronavirus -- in the US, 80% of deaths have been those ages 65 or older. India has a relatively young population -- 44% of the population are 24 or younger, compared with 23% in Italy and 29% in China, according to data from the CIA World Factbook. But many Indians live in a three-generation household, meaning that there is significant contact between younger and older generations, said University of Cambridge mathematician Ronojoy Adhikari, who modeled India's outbreak. \"This makes the elderly in India particularly vulnerable, as they are far more likely to catch the infection from the second and third generations, on whom the infection will, statistically speaking, only have mild effects,\" he said. Even if India does manage to avoid the worst of the virus this time around, there's plenty to be done. The government needs to be working to support the country's informal workforce, who are \"underwriting the cost of the lockdown,\" as Saran puts it. The government needs to strengthen the public health system to prepare for a possible return and resurgence in the winter, said Reddy.\"This is not a one month challenge, this is going to be a 12-month challenge,\" said Saran. \"I think this is a good 18-month examination of how we respond as people, communities, countries, states.\"\n\nCNN's Esha Mitra, Manveena Suri and Vedika Sud contributed to this story from New Delhi.",

        "body": "Paramedic Randy Lilly rides in an ambulance with a patient in Stamford, Connecticut, on April 4.\n\nThey've been the tip of the spear in the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nParamedics and emergency medical technicians have been working long, pressure-packed hours to respond to calls and get people the help they need.\n\n\"After 9/11, firefighters were America's heroes as first responders. This time, it's EMS and hospital workers,\" said John Moore, a Getty Images photographer. \"I think it's important to give credit where it's due and, for me as a photojournalist, to show the importance of their work.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Moore was embedded with emergency medical workers in Stamford, Connecticut -- where he resides -- and Westchester County, New York. Both have been hit hard by the coronavirus.\n\n\"New York City, of course, is the epicenter, but the suburbs are heavily affected and receive far less media attention because of the heavy media presence in New York,\" Moore said. \"So that's what I've been concentrating on.\"\n\nHe tagged along with EMTs as they made house calls, provided care and transported patients to the hospital.\n\nThese workers have demanding jobs, even in the best of times. But now they are being stretched like never before, with 12-hour shifts sometimes turning into more.\n\n\"Once or twice a week, many work 24-hour shifts. It's an extreme workload, and in the New York City area, they've been overburdened this last month to say the least,\" Moore said. \"That is starting to come down, much to their relief.\"\n\nNone of the workers that Moore spent time with had gotten sick, but they've had to be especially mindful because \"it's easy to make mistakes when you haven't had as much sleep,\" Moore said. \"So they try to be conscious of maintaining their protocols even when they're really tired, and that is the main issue. Because the protocols work. The protocols absolutely work.\"\n\nIn Moore's photos, you can see how seriously workers are taking the threat of the coronavirus. All of them are wearing protective face masks and gloves at the minimum. On many calls, they were outfitted in full-body suits and respirators.\n\nTheir level of personal protective equipment, or PPE, is decided on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"The paramedics and EMTs I photographed have been fairly well supplied with PPE,\" Moore said. \"However, they measure its use carefully. They're using it where it's necessary and not necessarily using it on every on every call that comes in. ... They don't have enough of it to waste on calls that they don't suspect require it.\"\n\nIt can be frustrating because there is still no approved treatment or cure for Covid-19. Workers do what they can to help manage the patient's symptoms, and in many cases that means getting them to the hospital.\n\nMoore has witnessed intubations take place right in people's living rooms, which he said is tough to see but often necessary to save them.\n\nCovid-19 may have comprised up to 80% of calls a couple of weeks ago, Moore estimated, but those numbers have dropped greatly for the workers he spent time with.\n\nMoore received consent from each household before entering and taking photos, and he, too, was decked out in varying levels of PPE.\n\nHe was always wearing an N95 face mask, even when he was alone with EMTs in an ambulance. He swapped that out for a full face respirator when they responded to a possible Covid-19 call. Sometimes he also put on a protective suit and boot covers.\n\n\"It's important that photojournalists, at least those of us with training in this sort of work, show what the front lines of this story look like. The public is bombarded with statistics every day about the coronavirus crisis. It's my job to frame this story in a more human way,\" Moore said.\n\nMoore wears two sets of gloves when he's shooting in a possibly infectious environment.\n\nWhen he's done taking photos, he'll remove one pair before taking off his mask and cleaning it with disinfectant wipes and sprays. He also cleans his cameras. Then he removes the second pair and sprays disinfectant again.\n\nBut he downplays the risk compared with the risk that the emergency workers face: \"Medics have to touch people as part of their work. A photojournalist stands back and touches nothing but his or her cameras or the ground below our feet. Our physical contact is much less with infected surfaces.\"\n\nMoore learned these techniques in 2014, when he covered the deadliest Ebola outbreak in human history.\n\nFor four weeks, Moore documented the crisis from the Liberian capital of Monrovia. The virus claimed thousands of lives.\n\n\"I had not expected skills that I'd learned covering the Ebola epidemic in West Africa would be useful here where I live,\" he said. \"But this is the world we now live in.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)This year's Earth Day -- the 50th anniversary of the birth of the modern environmental movement -- will be a quiet one.\n\nFor humans, at least, the planet is essentially closed on Wednesday, April 22, due to a worldwide pandemic. The observance was created in the US by late former Democratic Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson to increase public awareness of environmental issues. By 1990, Earth Day had gone global, mobilizing millions of people in more than 140 countries to take up environmental issues and turn them into a worldwide movement. Because of the coronavirus pandemic, this year's celebrations are limited to our immediate and virtual surroundings. Read MoreEven though we can't celebrate our planet with community tree plantings, cleanups and national park visits this year, there are outdoor activities to enjoy within the vicinity of your home that are good for the planet and good for your health. Walk, run or hike the EarthOn Earth Day, take a walk or run through the neighborhood. Go alone and relish your solitude, enjoying the time for free thought or listening to a podcast. Or take advantage of the opportunity for quality time with your loved ones and stroll with your family and dog by your side. It's safe to do so if you make sure you \"keep your distance from other people\" outside of your family, said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Massachusetts. \"The key word is consideration,\" Kuritzkes added. \"People need to be aware of their distance from others to be respectful and not crowd them, and not have other people crowding you. If people are respectful, it should be pretty simple to stay sufficiently far apart from other people so that there's really no risk.\"It's also good for your health. Walking in nature may even lead to less repetitive negative thoughts, according to research. And a study of older women in the US found the higher the number reached on their step counters each day, the lower their rate of premature death. Getting your heart pumping by walking may improve your executive functioning skills, a 2018 study also concluded. Those are the skills centered in the part of your brain that helps you take care of yourself and keep up with chores and bills. And walking at a decent speed may reduce your risk of developing high blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels as much as running. Running has been found to reduce stress, alleviate symptoms of depression and improve self-esteem. The activity has also been tied to living longer by improving heart health and sleep, and staving off cognitive decline. But is going to the beach okay? And what about hiking? If you can keep a respectful distance from other people and pay attention to hygiene, both are acceptable, Kuritzkes said. A beach that is isolated, unpopular and uncrowded is best. If you hike on a nearby trail, maintain the same distance of at least six feet apart from others. Bring hand sanitizer and wipes so that if you stop to eat or sit on picnic tables and benches, you can disinfect your hands, Kuritzkes suggested. Biking for strength and a good moodCycling through your neighborhood, on a trail or into town is permissible, as \"most people on bicycles are reasonably far apart from each other,\" Kuritzkes said. And since you'd be speeding down a road or path, there's not much opportunity to transfer the virus by closely talking with people. Just be courteous to those around you. If you do need to come to a halt, be sure you're maintaining the proper distance from other cyclists or pedestrians.Considering the health boosts, climbing aboard a two wheeler for exercise is easy on your joints, for one, as your weight rests on your pelvis and not your legs. Cycling is beneficial for your heart, brain and blood vessels, according to Harvard Medical School. It can also trigger the release of endorphins, the body's feel-good chemicals. Different phases of pedaling also help you build muscles in your thighs, calves and hips. The exercise builds bone density and smaller muscles, too: You use your abdominal muscles to balance and stay upright, and your arm and shoulder muscles to hold on and steer. Those benefits can carry over to everyday activities, improving your balance when you walk or stand and extending your endurance. Stay in touch with the Earth by gardening Putter around in your garden on Earth Day to keep in touch with nature and appreciate whatever you pull from its soil. One study found gardening may prevent brain shrinkage in older adults. Our cognitive abilities, including learning and memory, partly depend on the size of our brains. Gardening is good for the Earth when you replenish its soil in the form of compost or grow flowers from which bees can graze for pollen and plant nectar. But it's also advantageous for reaching a state of mindfulness.Horticultural therapy is rooted in the idea that interacting with plants contributes to well-being. Caring for plants can improve your mood, blood pressure, heart rate and stress hormone levels. But we may also have a philosophical lesson to learn from plants. In a 2018 CNN article on the topic, horticultural therapist Libba Shortridge described the life cycle of a seed to a group at Skyland Trail, a mental health treatment center in Atlanta, Georgia. At first, a seed may appear dormant and hopeless. What does it need to grow? It requires sun and water, and patience, courage and confidence from you, to name a few. We could use those things as we navigate this unsettling time. Enjoy the meditative qualities of natureYou might also celebrate the natural world by forest bathing. The term comes from the Japanese word shinrin-yoku, which means \"immersing in the forest atmosphere.\" Since the 1980s, the Japanese have managed forests to help citizens relax and reduce stress.Studies have shown that within just 15 minutes of this immersion, stress levels can decrease while your heart rate and blood pressure improve. You might even feel less depressed, or not as anxious, which is considerably needed during these vexing times.Getting some fresh air is also a boon to instilling good behavior in children. A recent study found children who felt connected to nature -- feeling pleasure when seeing wildflowers and animals, hearing sounds of nature -- were more likely to engage in behaviors that helped other people. They scored higher on a happiness scale, too. And if the weather's nice, give meditating outside a shot if you can find a quiet space. Numerous studies bolster the slew of benefits meditation has to offer: It may help keep your immune system functioning optimally. A consistent practice can help us better respond to stressful situations by reshaping our brains to become more resilient.In studies of meditation newbies, scientists found improvement in the region of the brain that regulates emotion, contributing to a state of mindfulness. Meditation may even slow aging in your brain. Virtual Earth Day activities You could also ring in Earth Day's half-century anniversary with the help of your phone or computer. Stream an eco-documentary on the Discovery Channel or Netflix. Throughout the rest of the week, EarthxFilm, an international nonprofit environmental organization that showcases environmental films, is streaming shorts and films that raise awareness for dozens of environmental issues. There's also a multitude of animal livestreams coming to you from aquariums, zoos and sanctuaries. How we'll celebrate Earth Day this year may be unusual, but there's no shortage of enjoyable activities that are good for your health and the planet and that will keep you safe during a pandemic.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)With nearly all American kids out of school and large numbers of workers telecommuting, many houses are more crowded than usual.\n\nAnd bathrooms are perhaps the one crucial point in the house where all humans -- and therefore microbes -- pass through. So during the present pandemic, keeping your toilets, sinks, counters and showers as germ-free as possible is key to keeping you and your family healthy.The novel coronavirus, or SARS-CoV-2, is known to live on hard surfaces for up to three days, according to data published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Your bathroom has plenty of those.\"We'd be mostly concerned with the inanimate surfaces,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \"Any household disinfectants will work against this virus,\" he said. \"And soap and water work perfectly well.\"Read MoreWe've got a guide to help you think about the area of your house that could become ground zero of the fight against coronavirus.Make sure you follow the right stepsAs you get ready to clean your bathroom, start by making sure to wash your hands. If you're using disinfectants, you should pick higher-quality ones. The US Environmental Protection Agency released a five-page list of disinfectants -- including Clorox Disinfecting Wipes and certain Lysol sprays -- which are strong enough to defeat \"harder to kill\" viruses such as SARS-CoV-2.It's important to focus on cleaning \"high-touch\" areas of your bathroom including light switches, door knobs and the sink areas in particular. That can also include less obvious areas everyone in the house likely touches, including shower heads, shower curtains and around the toilet seat.Anything that people touch should be cleaned, whether they have symptoms or not. That includes hair dryers, electric toothbrushes, shavers or other appliances in the bathroom. (You may not have touched razors recently if you're trying to grow out a gnarly quarantine beard.)We know you would never forget this, but just a friendly reminder not to forget to make sure devices are assuredly unplugged and turned off before you embark on a deep clean.You should consider placing a wipeable cover on electronic devices if you can, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises, and try to use a solution that's at least 70% alcohol.It pays to be thorough, because droplets capable of carrying the virus can really get around within your bathroom.For instance, one study published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology showed that particles and droplets can be spread up to 6 feet when you flush with the seat up.Follow the cleaning product maker's directions\"You don't have to panic clean,\" said Brian Sansoni, a spokesman for the American Cleaning Institute. But he emphasized that you need to make sure you're cleaning correctly.After you wipe down hard surfaces like sinks and counter tops, make sure to leave them wet for 3 to 5 minutes. Who knew? Turns out, the professionals do. The American Cleaning Institute recommends letting the surfaces air-dry, and then rinse them with water.People aren't aware of the need to wait, said Sansoni, who noted that's important to give the cleaning products time to actually work and thoroughly kill germs or viruses.Think there's no way you're doing it wrong? Sansoni cited findings from an Ipsos poll his organization commissioned, which found that 42% of Americans weren't cleaning or disinfecting the right way -- and could be leaving themselves vulnerable.Many people aren't following directions printed on product labels, including allowing cleaning products enough time to work, he said. Please make sure you're abiding by the instructions on your products, and that you're using them as the manufacturer intended.Use separate bathrooms if a family member is sickIf a family member or roommate living with you is showing Covid-19 symptoms, it's important to assign them their own specific bathroom and to separate that person from others.If you don't have more than one bathroom, have the person with symptoms clean surfaces they've touched after they use the bathroom, according to the CDC. If they're too sick to clean, your second option is to have a healthy person clean the area. Wait as long as you can before entering, wear a mask and gloves to clean and wash the mask and your clothes after cleaning. (Toss the gloves.)That might not be an option if your patient needs help using the bathroom.\"You may have to help the person use the facilities,\" Schaffner said. \"You can assign one person in the family to help them and to establish their routine.\"If you're in close quarters with someone showing Covid-19 symptoms, you absolutely must protect yourself with a mask at minimum, he emphasized.Protect yourself if you're helping a sick family memberIn addition to a mask, Schaffner recommended wearing gloves and some sort of other garment over your regular clothes if you're caring for an ill person in the bathroom. \"Watch the person, see what they touch, and wipe that off,\" he said.That could include the toilet seat, which may receive a lot of action since diarrhea and vomiting are common Covid-19 symptoms.As an additional precaution, Schaffner also recommended placing any sanitizing wipes you use in a plastic bag and throwing that in the garbage. Then change your clothes after you're done cleaning the bathroom or helping someone else use it.If someone in your home is sick, it's especially important to wash any of their towels or dirty clothes separately.For towels, bath mats, cloth shower curtains and other soft materials, the CDC recommends laundering them according to the manufacturer's directions with the \"warmest appropriate water setting.\" Then dry those items completely.Soap can work even better than disinfecting products\"By now you know that viruses, including the coronavirus, can live on surfaces for awhile -- several hours, even several days -- which means we have to be cleaning all the time,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said in a video. That gets complicated when you're burning through disinfectants and sanitizing wipes, and store shelves with those products are all to often bare.But you may already have soap at home, and it could be easier to find in a supermarket. And the good news? \"Many scientists argue it's actually a better alternative,\" Gupta said.There's scientific backing for this thinking: At a microscopic level, the novel coronavirus is surrounded by a \"lipid envelope.\" Soap works on the virus by tearing through that layer of lipids that surrounds the proteins inside and breaking apart the virus.The process is similar to how dish soap eats away at grease on a pan in ways that plain water can't.Finish the job correctlyFinishing the cleaning job right is crucial. Gupta explained that you don't necessarily have to wear gloves as you clean. But if you do, make sure when you're done to remove them by sliding your finger in underneath their opening so you don't touch the exposed outer side with your bare hands. And then wash your hands one last time after you've thrown away your gloves.",

        "body": "Coronavirus and a case of shingles left me more alone than any time in my life\n\nBy Sarah Jorgensen, CNN\n\nUpdated 1729 GMT (0129 HKT) April 28, 2020\n\nEditor's note: We are publishing personal essays from CNN's global staff as they live and cover the story of Covid-19. Sarah Jorgensen is a producer in CNN's New York Bureau.\n\nNew York (CNN)The back pain started a few days after I began working from home.\n\nIt wasn't too surprising -- I had just returned from a long-planned vacation to South Africa. I'd spent about 20 hours on planes, getting back just under the wire and was set for my solo quarantine in my Brooklyn apartment. But something about it felt weird.Then a rash seemingly appeared out of nowhere. Nothing helped the pain or the rash -- not yoga, not ibuprofen, not hydrocortisone cream, not standing while I worked, not lying down.And I was alone.I started to document the rash on my back as I would a news story -- taking photos daily, tracking its growth and the different symptoms. I FaceTimed my parents and sister who were together in my childhood home in Connecticut to ask their opinion. My parents sounded concerned. My sister, studying for the MCAT so she can become a doctor herself, demanded regular updates.Read MoreI was too scared to go to the emergency room or urgent care. This was when coronavirus deaths in New York City were rising. Hospitals were overwhelmed, and protective gear was limited. I feared even a short visit could expose me to the virus.So, I went the telemedicine route. Two different doctors a few days apart, looking at my rash on a tiny screen, prescribed me anti-inflammatories, steroids and even silver cream for burns. Each trip to the pharmacy -- there were five over the course of a week, far more than I was comfortable with -- felt harrowing. One day, I waited in a line that stretched down Flatbush Avenue, each person 6 feet apart, for 30 minutes so I could buy more hydrocortisone cream and a heating pad. Another visit, I glared at a man standing too close to me at the prescription counter over the top of my mask. He backed up, but not far enough.Did I stand too close to the pharmacy associate? What about the time I forgot to wear a mask? Did I put on hand sanitizer after I had to touch the stylus to sign my name at the checkout counter? Had I exposed someone? Had I been exposed myself?I hit a breaking point one night when I could barely stand up from the pain and called my mom in tears. It was after my mom's regular 9 p.m. bedtime, but she answered the phone as she always does. \"I wish I could be there with you, my baby,\" she told me as I screamed about the electric drill I felt screwing into my back and about my skin, which felt like it was on fire. It was too much for me to pretend to be calm anymore.But we both knew she couldn't be there. She's a vulnerable older person, though she'll hate that I called her that. And even if I could get to Connecticut, I'd have to isolate in my parents' basement, not knowing what I had carried from the city, and I couldn't be sure I wouldn't expose them even if we were careful.So, I said goodbye and was alone again, the most alone I have ever felt.I've lived by myself for almost two years. In normal circumstances, my sunny apartment with my plants is a safe haven. It's a place to recharge from my role as a field producer for CNN, where I am often on the scene reporting breaking news. But those respites used to be a night or a weekend. I never planned for months.We all are dealing with the stress of social distancing, but I think there is a special kind of loneliness that comes with living alone during this time of the coronavirus. I can remember the last time I touched another person. It was on March 13, as I left my Airbnb near the beach in Cape Town. I hugged my host goodbye, and she told me to stay safe. I'm not sure when I'll be able to hug someone again.Of course, I'm far from alone in my situation. Census data indicate more than 23 million women live by themselves in the United States today. I'm just one of them.And I'm not always lonely. I FaceTime with friends and my family almost daily. I still enjoy the relaxation that comes with some alone time -- but there is truly no substitute for seeing or touching my loved ones in person. I've seen a few friends along the way -- through windows, or 6 feet away on the sidewalk, masks on so I can't see them smiling -- but they are fleeting moments in what will likely be a monthslong ordeal.And thankfully it was a friend who suggested I might have shingles -- a virus that can resurface in people who have had chickenpox. A third telemedicine doctor identified the rash, connected it with my back pain and prescribed an antiviral. I made another commute to the pharmacy, hand sanitizer in tow, to pick up another prescription.I've wondered whether I would have been diagnosed faster if a doctor could've seen the rash in person. Or if I would have healed more quickly if my family or friends had been able to help take care of me. But I also know how fortunate I am compared with others in this hard-hit city.Every day I got up and took my medicine, and every day I felt a little better. I held ice packs to my own back, and the angry blisters slowly disappeared. Now, all that's left is a mildly itchy set of scabs. I water my plants and watch concert livestreams and chat with my friends online. My plants and my music and the people I love on the other side of screens keep me comfortable.I'm getting through this on my own, just as every woman on her own will also get through this. There wasn't a moment when I realized I would -- I just pushed through it. To paraphrase the Grateful Dead, one of the bands that has kept me company: We will get by, and we will survive, even if it's on our own.",

        "body": "Wellington, New Zealand (CNN)I'm a 30-year-old woman and my dad has just told me to clean my room.\n\nIt's slightly humiliating, but not entirely surprising. For the past month, I've been at my childhood home in New Zealand on coronavirus lockdown -- and it appears I'll be living with my parents for the foreseeable future. Until recently, I lived in my own apartment in Hong Kong with a spirited cat and a large collection of potted plants. My interests included heading to the beach or grabbing a drink in a pub. Now, my hobbies are a bit different. Last weekend, I made five different types of bread. This weekend, we have grand plans to go on a walk. For almost all of my adult life, I've lived in different cities to my mum and dad. After all those years of only staying in touch via intermittent phone calls, for a month, my parents have been basically the only people I've talked to face-to-face. Read MoreBack in late January, as the coronavirus outbreak grew increasingly serious in mainland China, CNN's Hong Kong office largely shut down and I was asked to work from home. At first, I enjoyed the novelty of wearing my pyjamas during work meetings. But as the weeks wore on, my 370 square feet (34 square meters) studio apartment only seemed to get smaller, and work days and weekends bled into one another.So, at the start of March, I decided to work from my parents' home in New Zealand for two weeks. I left my cat with a willing friend, and headed to New Zealand, which at the time only had a handful of cases. I had visions of going to see my brother's band play and hanging out with my best friend. Although my parents are in their 60s, they are both fit and healthy, and we didn't feel like I would be putting them at risk. Within days of my arrival, New Zealand imposed new restrictions. First, our Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced that everyone who entered the country would need to self-quarantine for 14 days, meaning I need to stay home. Then the government shut borders to foreigners and urged Kiwis overseas to return home. By the time two weeks were up, my flight out of the country had been canceled and New Zealand was in lockdown. I figured I would just stay put.Living with your parents as an adult is common in many cultures, but to many Westerners it's seen as an admission of failure. As Anna Silman wrote in The Cut, \"Going back to your parents' house is usually an option of last resort, like the shelf-stable can of beans you know you can always eat once the pantry runs dry.\"Nevertheless, adults around the world are opting for prolonged stays with their parents. Some have lost their jobs, some are university students who have been sent home, some need additional emotional support. And as we head into a recession, many more could follow suit. Already, around 15% of 25 to 35-year-olds live with their parents in the United States. With millions of people already filing for unemployment benefits, many more could end up moving back in with their parents. For some, that will be a challenge. Research suggests that young people who \"boomeranged\" back to their parents experienced an increase in depressive symptoms. Already, being stuck home with parents is hard for some. Last month, a 19-year-old University of Delhi student who lives with his parents told me that while the country has been under lockdown, he hasn't been able to phone his boyfriend as he hasn't come out to his family.For me, the challenges have been more minor. There have been moments -- like when I was asked to tidy my room -- that I've felt like I've gone back in time. But in a lot of ways, this isn't like being a teenager again. This is all totally new. Mum speedwalks around the neighborhood and reports back on what everyone else is up to. A WhatsApp group for our street that was set up for the pandemic keeps us abreast of any breaking news (\"Grey warblers spotted outside\"). For the first time in my life, I've become a kind of IT guru; When I introduced my parents to Google Docs, they watched, transfixed, as \"Anonymous Otter\" edited the file in real time. Like everyone else on Instagram, I've become consumed with baking, so much so that I got flustered by all the doughs that required my attention and eventually relinquished responsibilities for the sourdough starter to Mum. Each day, we listen to the ever-calm New Zealand Director-General of Health, Ashley Bloomfield, announce the latest coronavirus case numbers. In the evening, we often pull out that day's newspaper and do the general knowledge quiz, a fixture in New Zealand office culture. When my family looks back on this tumultuous period, it's hard to know what we'll take from it. Maybe we'll just be relieved that it's over. But hopefully, we'll see it as a time when we were able to learn to coexist as adults -- a time when my parents weren't just my mum and dad, but my workmates, too.",

        "body": "(CNN)It almost felt like an episode of \"Shark Tank.\"\n\nOne by one, vaccine developers at a White House roundtable convened by President Donald Trump in early March pitched their product as a viable solution to the coronavirus that was spreading globally and killing Americans. John Shiver, the head of R&D for Sanofi Pasteur vaccines, said he could have a product ready for the clinic in a year -- perhaps a vaccine for the public in as \"few as several years.\"Trump seemed uninterested.\"Right. OK. Thank you very much,\" he said at the March 2 roundtable, which was captured on C-SPAN.Read More Next was Lenny Schleifer, the founder and CEO of Regeneron -- which aims to conduct clinical trials this summer -- who talked of pumping 200,000 doses per month of its therapeutic vaccine from his factory, starting in August, \"if all goes well.\"This got Trump's attention. He leaned over the table and interrupted Schleifer mid-pitch.\"So that process would be faster than John's?\" he said, pointing at Shiver.\"It would be,\" Schleifer said, adding that the process could take \"weeks to months.\"The only way to top that was to start talking about days, and it's exactly what the next CEO did.St\u00e9phane Bancel of Moderna Inc. glanced across the table at the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and said he is \"very proud to be working with the US government and to have already sent, in only 42 days from the sequence of the virus, our vaccine to Dr. Fauci's team at the NIH.\"The French-born Bancel went on to say that he needed just \"a few months\" to start phase two of a three-part clinical trial of the sort that typifies vaccine development. (The entire process often takes more than a decade.)Trump seemed to tune out everything but the talk of time.\"So you're talking over the next few months, you think you could have a vaccine?\" he asked.\"Correct. Correct,\" Bancel said, raising a hand to acknowledge Fauci shifting in his chair across the table. \"With phase two,\" Bancel clarified, just before Fauci interjected, for Trump's benefit: \"You won't have a vaccine. You'll have a vaccine to go into testing.\"To some observers, it was a classic Bancel performance -- a rare public glimpse into his uncanny ability to say the right thing to the right people in the right moment. His supporters say, however, he was doing what he's always done: letting Moderna's accomplishments speak for themselves.Either way, it turns out Moderna had an edge. Its scientists had already been collaborating with researchers from the National Institutes of Health on a vaccine for another coronavirus, Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). So when Chinese researchers released the genomic sequence for the new coronavirus -- SARS-CoV-2, which causes the deadly disease known as Covid-19 -- in mid-January, they had a jump start.On March 3 -- the day after the roundtable -- the FDA green-lit Moderna's product for trial, making it the first vaccine candidate to advance to the first phase of a clinical study, in which an as-yet unapproved vaccine is injected into the arms of a small group of 45 human volunteers. Established in 2010, Moderna has never brought a product to market, or gotten any of its nine or so vaccine candidates approved for use by the FDA. It has also never brought a product to the third and final phase of a clinical trial.And yet at the moment, it represents one of the country's -- and possibly world's -- best hopes for a return to the normalcy that slipped away when the microscopic enemy brought civilization to a standstill. The federally funded trial for Moderna's vaccine candidate began in Washington state on March 16 -- two weeks after the roundtable. With a hope-starved world cheering it on, Moderna officially burst out of the gate, marking the beginning of the race for a vaccine for the new coronavirus.Major funding injected into vaccine raceThe effort received another boost on April 16, when the federal Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) awarded Moderna up to $483 million to accelerate the development and manufacturing of the vaccine. That amounts to about half of what the federal agency has doled out, with Janssen Research & Development -- part of Johnson & Johnson -- receiving $456 million, and a third company, Sanofi, receiving up to $30 million. Johnson & Johnson is a household name with a long list of approved medicines; Sanofi has been making vaccines for more than 100 years. But much of Moderna's appeal is not what it has done, but what it says is possible: to develop a vaccine -- which normally takes years -- in record speed. As it happens, although Moderna is not a household name, it's a company with a storied history.CNN Investigates interviewed more than 20 experts and former employees for this story and found that while some of the scientists expressed optimism that Moderna can pull it off, others voiced criticism about the hype the company has generated over the years, as well as what has been described as a caustic work culture.Others raised concerns about the science, or challenged the wisdom of the federal government-sanctioned shortcuts in the ongoing clinical trial, in particular the FDA's approval to gloss over the animal trials that normally precede injecting an untested vaccine into healthy humans. Dr. Joseph Bolen, who served as Moderna's chief scientific officer and president of research and development from 2013 to 2015, believes it was reasonable to give Moderna a shot, but was puzzled by BARDA's massive allocation -- up to $483 million -- calling it a \"big bet.\"\"I don't know what their thinking was,\" he said. \"Why so much? ... I just don't know. When I read that, I was pretty amazed.\"Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer, acknowledged that the company doesn't have a product on the market, but said the government's decision was wise. \"We're a young company with an emerging technology and for that reason we have not yet brought anything to full licensure,\" he told CNN. \"But if you look at the building blocks of what we have been able to demonstrate over time -- from preclinical through our early clinical data -- this is a very promising technology.\"Moderna is ahead of the packModerna, Inc. -- originally called Moderna Therapeutics -- was founded on a big idea that would disrupt the pharmaceutical industry.Its vision is to harness a new technology that synthesizes messenger RNA, or mRNA -- essentially an instruction manual in every living cell for creating protein -- to prompt the human body to make its own medicine. The hope has been to find \"transformative\" treatments for heart disease, metabolic and genetic diseases, kidney failure, even cancer.To be sure, a handful of other vaccine candidates have since entered the human trial phase, and more than 80 companies and academic labs are working on vaccines to add to the mix.But Moderna -- which has at least 15 products in clinical trials -- was the first company with an mRNA vaccine that advanced to human trials, though another German mRNA company has since entered the race and another isn't far behind. Moderna also has been allocated the most funding by BARDA, a division of the US Department of Health and Human Services. BARDA said it plans to fund a variety of approaches.\"More than one vaccine is likely to be the solution,\" a BARDA spokesperson said in an email. \"Of note, Moderna was the first into the clinic with a vaccine.\"Meantime, Moderna is indeed moving at a fast clip: On Monday, it submitted a proposal to the FDA to enter Phase 2, subject to final safety findings from Phase 1.(The second phase of a typical clinical study ramps up the number of people -- often into the hundreds, including more members of at-risk groups. In Phase 3, the vaccine is given to thousands of people and tested for efficacy and safety, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.)Over the years, Moderna has sold investors on the revolutionary potential of its medicine. Bancel has been the chief narrator of the company's intoxicating story.\"We feel this is most probably the only time in our lives that we will have a chance to really change the world,\" he said in a 2013 TED Talk about how mRNA could be used as a way to regrow heart tissue in people who have suffered heart attacks.Ambition, secrecy and money has earned Moderna criticsTwo of its four founders -- Derrick Rossi and Robert Langer -- are especially heavy hitters in the science community. Rossi, once an associate professor at Harvard, was hailed by Time magazine as one of the 100 most influential people of 2011 for a novel stem-cell treatment; Langer of MIT is ranked by Google as the eighth most-cited researcher in the world, just a few notches below Sigmund Freud.Moderna's unproven but potentially paradigm-shattering technology has garnered enthusiastic press: Moderna was ranked No. 1 on the CNBC Disrupter 50 list in 2015 for its goal to help \"the human body make the medicine it needs to cure a disease,\" putting it in company with eventually the likes of Airbnb, Lyft and WeWork. More recently, it was praised in an op-ed by Bill Gates -- whose namesake foundation has given millions to Moderna -- though his piece didn't mention the company by name. But Moderna's unbridled ambition, reputation for secrecy and preoccupation with venture capital have earned it detractors.In 2016, an op-ed published in the science journal Nature scolded Moderna for not having published a single peer-reviewed paper outlining the science of its dazzling product, even as it participated in a \"schmoozefest\" at a JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco that announced $350 million in investments.The piece noted that Moderna's then lack of scientific publishing was similar to that of Theranos, now disgraced for raising some $700 million in venture capital for a blood-testing technology that turned out to be a sham, turning the now-dissolved company and its embattled CEO into a symbol of tech hubris run amok. \"Deals don't validate science,\" the op-ed said. \"Biotech is littered with examples of big money acquisitions or licenses written off or abandoned subsequently.\" Articles in the science press sometimes refer to the company as \"mysterious\" or \"secretive.\"\"They've been a little tight-fisted about their data,\" said a former BARDA official who now works as a biotech expert at Biologics Consulting and has worked with Moderna. \"And I interpret that to mean the results so far have been disappointing.\"In a rare interview, Noubar Afeyan, one of Moderna's four co-founders and the current board chairman, told CNN the company's reputation for secrecy is misunderstood.\"They mistake secrecy for ambiguity,\" he said of critics, noting that the company didn't publish in the early days because it had nothing to publish -- it was in the experimental phase.But Matthias John, a molecular biologist who was a group leader and senior research fellow at Moderna for nearly four years ending in 2016, remembers being told not to publish even when he had good data.\"They had really this fear to disclose results,\" he said, adding that the company worried it would allow competitors to catch up to their innovations. \"It was just a pity. ... We had fantastic data back then.\" Critics call for more skepticismIn any case, the company has published dozens of papers in recent years, and several experts and former Moderna employees contacted by CNN for this story rejected any comparison to Theranos, saying the science is sound.One former employee, who worked at the company for three years ending in 2019 -- most recently as a director -- called the comparison \"absurd.\"\"I think Moderna has a strong compliance culture,\" said the former director, who spoke on condition of anonymity, saying the biotech industry is a small world and he didn't feel comfortable making a public statement. \"They are very driven. They have a strong vision, they work really hard.\"But a former company executive had a more mixed take on the question. On the one hand, he said, the science is on a \"good foundation.\"\"They really are pushing forward the boundaries of understanding RNA,\" said the former executive, who requested anonymity because he still works in the field.In his view, though, Moderna is a company that \"believes their own story, spins their own story and has managed to convince a lot of investors -- in-biotech investors and other non-biotech investors -- that it's true,\" he said. \"I think (people) should approach it with a little more skepticism.\" Moderna's turbulent startIn the early years, Moderna was a chaotic place. Over the span of a decade, the size of its workforce has expanded from four employees to more than 700.The culture of the company seems to have stabilized: In the past five years, it has ranked as a top biopharmaceutical employer in Science magazine's Top Employers Survey. But there were growing pains, some of which centered on Bancel, the only CEO the company has ever had. Afeyan, a venture capitalist with a PhD in biochemical engineering from MIT, had tried to recruit Bancel to lead other projects, but Bancel -- formerly the CEO of a French diagnostics company -- had turned him down.\"I told him I was willing to take a career risk by working on something that might not work,\" Bancel told Boston magazine in 2013. \"But it would have to be something that, if it worked, would change the world.\"When Afeyan asked him to join Moderna, the idea was too big for Bancel to resist. The holder of a Master of Science in chemical engineering from the University of Minnesota and an MBA from Harvard Business School joined in 2011.Bancel's leadership style has come under fire from employees who have described a pressure-cooker atmosphere in which around-the-clock hours were the norm and failed experiments -- a fact of life in the world of science -- could be met with reprimand or even dismissal, according to a 2016 investigation by Stat, a health publication. The former executive, who left in 2016, recalled that Bancel seemed to have two versions of himself: the calm public persona who makes speeches and appears on TED Talks, and the private version in corporate meetings.\"What you hear in corporate meetings is stuff like this, 'What the f**k are you taking about? It's complete bullsh*t. ... You just said six-to-nine months; I need it done in five.'\"Dr. Suhaib Siddiqi, a chemist who served for a short time as Moderna's former director of chemistry in 2011, said Bancel was \"unfriendly\" and \"arrogant,\" and punished technicians for failed experiments. \"Ninety percent of the things in science fail -- that's the way the inventions are made,\" Siddiqi said. \"When it failed (at Moderna), he just shifted the blame to the technicians and fired them.\"Bancel disputes the characterization.\"Science is complicated and many things fail,\" Bancel, who declined CNN an interview, responded in a written statement. \"I don't recall one employee being fired since we started the company, because of science failing. If that had been the case, most scientists would have left the company and the company could not have gotten to the point it is.\"He added: \"We are creating a new class of transformative mRNA medicines to improve the lives of patients. When there is an opportunity to help patients, every day matters. So, there is an urgency to what we are doing because patients are waiting. We are privileged to be a part of a broad ecosystem of researchers from academia and industry who are expanding the understanding of mRNA.\"Some former employees spoke in defense of Bancel.\"As a person I like him,\" said Matthias John, the molecular biologist that left in 2016. \"He's a little bit of a fanatic. But he's not in my opinion a cheater or pretender. It is his personality -- that he's pushing hard and he expected everybody's pushing the same way.\"The former director who left in 2019 said Bancel has brought in a leadership team with experience in biopharmaceutical development that has \"tempered the intensity.\"But in 2014, the work environment became too much even for Rossi, a co-founder of Moderna, who says his team developed the company's core technology at Harvard Medical School. Rossi said he butted heads with Bancel, and that the company and its investors had a way of taking credit for the ideas of its scientists, including his own -- an allegation that Moderna's leadership denies.But Rossi, who later went on to become an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and is now the CEO of another biotech company called Convelo Therapeutics, said he believes in the technology. He continues to have a financial stake in the company.\"I'm very optimistic,\" he said. \"It's still going on the exact concept that it was founded on.\"Rossi, who said that he's heard that the culture at Moderna has mellowed, added that on some level, the cutthroat nature of the place made sense. \"I founded the company because I wanted to make an impact on human health,\" he said. \"The CEO's job is to make money for investors.\"Afeyan, the Moderna board chairman, fiercely defends Bancel. He told CNN the characterizations of Bancel as a gifted fundraiser are misplaced and even \"derogatory,\" saying it's a way for detractors to smear him with faint praise.\"He's a skilled team builder, he's a skilled product developer, he's a skilled strategist, he's a skilled partnership forger ... he's all of those things,\" Afeyan said. \"In order to fuel all that, he needs to have come up with money and we did, in a way that's unprecedented in the biotech industry. Also by tenfold. That's why he has detractors.\"The big deals that shaped ModernaIn 2013, Moderna received $240 million from UK pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca for a license to develop RNA-based drugs to combat a range of ailments, from cardiovascular disease to kidney failure to cancer. It was one of the largest Big Pharma licensing deals ever conducted for a drug not yet in trials. The next year, Moderna and Alexion Pharmaceuticals inked a $100 million deal to develop drugs to treat rare diseases, including a rare hereditary disease called Crigler-Najjar syndrome, which can cause brain damage in infants.Other gargantuan deals include a $325 million multi-part pact with Merck for a cancer vaccine and a $315 million agreement with Vertex for a treatment for cystic fibrosis.The clinical trials associated with most of those companies have advanced, but the Alexion agreement cratered. Alexion executives said the company decided to move in a new direction. But safety issues had surfaced in studies, with animals exhibiting liver problems, meaning it wasn't safe enough to test in humans, according to a 2017 Stat investigation.Afeyan said it is true that Alexion's experiments showed animal toxicity, but added that Moderna has since changed its formulations and, in human trials, \"we haven't seen any of that.\" Moderna gradually began to shift more focus on vaccines. Experts and former employees say that progress with therapeutics was much slower and more difficult to get to point where it could be used as promised in humans. Messenger RNA activates the body's instinct to get rid of the foreign invader, which works better for single dose vaccines but creates safety issues for longer-term use in chronic diseases.Jeff Ellsworth, who served as Moderna's former senior director of preclinical pharmacology and the head of rare genetic diseases until he left in 2013, remembers standing around a white board in his office with two company executives, discussing the data used in animal studies for drugs meant to treat rare genetic diseases.\"We all kind of looked at each other and said, 'Oh. We should probably be a vaccine company,' because these things stimulate antibody responses,\" he said.Said Rossi: \"It's the perfect technology for the threat we face.\"The problem is, in part because the field is crowded, the vaccine arena was perceived as less ambitious than therapeutics among investors, who saw it as a \"loss leader\" financially -- that is, a money loser, or perhaps a modest moneymaker. Many considered it a low-margin commodity. \"Most of the biotech community did not value vaccines,\" Ellsworth said. \"It was very hard to move that stuff forward. Because people said, 'Oh, vaccines, nobody's going to pay for that -- it's no big deal.'\"But Bancel -- who pulled in a salary of more than $920,000, plus a bonus of $1 million in 2019 -- has ably applied his persuasive powers to vaccines. In a \"Mad Money\" interview on CNBC in January, Bancel wowed host Jim Cramer with his description of a potential therapeutic \"personalized cancer vaccine\" by Moderna using mRNA technology.\"In our lifetime?\" Cramer asked.\"It's happening actually right now,\" Bancel answered. \"We compare every letter of DNA ... of a cancer cell and a healthy cell, and from that we deduce what do we need to do in our product, just for your cancer.\"\"It's almost science fiction, what you're up to,\" Cramer replied. \"I think it's incredible.\"In 2018, the company changed its name from Moderna Therapeutics to Moderna, Inc. and beefed up its vaccine portfolio: flu, Zika and CMV, a common virus that can cause developmental delay in infants. The list would grow, although none yet has been approved. For a time, despite its deepening involvement in a supposed money loser, Moderna's bubble only seemed to inflate. In late 2018, it went public. Raising some $600 million, its initial public offering was the largest in the history of biotech -- despite the fact that its technology remained unproven. Moderna's valuation ballooned to $7.5 billion -- up from an already impressive $5 billion from a year and a half prior. Still, there were signs of an impending nosedive: Moderna -- which currently generates revenue primarily through investments by collaboration partners -- ended 2019 with a $514 million net loss. True to swashbuckling startup form, the nation's wealthiest biotech firm has incurred significant losses since its 2010 inception; at the close of 2019, its accumulated deficit was $1.5 billion, according to a year-end filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Then came the new coronavirus and Covid-19, which has killed nearly 63,000 Americans since February and 233,000 people worldwide.For the world, it was a disaster. For Moderna, it arrived just in time. As the economy tanked, shares in Moderna surged in February when the news of its vaccine emerged. They shot up again -- by more than 24 percent, to $26.49 -- on March 16, the day the clinical trial of its vaccine made headlines. The stock price kept rising and rocketed again on April 17 -- with news of the federal government's nearly half-a-billion-dollar investment -- to beyond $45. Its valuation climbed to $10 billion. The new coronavirus, according to Forbes, turned the 47-year-old Bancel into a billionaire.Vaccine pipeline is a funnel: 'very few things survive'To try to bring a vaccine to market is to try to beat the odds.Dr. Myron Levine, a professor and infectious disease expert at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, cautioned that most vaccines fail. \"I've been in this business a very long time -- a half a century,\" he said. \"A vaccine pipeline is the shape of a funnel. A lot of things go in one end; very few things survive.\"Still, Levine thinks Moderna could make a breakthrough.\"There's a real good chance this will be the moment for the RNA vaccine -- they've been improved and tweaked,\" he said. \"I hope and pray that they will work.\"Moderna didn't invent the mRNA approach, but is the company that has \"cornered the market\" on the idea, said the former executive who left in 2016.\"Henry Ford wasn't the first carmaker, but he managed to scale in a more effective way,\" he said.The science of messenger RNA is complex, but the oft-touted bottom-line potential benefits are easy to understand: safety and speed. Conventional vaccines involve injecting a tiny piece of a weakened or dead virus into the body to stimulate an immune response in the cells.In theory, an mRNA vaccine enables scientists to plug a small piece of the coronavirus's genetic code into a human cell to create a synthetic copy of the virus's spike protein. That's the part of SARS-CoV-2 that resembles a plastic bristle on a hairbrush, and which attaches to human cells. Because it is just a small portion of the virus, the synthetically created spike protein can't infect a person. And partly because there is no need to manipulate a virus in the lab, the process is faster.The coronavirus spike-protein lookalike would then be produced by the body's own cells. If all goes well, the body then counterattacks the \"invader\" -- the synthetic antigen created by a person's own cell -- with antibodies.The technology \"teaches the human body to recognize the virus by teaching the body to make snippets of the virus on its own,\" said Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer.On January 11, Chinese researchers released the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, a 30,000-character string of the letters a, u, g and c. Largely because of the ongoing cooperation between Moderna and NIH, the process of designing the mRNA for delivery was lightning fast. Indeed, it took just 42 days, as Bancel told Trump.Officials with the National Institutes of Health are bullish.\"A lot of our work that we've done previously has essentially driven us into what we call a rapid response,\" said Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, the lead scientist for coronavirus research at the National Institutes of Health, in a recent interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"The really interesting part about this is that we have a collaboration with Moderna,\" she added. A spokesperson from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases -- a branch of the NIH -- said Moderna's vaccine platform is well-suited for responding to emerging outbreaks such as novel coronaviruses.It \"can be produced more quickly than with many other vaccine platforms,\" said Judith Lavelle. \"Once the genetic information of a given emerging virus becomes available, scientists can quickly select a sequence to express an immunogen in the existing mRNA platform.\"The science has its skepticsBut some experts are skeptical of the science.For starters, in the rush to get started, the FDA allowed Moderna's RNA vaccine -- called mRNA-1273 -- to essentially gloss over the animal-testing that typically precede clinical trials in humans. Given the nature of this emergency, they are happening in parallel.Siddiqi said this is cause for alarm.\"I would not let that [vaccine] to be injected in my body,\" he said. \"I would demand: Where is the toxicity data from the lab?\" Professor Nikolai Petrovsky at Flinders University in Australia, who is collaborating with Oracle to use computer models and AI technology to develop a Covid-19 vaccine, has concerns about the mRNA trials, insisting the US government has taken an unproven vaccine and \"put (it) straight into humans.\"\"It's a double game,\" he said. \"An unproven platform for a new disease with no animal testing.\"But while these experts felt dosing humans before animal trials could happen was questionable in practice, Zaks of Moderna said it would be \"unethical to wait,\" given the urgency of the pandemic.The FDA, in a statement to CNN, said it was \"unable to comment on specific unapproved products.\" However, it said that when the agency evaluates the need for a vaccine study, it considers the relevant data. \"If the FDA's evaluation of these data support initiating human studies of a candidate coronavirus vaccine without first completing additional toxicology studies, then the FDA would consider allowing such human studies to proceed.\"Petrovsky also noted that while NIH and Moderna worked on a MERS vaccine, they hadn't collaborated on a SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) vaccine. MERS is \"quite a different virus than SARS and Covid-19,\" he said. \"MERS binds are different receptors, different pattern of disease. ... I would be much more comfortable with SARS data.\"Petrovsky said that while RNA vaccines are very fast to make, evidence that they are going to work is scant.\"In the past, we've seen they have poor immunogenicity, which means they don't stimulate the immune system very well,\" he said.Said Zaks: \"We've demonstrated the utility to generate the right kind of immune response time and again in multiple phase one trials.\" The challenge of a dangerous phenomenonOne frequent hurdle for vaccine developers is a phenomenon known as disease enhancement, in which the vaccine actually promotes the infection and makes the disease worse.\"The worst possible thing you do is vaccinate somebody to prevent infection and actually make them worse,\" Fauci said at a White House briefing last month.This phenomenon underscores the importance of animal trials, experts say.Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, worked on development of a vaccine for SARS. Some of the animals he vaccinated wound up sicker than the ones he didn't vaccinate, once they were exposed to the virus.He told Reuters that he believes the Moderna trial should conduct animal studies prior to injecting the vaccine in humans.\"If there is immune enhancement in laboratory animals vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine, that's a showstopper,\" he told the news organization.A Moderna spokesperson said the company has not seen signs of enhanced disease in animal trials with the MERS vaccine that it was developing with NIH.\"Enhanced disease is a clinical finding that is very rarely seen,\" she said in an email.Potential setbacks fall into two broad categories: the vaccine isn't strong enough to produce an immune response or the vaccine causes safety issues.\"It's possible there's no actual production of antibodies, in which because either the mRNA didn't get into the cells, the cells didn't make the proteins from the mRNA or the immune system didn't recognize those proteins ... or the dose was too low,\" Dr. Evan Anderson, the lead investigator of the Moderna vaccine study at Emory University where part of the human trial is taking place, told CNN's Gupta in a recent interview.Anderson added that there is a \"theoretical possibility\" that the vaccine could trigger an \"enhanced immune response\" that actually worsens the illness.Jason Schrum, a founding scientist at Moderna, also pointed out that the vaccine formulation listed on Moderna's clinical trial page for Covid-19 doesn't seem to include a key element to conjure a strong efficacy in any vaccine: the adjuvants. Adjuvants stimulate the body's immune system to react to the vaccine antigen -- the molecules that trigger an immune response in the body. In other words, they boost the body's immune response.\"Typically, what you see in any vaccine if they use adjuvants, they clearly identify that and say this is the purpose of using in the vaccine formulation as an adjuvant,\" said Schrum, who is no longer with the company. \"In that one [Moderna], I just don't see that.\"Moderna confirmed that it is not using an adjuvant.\"We have not used adjuvants in our vaccine clinical trials,\" the spokesperson wrote in an email, adding that the trials have shown that Moderna's vaccines induce an immune response similar to that seen with natural infection.The former BARDA official told CNN that Moderna generates a lot of \"hype\" for an organization that has never entered the third and final phase of a clinical trial for a drug or vaccine. \"I don't think it's misplaced to -- I want to say question -- but have some healthy skepticism about the current efficacy of their technology,\" the expert said.Ian Haydon of Seattle is one of the trial participants who volunteered to take a shot in the arm in April. He said that so far -- after a couple of weeks -- aside from a sore arm for a day or two after the injection, he has experienced no symptoms.\"I'm eating normally, I'm sleeping normally, I feel fine,\" said Haydon, a 29-year-old science writer and a biotech consultant. Far from assuming he's immune, Haydon said he's being more careful than ever.\"Now that I am a subject of study, now would kind of be the worst time for me to get sick with the coronavirus,\" he said. \"I'm keeping locked up at my house, only going out to get groceries, hand-washing, wearing a mask, just like everybody should be.\"Petrovsky said the United States is unique in how it has poured so much money into \"one experimental technology.\"\"The danger here is ... if the US just backs one or two horses and they fall to the back of the pack, we're not going to have an effective vaccine in the US anytime soon.\"But Zaks says Moderna has delivered on its promises to US officials about its coronavirus vaccine, saying, \"When our CEO said that we would get this fast into the clinic, we did.\"That, he said, combined with the company's potential, is why \"the US government stepped in and picked our platform as one of the major investments that Tony Fauci and the team are making in. And I think if you stay in tuned, you should expect to see us be able to deliver on that.\"\n\nCNN's Scott Bronstein and Drew Griffin contributed to this report.",

The department relies on \"sound science and sound legal advice\" regarding inmate release, Villanueva said.The mid-April spike in positive cases drew the attention of authorities. On May 3, the department started testing everyone -- but at the time of the video, only those exhibiting symptoms were tested.

        "body": "Inside New York's notorious Rikers Island jails, 'the epicenter of the epicenter' of the coronavirus pandemic\n\nBy Sonia Moghe, CNN\n\nUpdated 1836 GMT (0236 HKT) May 16, 2020\n\n(CNN)As coronavirus cases began spiking in New York City in March, officials worried that the city's notorious jail system on Rikers Island could become a powder keg inside the epicenter of the pandemic.\n\nIn the weeks since, correctional officials handed out masks. They increased cleaning. And with a focus on creating more space for social distancing, the city pushed through the release from its jails of more than 2,600 people considered at low risk to commit a crime and high risk to contract the disease, with many of the inmates gaining their release through court decisions argued by advocacy groups. Despite these efforts, critics say there is still not enough sanitizing, social distancing and wearing of masks to stamp out an outbreak among 362 people currently incarcerated and more than 1,300 Department of Correction workers, according to data released by the Board of Correction on Friday. Since March, three inmates and 10 correction workers have died, according to New York City's Department of Corrections.Across 37 states, 88 inmates and 15 correctional staffers died from Covid-19 between January 21 and April 21, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. In all, 4,893 inmates tested positive, as did 2,778 correctional staff. \"Jail is inherently not a place where you can socially distance. It's just not built that way,\" said Caitlin Miller, an attorney with Legal Aid Society's parole revocation defense unit. \"It was inevitable that coronavirus was going to get to Rikers, and once it did, it would be a complete disaster. And that's exactly what we're seeing.\"Read MoreLaw enforcement officials say releasing inmates to curtail a public health crisis behind bars has increased the risk of crime, with the New York Police Department reporting about 150 people released from Rikers having been rearrested, some more than once. Some crimes were violent offenses, including domestic violence and attempted rape, police said. Advocates and a watchdog agency for the jail system contend that while correction officers wear masks, inmates don't nearly as often. Correction workers also warn their jobs are more unsafe than ever, as the number of employees with the coronavirus continues to climb. New York City's Department of Correction officials pushed back on some of these claims, arguing that the department's efforts are working. Seventy percent of the agency's facilities are less than half full and the number of symptomatic, quarantined inmates was decreasing, Commissioner Cynthia Brann said Tuesday at a public meeting. \"It's a clear indication our containment strategies are working,\" Brann said.CNN spoke with several inmates, correction officers, advocates, city officials and law enforcement officials to get a picture of what has happened at Rikers since March 1, the day New York City reported its first coronavirus case. Conditions on Rikers Island It is difficult to tell if the number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 among inmates in the city's jail system is increasing or decreasing because the population is constantly shifting, with new arrests and inmates being released every day. People who have been arrested and did not get released on bail are brought to Rikers Island, nearly 88% of its population is there on a pretrial basis.Correctional Health Services data showed a decrease in positive cases starting in mid-April. Most positive cases were coming from new arrestees entering the system, Chief Medical Officer Ross MacDonald said Tuesday. New arrivals who show symptoms and test positive are kept in a separate facility from those who are symptom-free, and the system is moving toward universal testing of new inmates, a Correctional Health Services spokeswoman told CNN.\"We've seen a dramatic change,\" MacDonald said. \"The most important intervention was a concerted effort at depopulation, which allowed us, I think, to do much better than many systems around the country despite having a broader epidemic that was more severe than anywhere in the country.\"But positive cases of coronavirus among correctional staff continue to increase. Correction officers tell CNN that their jobs have become more unsafe because of the virus.\"Every day, correction officers suit up and go in. Do we feel safe? I don't think anybody feels safe,\" said Elias Husamudeen, president of the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association, the union that oversees nearly 10,000 correction officers in New York City. \"We're the epicenter of the epicenter.\"All workers began getting masks and gloves on April 3 at the start of each shift after unions sued the city for more protective equipment and testing. Some workers began getting masks as early as March 11 depending on where they worked, correction officials said at a Board of Correction meeting.\"We are taking every precautionary measure to keep our personnel and people in custody safe,\" Peter Thorne, the top spokesman for the Department of Correction, the city agency that oversees Rikers, said in a statement to CNN when asked about unions' lawsuits.In the weeks since the city's first confirmed coronavirus case, inmates on Rikers said they've been using whatever they can get their hands on to protect themselves from Covid-19 behind bars. They wrap their faces with do-rags and T-shirts when masks are not available and use shampoo to clean themselves when they can't get soap. They employ alcohol pads from medical units and the barber shop to sanitize items that are shared among inmates, such as landline phones, and some put socks over the receivers. Department of Correction officials said Tuesday they began giving masks to all people in custody on April 3, plus cleaning supplies and soap for free. Officials said masks are available for inmates as needed, in every housing unit. \"No staff member and no person in custody is being required to reuse masks,\" Brann said. But Claudia Forrester, a jail services advocate with Brooklyn Defender Services, said she continues to get calls from inmates claiming they don't have access to supplies they need to keep themselves safe during the pandemic. Forrester is concerned correctional agencies are understaffed and ill-equipped to enforce their own policies, she said.\"We hear a very different story,\" Forrester said during the public meeting Tuesday, which conducted via video conferencing. \"Communication with those inside the walls makes it obvious that these procedures are not the lived reality.\"To get a handle on the reality, over two weeks in April, the city's Board of Correction, which oversees the city's jail system, had staffers observe inmates and correctional staff using surveillance footage. They found that 86% of correctional staff wore masks correctly, while inmates in common areas were seen wearing masks correctly only 17% of the time, auditors reported. \"Board staff observed people in custody not practicing social distancing, as they were sitting or standing close together in communal spaces such as dayrooms, especially around TV sets, phones, main doors, and during meals,\" according to a report of the agency's findings.Officials encourage detainees to wear masks and practice social distancing, Thorne told CNN, but \"we cannot force people in custody to comply.\" Living and working in the jails People in custody tell CNN they still sleep in beds that are a few feet apart, share phones that are not cleaned between uses, have trouble getting new masks and access to soap. There is also housing for inmates who test positive and show symptoms of the virus that allows them to be quarantined separately.But inmates are not allowed to use alcohol-based hand sanitizer, which the CDC recommends for preventing spread of the virus, as it is considered contraband by the Department of Correction because it is flammable.Luis Reyes, 34, who was detained after pleading not guilty to stealing a package, spoke to CNN in multiple 15-minute increments from a phone at a dorm-style jail facility on Rikers Island. The calls are free, but the phones -- shared by all inmates in his unit -- are a few feet apart.\"Sometimes, we clean the phones with alcohol pads. But there's not enough,\" Reyes told CNN. The Department of Correction told CNN it cleans phones every two hours. Board of Correction staffers observed phones being cleaned between inmate calls only 6% of the time, according to its April report. Inmates told CNN phones are constantly in use. Wayne Pritchard, 51, was held in Rikers for a parole violation and released on April 27 after arguing he was at risk of developing complications of the virus. Inmates knew from watching the news that they needed face coverings to prevent themselves from getting sick, he said. When they didn't get masks from correctional staff, they improvised. \"We took our do-rags and put them around our mouths,\" he said. \"We took T-shirts to cover our mouths.\"Since all in-person visits to Rikers Island were suspended on March 18, phones are the only way inmates can ask for help from those the outside. Several inmates told CNN they call family members or 311, the city's help line, to report problems like soap shortages. Kelsey De Avila, a social worker with Brooklyn Defender Services who normally visits inmates on Rikers Island, tries to do video visits with her clients, but it takes weeks to get a spot, she said.\"We cannot flatten the curve if we ignore the crisis that exists in our jails,\" De Avila told CNN. \"There are a number of people who are leaving these jails and coming back to our community.\" Among those moving in and out of jails are more than 11,000 Department of Correction employees.About a week after the first jail system employee died on March 15 from Covid-19, a correctional officer on Rikers Island began feeling symptoms -- a cough, headache and eventually a fever and trouble breathing, he said, speaking with CNN on the condition of anonymity because he fears losing his job. \"I'm touching all this mail, I'm delivering it to every single inmate,\" said the worker, who takes mail to and from inmates at multiple units and said he didn't get a mask to wear to work until March 19. \"If I don't have gloves and I'm touching all this stuff I still have to do my job either way.\"He called in sick from work toward the end of March and hasn't been back since, the employee said. He has tested positive for Covid-19 three times and still had a fever nearly 40 days later.Husamudeen said his union and others that represent jail workers have sued the city twice to get more protective equipment for workers, among other issues. Now, when correction officers start shifts, they are asked questions about possible Covid-19 symptoms, get their temperatures checked and are given a mask. The Department of Correction said it issued guidance in April requiring all staff, regardless of their posts, to wear a face mask, to have latex gloves and to practice social distancing when possible. \"We feel a degree of comfort in having the PPE (personal protective equipment) to try to keep us a little bit safer,\" Husamudeen said. \"But I don't think anybody feels safe with this particular virus that they still haven't gotten a grip on.\"Concerns about releases On April 5, Michael Tyson, who was incarcerated on Rikers Island but was being treated for coronavirus by Correctional Health Services at a hospital, became the first inmate on Rikers Island to die from complications of the virus.Correctional Health Services doctor, Rachael Bedard, who didn't treat Tyson directly, wrote in a piece for The Washington Post, \"We'd hoped to free him before he passed, but he wasn't released before it happened.\" Tyson was being held on Rikers Island because of a technical parole violation, and his death prompted the Legal Aid Society's attorney-in-charge of criminal defense Tina Luongo to warn, \"As the virus reaches its apex, many more will succumb unless the Governor and (the state corrections agency) act immediately to address the humanitarian crisis in our jails and prisons.\" New York state's Department of Corrections and Community Supervision has been working to release technical parole violators from local jails across the state, a spokesman for the agency said. Those types of violations include failing to report to a parole officer or failing to report an address change. The governor called for the release of people being held on parole violations at the end of March.The city's Board of Correction began pushing to release thousands of inmates as soon as possible in mid-March, even before Tyson's death. Those recommended for release were on Rikers Island on a pretrial basis, meaning they had not been convicted of crimes, were serving city sentences of 1 year or less, or were there because of state parole holds, board member Dr. Bobby Cohen told CNN.By mid-May, more than 2,600 inmates were released from Rikers Island for reasons ranging from their parole holds being lifted to courts determining their underlying health conditions could put them at risk for Covid-19 complications. Correctional Health Services screens people who are presented by the Department of Correction before being released to identify anyone who should self-isolate and connects those who need a place to self-isolate with hotels, according to the health services agency.But the city's decision to release thousands of inmates from its jails due to the pandemic did not sit well with some law enforcement leaders and victims' advocates.\"You know, we'll be fluid and adapt to conditions as more people start coming out. You know, we'll probably see crime rates ebb and flow in different areas, and we'll be ready to respond accordingly,\" NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said this week. An NYPD official told CNN the department voiced concerns about inmates with violent backgrounds that the city wanted to release that, but that its concerns weren't listened to. Since releases began in mid-March, about 150 inmates -- all released because of the virus -- have been rearrested, some multiple times, the NYPD official said.Some have been rearrested for robberies, assault, violating orders of protection from domestic violence victims, narcotics charges and attempted rape, the official told CNN. Some released inmates with charges involving domestic violence allegedly have committed more domestic violence crimes against their previous victims, the official confirmed. Less than 4% of those released offended again, the official said.This troubles Dorchen Leidholdt, the director of the legal center at Sanctuary for Families, an organization that supports survivors of domestic violence.\"We understand the reason to release people at Rikers. We are supportive of that,\" Leidholdt said. \"The fact that there are defendants with domestic violence charges against them being released, where scrutiny is clearly not happening, that's positively alarming.\"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday he was disappointed with those who have allegedly committed new crimes since being released from Rikers Island. \"I am convinced it was the right thing to do because we were thinking about the health and safety of everyone involved. And looking to save lives,\" de Blasio said. \"I'm disappointed in anyone who was shown mercy and turns around and commits an offense.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Jimmy Glenn, a former boxing trainer and Times Square bar owner, died on Thursday after fighting the novel coronavirus for weeks, his son told CNN.\n\nHe was 89.Glenn was hospitalized at NYU Langone Medical Center in April after suffering Covid-19 related symptoms and tested positive shortly after being admitted, his son Adam Glenn said. The former boxer and corner man was originally from South Carolina but spent most of his life in New York City. He began his boxing career as part of the Police Athletic League and later competed in The Golden Gloves for two years, according to the New Jersey Boxing Hall of Fame.Glenn left behind amateur boxing and went on to become a trainer, manager and cut man. In the 1970s, Glenn worked as a cornerman for heavyweight great Floyd Patterson and trained numerous boxers.Read MoreHe operated the now shuttered Times Square Gym for 18 years, working with fighters who considered him family.\"I would have these people coming up to me saying, you don't know what your dad did for me to help me, to get me off the streets,\" said Adam Glenn, 39. \"He could look into anyone and make you feel like he could be your best self.\"More recently, Glenn was a fixture at Jimmy's Corner, the dive bar he owned in Times Square.The bar is an homage to boxing and a favorite for those looking for beer and whiskey at reasonable prices in the area.For nearly five decades, Glenn would walk around the bar and often swapped fighting tales with his customers. He met his wife there when she was a bartender and later they decided to become the bar's owners, their son said.The bar is considered a New York City staple. It's covered from wall to wall with boxing posters, newspaper clippings, boxing gloves and even a Madison Square Garden ringside bell.When Glenn's wife died, his son quit his job as a lawyer and joined him to run Jimmy's Corner. \"I grew up in that bar, I have worked there since I was old enough to push or carry anything,\" Adam Glenn said. \"The bar was always as much my home as my parents' home was.\" In his final hours, Glenn was able to talk to his son one last time. \"He and I got to talk, he told me he loved me,\" Adam Glenn said of his father.Doctors did not tell Glenn's son that his father's death was directly caused by Covid-19, he says, but they told him that fighting the virus had weakened his body.Glenn was remembered by the boxing community in the United States and around the world. \"A legend of boxing has heard his final bell,\" Mauricio Sulaiman, president of the World Boxing Council, tweeted about Glenn's death on Thursday.Boxing promoter Lou DiBella said Glenn was an \"icon and a legend\" in New York City.\"Jimmy was an icon and a legend in #NYC, not because he was a giant in #boxing or because he owned an incredible pub, but because his heart was giving, pure and boundless. There are literally COUNTLESS people that Jimmy touched who are grieving right now...,\" DiBella tweeted.",

CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta is joined by CNN10 anchor Carl Azuz to answer some of the key questions on kids' minds these days.\n\nGupta: Today's episode is going to be a little different. So far on this podcast I've spoken to a lot of adults -- scientists, doctors, and even an astronaut. But they're not the only ones thinking about the coronavirus. Kids are listening and asking questions, too. Oftentimes, they ask the questions that adults are too embarrassed to ask. We've heard from a bunch of you and I hope I can help you understand what's going on right now.I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\"Gupta: A lot of kids around the world want to know when they can see their friends again. Read MoreI wish I could tell you I knew exactly when you could go back to having playdates and learning from your teachers in person, but there's just no answer to that yet. That's one of the hardest things about life during this time -- not having answers. But I've gotten some amazing questions from you, and I'm going to try and answer them the best I can. I've also brought in my friend Carl Azuz -- many of you probably know him as the anchor of CNN10 in classrooms across the country. Carl Azuz (on CNN10): We know what it's doing, we know where it's spreading, but where did Covid-19 come from? That's the first thing we're looking at today on CNN10 and we're happy to have you along for the hunt.Gupta: Hey Carl!Azuz: Sanjay, it's always a pleasure to work with you. Thank you for thinking of me. Gupta: So, let's jump right in. Our first question comes from Micah in Maryland.Micah: I wonder where the coronavirus came from. If it was from bats, how did it change or mutate? Thank you, stay well.Gupta: Thanks, Micah. Scientists do think that this coronavirus did come from bats in China. What we're not entirely sure about is exactly how it got into humans. It could be that the bat made another animal sick and then that animal got a human sick. Or it could be that it spread directly from bats to humans. It is also possible that the bats were studied in a lab and that the virus spread to humans that way. We just don't know yet. Next we have a question from PJ in Florida. PJ: Will we have to wear masks in public forever? Thank you. Azuz: I have good news for you, PJ. No, we are not going to have to wear masks in public forever, although some people might think they're pretty fashionable and want to keep it going. That's the good news. The bad news is we don't know when we'll be able to take them off. Gupta: That's right, Carl. And I think it's also important to remember that when you wear a mask, it's to help protect other people from you. It makes it less likely that you can spread the germs from you to somebody else. Remember, even if you're not sick, even if you're not coughing or sneezing, if you have the virus inside your body, you could possibly spread it to others. A mask helps prevent you from doing that. Azuz: Alright, Sachin is in New York City with our next question. Sachin: What do the germs look like? What do the germs feel like when you have them?Azuz: Sachin, I have no idea what germs look like. I think Dr. Sanjay Gupta might be the best person to answer that one.Gupta: Sachin, the thing about germs and viruses like this is that they are too small for us to see or feel even on our skin. But that doesn't mean that scientists haven't been able to use microscopes and get a good look at them. This coronavirus is called coronavirus because corona means crown. So this looks like a little blob with a crown on top of it. That crown is actually a bunch of little spikes that the virus uses to move around and to get inside the body. That's the reason you have to wash your hands a lot, because when you use soap and water, you can actually clean those germs off your hands even if you can't see it happening. Even though you can't see these germs or these viruses, they are all over the place. They're on door handles, sometimes they're on your toys. But the good news is that many of these germs aren't going to make you that sick. Now we have a question from Abby, in Washington, DC.Abby: My question about coronavirus is: Will I be able to go to camp and different places in the summer? Gupta: Abby, this is probably the number one question that I get even in my own home. What are things going to be like this summer? Well, Abby, there's a good chance that we may still have to be home this summer. We still don't know yet. We got to make sure that in different places around the country, things are headed in the right direction, that there are fewer people getting sick, that more people can get tested. When we get to that point, we may start to slowly open things back up. The one thing, Abby, we don't want to happen is that more people get sick that didn't need to because they went out too early. Now we have a question from Leonard in California.Leonard: Are there any drugs that can actually help you not get this virus?Azuz: Well I don't know if I would call it a drug, Leonard, but I can say that washing your hands is a really good way to keep yourself safe from this virus. Dr. Gupta: Yep, right now, the only medications for this coronavirus are ones that help treat your symptoms. So if you have a cough, runny nose or a fever, there are certain medicines that can help with that. But there are scientists all around the world in labs who are working at different treatments to treat the virus itself. And hopefully by the summer, we may have some good answers on that. Azuz: You know Sanjay, you are a doctor, you're going to have some pretty good points. And that was another one. You want to make sure that you are doing other things you can do just to keep yourself healthy, besides washing your hands, to eat a healthy diet. Fruits and vegetables. Make sure you get lots of sleep. Make sure you get some exercise as long as you're, you know, not getting too close to other people. And it's a good idea to do that, whether or not there's a threat from coronavirus. Santiago in California is next.Santiago: Will more families become poorer after this passes? I'm worried that my family or other families will become hungry or homeless.Azuz: Santiago, that's a very important question. I'm sorry that you're worried about it. As far as families becoming poorer, we do know that a lot of people have lost their jobs. There are a lot of folks who are unable to work right now because businesses are closed down. But there are also a lot of folks helping others. For one thing, the US government has spent trillions of dollars trying to get money to people in need. Also, we've heard from a number of different charity organizations. We know some churches are involved in helping their communities. And then there are some folks who are just giving lunches to students who might normally get those at school but can't because of the coronavirus. So the good thing here, Santiago, is the fact that so many people are helping others in different communities. And that's something that gives us all hope. And last question is from North Carolina. Sydney, what's on your mind?Sydney: When will the coronavirus be over? When will the scientists get a cure for the coronavirus and how will they find it?Azuz: Thanks for the question, Sydney. If it were up to me, it would be over in five minutes. Everybody would be healthy. You'd be able to go back to school, hang out with your friends, go to concerts, all the fun stuff that you and your parents love to do. Gupta: That's right, Carl. Sydney, everybody wants the answer to this question. One thing we need to make sure we can do is start to test people for the virus. Letting them know whether they have it in their bodies and making sure that if they do, they don't spread it to other people. Right now, Sydney, one of the most promising things out there is that scientists are working on finding a vaccine. That's a medicine that can help teach your body how to fight the virus. We probably won't have a vaccine until next year some time. But once that happens, that will protect us against this virus, just like a flu shot protects you against the flu.Gupta: These have all been really great questions. Thank you so much for sending them in. And Carl, thank you very much. I really appreciate it. You have such a great way of talking to kids. I know they adore you.Azuz: Hey, thank you, Sanjay. Always a pleasure working with you. Happy to be here.Gupta: Before I sign off, I want to talk directly to parents. Sometimes it's really hard to figure out how to explain what's going on right now to kids. I know, because I've had to talk to my own kids about it. Even if your kids are young, or aren't asking about it, experts say it's a good idea to start a conversation with them to see if they have questions or worries that they haven't yet expressed. Try asking your kids what they're hearing and thinking about things, and let them know it's okay to feel anxious. There are more tips for talking to kids about the coronavirus at CNN.com. And if you have older kids who want more information, they can watch Carl's show at CNN.com/cnn10. We'll be back tomorrow. Thanks for listening.",

        "body": "(CNN)Kids who may have multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, a troubling complication of Covid-19 infection, need immediate attention and will probably need to be hospitalized, doctors said Tuesday.\n\nSymptoms do not look like the classic symptoms of coronavirus and may mostly include stomach pain and vomiting, along with fever and perhaps a rash, the experts told other doctors during a meeting Tuesday organized by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.It's becoming clear that many of the children with the new syndrome have damage to their hearts and need immediate treatment, they said at the Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA) briefing. And they believe it's increasingly clear that Covid-19 is involved, even though many of the children test negative for the virus at first and never seemed to have had symptoms of infection.The syndrome appears to develop two to six weeks after infection with Covid-19 and affects mostly children who were perfectly healthy beforehand. The CDC issued a health alert last week warning pediatricians to be on the lookout, and at least 20 states plus Washington, DC have reported they are investigating possible cases.\"A striking finding here -- alarming -- is that in this group, about half the children already had coronary artery abnormalities,\" Dr. James Schneider, who heads pediatric critical care at Northwell Health in New York, told the briefing. Because the children were previously healthy, he thinks the abnormalities were caused by MIS-C, possibly as a result of a delayed immune response to the coronavirus.Read More\"Any child at home who has fever, abdominal pain or symptoms such as rash and conjunctivitis should be seen by a pediatrician right away,\" he advised. \"I think we need to have a low threshold for evaluation.\"'Alarming' findingsMore than half of the 33 children treated for MIS-C at Northwell in April and May had developed some sort of heart dysfunction, Schneider said. \"They need good, old-fashioned critical care.\"And most of the children had no underlying conditions that might make parents wary. \"No definitive underlying conditions predispose children to this,\" he said.Infectious disease specialist Dr. Nicholas Rister at Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, Texas, said he has examined several children with a range of symptoms.\"I feel very terrible -- some patients have said, you know, everything kind of hurts. And then swelling in various points of your body, especially your hands and your feet, and even your mouth,\" he said at a separate briefing.\"The biggest concern we have right now, especially in kids, is largely stemming from inflammation around the heart,\" he said. It's one reason doctors at first thought the syndrome was a rare condition known as Kawasaki disease. \"And not just the heart but the major vessels around the heart,\" he added.Dr. Michael Levin of Imperial College in London, who treated some of the first patients in Britain, said parents may hesitate to bring their children in, but they should.Some of the children he and his colleagues have treated were already critically ill when they arrived at the hospital. \"One of the reasons for this may have been the lockdown and fear of coming to hospital,\" he said. \"The public health message in the UK was that patients should try and stay at home and not attend hospital,\" he added. So children were staying home with fevers ... and arriving in a seriously ill state.\"Blood tests will quickly tell doctors if children might be experiencing MIS-C, Levin said. Tests for inflammation and heart damage can show if children are at risk and need to be hospitalized.Quick treatment appears to work and most children go home after a few days in the hospital, both Schneider and Levin said.Levin said most children tested negative for Covid-19 infection at first but later tests indicated they had probably had a past infection.He said these young patients were showing symptoms of extreme inflammatory response. \"There is a concern that we are seeing a dysregulated immune response,\" Levin told the briefing. \"The timing of this illness does seem to coincide with when acquired immunity would be developing.\"Many of the children in England who were diagnosed with MIS-C are from ethnic minoritie, Levin said. \"There seemed to be a predominance of children from black, African, Caribbean-British ancestry who accounted for about 46% of the cases,\" he said. Twenty-seven percent of the children with the illness in a recent New York study were Hispanic, Northwell's Schneider said.\n\nShelby Lin Erdman contributed to this story.",

        "body": "(CNN)In Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, located in the Illinois zip code hardest hit by the coronavirus, most residents are Hispanic.\n\nAmid a surge in cases, Latinos in Chicago represent nearly 39% of confirmed coronavirus cases, despite making up nearly 30% of the population. Four weeks ago, the percentage of confirmed cases among Latino residents was just 14%. Alex \"Demo\" Ramirez is among those cases, testing positive for coronavirus on May 1. \"I started moving around and I could not breathe,\" said Ramirez, speaking to CNN through the window of his basement apartment. The 28-year-old says he doesn't think people were taking the pandemic seriously enough in the beginning. But he also doesn't know many people who are able to stay home from work. Read More\"A lot of people don't have that benefit,\" said Ramirez. \"That's an actual benefit, being able to stay home for two weeks and not have to work.\"For those who have to commute to work, testing is likely their strongest defense. One neighborhood testing site run by Chicago community organization Project Vida alongside Howard Brown health, performs roughly 120 tests daily. The testing site has seen such demand since the beginning that at times they have had to turn people away due to simply a lack of human resources, a lack of time, or even exhaustion. When they first opened three weeks ago, Project Vida Executive Director Jerome Montgomery said they had a 47% positivity rate among those tested and only about a third of those individuals showed symptoms.\"Since then, our positivity rate has come up to 57.21%,\" said Montgomery.\"Things don't seem to be slowing down. If anything it's ramping up. The pandemic may be new, but the crises and the disproportionate resources in the community is not.\" 'Dying at a higher rate' Chicago's high coronavirus infection rate among Latinos mirrors a trend seen in cities across the country.In California, Latinos represent 70% of all coronavirus related deaths within the demographic of those 18 to 49-years-old, despite making up just 43% of the population, according to data from the California Department of Public Health. \"That's the occupational side of this -- a disproportionate number of black and brown communities are not teleworking or not home working. They're right on the front lines,\" said California Gov. Gavin Newsom, during one of his daily coronavirus updates.In New York City, Hispanics are dying at rates more than 50% higher than their white counterparts, and more than twice the rate of Asians, according to the New York City Health Department. \"We are dying at a higher rate because we have no other choice,\" said Frankie Miranda, president of the Hispanic Federation, a national Latino organization that supports Hispanic families and communities. \"These are the delivery food people, the people that are the day workers, the farm workers, these are people that are working in restaurants. They are essential services, and now they are not enjoying the protections that maybe in other industries people can have.\"'This pushes you to do things that you never did before'In just a few months, Covid-19's economic toll has left lifelong scars. With unemployment in the United States soaring to levels not seen since the Great Depression, Hispanic unemployment sits at nearly 19%, an all time high and higher than any other demographic. \"We're struggling,\" said Patty Navarro, manager of Novias Davila, a Little Village bridal boutique. With proms and weddings on hold until further notice, Navarro has shifted to making masks. She says her store initially donated over 10,000 of them, but now she sells them for $5 each. \"This pushes you to do things that you never did before,\" said Navarro. \"It's not easy.\"Michael Rodriguez, alderman for Chicago's Ward 22, which includes Little Village, agrees that the community faces unprecedented challenges. \"We've got a lot of work to do,\" he said. \"Little Village is filled with working class individuals, people who are essential to our economy, people who are the backbone of Chicago's economy. And the fact is, they're forced to go to work.\"It's a reality playing out across the country, and one hat has likely contributed to infections and potentially even deaths, health experts have said.\"People are losing people out here,\" said Ramirez, wearing a mask and gloves at home, while still recovering from his coronavirus hospitalization.He said, \"You've gotta take it as serious as you take your own life.\"",

        "body": "Washington (CNN)Congressional lawmakers and the Trump administration are on the verge of striking a deal on a nearly $500 billion package to extend funding for an emergency small business lending program, provide additional funding for hospitals and expand funding for coronavirus testing.\n\nNothing is final until everything is agreed to -- and they aren't there yet. But a resolution to a weeks-long stalemate is coming. Bottom lineFewer than four weeks ago, Congress passed the largest economic rescue package in the country's history at $2 trillion. Now they are about to move forward on another *half-trillion*-dollar package -- and this is only considered an \"interim\" package before a significantly larger deal. If you want to know how truly devastating the economic damage is right now, just look at this response. The scary part? This comment from a senator to CNN Sunday night: \"This still isn't enough. Not even close.\" About that optimismRead MoreThere was no shortage of optimism on Sunday as Democrats and administration officials made clear a deal was near, and leaders in both parties held calls with their respective caucuses to lay the groundwork for the agreement. But they aren't there yet, according to multiple people involved. Late Sunday night, the two sides were still having significant disagreements on a few elements on the package, the people said. \"This will get done. It has to,\" one source told CNN before cautioning that action as soon as Monday was \"maybe a bit too optimistic.\" What to watch Monday:When a deal is announced.What the actual legislative text of that deal looks like.What the timeline is for moving forward on the House and Senate.What lawmakers and small business owners are talking aboutIn the dozens of small business owners and lawmakers we've spoken to over the last several days about various elements on the Small Business Administration's Paycheck Protection Program, almost to a person, one thing has been a constant: frustration (and in some cases white-hot rage) about the large restaurants that have received PPP loans. To be clear, it's all legal -- and the result of a specific provision in the law restaurants lobbied for during the legislative drafting of the program (and many, many lawmakers hearing from restaurants back in their states and districts were supportive of that carve-out, it should be noted).But Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, Potbelly, J. Alexander's, Jura Sushi and others announcing in government filings they'd received millions from a tapped-out small business program has drawn significant anger from small business owners -- and some reflection from lawmakers who wish the law was drafted in a tighter manner. That said, public pressure, particularly in instances like this, can often do far more than legislative amendments. Take, for example, Shake Shack.Heads upHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat, notified members Sunday they would need to return to Washington this week to vote on the package. Democrats have expected Republicans will call for a recorded vote. The expectation is it would occur sometime mid-week, but it all depends on a final agreement being reached. The deal's top linesSBA PPP program: $310 billionSBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan program: $60 billionHospital funding: $75 billion Testing funding: $25 billion The sticking pointsThe biggest sticking point is over the testing piece of the package. Democrats want Republicans to agree to making the Trump administration come up with a national testing plan in addition to the $25 billion they want to boost testing. The money isn't an issue. But multiple sources say that attaching strings that could potentially put the President and the administration in the seat for a political blame game is an issue.\"Republicans view this as a political play,\" one source said.A reality check packageThe longer these negotiations have gone on, the more obvious it has become that the needs are far greater than replenishing the depleted PPP funds. What began as a straight $251 billion request to increase money for the PPP has morphed into a package that is expected to include $75 billion for hospitals and at least $25 billion to boost the country's testing capacity in addition to more money for SBA. The money for SBA has also grown to at least $300 billion for the PPP loan program and additional money for Economic Injury Disaster Loan Emergency Advance that has faced a massive increase in application volume over the last month.The growing cost of the legislation is symptom of just how rapidly the economic outlook for the country is shifting week to week. What began as an offer by Republicans to simply increase the amount of money for SBA became a much larger bill in part because members themselves were hearing from cash-strapped hospitals. And, as the country grows tired of stay-at-home-orders, testing is only becoming more of a priority for Americans anxious to get back to work.Where Democrats standDemocrats, if they are being candid, will acknowledge the push for state and local government funding has been a bridge too far for days now. They wanted it, they won't get it, but they will get significant funds for several other key pieces they've pushed for the last two weeks. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi held a call with her leadership team on Sunday and Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer has remained in close touch with his members over the last several days as the deal has come together.Where Senate Republicans standMajority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, held a call with his members Sunday afternoon to gauge support for the broad outlines of the package. The call also included President Donald Trump, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. According to one source familiar, Trump said little on the call, but his presence spoke volumes about his desire to get the package passed quickly. Again, when you can only pass items by unanimous consent, you have to have every single member on board. Trump's presence on the call was intended to send a message that this is important to the President. Where House Republicans standHouse Republicans also held a Sunday call with Mnuchin and Meadows. The call was an opportunity to brief members on the latest contours of negotiations, but also another chance for Republicans to voice the concerns they have a about specific regulations related to PPP. Rep. Mark Amodei, a Republican from Nevada, continues to share his concerns on the calls that smaller casinos aren't eligible for PPP loans.Members also raised concerns Sunday that restaurants applying for PPP are having a hard time getting workers to come back under their payroll because in some instances, unemployment insurance payments are higher than what they could provide. Remember: PPP is supposed to go largely to paying payroll costs (Treasury wrote it so that 75% of the loan is supposed to go to payroll), something Republicans and Democrats have voiced frustrations with. Many argue that businesses like restaurants need the money to pay utilities or high rent. Where the administration standsThe administration, and congressional Republicans, drew one clear line in the sand in opposing Democratic efforts to add funding for state and local governments to the package. But there's no question Mnuchin and the White House have moved toward Democrats on this looming deal. That said, much of what Democrats were asking for wasn't all that controversial. But it did take time to pull together, draft and agree on (an agreement that still hasn't been officially clinched as of Monday morning). That fact has outraged Republicans who simply wanted to re-up the funding for a program that was already massively oversubscribed. Mnuchin, in his interview on CNN's \"State of the Union\" Sunday, made clear funds for state and local governments would be a piece of the next legislative package. \"The President has heard from the governors and he's prepared to discuss that in the next bill,\" Mnuchin said.",

        "body": "(CNN)Two attorneys representing ICE detainees involved in a violent altercation with corrections officers in Massachusetts said they suspect the officers were retaliating for a class action suit.\n\nAn altercation over coronavirus tests broke out at the at the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center in Bristol County on Friday, after 10 ICE detainees and 15 other detainees reported Covid-19 symptoms but refused to get tested, officials said. Their lawyers said their clients refused testing for fear of exposure to the virus. According to the Bristol County Sheriff's Office, the detainees \"rushed violently at Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson and corrections officers, barricaded themselves inside the facility, ripped washing machines and pipes off the wall, broke windows and trashed the entire unit.\"Pepper spray was used to break up the incident, ICE said in a statement. No officers were injured, but three detainees were taken to a hospital. Jonathan Darling, a spokesman for the Bristol County Sheriff's Office -- which runs the detention center where the clash occurred -- blasted the lawyers' suggestion of payback. Read More\"Retaliation? That's absurd,\" Darling said. \"They trashed the place and attacked officers. All part of the misinformation campaign these lawyers are spreading. It's shameful.\"The lawsuit, filed in March on behalf of all ICE detainees in Bristol County, asked the court to determine whether their detention was unlawful, and demanded the immediate release of the ICE detainees along with implementation of proper protocols to limit the spread of Covid-19 in the facility. \"When we filed the lawsuit, we were receiving alarming reports from detainees that they had no soap, no disinfectant, no sanitizer, and that guards were showing up to the facility with symptoms,\" said Iv\u00e1n Espinoza-Madrigal, executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights (LCR). \"And so it was a tinderbox waiting to be lit with Covid-19.\"The suit, filed in federal court in Massachusetts, named Hodgson, County House of Corrections Superintendent Steven Souza, Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, and various ICE officials as defendants, according to the copy provided by lawyers. To date, the class action has resulted in the humanitarian release of over 40 civil immigration detainees, according to lawyers and the sheriff's office.Fear of the virusLCR Litigation Director Oren Sellstrom said their clients told them the corrections officers at the facility didn't always wear the required protective equipment to prevent Covid-19 infection. Espinoza-Madrigal also said their clients told them they hadn't been provided with masks. Darling disputed that claim, saying all prisoners at the facility are required to wear masks and have soap. The facilities are \"cleaned every shift every day.\"Fifteen detainees who reported Covid-19 symptoms or were in close contact with symptomatic individuals all tested negative, Darling said. So far, he said there have been no positive Covid-19 cases among the incarcerated population. Ten staff members have tested positive, he said. Six are out, and expected to be back soon, and four have already recovered and returned to duty.Espinoza-Madrigal said the medical status of the three detainees hospitalized at St. Luke's in New Bedford after Friday's clash was unknown. He didn't know whether the seven other detainees involved in the altercation with officers were currently housed in the facility's medical unit or if they had been tested. Charges may be filed, sheriff saysAt a press conference on Saturday, Sheriff Hodgson said that the office would be reviewing tapes of the incident with plans to file charges, in addition to any potential state investigation.Hodgson also sharply criticized Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who called for an independent investigation and the release of surveillance footage of the incident. \"America's sheriffs are done with these people in Congress who spend all their time using issues like this for their political advantage. And Joe Kennedy ought to be ashamed of himself,\" said Hodgson. \"He may be running for Senate, but you don't play games with my staff's lives and the lives of the people we're charged with, using it for your political gain.\"ICE will review incidentICE said it is reviewing the Friday incident, during which facility staff eventually used pepper spray to stop the detainees, according to the agency.The use of pepper spray was \"consistent with agency protocol,\" ICE said. After it was used, \"the detainees became compliant and facility staff was able to restore order in the facility.\"Three detainees were taken to a hospital after the incident, one for symptoms of a panic attack, another for a preexisting condition, and a third \"for a medical incident after being removed from the unit,\" ICE said. All three are expected to be fine, according to the sheriff's office. No facility staff were injured, ICE said. The detainees caused more than $25,000 in damages to the facility, according to the sheriff's office.Espinoza-Madrigal said attorneys have not been able to contact detainees since the Friday incident.The ACLU of Massachusetts and other advocates for the detainees have called for an independent investigation of Friday's events. \"These reports are deeply disturbing,\" Carol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, said in a statement. \"We are concerned for our clients, and everyone detained in the Bristol County House of Correction and ICE detention.\"\n\nCNN's Rob Frehse contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)As coronavirus sweeps across the nation, with some states seeing drops in numbers while hotspots emerge in others, experts are warning it's unlikely a vaccine will be ready this year.\n\nOver 73,000 people have died of coronavirus and more than 1.2 million are infected in the United States, according to Johns Hopkins University. Vaccines to prevent coronavirus infections are racing through development at unprecedented speeds. But scientists won't know if the vaccines can prevent infection until April or May next year, said Dr. Mark Mulligan, director of the Vaccine Center at New York University's Langone Health.The first phrase of the trial will determine if it is safe, he said, which typically takes three to four months.\"That's actually the most important first question and then we want to know if it's tolerated well and if it produces an antibody response that might be protective after those first three or four months,\" Mulligan said.Read More\"You go onto the question does it protect, and that'll take several months as well,\" he added. \"I do really think we're talking about getting through to the end of the year and into early next year before we would have a definitive answer.\"President Donald Trump had said one would be available by December, then appeared to back off his claim this week. There are more than 100 vaccines under development all over the world, according to the World Health Organization. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has said it's possible to have a coronavirus vaccine by January. Meanwhile, an expert warned that life will look different for the next 12 to 18 months as we wait for a vaccine. \"I don't think we're all going to have to stay home for 12 to 18 months,\" said epidemiologist Caitlin Rivers, a senior scholar and assistant professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"I think there will be a period where we are able to shift from everyone having to stay home to slow the spread, into these case based interventions.\"That means contact tracing and isolation and quarantine of people who could spread the virus.No state has met the guidance on reopeningMore than 40 states are partially reopening and lifting stay-at-home restrictions. But none of them have met the White House's guidelines on reopening, Rivers said. Rivers described the four criteria at a House Appropriations Subcommittee on Wednesday:\"The first is to see the number of new cases decline for at least two weeks, and some states have met that criteria. But there are three other criteria and we suggest they should all be met,\" Rivers said. They include having enough resources to conduct contact tracing on new cases, enough diagnostic testing to test everybody with Covid-like symptoms and \"enough health care system capacity to treat everyone safely.\"But the US hasn't done enough to protect people from the coronavirus pandemic, said Dr. Richard Besser, former acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It must overcome major obstacles to help prevent a resurgence of coronavirus, he said. \"We don't have the testing capacity now to know where this disease is,\" Besser said. \"We have not scaled up the thousands and thousands of contact tracers that we need, we don't provide safe places for people to isolate or quarantine.\"It will take weeks to learn how many new cases and deaths emerge after states start easing restrictions. Here's where all 50 states stand on reopening Blood thinners could help save patients' lives As experts work to discover what treatment options may exist, a new study finds blood thinners could play a crucial role in treating seriously ill coronavirus patients. Some patients hospitalized with coronavirus develop blood clots throughout the body, complicating treatment. The findings from a team at Mount Sinai Hospital could help with the problem that has shocked health care workers treating those affected by the virus. The team is running experiments to see which anticoagulants work best, and at which doses. \"The patients who received anticoagulants did better than those who didn't,\" said Dr. Valentin Fuster, physician-in-chief of The Mount Sinai Hospital. \"This has implications already. People, I believe, should treat these patients with antithrombotics,\" he added.The findings are not clear enough yet to make solid recommendations. The team noted that patients who were already severely ill were more likely to be given the blood thinners.Pentagon's considering a ban on survivorsFor those who contract Covid-19, the recovery process can be long and arduous, with reports of shortness of breath and other complications weeks after testing negative.Due to little understanding of the virus's longterm effects, a defense official said, the Pentagon is considering guidance banning new military recruits who have been hospitalized for Covid-19.There's concern potential recruits who have been hospitalized may need further medical assessments, the official said, but the policy would not apply for those who obtain a waiver.Department of Defense medical waivers are required for various medical conditions, including heart disease and loss of vision. The fact that sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt are still testing positive weeks after the coronavirus outbreak on the ship is underlining the need to solve the medical mystery of why some people carry the virus but have no symptoms and may continue to test negative, Navy officials said.With the military living and operating in close quarters, with sailors on ships at sea for months, testing and understating of the virus is a priority to ensure units can deploy safely.\n\nCNN's Maggie Fox, Barbara Starr and Konstantin Toropin contributed to this report",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n\"Covid Heroes and Newsmakers\" is a weekly social media series featuring interviews with Africans driving strategy as the continent faces Covid-19. Watch on CNN Africa Instagram.\n\nLagos, Nigeria (CNN)Nigerian medical delivery company Lifebank has launched two drive-through mobile testing centers to boost coronavirus testing numbers in the country.\n\nThe test centers, built like restaurant drive-throughs, are located in Lagos, Nigeria's commercial center, and Oyo, in the southwest of the country. Lifebank says it launched the free testing centers in partnership with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR). Nigeria has 1,273 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of April 26, according to the Nigeria Center for Disease Control (NCDC), the country's leading national public health institute responsible for collating data and responding to suspected cases of the virus. The NCDC has tested more than 10,000 samples to date in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and home to an estimated 195 million people according to the World Bank. Temie Giwa-Tubosun, founder of Lifebank, said she was inspired to start the mobile test centers when she decided that the country was not testing enough people for the virus.\"I read too much about the virus and got anxious. I realized that testing was a problem so I started to think up ways to get more people tested for the virus,\" she told CNN.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nTemie Giwa-Tubosun @temiegiwa has successfully launched 2 drive-through coronavirus testing centres in Lagos and Ibadan, Nigeria. She is also working on a project to boost oxygen supplies in the country, vital in treating #Covid19. Join us as she tells us how to scale testing in the country. We celebrate you and your work Temie. #cnnafricacovidheroes\n\nA post shared by CNN Africa (@cnnafrica) on Apr 22, 2020 at 2:39pm PDT\n\nRead MoreDrive-through coronavirus test centersLifebank has received funding from stakeholders in Nigeria including Sterling Bank, UTL Trust, Rising Tide, and the Daystar Center, which means it can provide the tests for free. Residents register first on the NIMR website where they are asked a series of questions to determine whether they are at risk of contracting the virus, says Giwa-Tubosun. \"You are only selected and invited for testing if you meet the case definition for coronavirus, or if you have the symptoms. NIMR and Lifebank staff select the people who get invited for testing,\" she explained.NCDC staff double-check patients who show up at the center actually have symptoms of the virus, while the test is done by NIMR staff, said Giwa-Tubosun. \"We are leaving the certified government agencies to do the testing while we (Lifebank) assist them with setting up the infrastructure, sorting out the funding, budgeting and procurement,\" she said. In Lagos, 250 people have been tested for free, and in Oyo over 500 people have been tested. Giwa-Tubosun says the goal is to test 2,000 people per center during their operational lifetimeOxygen supply Lifebank is also delivering medical oxygen, a critical supply needed in severe cases of coronavirus.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), hospitalized patients with coronavirus should be given supplemental oxygen therapy as part of early supportive treatment. But Africa currently has a shortage of medical oxygen and ventilators. \"We have always delivered emergency oxygen through an initiative called Airbank,\" said Giwa-Tubosun, \"but what we are doing now, thanks to sponsors, is expanding deliveries to bigger oxygen cylinders to supply for Covid-19 patients.\"The company has also created a database containing the number of ventilators, ICU beds and respirators available in private hospitals and health centers in Nigeria; information collated from volunteers and Lifebank employees' calls to private facilities.\"We are talking to agencies of the government to find out what supplies they have and what they need,\" said Giwa-Tubosun. \"We want the database to be available so that they (government agencies) can reach out to the private sector and strike out deals with them regarding the equipment they need.\"So far, 768 ventilators, ICU beds, and respirators in Nigeria have been identified.Kenya and Ghana expansion Lifebank is also expanding the database to Kenya, and is looking to do the same in Ghana and Ethiopia . \"We had our team in Kenya call about 500 hospitals,\" Giwa-Tubosun said. So far, Lifebank has found 64 ventilators, 6 respirators and 265 ICU beds in 11 cities in the East African country as of April 27.Lifebank is not making a profit from its work around coronavirus; the reward is in providing solutions that limit the spread of the virus, Giwa-Tubosun said.\"I didn't have plans to do anything around Covid-19 when it first started, but I read too much about it and started having nightmares about ventilators and the virus,\" she said. \"The next day I called the team and we got to work.\"",

    "Lifting lockdowns safely relies on effective testing. Germany surges ahead, but US states are flying blind": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "(CNN)People in the US state of Georgia can now get their nails done, their hair cut -- even get a tattoo or a massage -- after just three weeks of a state-wide stay-at-home order. That's an awful lot of touching, considering a highly contagious and deadly virus is going round.\n\nThese activities may give some people in Georgia a sense that life is returning to normal, but Governor Brian Kemp's decision to allow such businesses to reopen on Friday is a risky roll of the dice. In a state that has performed a relatively small number of coronavirus tests, Kemp is driving Georgia through this pandemic blindfolded.As governments around the world begin easing their lockdowns -- and as new infections are inevitable -- they will get another chance to get their responses right.Many are embracing that second chance, but some US states are not. There are now fears that reopening too quickly, or too boldly, could mean a second wave of infections in the US as fierce as the first. If any one lesson has come out of the rapid spread and sweeping death toll of this coronavirus over the past few months, it's the importance of testing, health experts have reiterated. Read MoreWithout a vaccine in sight, what governments need to do to safely lift lockdowns is test, trace and quarantine, according to WHO spokeswoman Dr. Margaret Harris.\"We need to know where the virus is, and then separate the sick from the healthy -- that's why you need testing. You need to check that people who have symptoms actually have the virus, and then find people who they've been in contact with and isolate them,\" she told CNN. \"If you can't do that, then you go back to square one.\"In two suggested plans for reopening the US economy, public health experts and economists said that the country would have to perform millions of tests each week before restrictions could be safely lifted. The US has carried out 4.69 million tests in total, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project via Johns Hopkins University (JHU). That's a far cry from the Rockefeller Foundation's recommendation, which suggests having a capacity for 3 million a week within the next two months. In its plan, to which prominent experts contributed, the foundation says the country should expand that capacity to 30 million a week over the next six months. Another plan, by Harvard University's Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, published on Monday, suggests the country will need to deliver at least 5 million tests a day by early June to begin reopening, and as many as 20 million a day to fully remobilize the economy, ideally by late July. US misses testing benchmark (but so does the UK)The way some leaders talk about the level of testing can be confusing. President Trump had claimed that the US had carried out the most tests in the world, and while that may be true, per capita, it's not leading.While it's useful to look at how widely a country is testing per capita, the WHO says there is a better benchmark to measure whether a country is testing adequately. Dr. Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programs, said recently that a good benchmark is to have at least 10 negative cases for every one positive case confirmed. That means if a state or country carries out testing and comes back with positive cases of around 9% or under, then it's likely that it is testing well.The US has a positive result rate of 18.8%, going by the COVID Tracking Project's figures cited by JHU. Such high rates suggest a country is only testing the worst cases, usually people who are severely ill and in hospital, Harris said. It's the same picture in individual US states. Georgia has carried out around 101,000 tests, with a positive result rate of 21.6%, even further away from the WHO benchmark. Elsewhere, several European countries are also lagging far behind in testing and will need to catch up to safely reopen their societies.The UK stands out, with just over 610,000 tests carried out and a positive case rate of 23.4%, worse than Georgia.The difference is, the UK government has extended its social restrictions. But it is looking at when and how to lift its lockdown. The UK government has set a goal of performing 100,000 tests a day by the end of the month, and while it insists it's on track, it was only able to carry out around 28,500 on Thursday, raising speculation that it will fail to meet its target. France and Sweden are also performing tests below the WHO benchmark.Germany lifts lockdown with cautionGermany makes a good case for comparison with the US. It too has begun easing its lockdown, and it too leaves much of the decision-making to individual states. Yet its approach is far more rigorous than what we're seeing in Georgia, and Germany's states are showing a uniform sense of caution.Germany has an enormous capacity to test. At its peak around two weeks ago, it carried out around 400,000 tests a week, according to the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), the national public health body. It has the capacity now to perform 730,000 tests weekly, and plans to ramp up the number of tests as its lockdown eases.By the end of last week, RKI reported that Germany had tested more than 2 million people and has a positive result rate of 7.5%, well above the WHO benchmark.Last week, German Chancellor Angela Merkel laid out a list of steps the country would undertake to begin lifting its lockdown, and on Monday stores up to 800 square meters in size began reopening, as long as they have hygiene and social distancing measures in place. Bookshops, car dealerships and bike stores can also now reopen regardless of their size. Restaurants, bars and gyms will remain closed. Merkel also announced that the country would ramp up its contact tracing efforts, deploying a team of five officers for every 20,000 people in the population to trace people who may have come into recent contact with every confirmed case. But Merkel has repeatedly warned that the situation could quickly reverse if people do not adhere to social distancing measures, which are still in place. On Thursday, the Chancellor warned Germany was on \"the thinnest ice\" after many people flocked to shopping areas and pedestrian zones this week, prompting German virologists to warn against complacency. While Merkel supports the reopening decisions made by the federal government and the states, \"their implementation worries me ... they appear to be very bold, maybe too bold,\" she said.Germany only considered reopening as its reproduction rate -- the average number of people each person is infecting -- had fallen below 1, to 0.7. According to the WHO, keeping this rate below 1 means the virus can decline and eventually die out. On Friday, however, German authorities reported that rate had gone up to 0.9. Trump contradicts White House stanceThe messaging in the US has been less coordinated and clear. In theory, the White House supports the idea of widespread testing, contact tracing and quarantining. It calls for just that in its \"Guidelines for Opening Up America Again.\"But Trump, in the face of a staggering increase in unemployment related to the shutdowns, has at the same time pushed several governors aggressively to reopen their economies, some of them before May 1. That's despite a recent model by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, at the University of Washington, that shows no state should open before that date, suggesting about half the states in the country should remain closed until May 25 or later. Georgia is opening around eight weeks too early, according to the model.Trump has also supported protesters rallying against stay-at-home measures that they say violate their rights.Kemp, a Republican governor and staunch Trump ally, appeared to have the President's support in his plan. But on Wednesday, Trump changed his tune, saying he \"strongly\" disagreed with Kemp's approach and that \"it's just too soon\" to open businesses like hair and salons, and tattoo parlors.Kemp on Thursday defended his plan, saying on Twitter that his decision was data driven, though he provided no data to support his statement. \"Our next measured step is driven by data and guided by state public health officials. We will continue with this approach to protect the lives -- and livelihoods -- of all Georgians,\" he wrote.In separate posts, he also said that the state was dramatically ramping up its testing capacity.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Thursday that if he were advising Kemp, he would tell him \"not to just turn the switch on and go.\" \"Because there is a danger of a rebound. And I know there is a desire to move ahead quickly. That's a natural human nature desire. But going ahead and leapfrogging into phases where you should not be, I would advise him as a health official and as a physician not to do that,\" said Fauci, who is part of the White House's coronavirus task force.There's plenty of opposition to Kemp's plan in Georgia as well, and many shop owners there said they wouldn't reopen on Friday.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a Democrat, told CNN in an interview that she was \"perplexed that we have opened up this way.\"\"I don't know how you get a haircut and keep a safe distance from someone who is cutting your bangs, it just doesn't make sense to me,\" she said.And it's not just Georgia. Oklahoma also allowed \"personal care businesses\" like hair salons to open on Friday, in a plan that looks very similar to Georgia's. Montana will lift its stay-at-home order on Sunday while most businesses where social distancing can be practiced are allowed to open. Florida has already reopened some its beaches, in a controversial decision that drew criticism on social media.All data in this story was accurate at 1p.m. ET on April 24, 2020.\n\nCNN's Nadine Schmidt reported from Berlin.

Those who get tested at drive-thru testing sites can usually get results within 24 to 48 hours. Garcetti said at the news conference that the testing would be open to city residents only, but according to a news release and the city's website, all Los Angeles County residents can sign up for a free test. Those with symptoms will be given first priority, but Garcetti encouraged even asymptomatic residents to get tested.Read More\"If you feel you need a test, get one. If you want to be safe, get one,\" Garcetti said. He encouraged all residents to get a test if they want one, even if they don't have symptoms. The decision to expand the availability of tests came after the city opened more testing locations and found that tests were leftover each night, Garcetti said.There are 34 testing sites across the city and county of Los Angeles, with a capacity to test 18,000 people per day. More than 140,000 people have been tested throughout those testing sites, according to Garcetti.Health experts have said states should ramp up testing in order to safely reopen. California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday that the state is instituting a phased reopening plan.The state is currently in Stage 1, which involves staying home and working on flattening the curve. The state is still \"weeks away\" from opening retail businesses and schools,\" Newsom said.",

        "body": "Washington (CNN)The Louisiana Secretary of State's office this week launched its absentee ballot request form as part of an election plan to protect voters amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLouisiana election law requires that voters meet one of several reasons to be eligible to vote absentee. Republican Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin, in coordination with Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards, pushed to expand this to include people with concerns about coronavirus exposure.The expansion was included in a revised plan passed by the Republican-led state legislature last week. The absentee ballot request form is now available on Ardoin's website. The new absentee ballot form will only apply to the state's upcoming July presidential primary and August municipal general election, but not the November presidential election.The expanded acceptable reasons for a person to request an absentee ballot include being at high risk because of underlying medical conditions, being subject to a medically necessary quarantine or isolation order, being advised by a health care provider to self-quarantine, experiencing Covid-19 symptoms and seeking a medical diagnosis, and caring for someone who is subject to a quarantine or isolation order and has been advised to self-quarantine. \"This is a great result for Louisiana's voters and election workers, especially those most susceptible to the COVID-19 virus,\" Ardoin said in a statement when the plan was approved. \"Our plan serves as a pragmatic and temporary response to the COVID-19 pandemic ravaging our nation.\"Read MoreOther election changes that state election officials are implementing include the relocation of polling sites and the expansion of the number of early voting days. \"Obviously we want as many people to vote as possible, and we want it to be as safe as possible...we are preparing for an influx,\" Ardoin spokesman Tyler Brey told CNN. Brey said Louisiana has a high in-person voting rate and that election officials are hopeful that the pandemic will eventually slow down this election year to a point where people will be comfortable and safe to vote in person. The new election plan is already getting pushback from voting rights groups. On Thursday, a federal lawsuit seeking a more robust expansion to the plan was brought by the the NAACP, Power Coalition for Equity and Justice and four individual voters. The lawsuit looks to completely eliminate the need for \"an excuse\" for vote by mail, therefore broadening the option to everyone.Cases of coronavirus in Louisiana have surpassed 30,000, with more than 2,200 deaths, according to data from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering. The plan comes as Louisiana and other states have grappled with how to deal with the pandemic while still holding elections. A Texas judge last month ruled that registered voters could vote absentee if they feared catching coronavirus. And on Thursday, Delaware Gov. John Carney announced a second delay in the state's upcoming primary and said state election officials will be mailing absentee ballot applications to all registered Democrats and Republicans in the state ahead of the primary, now set for July. Louisiana was the first state to postpone its presidential primary. It was initially moved from April 4 to June 20, but Edwards later signed a proclamation moving the election a second time, to July 11. More than a dozen states have announced some form of election day changes or plans hoping that a later date will coincide with the end of the outbreak.",

The new \"personal health certification\" is expected to launch in the next few weeks, according to Angie Westbrock, Lyft's vice president of global operations and head of its Covid-19 Response Task Force.The certification, which will appear in the app, will require that drivers and riders agree to wear a face covering, not use the service if they think they may have coronavirus or related symptoms, and follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local regulations.That includes confirming they will \"leave windows open when possible and avoid recirculated air,\" and passengers sitting in the backseat instead of sitting up front with the driver, per CDC guidance. Drivers will have to re-confirm each day that they sign on to drive and riders will have to do so once a week.Read More\"When you wear a mask, you're demonstrating to someone that you care about them,\" Westbrock said during a short press briefing Thursday. \"The personal certification is helping give both riders and drivers that extra piece of mind during this time.\"Riders and drivers can opt not to take or accept a ride if they feel unsafe and can report someone to the company for not following the policies.The news comes after CNN Business reported Sunday that Uber executives recently approved a policy around requiring drivers and riders to wear masks in the US and other markets.As part of its policy, Uber (UBER) is in the process of developing technology to detect if drivers are wearing masks or face coverings before they go online and start accepting trips, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the policy decision was just made recently and has not yet been introduced.Robyn Gershon, a New York University epidemiology professor, previously told CNN Business that because coronavirus can spread easily in close contact, such as in a vehicle, \"absolutely positively everyone should be wearing a mask\" or face covering. Those masks should be changed out frequently, she said, such as every eight hours for drivers who \"work long hours.\" Masks should be placed into a new zip-lock bag after use and washed, if reusable, she added.While Lyft has said it is making free sanitizing products and face masks available to drivers, it has said those \"will generally be limited to 1 face mask and 1 sanitizing product per driver per week, for as long as inventory lasts.\"Both Lyft and Uber have announced significant staff reductions in the past week spurred by the decline in ride volume caused by the pandemic. Lyft, on its first quarter earnings call with analysts Wednesday, said rideshare volume was down 75% in April compared to the same period last year. It began to show some signs of rebounding last week: rides were down 70%.",

        "body": "Mexico City (CNN)As the United States slowly re-opens its economy, the messaging from health experts has been largely consistent -- to do so safely over the long term, millions more tests are needed.\n\nBut as its neighbor Mexico is set to re-open its own economy in a few short weeks, the message from top health officials there couldn't be more different -- mass testing is not only unnecessary, it is largely a waste of time.Dr. Hugo Lopez-Gatell, Mexico's top epidemiologist and the public face of its Covid-19 response, sat down with CNN for his first network TV interview two days before the government announced plans on how it would re-open.Certain industries deemed essential, like car parts manufacturing and construction, will be allowed to re-open starting June 1. Other sections of the economy will follow in phases during the weeks after.Mexican health officials believe the outbreak will peak in this country no later than May 20, though some studies suggest it could arrive in late June, even as the country has one of the lowest testing rates in the world.Read More\"I don't think testing is a must,\" Lopez-Gatell said when asked if the country could re-open safely without more tests. \"This doesn't mean we're resistant to testing, we will use testing but in a carefully planned manner.\"As of May 11, Mexico had only conducted 89 tests per 100,000 people, according to health ministry data. By contrast, the US tested at a rate nearly 32 times higher than that, according to the COVID Tracking Project.The government strategy is to mainly test only those with severe symptoms of the virus while monitoring people with suspected but undiagnosed cases of Covid-19, thereby creating a sample.The data from that sample is then extrapolated to apply to a wider population using modeling, Lopez-Gatell said. The idea is to give the government a view of what is happening in a broader area without spending resources on mass testing.\"It is nonsensical to do test after test after test when most of those tests will result in a negative result,\" said Lopez-Gatell. \"It is quite inefficient as an assessment strategy.\"The plan is consistent with Mexico's testing strategy since the beginning of the outbreak.As of Thursday night, Mexico had confirmed more then 42,500 positive cases after only testing roughly 156,000 people.Lopez-Gatell said the actual case total might well be into the millions, but that setting response policy does not require knowing the exact number of potential cases; knowing it's sufficiently high to take drastic action is enough.He said that is why the government forced schools and most non-essential businesses to close in March and has since urged people to stay home.But the lack of testing has prompted criticism that a dearth of confirmed data has left the government with, at best, an incomplete view of how bad the outbreak is just weeks before the country will start to re-open. \"That's worrisome because it means that we don't have the full grasp of the magnitude of how much the disease has spread,\" said Dr. Julio Frenk, Mexico's former health minister from 2000 to 2006. The US federal government has also faced criticism for insufficient testing in past months. But while President Donald Trump on Thursday questioned if testing was \"overrated,\" top health officials in his administration still emphasize its importance.\"Rapid, extensive and widely available, timely testing is essential for reopening America,\" Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, told US senators at a committee hearing on Tuesday.At the same hearing, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the US' top epidemiologist and member of the White House's coronavirus task force, also said mass testing will be key to state and local governments' responses to future outbreaks: \"When you are in the process of opening up and pulling back on mitigation, you really must have in place that capability of responding when you do have the inevitable upticks in cases that will absolutely occur,\" he said.The hope is to provide Americans with 12.9 million tests by mid-June and by September will have a nationwide ability to conduct 40-50 million tests per month if needed, US testing czar Brett Giroir has said. States and municipalities across the US are also planning on building so-called contact tracing armies, where trained personnel fan out across the US, identifying new cases and isolating those people as well as those who they've come in contact with.But Mexico has no publicly known plans to do that on a large scale, though officials say they do contract tracing among those suspected and confirmed cases.\"Test, trace, isolate, repeat,\" said Dr. Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, when asked about what Mexico needed to do to prevent additional Covid-19 outbreaks in the future. \"All of those things need to happen and [the Mexican government] will need to do more testing to make that happen.\"Lopez-Gatell flatly rejects the idea the only way to re-open safely is through mass testing, though he added he greatly respects the experts who assert that.\"Of course there is always the risk of having an outbreak again but we will be able to carefully monitor the re-opening so when any outbreak occurs, we take action,\" he said.His contention: it's far too early in this pandemic to know which approach will ultimately prove more successful or whether both might work. \"I would say don't jump to conclusions just based on how famous one approach is as opposed to another,\" Lopez-Gatell told CNN. \"Let's wait for the global public health community ... to have scientific discussions to see what are the best experiences that one can learn from for the present and for the future.\"",

They can be used to see how many people in the population have been infected, even if they did not show symptoms. They may begin to show if people develop any kind of immunity to coronavirus, either in the short term or the long term.\n\nThey are different from the tests usually used to detect current infections. Those tests look for evidence of the virus itself in a patient.\n\nPublic health experts have complained that most of the antibody tests now on the market are inaccurate. Even a test that claims to have 95% accuracy can miss up to half of cases if the virus is not very common in the population being tested.\n\nRoche said its test catches 99.8% of people who have been infected and identifies 100% of those who have not - a sensitivity of 99.8% and a specificity of 100%.\n\nBetter specificity averts the risk of false positives - a test that wrongly tells someone they have been infected when they have not been. If people do develop immunity to coronavirus infections, false positives would be dangerous because they could give people a false sense of security.",

        "body": "Washington (CNN)A member of Vice President Mike Pence's staff has tested positive for the coronavirus, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany confirmed Friday.\n\nThe announcement came following an hour-long delay to Pence's Friday morning flight to Iowa, when individuals were seen exiting Air Force Two before the plane lifted off of the tarmac at Joint Base Andrews just outside Washington. A senior administration official told the press pool aboard Air Force Two that a Pence staffer tested negative for the coronavirus Thursday and positive Friday morning. The individual, who was not on the plane, had possibly been in contact with six people scheduled to fly on the trip, and they were removed before takeoff, according to a senior administration official. Bloomberg News first reported the coronavirus case earlier Friday. The vice president, who leads the White House coronavirus task force, traveled to Des Moines, Iowa, to participate in a discussion with faith leaders on responsible religious and spiritual gatherings, followed by a roundtable on securing the food supply.Read MoreAgriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue, as well as Iowa Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst were also on Air Force Two with Pence for the trip. About 10 members of Pence's staff are tested daily, the senior administration official told the press pool, adding that \"the vice president and the President have not had contact with this person recently.\"The official said Pence was last tested Friday morning. Friday's case marks the second time the White House has said a Pence staff member has tested positive for the coronavirus. The first tested positive in March.The new case of coronavirus among the vice president's staff comes a day after one of President Donald Trump's personal valets tested positive for the virus earlier this week. The valets are members of an elite military unit dedicated to the White House who often work very close to the President and first family, assisting them with a variety of personal tasks. They are responsible for the President's food and beverage not only in the West Wing but they also travel with him when he's on the road or out of the country. Trump was upset when he was informed Wednesday that the valet had tested positive, a source told CNN, and the President was subsequently tested again by the White House physician. The President also said he'd had \"very little personal contact\" with the man. Following the news of the valet's illness, Trump said he would be tested for the coronavirus daily. Pence, White House staff and individuals who come in contact with the President will be tested daily, too.Trump said before traveling aboard Air Force One earlier this week that he was not concerned about being in close quarters with other people since those around him are regularly tested.But a negative test and lack of symptoms are not sure signs that someone can't spread the virus.Doctors say the incubation period for the coronavirus varies. The incubation period is the time that it takes from when you are exposed to the virus to developing symptoms. It ranges anywhere from 2-14 days. The average incubation period is estimated to be five days, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.During a recent trip to the Mayo Clinic, Pence did not wear a face mask, despite being told about the clinic's policy saying they're required. Pence told reporters that he wasn't wearing a mask because he's often tested for coronavirus. But a few days later, Pence said he should have worn a mask. Trump also declined to wear a mask this week during portions of his tour of a mask-making facility in Arizona.",

        "body": "(CNN)President Donald Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen will be released early from prison on Thursday and is expected to serve out the remainder of his sentence at home as coronavirus continues to spread behind bars, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\nCohen will be released on furlough while he completes the process of being moved to home confinement, the person said. Cohen was serving a three-year sentence in New York after pleading guilty to lying to Congress, tax charges and two campaign finance charges for facilitating hush money payments to two women who alleged affairs with Trump. Trump has denied having affairs with the women.The Wall Street Journal was first to report on Cohen's impending release. Cohen's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.Cohen's shift to home confinement comes as the Justice Department and the Bureau of Prisons have released scores of nonviolent and vulnerable inmates early as the pandemic grew in the corrections system. Across federal and state prisons, thousands of inmates have tested positive for the virus -- many of whom showed no symptoms when they were infected.Read MoreAs a result, Cohen and dozens of other inmates at Otisville were placed in quarantine after being notified that they would be released and serve the remainders of their sentences in home confinement. Cohen had anticipated being released earlier this month but his release was delayed as the agency's conditions for early release amid the pandemic were narrowed. The Bureau of Prisons at first released guidelines that called for prisoners to have served at least half of their sentence to be considered for potential release. But days later, BOP reversed that guidance, saying they would prioritize inmates for release who had served more than 50% of their sentence or have served 25% of their sentence with less than 18 months left, without making it a hard-and-fast requirement, according to an internal memo obtained by CNN.Still, Trump had been irked by reports that Cohen was going to be released early due to the pandemic, multiple people familiar with the President's thinking previously told CNN. Cohen had been a vocal surrogate for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, often sparring with reporters and appearing on television to support his longtime client. But when pleading guilty, he implicated the President, telling a federal judge that he had made the payments \"in coordination with and at the direction of\" Trump, who prosecutors identified in court filings as \"Individual 1.\"The charges against Cohen punctuated a climactic end to a months-long investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, which exposed that he had acted with Trump and his allies, including David Pecker -- the CEO of the National Enquirer's publisher, American Media Inc. -- to suppress potentially damaging claims against the now-President.His early release comes in the middle of Trump's reelection campaign and as the President is facing his greatest test: handling the pandemic.And Cohen, who is working on a tell-all book about his time working with Trump, has been served a cease and desist letter from Charles Harder, an attorney for the Trump Organization, requesting he stop working on the book, according to two sources. Among the reasons cited by Harder, they say, is writing the book would violate a confidentiality agreement and a lawyer's ethical and legal obligations, such as attorney-client privilege.This story has been updated with additional background information and context Wednesday.\n\nCNN's Kara Scannell and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Some Washington, DC, residents may have thought they were being prank-called when they recently answered their phones to hear: \"Hi, this is Michelle Obama.\"\n\nBut the voice on the other end of the line did in fact belong to the former first lady. Obama has teamed with Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser to launch a public outreach campaign in the District this week featuring pre-recorded phone calls to encourage the city's residents to seek free coronavirus testing if they show symptoms of the virus.\"On behalf of Mayor Bowser, I wanted to share information on free coronavirus testing for District of Columbia residents experiencing symptoms,\" Obama says on the recorded call, asking listeners to \"please contact your medical provider immediately\" should they experience symptoms including a fever or cough.\"You can schedule a free testing appointment by contacting your medical provider or calling the DC Hotline,\" she adds, providing the phone numbers to schedule services in English or in Spanish. The calls will go out to DC residents this and next week.Bowser -- whose city has seen over 4,000 cases and over 200 deaths from the virus -- thanked Obama for her support for the testing efforts.Read More\"We know a critical part of fighting this disease and ultimately reopening our city is expanded testing, particularly among our most vulnerable populations,\" Bowser said in a statement Monday. \"We are grateful to first lady Obama for joining our effort to let residents know about free testing and for encouraging DC to stay home.\"Bowser ordered the closure of nonessential businesses in DC from March 25 through April 24, telling CNN earlier this month that the city doesn't a peak medical surge until June. She has spoken out against elements of the national coronavirus response, calling it \"infuriating\" that District of Columbia was treated like a \"territory\" after it was allocated $725 million less than the states in the $2 trillion coronavirus response bill, as well as urging for a national focus to collect data on coronavirus deaths in communities of color.The phone call is Obama's latest push to support those impacted by the coronavirus. Earlier this month, she announced a weekly livestreamed story time to \"give kids an opportunity to practice their reading (while giving families a much-needed break!)\" She also made an appearance during the Global Citizen \"One World: Together At Home\" televised concert special, along with fellow former first lady Laura Bush, thanking healthcare workers and first responders.Obama and the non-partisan organization she co-chairs have also thrown support behind Democratic legislation seeking to expand access to mail-in voting and early voting amid the Covid-19 outbreak.She has also shared the Obama family's experience during the outbreak, telling talk show host Ellen DeGeneres in March that she and former President Barack Obama are trying to establish a routine with their daughters Malia and Sasha home from college.\"On the positive side, I know for us, it's forced us to continue to sit down with each other, have real conversations, really ask questions and figure out how to keep ourselves occupied without just TV or computers,\" she said in the interview. \"It's a good exercise in reminding us that we just don't need a lot of the stuff that we have.\"\n\nCNN's Simret Aklilu, Chandelis Duster, Devan Cole, Abby Philip and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report.",

    "Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's podcast for May 20": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "(CNN)Health officials in Europe and the United States have reported cases of a rare but serious new syndrome affecting children. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta talks to doctors investigating the condition and to a young girl who has recovered from it.\n\nYou can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.MSNBC: Doctors are seeing an increase in what's being called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Jack McMorrow, 14-year-old patient: It felt like almost electricity or fire coursing through my veins. CNN: It's been seen in children across Europe. It's been in at least 18 states now plus Washington, DC.Read MoreDr. Sanjay Gupta: In the last few months, health officials in Europe and the United States have begun looking into a new condition affecting children. Children are showing up in hospitals with severe inflammation and poor function in some of their organs -- including their kidneys and heart. It's particularly surprising because in most cases these children were seemingly healthy without any underlying conditions before they developed this syndrome. So, in this episode, I'm going to explore what we currently know about the new syndrome and how doctors are treating it, and also what it was actually like for one little girl and her family. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\" Now, as a father myself, I want to start off by reassuring parents that this condition we're talking about today remains rare for the time being. To date, there have been fewer than 200 reported patients in the United States who doctors are still investigating.The CDC [US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] is calling it multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C for short. There is still a lot we're figuring out about it. Why are just some children getting sick? Why now, months into this pandemic? And what exactly is causing it? One thing that many of them have in common is that they tested positive for Covid-19. Experts say it could be a post-viral syndrome. That means it may not be directly caused by Covid-19, but it could be a response by the patient's immune system. To learn more about the symptoms and how the syndrome is treated, I reached out to 12-year-old Juliet Daly, one of the first patients treated for the syndrome in the United States. I spoke to her and her father, Sean, from their home in Louisiana.Sean Daly: Hello!Juliet Daly: Hello!Gupta: Juliet, let me start with you. When did you first start to not feel well? Juliet: Well, it was about ... it was Friday. I woke up in the morning. My stomach started to hurt pretty bad. And it felt like my legs were weak and I was pretty tired.Sean: So Friday she wasn't feeling well, but she sort of made it through the day. Sunday she was nauseous. She was throwing everything up, even water. And we became pretty concerned that day and sort of had that in our mind that if this continued through Monday, you know, we were gonna take her into the pediatrician. So Monday came around. She started having blue lips and her extremities were cold. So that's when it was like, this is not a, you know, normal flu. Gupta: So what do you do next? Sean: So we called her pediatrician, and they talked to us on the phone. But then it sounded serious enough to bring her in. So we went in. He saw her very quickly, very quickly decided this is something different. You know, she's sicker than normal. So had us go across the street to the ER where, you know, they could run some tests, essentially. And that's when we sort of, everything started cascading. Gupta: It turned out Juliet's oxygen levels were low. Her heart wasn't pumping blood to the rest of her body very well. Doctors decided to intubate her and then airlift her to a different hospital -- a nearby ICU that was better staffed to treat her. On that journey, she went into cardiac arrest and was resuscitated twice. Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, medical director of pediatric heart transplant and heart failure, Ochsner Hospital for Children: She was about as close to death as you can get. Gupta: That's Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric cardiologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children. He treated Juliet when she got to the ICU. Juliet tested positive for Covid-19. Kleinmahon: Her heart was barely squeezing. She was going into kidney failure, liver failure. Gupta: It is believed that MIS-C is caused by the immune system acting in overdrive -- the body's own defenses overreacting. And that can lead to inflammation in several organs in the body. So to treat Juliet, Dr. Kleinmahon gave her a medication that reduced the inflammation in her heart, her lungs and her kidneys.Kleinmahon: So those medicines, they stop the cell signaling for inflammation and for the inflammatory process. And the hope is that if we can calm everything down in the body, we can give the body a chance to recover naturally.Gupta: Thankfully, the treatment was effective. After four days, Juliet's lungs began to function normally again. She was taken off the ventilator. And for the first time since her air transport, was able to talk to her parents. Sean: When she first woke up, she wanted water and then she wanted my wife to tell her teachers that she was in the hospital. She was like, \"They know.\" Gupta: Juliet appears to have made a full recovery. After 10 days in the hospital, she was able to go home and get back to online school.Juliet: Well, I'm feeling good. Gupta: Are you back 100 percent would you say? Back to normal? Juliet: Well, I still feel a bit out of place. Feel kind of 99%. Sean: Yeah, we'll take 99%. Gupta: Well, I'm glad you're 99%, and I'm sending you good energy to get you to a 100%. OK? Sean: Yeah. I mean, she said 98% two days ago. So we're going in the right direction. Gupta: This new syndrome, MIS-C, has been compared to toxic shock syndrome, and another rare inflammatory disease that affects young children called Kawasaki disease. Dr. Jane Burns, director, Kawasaki Disease Research Center, University of California, San Diego: Kawasaki disease is a very visual disease. Gupta: Dr. Jane Burns is the director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center at the University of California, San Diego.Burns: Children develop high fever and in conjunction with the fever, various things turn red. So they get bloodshot eyes, red cracked lips and tongue, rash over the body, red palms and soles and swollen hands and feet. Gupta: Some MIS-C patients have had symptoms that look similar. But doctors are still not sure if there's a link.Burns: We certainly don't know at this point in time that this new very severe cardiovascular collapse that we're seeing is related to Kawasaki disease. We do not know that. We are certainly trying to investigate and understand if there is a relationship, because that leads us then to knowing more about how to treat it. Gupta: Hearing about all this can be overwhelming. But the good news is that doctors say treatment has largely been effective. If you're a parent, keep an eye out for any unusual symptoms in your child -- abdominal pain, vomiting or fever that is lasting for days or any red rashes on the body. You know your kids best. If they aren't acting like their normal selves, call your pediatrician. I think it's a good idea to set up a communication line with your pediatrician now via telehealth, even if you don't need them right now. That could save you a visit to the hospital in the future, which is certainly a good idea in the midst of a pandemic.Now, like I said, there's still a lot that we are learning about this syndrome. One of the big questions that remains is what is the link to Covid-19? Just as we have been learning and treating coronavirus at the same time, we're going do the same with this new syndrome.After all, this is a new disease we're seeing unfold in real time. And as we've always said, we're learning together. All of us. We'll be back tomorrow.

        "body": "Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has been a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer. Jones is co-author of \"Say it Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete.\" She talks politics, sports and culture weekly on Philadelphia's 900AM WURD. The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN)The latest pandemic news has many parents on edge.\n\nIf we didn't have enough to worry about already during this pandemic, parents now have another dire warning from medical experts. A rare inflammatory disease, similar to toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, is affecting children. Three children have died so far in New York, but dozens more are feared infected. Most of the children tested positive for coronavirus or had positive antibody tests. Among other symptoms, Kawasaki disease causes inflammation of blood vessels, which can lead to limitations in blood flow to the heart or inflammation of heart muscle. Kawasaki is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in the United States, with complications that include coronary artery enlargement and aneurysms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Parents are afraid, with good reason -- especially if they are the parent of a black or brown child. Much like Covid-19 that has been found to disproportionally kill and infect black and brown people, Kawasaki disease is also prevalent among African Americans. Though it is found in children of all races, it is more likely to be found in children of Asian and African American descent. Read More\"KD has a clear genetic link. It is most common in the U.S. among persons of Asian or African descent\", wrote doctor Jane C. Burns in a 2017 study on how the disease affects African Americans. \"But despite their apparent increased susceptibility, children of African American descent have been excluded from previous (Kawasaki disease) genetic analysis,\" wrote Burns, the director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center at UC San Diego School of Medicine and Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego. Burns is one of the few doctors in the nation studying the racial disparities of Kawasaki disease. But her clinical information is apparently not being shared with many parents as they try to navigate this pandemic. Just as the racial data surrounding the Covid-19 infections and deaths rates initially went unnoticed and underreported and now has become politicized, there has been little or no public warning from medical experts, or our government, about the higher rates of Kawasaki disease in black and brown children. Sadly, I don't need doctors to tell me of the painful truth. As a toddler, my son almost died from Kawasaki disease nearly 20 years ago.And for doctors who treated him, it was his golden-brown skin that helped delay his diagnosis. Emergency room doctors and his pediatrician failed to notice his skin rash and blue swollen fingers and toes. And instead they went strictly by the medical books, which then (and now) mostly warn of a \"pink rash\" and show photos of how the rash looks when present on white skin.It apparently never occurred to any of them that a \"pink\" rash would present differently on brown skin. And though my son was showing known symptoms -- an extremely high fever, skin rash and swollen fingers and toes, I was told me to go home, hydrate my baby and give him aspirin.Like many other women, I was written off as a hysterical new mom. But I was having none of it. Ironically, I'd been here before -- feeling ignored or misunderstood by my doctors -- an experience that contributes to the disproportionately higher maternal and infant mortality rates among black women. During my pregnancy, doctors failed to diagnose a severe case of poison ivy on my legs, which led to a gnarly staph infection, emergency delivery and a monthlong hospital stay for my baby and myself. Needless to say, alarm bells went off in my son's case years later. Clearly, something was seriously wrong with him and I insisted that he get a full checkup. My son and I got lucky. A young black medical resident was working when I brought him into the emergency room. As she walked over to me to help soothe us after we were told to go home, she noticed his rash and skin discolorations herself. And she was confident enough to take her concerns to the doctors, suspecting Kawasaki disease, sometimes called Kawasaki syndrome. Turned out she was right. She saved my son's life. Today, though more is known about the disease, the same racial ignorance -- whether intended, or not -- is putting our kids at risk and preventing parents from getting critical information they need to protect their children.A high temperature lasting over five days, a rash, swollen neck glands, dry cracked lips, swelling of the hands and feet, and redness in both eyes -- those are the symptoms of Kawasaki disease that doctors warn parents to look for in their children. Parents are advised to seek immediate medical attention if they notice these symptoms. Dr. Jen Caudle, a family physician in Sewell, New Jersey, has even more practical advice for worried parents. \"Trust your gut, when it comes to this condition and the symptoms that come along with this inflammatory-like disease,\" she told me. \"Listen to your children if they are feeling sick.\"Caudle said that if you notice and changes in your child's behavior, if they are lethargic, have no appetite, have high fevers and skin discolorations or skin rashes, you should seek immediate medical care. She warns parents not to let a fear of exposure to the virus stop them from taking their child to the hospital in an emergency, or to their own doctor. Just remember, masks should not be worn by children under two years old or those with breathing problems. Each day, together, we are all learning more about the Covid-19 virus. And overworked doctors, fearing for their own lives, must be applauded for the unimaginable sacrifices they're making to save lives during this pandemic. Kawasaki disease is not easy to diagnose simply because the symptoms mirror so many other illnesses. Caudle acknowledges that some doctors, as in my case years ago, may make mistakes, especially if they have little or no experience treating people of color. \"It's an ongoing issue that needs more discussion in the medical community,\" she said. \"A pink rash is going to look different on different skin tones.\"But she added that ultimately, doctors will depend on parents to help them identify Kawasaki disease. \"You know how your child's skin usually looks and if you notice a rash coupled with the other symptoms, share this information with doctors,\" she urged. Be persistent, is my own best advice. Because in this situation, mother -- or father -- knows best.",

        "body": "(CNN)The engineers at NASA have developed a high-pressure ventilator prototype specifically tailored to help coronavirus patients, according to the agency.\n\nIt's called VITAL, or Ventilator Intervention Technology Accessible Locally. And after passing a critical test at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York earlier this week, NASA is hoping for fast-track approval of the ventilator in the coming days so it can be used to help coronavirus patients. \"We were very pleased with the results of the testing we performed in our high-fidelity human simulation lab,\" said Dr. Matthew Levin, director of innovation for the Human Simulation Lab and associate professor of anesthesiology, perioperative and pain medicine, and genetics and genomics sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine, in a statement. \"The NASA prototype performed as expected under a wide variety of simulated patient conditions. The team feels confident that the VITAL ventilator will be able to safely ventilate patients suffering from Covid-19 both here in the United States and throughout the world.\"The prototype works like traditional ventilators, where sedated patients rely on an oxygen tube to help them breathe. But it's built to last three or four months unlike ventilators in hospitals that were designed to last for years and help patients with other medical issues. The engineers hope that more traditional ventilators can be freed up for patients with the most severe cases of coronavirus if VITAL is put into place. The innovative ventilator was also designed to offer more oyxgen at higher pressures than typical models because Dr. Levin said some of the patients he's treating needed that capability. Read More\"Intensive care units are seeing Covid-19 patients who require highly dynamic ventilators,\" said Dr. J.D. Polk, NASA's chief health and medical officer, in a statement. \"The intention with VITAL is to decrease the likelihood patients will get to that advanced stage of the disease and require more advanced ventilator assistance.\"Engineers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena developed the ventilator, which can be built quickly using fewer parts, most of which are available in current supply chains, the agency said. But it won't compete with the existing supply chain for ventilators.It was also designed to be flexible with easy maintenance, meaning it can be used in the diverse settings hosting field hospitals, including hotels and convention centers.\"We specialize in spacecraft, not medical-device manufacturing,\" Michael Watkins, JPL director, said in a statement. \"But excellent engineering, rigorous testing and rapid prototyping are some of our specialties. When people at JPL realized they might have what it takes to support the medical community and the broader community, they felt it was their duty to share their ingenuity, expertise and drive.\"Rising to the challengeEngineers like Stacey Boland stepped up, driven to do anything they could to help. The last 40 days have taken everything they had to make VITAL. The team worked long hours each day, which bled over into nonexistent weekends.Boland is a project system engineer developing the MAIA instrument, the Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols that will characterize particulate matter in air pollution. The instrument could provide the data that helps medical professionals determine what types of pollution correlate with negative health outcomes. On MAIA, Boland has worked with epidemiologists to determine the data they would need from the mission. On VITAL, Boland acted as the operations lead to create a communication pathway between engineers, designers and visualization specialists with doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists and intensivists (board-certified physicians providing special care for critically ill patients). Translating between the different professions to put everyone on the same page was a challenge, but one she enjoyed. Operating during a pandemic meant that they were relying on calls, sending images and video conferencing to make a product in real time. Medical professionals called in on their lunch breaks, still in scrubs, describing what they were seeing in patients and what they would need VITAL to do. A limited staff worked in person on the hardware, while the rest of the team video conferenced in. Boland was literally writing the instruction manual for how to operate VITAL as it was being built. For Boland, it's personal. Her sister is a hospitalist at Memorial Hospital at Gulfport in Louisiana. She would call her sister, send her pictures and ask questions as they worked on the device, and her sister would send feedback in real time.Boland calls it the experience of a lifetime, working on a team that was able to find camaraderie through their singular desire to create something helpful during such a challenging time. When they encountered obstacles while working on VITAL, there was no sleeping on decisions that needed to be made, Boland said. Normal coping mechanisms were tossed out the window, and they worked through issues in real time to overcome the next challenge. It's been an adrenaline rush, working on a ventilator in such a short time, and the team wished it were under better circumstances. But the VITAL team was driven to help.\"I am not a medical device engineer, but when I hear someone on the front line needs something, I want them to have it,\" Boland said. \"We want to be there for them. It's been a blessing and a privilege to have something so challenging and yet so relevant to be working on.\"Leon Alkalai, a technical fellow at JPL, manages the office of strategic partnerships. In recent years, he's been leading a small effort to build relationships with the medical engineering community. He joined the VITAL team in a leadership role and helped establish communication between JPL and Mount Sinai, the FDA and the US Department of Homeland Security.Alkalai said the FDA has been extremely supportive. And the doctors at Mount Sinai were interested in partnering together on VITAL after he reached out and shared the idea. The collaboration between NASA and the FDA and medical professionals is an example of how institutions with different areas of expertise are coming together to create solutions for the pandemic. \"We're rocket scientists and engineers, we know how to land on the moon and Mars,\" Alkalai said. \"But building a medical device is new. We were humbled by that challenge to do something we've never done before for a good cause. It goes against our culture to do something quickly in a domain where we're not experts. But it fits with the JPL mantra: 'Dare Mighty Things.'\"Currently, the California Institute of Technology, which manages JPL, is conducting outreach to find manufacturers for VITAL. A helping handAdditionally, NASA is trying to help fill the gaps due to shortages of other medical equipment in local communities, like Antelope Valley, California. One new device is the Aerospace Valley Positive Pressure Helmet, which can be used to help treat coronavirus patients with minor symptoms so they don't have to use a ventilator. It functions more like a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP, machine, commonly used to treat sleep apnea, the agency said.It has already been successfully tested and submitted to the FDA for emergency-use authorization. Meanwhile, 500 are currently in production. The device is the result of a collaboration between NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in California partnered with Antelope Valley Hospital, the City of Lancaster, Virgin Galactic and The Spaceship Company, Antelope Valley College and members of the Antelope Valley Task Force.The prototype for VITAL and the helmet are the result of NASA's call to action issued on April 1 called the NASA@Work challenge. Within two weeks, NASA employees had submitted 250 ideas. The NASA Glenn Research Center in Ohio previously partnered with Emergency Products and Research, an Ohio company, to work on small, portable devices that decontaminate ambulances quickly and much cheaper than current systems called AMBUStat. They're looking at the best way to apply this during the pandemic as well.Indeed, \"NASA's strength has always been our ability and passion -- collective and individual -- for solving problems,\" said NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine in a statement. \"All the work being done shows how NASA is uniquely equipped to aid in the federal response to coronavirus by leveraging the ingenuity of our workforce, mobilizing investments made in the U.S. space agency to combat this disease and working with public and private partnerships to maximize results.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)The US Navy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have launched an investigation into the coronavirus outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier that has left one sailor dead and saw nearly 700 other crew members test positive for the virus.\n\nThe inquiry will look to establish the origin of the outbreak and understand how it spread rapidly on board the ship.The Roosevelt's commander Capt. Brett Crozier was fired earlier this month for what then-acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said was poor judgment for too widely disseminating a warning about the spread of virus aboard his vessel, a warning that eventually made its way into the press.Modly resigned days later over his handling of the incident, actions that included a $240,000 trip to Guam where he slammed Crozier and admonished sailors for giving their former commander a rousing sendoff in public remarks to the crew.The results of a separate Navy investigation into the circumstances of Crozier's memo is expected soon and it is possible Crozier could be reinstated.Read More\"This is a stealthy virus in many ways and this outbreak investigation is an important medical weapon to understand its behavior so that we can better protect the crew, their shipmates on other vessels and ultimately the nation,\" Rear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, the US Navy surgeon general, said on Friday. To carry out the investigation, crew members are being asked on a voluntary basis to complete a survey and provide two new specimens -- blood and nasal swabs -- for laboratory testing, according to the Navy. It hopes to get 1,000 volunteers which is what it believes is needed for representative sampling.\"One of the reasons we do the questionnaire is to try to connect the dots. When you combine that questionnaire with the serology and the nasal swabs, we begin to get a picture of how the disease was transmitted throughout the crew, or at least in a pattern,\" a Navy official told CNN. \"The questions on the questionnaire ask about previous health history, locations where sailors live and work and known exposure to Covid cases. These will be used to help connect the dots regarding shared exposure on the ship and development of antibodies in response to this exposure.\"While the military would routinely conduct a medical investigation of any outbreak of infectious disease, understanding the rapid spread on the Roosevelt is a top priority for senior military officials. The carrier may prove to be a unique laboratory for understanding how the virus transmits and how to control its spread.\"We have had significant numbers on the Roosevelt who originally tested negative and later tested positive, so there is a timing factor there,\" said Gen. John Hyten, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.Looking ahead across the military, the Pentagon believes if they quarantine people in small groups and then test them after 14 days, it will \"give us high confidence\" service members are healthy and can be deployed.Military medical investigators are also examining numerous cases where sailors who at first were asymptomatic later exhibited symptoms. Officials calculate that approximately 10% of the positive cases on the carrier originally tested negative. \"It has appeared that pre-symptomatic transmission has been a factor of transmission aboard. That is truly one of the secret weapons of this virus. Individuals can transmit before they know they have it,\" Gillingham said. \"It probably passed through quite freely, and was initially unrecognized.\"The Navy currently assesses that the first cases of the virus originated with the aircraft carrier's air wing.\"We don't know for sure how the virus got started. Certainly there's evidence to suggest since the first two sailors who tested positive, that was at day 15 following their port visit, we also know that those sailors were from the aircrew portion of the crew,\" Gillingham told reporters on Friday.While Gillingham later said that he did \"not personally have knowledge about the initial individuals,\" a Navy official later confirmed to CNN that the first two cases were among the ship's air wing. The air wing is responsible for operating the fighter jets, helicopters and other aircraft on board the carrier.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Nearly all coronavirus patients who needed ventilators in New York's largest health system to help them breathe died, a study found.\n\nOverall, about 20% of Covid-19 patients treated at Northwell Health died, and 88% of those placed on ventilators died, according to the study. A ventilator is a device that forces air into the lungs of patients who cannot breathe on their own because of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome.Other, smaller reports have indicated that patients who need ventilation are unlikely to survive.Just 12% of the patients in the study needed ventilators, Dr. Safiya Richardson at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, Northwell Health, and colleagues found.But this study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, shows how dire the outlook is for patients with severe Covid-19 disease.Read MoreThe team looked at the electronic health records of 5,700 patients with coronavirus disease hospitalized at Northwell Health. Final outcomes were known for 2,634 of them.The records support what doctors have been saying about the coronavirus: most people who become severely ill have some sort of so-called underlying condition. More than half, or 57%, had high blood pressure, 41% were obese and 34% had diabetes.\"Of the patients who died, those with diabetes were more likely to have received invasive mechanical ventilation or care in the ICU compared with those who did not have diabetes,\" the researchers wrote.They also confirmed that men were more likely to die than women, and no one under the age of 18 died.The symptoms of infection were far from clear-cut. About a third of all patients showed up with fevers, 17% were breathing too fast and just under 30% needed extra oxygen. On average, patients were sent home after four days.But 14% were treated in intensive care, 3% needed intensive dialysis and 21% died.Since final data was only available on about half of the patients, it's possible that more of those on ventilators survived, the researchers said -- something that would drive down the 88% fatality rate for that group.\"This study reported mortality rates only for patients with definite outcomes (discharge or death), and a longer-term study may find different mortality rates as different segments of the population are infected,\" the Northwell Health team wrote.",

        "body": "(CNN)The New York State Nurses Association (NYSNA) filed three lawsuits Monday challenging the \"failures\" of the New York State Department of Health (DOH) and two New York hospitals, Montefiore Medical Center and Westchester Medical Center, alleging the entities aren't doing enough to protect nurses treating Covid-19 patients.\n\nAll three suits allege shortcomings such as inadequate personal protective equipment, a lack of training for registered nurses redeployed from hospital units to meet the staffing needed to treat the high number of Covid-19 patients and unsafe working conditions for high-risk employees.\"More than seven in ten of our nurses are reporting exposure to Covid-19 and most are still untested. These lawsuits were filed to protect our nurses, our patients and our communities from grossly inadequate and negligent protections,\" NYSNA Executive Director Pat Kane said in a news release. \"We cannot allow these dangerous practices to continue.\"New York governor extends stay-at-home orderThe New York State Nurses Association has 42,000 members, according to the court documents. So far nearly 1,000 union members have tested positive, including at least 150 at Montefiore, according to the filing. Read More At least 84 nurses in the union have been hospitalized with the virus, and at least six nurses are known to have died from the virus after contracting Covid-19 while working, court documents say.Suit seeks injunction against New York State Department of HealthIn a lawsuit filed against the New York State Department of Health, the nurses union requested an injunction from the New York Supreme Court alleging multiple failures to protect the health of nurses, patients and the public. The suit seeks to enforce Gov. Andrew Cuomo's April 13 \"directive\" that each direct care nurse be given at least one N95 respirator daily. The suit also cites a Department of Health advisory that spells out conditions that would allow health care personnel to return to work seven days after the onset of Covid-19 symptoms.The suit is asking the Department of Health to rescind that advisory and issue a new one.\"The DOH's dereliction of its statutory charge has created a public nuisance, as New York's hospitals have turned into petri dishes where the virus is allowed to spread, unchecked by basic protective equipment and measures,\" attorneys for the union said in a memorandum of law in support of a temporary injunction and temporary restraining order.The lawsuit asks the court to issue a preliminary injunction directing the department of health to rescind all directives instructing hospitals to require sick nurses to return from quarantine in less than 14 days if they still are symptomatic and order the department to fulfill its statutory mandate to ensure that nurses have adequate protective equipment and other appropriate safety measures to protect them from contracting Covid-19. Jonah Bruno, the director of communications for the New York State Department of Health, declined to comment on the pending litigation.\"We are deeply grateful for the ongoing efforts of New York's health care workers to reduce the spread of Covid-19 by testing people who may be infected and treating those who are most in need,\" Bruno said in a statement to CNN. \"The State of New York continues to take every step necessary to ensure that health care workers, particularly those who are sampling and providing direct care, have the support and supplies needed to address this unprecedented public health emergency.\"Suit says nurses at Montefiore Medical Center not given enough PPEA complaint filed by the Nurses Association in federal court for the Southern District of New York says the union is bringing a lawsuit on behalf of the approximately 3,000 nurses it represents at the Montefiore Medical Center, alleging the nurses are facing workplace hazards that are causing or are likely to cause \"imminent death or serious physical harm\" as they work to treat patients during the Covid-19 pandemic.The suit alleges the hospital system is not providing enough personal protective equipment like masks, inadequate Covid-19 testing, and is requiring nurses who have been given isolation orders to use their own paid time off, rather than what they describe as the state-mandated paid leave. They also say Montefiore is requiring nurses to return to work after seven, rather than 14, days of quarantine. \"Right now, the Hospital is like a war zone,\" the suit alleges. \"The RNs there are treating large numbers of very sick and frightened patients, and are doing so with inadequate and often ill-fitting equipment, often in rooms that have not been properly converted to deal with Covid-19 patients, often working while they are sick because they have been forced back to work too early, often in practice areas where they have never been trained, and generally without adequate testing to ensure they are fit to work without infecting others.\" \"NYSNA leadership has chosen to attack a system, and the commitment of thousands of their colleagues, who have followed the Governor's emergency orders and are selflessly doing all they can to fight Covid-19 and save lives,\" a Montefiore spokesperson told CNN.The suit asks for relief from the court, since the union and hospital are currently in arbitration, and by the time any decisions are made \"it will be too late to remedy the harms\" caused by the hospital system.The suit asks for the hospital to provide an adequate number of protective masks like N-95 respirators that are not re-used day after day, nonpermeable gowns and negative pressure rooms so that disease-infected air doesn't linger, or air filters to cleanse the air of particles of the virus. The suit also asks for the hospital system to provide leave for nurses so that they are not forced to work while sick with Covid-19 symptoms, as well as coronavirus testing on demand for nurses. Westchester Medical Center calls suit \"a distraction\"A lawsuit filed against the corporation that runs the Westchester Medical Center on behalf of 1,600 registered nurses who work there claims the nurses are experiencing \"severe and pervasive workplace hazards that are causing or are likely to cause the nurses imminent death or serious physical harm.\" NYSNA met with WMC officials January 28 to discuss preparedness measures, according to the filing. The lawsuit alleges that in that meeting WMC officials \"assured NYSNA that they were making all necessary plans to prepare for the virus.\" The nurses are sent into the \"war zone\" without adequate resources, the lawsuit says. The lawsuit details complaints from nurses at the hospital alleging the hospital is rationing N-95 masks and gowns, failing to properly train nurses redeployed to other departments and in some units failing to properly ventilate Covid-19 patient areas to minimize exposure risk. The lawsuit also claims WMC officials have refused to reassign pregnant nurses to units that do not treat Covid-19 patients, unless the pregnancy has entered the third trimester. The suit alleges the hospital system is not providing enough personal protective equipment such as masks, provides inadequate Covid-19 testing and grants insufficient sick days for nurses to recover after getting sick with the contagious virus. The suit also alleges the hospital system required nurses to use personal sick leave time when they start to experience Covid-19 symptoms. In order to access the emergency sick leave guaranteed under New York law, the lawsuit claims the hospital requires nurses to obtain an individual order from their county's department of health.A spokesperson for the hospital said they cannot comment on pending litigation, but said the allegations are wrong.\"We know, and our care providers know, that the allegations in NYSNA's lawsuit are wrong,\" the spokesperson for Westchester Medical Center Health Network said in a statement to CNN. \"Our focus is, and has always been, protecting our workforce, which has been aligned from the outset in treating the most severely ill patients battling Covid-19. NYSNA's lawsuit is irresponsible and a distraction from this work, and a disservice to all who are valiantly caring for these patients every day.\"The union asks the court in the lawsuit to issue a declaration that Westchester Medical Center is violating state labor law and compel the hospital to address the concerns. The lawsuit also asks the court to compel the hospital to stop refusing statutory medical leave and allow union members to freely speak to the media.\n\nCNN's Brian Vitagliano contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)As far as first dates go, the one 14-year-old Jake Scott had with his new 15-year-old girlfriend, Abby Westrope, back in early March was epic.\n\nIt started at Scott's baseball game, where Westrope watched him play. From there they went back to his dad's house, watched Netflix, played catch outside and ate tacos. The two talked about life, friends, hopes and dreams. At some point(s), the Northern California teens might have even kissed.Three months later, the duo is still dating, only it looks much different in the face of a global pandemic.They FaceTime for hours each day. They text. Once or twice a week, they don masks, meet up on the driveway at a parent's house and sit in lawn chairs spread apart by a minimum of 6 feet apart. They're not allowed to touch or kiss or do anything else that eighth and ninth graders typically might do -- one parent is always watching. In Scott's words, it's \"rough.\" But they have made it work.\"At first, I was really against it, but [now] I'm in the acceptance phase,\" Scott wrote in a text message last week. \"It helps to know that my [girlfriend] is doing the same thing so that I know that it's not just me.\"Read MoreDating in the time of CovidScott and Westrope aren't the only teenage sweethearts facing new rules under the coronavirus pandemic. All over the world, teens and their families are figuring out how to adapt the drama of adolescent love to the rigors of social distancing and sheltering in place. Thankfully, many are following recommendations from their local governments, even if it's with some extra encouragement and enforcement from their parents. Others are disregarding the rules altogether -- partially because they're teenagers, but also because moms and dads either can't or won't supervise social distancing.\"It's a tough time to be young and in love,\" said Jessica England, a licensed marriage and family therapist in San Francisco. \"Getting teenagers to see the big picture and think long-term is really, really hard.\"Teenage lovers dating back to Romeo and Juliet have vowed to stop at nothing to be together, and each of us has at least a few stories of sneaking out to be with our high school heartthrobs.There's even a scene in the 2011 movie \"Contagion\" in which a teenager gets mad at her father (played by Matt Damon) for not letting her see her boyfriend during a pandemic.And yet the danger is real. Research has suggested teenagers and younger kids are less likely than adults to show acute symptoms of Covid-19 or require hospitalization. Reports from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, however, say asymptomatic children can act as vectors, picking up the virus from one person and transmitting it to another, potentially infecting any number of other unsuspecting victims along the way. Note that our understanding of how Covid-19 affects children is developing with the recent hospitalization of dozens of kids due to a mysterious illness which health officials believe could be linked to the coronavirus.Why teenagers don't get itSo why is it so difficult for teenagers to grasp the gravity of a pandemic? Why do so many of them struggle with understanding the importance of social distancing and actually sheltering in place?Perhaps the most significant explanation has to do with brain development: The last part of the brain to form fully is the frontal lobe. This is the region with the prefrontal cortex, which controls \"executive functions\" such as impulse control, judgment, emotional regulation, planning, reasoning and a person's ability to look at situations with perspective and an eye on the future. Scyatta Wallace, associate professor of psychology at St. John's University in Jamaica, New York, said this area of the brain doesn't stop developing until we're 25, which makes it difficult for some teenagers to imagine the enormity of how a life-threatening virus could potentially impact them at all.It also makes it tough for teenagers to see beyond their own overwhelming feelings.\"It's physically difficult for teenagers to imagine these sorts of things and understand them,\" said Wallace, who has focused the bulk of her research on teens. \"When you apply this to romantic love and all the intense feelings associated with them thinking they're going to feel this way about a boyfriend or girlfriend forever, it's even more challenging for them to think practically about the situation and balance out the risk.\"Dr. Errol Fields, a pediatrician in Baltimore, Maryland, agreed, adding that incomplete development of the prefrontal cortex also accounts for the sense of invincibility and invulnerability that often characterize the teenage years.Fields, who is an assistant professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, likened the situation to teenagers reading about the dangers of speeding, but then driving too fast.\"It's totally common for teenagers to think, 'That's not going to happen to me,'\" he said. \"They hear about this abstract virus that's causing the world to shut down, but they also hear it's not a big deal for adolescents, which multiplies the perception that it's not a big deal.\"How to parent teens through the pandemicParents can help teens understand why they must take social distancing seriously.Yes, these conversations ultimately must convey the rules of the house. But they also can incorporate open and honest conversations about fears, frustrations, anxieties and more.Jody Thomas, a psychologist in Denver, said \"how\" questions are critical components to these chats. How are you feeling about disrupting the routine with your boyfriend/girlfriend? How would you decide if it's safe to see your significant other? How would you determine what risks come with it? All of these are good questions to ask to get your teen thinking more broadly.Thomas said parents should at least try to acknowledge the tragedy of their teens being cut off from friends and significant others, especially at a time when teenagers might feel they need their closest pals most. She advised to start these conversations by letting teenagers vent about frustrations with quarantine life, listen to what they're feeling, validate those feelings and then invite them to contribute to a discussion about how the family can work together to make the situation more palatable.\"Saying something like, 'I know it sucks right now, but we need to keep you safe,' might help a teenager begin to understand what's really at stake,\" said Thomas, who doubles as an adjunct lecturer at the Stanford University School of Medicine. \"We have to draw these lines for kids in a way that's empathetic and also acknowledges how hard it is.\"England, the psychotherapist in San Francisco, said it's important to lay out the rules of the house but it's equally important to engage in skill building with teens and walk them through what to do if they find themselves in a situation where they've made bad choices and wish to tap the brakes.Specifically, she said, parents must make clear they value safety over obedience.\"You'd rather have your kid call for a ride at 2 a.m. than drive drunk or ride with someone who's driving drunk,\" she said. \"It's the same situation if your teenager sneaks out to see his or her boyfriend or girlfriend. It takes courage to admit the mistake, but you need them to tell you about potential risk exposures to keep everyone else in the family safe.\"How NOT to parent teens through the pandemicOf course, parents also need to be mindful of pandemic parenting strategies that are likely to backfire.For starters, parents who are draconian, highly authoritarian or rigid risk their teenagers engaging in a psychological process called reactance, which essentially results in kids doing precisely what they're told not to do, according to Joe Rodgers, the Lois Autrey Betts professor of psychology and human development at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.Another potential pitfall: engaging in what experts refer to as comparison of suffering.\"When grown-ups start throwing out statements like, 'This isn't as hard as what I went through,' or 'This is nothing compared to x, y or z,' teenagers just stop listening,\" said Thomas. \"With the exception of some extenuating circumstances, this is the hardest thing most teenagers have ever had to go through. There's no way they're going to be able to contextualize it.\"England added that parents must be realistic about what to expect from their teenagers during this time of heightened stress, and to strive to make sure they don't set up their kids for failure.\"If any parent thinks he or she can say to a teenager, 'You can see your partner unsupervised but you can't make out with them,' that's just plain delusional, like asking them to take a closed-book test alone in their room with all of their textbooks,\" she said. Fields, who specializes in helping adolescents grappling with questions of gender and sexuality, cautioned parents to remember that even when a teenager hasn't identified a significant other, it doesn't necessarily mean the child lacks one.For this reason, he said distancing can create mental health challenges for kids who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual, queer, intersex or asexual. \"If a teenager isn't out to [their] parents, they can feel incredibly isolated, even when there's not a pandemic requiring all of us to stay at home,\" Fields said. \"Sometimes for these kids, a romantic partner is the only connection to feeling normal and sane.\"Silver liningsAt the end of the day, parents must prepare themselves to be flexible, and to practice patience in the face of inevitable hiccups with the family social distancing plan.Rodgers said this is because resourceful teenagers who think they're in love always will figure out ways to circumvent their parents.\"Rule No. 1 is that teenage boys and teenage girls will find ways to get together,\" he wrote in an email. \"Rule No. 2 is that pandemics don't change Rule No. 1.\" With months of uncertainty in front of us, Rodgers said parents should be open to any opportunity that enables teens to connect with their significant others safely, even if it means more time on social media or screens. Here, he referenced get-togethers like those Scott has been having with his girlfriend in Northern California -- hangouts that celebrate togetherness instead of tonsil hockey.As Rodgers explained it, though these sessions may not be what teenagers want during this tumultuous time, these low-key get-togethers may, in fact, be what they need.\"In a strange sense, a conversation between a teenage boy and girl from 10 feet apart creates a kind of psychological safe space that some may come to appreciate,\" Rodgers said. \"Lots of teenagers aren't nearly ready for intimacy,\" he said, and they know it. \"'I'll social distance with you if you'll social distance with me' could be the rallying cry of the 2020 dating world.\" And maybe beyond.\n\nMatt Villano is a freelance writer and editor who lives in Northern California.

        "body": "(CNN)Nearly 100 sailors from the US Navy destroyer USS Kidd have tested positive for coronavirus, two US defense officials told CNN Friday.\n\nThe ship, which is currently in port in San Diego, was the second US warship to be struck by an outbreak of the pandemic after the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier.The officials said that there are more than 95 cases currently aboard the ship, meaning that almost 30% of the crew has been infected, surpassing the infection rate for the USS Theodore Roosevelt which has seen approximately 24% of its crew infected. The handing of the outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier led to the firing of the ship's commanding officer, and the resignation of the acting Navy Secretary. It has been the subject of a Navy investigation which is due to be completed on May 27 following an initial preliminary inquiry that officials tell CNN recommended that the aircraft carrier's former captain, Capt. Brett Crozier, be reinstated.The Navy on Friday stopped providing official daily figures about the number of cases on the Kidd and Theodore Roosevelt, saying that it \"will only report significant changes on these vessels and new cases on any other deployed vessels.\"Read MoreOn Thursday night, a Navy statement said that official number of active coronavirus cases on the Kidd was 78. The 20% increase in positive coronavirus cases does not appear to have met the Navy's definition of \"significant\" information.The statement Thursday said that the USS Theodore Roosevelt had 1,102 active cases in addition to 53 sailors who have recovered from coronavirus after completing at least 14 days in isolation and two successful negative tests. Three sailors from the ship are being treated in US Naval Hospital Guam for coronavirus symptoms. None of those sailors are in the ICU.Asked about the new policy, chief Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman told reporters at the Pentagon \"we wanted to get out of the pattern of providing a daily tracker of minor changes.\"\"We've now reached a point with both of those ships, particularly with the (Theodore Roosevelt), where we've gone through, the entire crew's been off, the entire crew's been tested, we have the results, the ship has been cleaned, the crew is now returning to the ship. So we believe that we have moved past a point where the daily updates are providing useful information for a public conversation about it,\" Hoffman said. \"If there was unfortunately an additional outbreak, we would provide information. But we wanted to get out of the pattern of providing a daily tracker of minor changes in this. And I think that's a reasonable place to be,\" Hoffman added.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Nearly 50 sailors from the USS Kidd have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the US Navy.\n\nThe navy destroyer is the second US warship to be hit by an outbreak of the virus while at sea following the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier. At least 47 sailors from the Kidd came back positive with 45% of the crew having been tested, the Navy said in a statement Monday. That's a rapid increase from Friday when CNN reported at least 18 sailors had the virus. There are typically 330 sailors on board. Fifteen Sailors have been evacuated to the USS Makin Island for monitoring due to persistent symptoms. The Navy had previously flown two sailors from the ship to the United States for medical treatment and had dispatched the Makin Island, an amphibious assault ship equipped with a fleet surgical team, intensive care unit capacity and ventilators to rendezvous with the USS Kidd to provide medical support if needed.Read MoreThe Kidd is expected to pull into port in San Diego in the coming days so that the ship can be disinfected and cleaned and the crew isolated and quarantined. Prior to the outbreak, the ship had been assigned to the recently enhanced counter narcotics mission in the Eastern Pacific aimed at countering illicit drug trafficking.News of the outbreak aboard the USS Kidd comes as the number of cases from the USS Theodore Roosevelt has increased to 955 with 100% of the crew having been tested.More than 4,200 sailors, some 85% of that ship's crew, have been moved ashore to Guam where they are being isolated or quarantined. One sailor is currently being treated for coronavirus symptoms at the US Naval Hospital in Guam.The handing of the outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier which led to the firing of the ship's commanding officer, Capt. Brett Crozier and the resignation of the acting Navy Secretary, has been the subject of a Navy investigation.US officials told CNN that senior Navy officials had recommended Friday that Crozier be reinstated but Secretary of Defense Mark Esper was not prepared to immediately endorse that recommendation.Two defense officials told CNN that the Navy had expected Esper to endorse the recommendation on Friday.A Pentagon spokesman said Friday that Esper \"intends to thoroughly review the report and will meet again with Navy leadership to discuss next steps.\"Crozier was fired earlier this month for what the then-acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said was poor judgment by too widely disseminating a warning among Navy officials about the spread of the virus aboard his vessel, a warning that eventually made its way into the press.Modly resigned days later over his handling of the incident, actions which included a $240,000 trip to Guam where he slammed Crozier and admonished sailors for giving Crozier a rousing send off in public remarks to the crew.",

        "body": "(CNN)A flu shot will protect you from coronavirus, a worker reported being told by supervisors at a Rhode Island nursing home, where at least 60 residents were diagnosed with Covid-19 and at least one died.\n\nKeep working, an employee who was vomiting and running a temperature at an Ohio long-term care facility was instructed, according to another worker complaint.No need to tell authorities, a worker reported being told about the Covid-19 related deaths of colleagues at a Missouri nursing home.These employee accounts were drawn from more than 500 complaints filed in recent months with the federal government's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and state worker safety programs approved by the agency. A CNN review of these records, along with reports made to other government officials and interviews with employees, show that long-term care workers across the country feel their own lives are at risk as they work on the frontlines in facilities that have become hotbeds for Covid-19 -- with more than 10,000 deaths nationwide. Read More Like hospitals, nursing homes have faced severe supply shortages during the pandemic and have been urgently seeking assistance from the government. Worker complaints allege dangerous conditions in which staff members are deprived of basic protective gear and have been told to use coffee filters as masks and wear garbage bags or rain ponchos as medical gowns. The employees say they have been kept in the dark about outbreaks in their own facilities as they care for elderly and frail residents who are particularly susceptible to the disease.Some of the employees' grievances, CNN found, were made just days or weeks before Covid-19 outbreaks and deaths were announced at the same facilities. Other complaints were lodged after management was allegedly well aware the virus was spreading throughout their facilities. In New Jersey, for example, the 10 facilities where CNN identified complaints to OSHA have all had coronavirus deaths. In total, these locations reported around 500 cases and nearly 150 deaths. OSHA, which is charged with enforcing workplace safety laws, has faced criticism for its slow response to complaints related to Covid-19. A spokesperson told CNN the agency investigates all complaints and \"has been acting to protect America's workers\" -- saying it is paying \"particular attention to protections for health care workers, emergency responders, and others with a heightened exposure to coronavirus.\" Yet, the records show that OSHA has closed many complaints after operators denied the claims or promised to address alleged issues. On-site inspections, which the agency says it launches to investigate the most serious allegations, were rare. In the worst examples, employees reported that managers hid positive cases from staff, meaning caregivers had no way of knowing for sure whether they were treating a patient with the disease. They expressed concerns over a lack of preparation, training and supplies to prevent them from contracting and spreading the virus. Employees have also reported staff being forced to work while symptomatic for Covid-19.\"Management is not telling the staff what's really happening nor are they taking the correct steps to prevent the illnesses,\" an employee claimed in March about a Michigan facility, which declined to comment on the complaint. Even though residents were \"non-stop coughing\" and \"very sick with temperatures and upper respiratory issues\" -- and some had died -- the complaint said staff were told they couldn't wear masks and that hand sanitizer was being hidden from employees. Warnings to the governmentUnder federal regulations, employers are supposed to protect workers from hazardous conditions. During the pandemic, that includes requiring the use of gloves and respiratory protection \"when job hazards warrant it\" and ensuring workplaces are \"free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm,\" according to OSHA's website.The more than 500 complaints identified by CNN come from employees working for long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes and assisted living centers, as well as hospice and home health care companies. They were filed with OSHA, as well as states with OSHA-approved worker safety programs, and date from early March to early May. OSHA was continuing to investigate more than 300 open complaints, according to the most recent data posted on the agency's website. More than 200 long-term care complaints had already been closed, meaning OSHA reviewed responses from employers and determined that further action was not warranted. OSHA officials can close complaints if there is \"information indicating the employer is aware of the hazard and is correcting it,\" according to guidance on its website, meaning that just because a complaint has been closed does not mean it was found to be invalid.Officials at the nursing home accused of not reporting worker deaths, for example, said in their written response to OSHA that they didn't report one employee's death because they had only later learned it may have been related to Covid-19, and that the autopsy results were still pending. Representatives of the facilities where employees complained of wearing rain ponchos, being told to work while sick, or that a flu shot would protect workers from Covid-19, denied the accusations in statements to CNN. Deborah Berkowitz, director of the worker health and safety program at the National Employment Law Project, criticized the lack of thorough oversight by OSHA in connection to Covid-19. \"All the employer needs to tell OSHA is we are trying,\" said Berkowitz, who previously served as chief of staff and then a senior policy adviser for OSHA.OSHA provided data to CNN showing that it had opened more than 40 Covid-19 related inspections into nursing facilities. The majority of these were triggered by employee deaths or hospitalizations, and only two were opened at facilities where there were worker complaints, according to the data available. Only three states with their own OSHA-approved worker safety programs had opened any inspections at nursing facilities related to complaints, according to OSHA. While details about open complaints and inspections are not publicly available, the allegations made by workers in the closed complaints provide a window into the kinds of concerns nursing home workers are expressing to the government.At Opis Coquina Center, a Florida nursing home where the state says 16 residents have died and at least 11 workers have contracted the virus, an employee told OSHA in early April that leaders allegedly waited days to tell staff about a resident who tested positive for Covid-19. The center's corporate owner said it could not comment on the specific information in the complaint, but noted that it had been closed without any action against the facility. Also last month, a worker at the Cardigan Nursing & Rehabilitation Center in Massachusetts reported that residents weren't being tested for Covid-19, and that the facility was reporting them as negative when there was evidence they were positive. The local health department was not being informed of the \"assumed positive\" cases either, the complaint alleged. The state has not released information about where the more than 3,000 long-term care deaths have occurred in Massachusetts, but publishes a list of all facilities with two or more cases. An administrator at Cardigan, which is not on that list, declined to say whether there had been any deaths -- only stating that Cardigan does not fall into the category of two or more positive Covid-19 cases. She denied the allegations in the complaint and noted that it had been closed.The most common problem threatening long-term care employees was a lack of personal protective equipment, or PPE, which includes face masks, gloves and gowns. Some workers said they weren't provided with protective gear because of facility shortages, while others said their facilities didn't allow them to wear masks even if they had them.\"Long-term care providers are facing an unprecedented situation that has left them begging for testing, personal protective equipment (PPE) and staffing resources,\" said Mark Parkinson, president of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, a trade organization representing long-term care facilities. \"Just like hospitals, we have called for help. In our case, nobody has listened.\" Many employees reported not being provided masks while working with residents who had tested positive for Covid-19 or were symptomatic. In some cases, the facilities accused of improper safety measures subsequently reported that coronavirus had infiltrated their facilities. That was the case at Cedar Mountain Post Acute Rehabilitation in California. Five days after an employee filed a complaint about a shortage of masks there, county officials learned there was Covid-19 in the facility. Cedar Mountain has now reported that 77 residents have tested positive, as well as 36 staff members. There have been 21 resident deaths -- the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in any facility in San Bernardino County, according to state data. A facility spokesperson told CNN that Cedar Mountain \"was never short on PPE\" and that the facility's proper PPE usage and inventory had been verified by the county and state health departments, as well as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The first positive case of coronavirus at Stafford Hill Assisted Living, in Massachusetts, was reported to the town nearly two weeks after a complaint was made to OSHA. The employee said the facility had not developed or communicated a plan to reduce employees' risk of Covid-19 and that supervisors weren't allowing staff to wear masks, even when they brought their own. A spokeswoman for the facility acknowledged that an employee was told not to wear a homemade mask to work even though medical grade masks were unavailable and said the facility was following CDC guidance at the time. She said that when the complaint was made, Stafford Hill was days away from securing medical masks and emphasized that when the employee requested to wear the homemade mask, there had been no positive cases. Since then, however, 14 staff members have tested positive, and 20 residents, according to the facility. There have been three deaths -- all residents.Four days after Avista Healthcare in New Jersey reported a Covid-19 outbreak to the county, a worker worried about the virus spreading to staff. The worker told OSHA that employees caring for a suspected Covid-19 resident were not given proper PPE and that the same resident was being allowed into common areas. State data shows there have been 60 positive cases at the facility and 18 deaths. The facility did not respond to a request for comment. In a May letter reviewed by CNN, a Camden County official told the state health department that the county had been \"diligently assessing the facilities and educating the staff on infection control measures\" and had \"very serious concerns\" about Avista and other facilities. He asked the state health department, which said the letter is under review, to immediately install a state monitor to keep tabs on the facility -- an action typically only taken when there is a situation that places the health and safety of residents in potential jeopardy. 'This is healthcare providers crying out for help'Nursing home employees have also turned to elected officials for help -- desperate for someone to intervene and echoing many of the concerns detailed in the OSHA complaints filed about other facilities.\"For many weeks we have been working extremely short staffed!\" an employee at the Life Care Center of Nashoba Valley wrote to officials in Littleton, Massachusetts, according to records obtained by CNN. \"Instead of managers stepping up and helping us that are struggling to keep patients safe they're in [their] offices. The Friday our first patient tested positive we were wearing masks and were told we couldn't do that cause (we) were contaminating the floor.\" Littleton documents show that town officials received at least 12 calls and messages from employees as deaths mounted there in April -- eventually becoming the site of 14 deaths and more than 80 positive cases among residents and staff. One employee reported testing positive for the virus but received no response after calling the facility in an attempt to let management know. A spokesman acknowledged that calls may have gone unanswered because family members, town officials and the media had been overwhelming the phone lines and staff was \"prioritizing patient care.\" Another staff member was one of the first employees sent home with a fever, according to a message given to town officials, but hadn't been told of any cases at the facility so didn't get tested. Then the employee learned a colleague was in the hospital. \"My dear friend and nurse is fighting for her life in the ICU sedated on a ventilator,\" the worker told town officials, according to records containing summaries and in some cases the full text of calls and messages they received from family members and workers. \"Never knew what was going on in the facility.\"The nurse this employee was concerned about later died, and after her death, a caller told the town that there were two more nurses in the ICU.A spokesman for Life Care Centers of America, the corporate owner of Nashoba Valley, told CNN that management immediately notified all staff of the first positive case at the end of March and that \"it is simply not true that we knew information related to the outbreak and didn't communicate this to our staff.\" He said that a state health department survey found the facility was in compliance with infection control regulations and preparation for Covid-19 -- including the proper use of protective equipment. Regarding the two additional nurses an employee claimed had gone to the ICU, he said one recovered and the other was a certified nursing assistant who went to the hospital but \"to our knowledge was never in the ICU.\" As of April 13, the most recent data provided by Life Care, more than 30 employees had tested positive for the virus or were presumed to have contracted it because they showed symptoms. Even more recently, a Pennsylvania state senator, Katie Muth, has been inundated with text messages and calls from employees at a state-run veterans home where her office said there had been around 50 deaths since April 1 -- though not all had been definitively linked to Covid-19. The state did not provide figures for the Southeast Veterans' Center, but said its system of six veterans homes had reported 101 resident cases, 47 staff cases and 39 confirmed or probable Covid-19 deaths.Muth said workers at the Southeast Veterans' Center reported that supervisors were putting pressure on them to erase signs of the disease from medical charts and records and to come to work even after testing positive for Covid-19. \"This is healthcare providers crying out for help,\" Muth said in a statement. The senator, along with the county coroner, has called for an investigation into the facility's handling of the outbreak.A spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs, which operates the facility, said that it takes all concerns from its staff very seriously and has been following CDC guidelines of when it is appropriate to bring employees back to work. She said the department has an officer who is responsible \"for ensuring that all employee inquiries are addressed and appropriately resolved\" -- noting that the veterans home had recently passed state and county inspections and these had found that the facility was using the correct protocols. One employee at the veterans home, who asked to remain anonymous out of fear of losing her job, told CNN that what has become a desperate situation all began when the facility banned staff from wearing PPE up until the first week of April. Management, she complained, said wearing masks might \"scare or insult\" residents. A colleague was even disciplined for wearing his own mask to work, she said. She said employees undoubtedly spread the virus throughout the facility as they delivered meals, and that even though certain residents were clearly displaying symptoms of Covid-19, she heard supervisors telling staff they weren't sick. Supervisors have also called and \"bullied\" workers who tested positive, she said, telling them to come to work or not get paid. The state said it could not comment on employee-related matters. Even as scrutiny on the veterans home has intensified, she said her bosses were putting pressure on employees to stay quiet about just how bad the situation has become.She would have quit by now, but she views the veterans at the facility as her \"adopted family.\" Each morning, she said she cringes as she logs into the facility's system to see whose name is the latest to pop up on her screen as \"expired.\"Do you have anything to share about Covid-19 in nursing homes?

        "body": "Observing Ramadan alone during the pandemic taught me to be grateful for what I have while I still have it\n\nBy Mirna Alsharif, CNN\n\nUpdated 1702 GMT (0102 HKT) May 18, 2020\n\nWe are publishing personal essays from CNN's global staff as they live and cover the story of Covid-19. Mirna Alsharif is a news assistant in the New York bureau.\n\nNew York (CNN)Before the pandemic, I knew exactly how I would spend Ramadan. I would avoid food, water and swearing -- which I unfortunately do often -- for up to 16 hours a day, all while longingly staring at my colleagues enjoy their morning coffee at work. Maybe have \"iftar\" to break the fast with my uncle and his family at his apartment in Queens on the weekends. And I'd definitely take some time off to visit my parents and sister in Dubai to enjoy the holy month together.\n\nI was looking forward to the central community message of Ramadan -- to cooking and baking with my mom, attending evening \"taraweeh\" prayers at our local mosque and hosting huge iftar parties at my parents' house like we did every year.But when New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued the stay-at-home order on March 22, I realized that the chances of any of that happening were slim to none. Almost overnight, New York City became something I've never seen it be before -- a ghost town. Soon after, it also became the epicenter of the coronavirus in the United States.By the time Ramadan started on April 24, I'd been working from my 319-square-foot studio on the Upper East Side for a little over a month. I'd originally thought we'd be out of lockdown in time for the fast, but it quickly became clear to me that this Ramadan was going to be different.Read MoreI was going to spend a month that is all about community, perfectly alone. I would have \"suhoor,\" the meal before sunrise, by myself. I would pray five times a day by myself. I would break fast at sunset by myself.There would be no overseas travel to see my family, no shoulder-to-shoulder congregational taraweeh prayers at my neighborhood mosque or family gatherings at my parents' house where I could eat \"kunafa\" soaked in sugar syrup or \"atayef\" filled with whipped cream. Traditions have been replaced by Zoom calls with my family and friends across the US, Dubai and my mother country, Egypt. While the calls sometimes soften the blow of my isolation, they also serve as a reminder of how far away I am from my loved ones this year. \"Are you sure you're OK? Are you eating enough?\" my mom asks me every time we talk. I wouldn't dare say anything other than yes; the last thing I want is for her to know how much I'm struggling right now. Or how much takeout I'm ordering. But while the pandemic has shown me just how fickle life is, how almost anything can change without a moment's notice, the fast has given me perspective and reminded me to be thankful for everything I have while I still have it. There are so many people who have lost their lives to the coronavirus; more than 15,000 in New York City alone. There are over 20 million health care workers on the front lines across the US fighting every day to save lives. And there are so, so many who have lost their jobs and may be struggling to put food on the table.This month, I'm thinking about my friend, Mohamed Madboly, who started his own food cart business at 19 years old and parked it right outside the New York Institute of Technology, where he was also a student. The pandemic has forced him to shut down the business he worked five years to get off the ground, but this Ramadan he's extra thankful because his elderly father seems to be recovering from Covid-19. Mohamed also tested positive and continues to struggle with symptoms, like having no sense of smell, all while observing the fast. I'm also thinking about Naoual Elidrissi, an essential worker who lives only 10 minutes away from her elderly parents in Queens but wouldn't dare visit them during Ramadan out of fear of passing on the virus.While the pandemic has taken a lot from me -- and so many others -- during this holy month, it has given me time that I didn't have before to pray the daily five prayers on schedule, to reflect on just how fortunate I am and to get to the root of what Ramadan is truly about beyond all the pomp and circumstance: Gratitude.I am grateful. For my health that I often take for granted. For the food I have access to. For my family and loved ones. For the first responders and health care workers taking risks on the front lines for the greater good.This year, I'm not surrounded by my colleagues and the scent of their countless cups of coffee or visiting family and partaking in Ramadan tradition. Instead, I'm tucked away in my tiny, fifth-floor walk-up apartment in complete isolation. But at sunset every single day when I take my first sip of water, I'm more conscious than ever before that I have clean water to drink, good food to eat and a roof over my head -- and that's more than enough for now.",

        "body": "He was on a ventilator, fighting for his life. A stranger sent reinforcements\n\nOpinion by Thomas Lake, CNN\n\nUpdated 1:15 PM ET, Thu April 23, 2020\n\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nIn a series of essays called The Distance, Thomas Lake is telling the stories of Americans living through the pandemic. Email thomas.lake@cnn.com to share your story idea.\n\n(CNN)Kevin Rathel was delirious, paralyzed with drugs, trying to comprehend this waking nightmare. He did not know where he was, why they were sticking him with needles, or why someone in a mask was shoving a tube down his throat. Rathel was in a battle he didn't understand, fighting an enemy he couldn't see. Those people in masks were the nurses and doctors of Orlando Regional Medical Center. They were trying to save his life.\n\nOn the seventh night, they got some help: 11 ounces of gold-colored liquid from the veins of a stranger. A man who'd fought the same enemy and won.It started the last week of March, when Rathel's 19-year-old son got sick. He'd been delivering pizza, and it seems he brought the virus home. Rathel's two daughters got sick, as did his wife, Stacie Rathel. Kevin Rathel was sickest of all. By Thursday, April 2, he couldn't go upstairs without stopping to catch his breath.Stacie took him to the hospital, where his condition kept getting worse. Kevin is 52, with no underlying health conditions. On Saturday morning, Stacie got a phone call. They were inducing a coma and putting him on a ventilator.After the shock wore off, Stacie remembered something she'd read a few weeks earlier. Some patients had improved after receiving blood plasma from others who had recovered from Covid-19. She asked about it, and Dr. Satya Mukkera, the hospital's director of critical care, agreed to give it a try. Because it's still an investigational treatment, the hospital needed permission from the FDA. They got it within hours. Now they just needed the plasma.Read MoreRathel's son wanted to donate, but he was ruled out because he'd never been tested for the virus. Stacie was still recovering, so she wasn't eligible. A family friend named John Stemberger took up the search. Rathel's condition deteriorated. One doctor told his wife, \"He is the sickest patient we have.\"As Stemberger worked his connections, he got a text about an unrelated matter from someone he knew down in Stuart. Stemberger said it wasn't a good time. He was looking for a plasma donor, because his friend was dying, and the donor had to meet all these requirements. A positive lab test for Covid-19. A compatible blood type. A full recovery from the disease, and so forth. He said he was looking for a needle in a haystack.The man in Stuart texted him back: I'm your needle in the haystack.A race against timeThe man in Stuart was James Crocker, 49, founder and president of a company that manufactures specialty vehicles for roadway and runway maintenance. Crocker had gone to a funeral in late February after the tragic death of a 27-year-old nephew, and a few days later began to feel sick. More than a dozen relatives did too. Crocker's symptoms kept getting worse: nausea, fever, headache, coughing so much he couldn't sleep. On March 14 he went to the hospital, where he stayed two nights with pneumonia. He went home and began to recover.As fear and sickness proliferated, Crocker felt immune to both. Although scientific data was limited, with experts urging caution, he felt almost invincible.Now it was Monday night, April 6. Here was John Stemberger on the phone, talking about his dying friend and his search for a plasma donor. Crocker raised his hand. The blood types were compatible. He'd been symptom-free for more than two weeks. Within an hour, he was on his way to Orlando.The hard part came the next day, when he tried to find a test showing he no longer had Covid-19. He drove around for hours, calling one contact after another. Finally he got a test at the hospital where Kevin Rathel was being treated, but he was told the results were three or four days away. When he asked a nurse how Kevin was doing, she closed her eyes and shook her head.\"These kids are going to lose their daddy,\" Crocker thought.He went to the Rathels' house to meet the family. While he was there, Stacie got a call from George Ralls, Orlando Health's chief quality officer. He'd found an instant test. Crocker went back to the hospital and took it. The negative result came back in minutes.The next morning Crocker went to OneBlood, the blood-donation center facilitating the transaction. It took about 20 minutes. Someone stuck a needle in his arm. It didn't even hurt. 'You're going to make it'As he writhed in pain and thought about death, Kevin Rathel kept hearing voices. God, please help Kevin. Later he found out that some of the hospital workers had been praying for him. He'd been afraid of them, confused in his delirium. Now he thought of them as angels.He received the plasma transfusion on the night of April 8. Grasping for anything that might help, doctors also gave him various drugs with long and complicated names: hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, tocilizumab. After getting a little worse, he began to get better. The toxins in his liver decreased. He began to need less oxygen. On Easter Sunday, April 12, the doctors brought him out of his coma to see if his body was strong enough to function on its own. Stacie and the kids got to see him on FaceTime. He was still groggy and delirious. One by one, they told him who they were.\"You're alive, and you're going to make it,\" Stacie told him.He couldn't respond because of the tube in his throat, but he seemed to hear them. They saw tears streaming down his cheeks.The improvement continued. Dr. Mukkera said he couldn't be sure why. Was it the plasma? The drugs? Some combination? There was no definitive answer. But Stacie was convinced the plasma saved her husband's life.On Thursday, April 16, he was strong enough to come off the ventilator. The following Monday he was well enough to go home. As they wheeled him out of the hospital, he was overwhelmed with gratitude. Hospital workers lined the path, cheering for him, but he wanted to cheer for them. His wife drove him home. Here were the neighbors, welcoming him with a car parade. Here at the car window was a man he didn't know.A man whose blood was in his veins.They would be friends for life. James Crocker would probably take Kevin Rathel fishing on his 64-foot boat. Their families would plan a vacation together. But there was no hurry. They had plenty of time, these veterans of the coronavirus wars, and they could do things that most people couldn't. They bumped fists, and stood close together.Have you fully recovered from Covid-19? Maybe you can help someone, too. Here's more information from OneBlood and the American Red Cross.",

    "Opinion: It's foolish to worry about privacy when data can help fight coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Alain B. Labrique is an infectious disease epidemiologist and associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\nThe recent announcement that Google and Apple are jointly developing an app that could alert you if you have been in contact with someone infected with coronavirus is a prime example of the tensions involved in using digital tools to fight this pandemic. The voluntary participation that is a cornerstone of the companies' privacy policy means the app may struggle to get a sufficient user base and, as a result, may not have much of an impact.\n\nBut it's urgent that we find a way to strike a balance when it comes to using digital technologies to manage this threat to our health and economy. The United States is moving toward an inflection point in the pandemic where we need a realistic road map for getting America back on its feet without sparking a second surge in infections. The data generated by mobile phones can play an incredibly valuable role by providing insights that can allow public health and economic imperatives to work in sync, rather than in opposition to one another. Countries like Israel, Thailand and Hong Kong already are effectively using data generated by smartphones to fight COVID-19. In Singapore, the government released an app that uses Bluetooth to identify people who have been in close contact with a COVID-19 patient. South Korea has used cell phone data to create maps showing where infected people went even before they were diagnosed. The public health implications of such data insights are remarkable. But significant privacy concerns have accompanied these moves to compile medical and location data. They are likely to be especially prominent around any effort to use digital tools to fight the pandemic in the United States. We're a country that has long emphasized the importance of autonomy and individual freedom. There has always been a tension between civil liberties and public health interventions, especially during crises when the suspension of freedoms is for the greater good. Here are a few ways we can take advantage of digital technologies while balancing public health imperatives with privacy concerns. Read MoreAnonymous surveysFirst, the federal government could use the Wireless Emergency Alerts system to use mobile phone networks to instantly communicate with virtually everyone on the network -- about 96% of Americans. There is an opportunity to strategically and judiciously use this incredible level of connectivity to communicate risk, inspire collective behavior and to gain insights into the state of the epidemic at a national level. For example, the system could be used to solicit anonymous answers to a few simple questions, like, \"Have you experienced a fever and cough in the last five days?\" or, \"Are you wearing a mask and practicing social distancing?\" This would augment data culled from fragmented and sometimes inconsistent state and local data to glean insights into potential hotspots worth investigating or to understand if mitigation policies are being followed. It can also help improve current disease models where a lack of data is producing sharply different predictions that have enormous health and economic implications.Real-time dataThere are already efforts to use anonymous, real-time data from groups of participating phone users to monitor adherence to social distancing and stay-at-home policies, a critical insight to identify potential hotspots for future outbreaks. Current data is often not sufficiently detailed or nationally representative to assess the situation at the county or city level where it's most needed. However, such data exists and can be integrated into a reporting system that would include appropriate privacy safeguards. For example, in addition to removing personal data, the geolocation can be blurred to prevent law enforcement agencies from using this data to crack down on a party or church service.Offer benefits for data sharingThere is the quandary of how to spur widespread adoption of a contact tracing app like the one Google and Apple are building before folks become infected, and even more importantly, once someone tests positive for coronavirus.One approach is to offer incentives -- like access to testing and virtual check-ins with health care professionals. Big providers like Kaiser Permanente, Blue Cross Blue Shield and even Medicare could offer service benefits to app users. App activation and data-sharing could be presented via an \"opt-out\" approach: People would be clearly informed that they will be part of a national COVID-19 mitigation system and they will have an easy way of opting out. Studies suggest higher inclusion rates when participation is seen as the norm, not the exception.Meanwhile, an additional safeguard could involve establishing a special government-appointed, bipartisan oversight body, with legal, ethical and civil society representation tasked with monitoring privacy standards and moving swiftly to address any issues that arise. Ultimately, we would be foolish to completely reject the powerful insights digital tools can provide, especially as we develop strategies to reopen the economy. When fighting a disease with a 14-day silent incubation period and transmission before the onset of symptoms, we need the best data -- especially at the local level -- long before an outbreak is well underway. Identifying those who may have been exposed and urging them to quarantine before they spread the disease to others, can stop the virus in its tracks.",

    "Partisan distrust is making it harder to fix anything": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "(CNN)Just before Anthony Fauci testified on Capitol Hill on Tuesday (by video conference and from partial quarantine), CNN released a new poll conducted by SSRS. The main thrust of the poll was that overall approval of the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak is negative, but with a massive partisan divide.\n\nTrusting Trump or trusting Fauci. Pay attention to this detail about trustworthiness in the story by CNN polling director Jennifer Agiesta:Some of the division in views of the virus may stem from a wide divergence in trusted sources of information about it. Republicans are more apt to say that they trust the information they get about coronavirus from Donald Trump (84%) than they are to say they trust the information they get from Dr. Anthony Fauci (61%) or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (72%). Among Democrats, just 4% say they trust the information they get from the President, well behind the 81% who say they trust Fauci or the 80% who trust the CDC. Overall, CNN (55% trust) inspires far more trust than Fox News (35%), with those figures also divided by party. And then Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul -- noted downplayer of coronavirus and asymptomatic vector -- told Fauci he didn't buy everything the doctor said. \"As much as I respect you, Dr. Fauci, I don't think you're the end-all. I don't think you're the one person that gets to make a decision. We can listen to your advice, but there are people on the other side saying there's not going to be a surge and that we can safely open the economy, and the facts will bear this out.\" Read MoreFauci answered that point:\"Well, first of all, Sen. Paul, thank you for your comments. I have never made myself out to be the 'end-all' and only voice of this. I'm a scientist, a physician and a public health official. I give advice according to the best scientific evidence. There are a number of other people who come into that and give advice that are more related to the things that you spoke about, about the need to get the country back open again and economically. I don't give advice about economic things. I don't give advice about anything other than public health.\"Paul wants to tear Fauci down a bit here. That's pretty clear. But their entire exchange was worth examining. Watch it here.Or read about it.Paul has said he's convinced he has immunity to Covid-19 now that he's tested positive. Fauci says it's likely Paul has immunity, but that hasn't been verified by the scientific process. FAUCI: As I've often said, and I again repeat, you can make a reasonable assumption that it would be protective but natural history studies over a period of months to years will then tell you definitively if that's the case.PAUL: I think that's important. Because, in all likelihood -- is a good way of putting it -- the vast majority of these people will have immunity, instead of saying there is no evidence. Fauci is dealing in facts and Paul is dealing in likelihoods. Those are very different things.Read here for why a positive Covid antibody test doesn't mean much of anything yet.Trump says. The problem is that President Donald Trump, who has the biggest bullhorn, doesn't deal in either one. He deals in innuendo, as with his unproven allegations about how the disease came to be in China.He pushes false promises, as he did when he promised, falsely, that an anti-malarial drug would be an effective treatment.He makes up timetables, as he's done for opening the economy and for the development of a vaccine.He makes false accusations, as when he says Democrats are intentionally slow-walking the opening of the economy. Here's a video that documents Trump's evolution on Covid-19.And here's our full library of fact-checks. Fauci says. But it appears there's a good chance a portion of the public is more likely to believe those things than Fauci's warnings today, which included: -- states face serious consequences if they reopen too quickly;-- it's almost certain that there are more deaths than reported (CNN has charted more than 82,000 deaths);-- a second wave in the fall is completely possible;-- and children could be more at risk than we realize.Read more about his testimony here. Republicans on Capitol Hill were split Tuesday on whether to follow Trump's push to \"liberate\" states or Fauci's call for caution. The communications genius of Trump is that somehow he, as President, has still become the voice of dissent against both the experts in his own government and many of the nation's government even as he has more power than anyone in the country. Up is down. Facts are dead. If the US President runs on a platform of liberating states from social distance his government still technically recommends it will be a snow job of epic, unprecedented proportions. Will kids go back to school in the fall?Paul, during his questioning of Fauci, said it would be a huge mistake not to open schools in the fall and argued portions of the country will be absolutely ready for it. His concerns are well put here: PAUL: \"But if we keep kids out of school for another year, what's going to happen is the poor and underprivileged kids who don't have a parent that's able to teach them at home are not going to learn for a full year. And I think we ought to look at the Swedish model and we ought to look at letting our kids get back to school. I think it's a huge mistake if we don't open the schools in the fall.\"Fauci then made the point that we don't entirely know how coronavirus will affect children and he pointed to an outbreak of troubling symptoms among some children in the northeast.At another point in the hearing, he suggested a regional approach to reopening. Unintended consequences. But this will continue to be a difficult decision as the needs of kids are weighed against the desire to prevent an outbreak.\"I don't have a good explanation or solution for the problem of what happens when you close schools and it triggers a cascade of events,\" Fauci added. Democrats push a massive new stimulus, Republicans say it's DOAThe legislative text is more than 1,800 pages and it would give new funding to state and local governments and also direct payments to individuals, hazard pay for front-line workers and billions to beef up testing. Republicans in the Senate have said the bill is going nowhere in their chamber. Keep an eye out for when the two sides start sounding like they're on the same page.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Vice President Mike Pence attempted to reassure governors on a Monday call that the federal government was working as quickly as possible to get states coronavirus testing supplies. But even as the call was happening, President Donald Trump insisted that the responsibility for coronavirus testing belonged primarily to the states.\n\nThe call with the country's governors, which included several officials on the White House coronavirus task force, was focused primarily on testing, according to multiple sources familiar with the call. One state official said it was the first time the testing issue had been laid out in such detail from a top official. The state official said the administration's message was that they were working to get the states what they need -- and that \"it's a partnership\" between the federal and state governments.But Trump, who was not on the call, has increasingly called on states to be primarily responsible for testing. \"Last month all you heard from the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats was, 'Ventilators, Ventilators, Ventilators.' They screamed it loud & clear, & thought they had us cold, even though it was the State's task. But everyone got their V's, with many to spare. Now they scream (...) 'Testing, Testing, Testing,' again playing a very dangerous political game,\" Trump tweeted while the call was happening.The President added: \"States, not the Federal Government, should be doing the Testing - But we will work with the Governors and get it done. This is easy compared to the fast production of thousands of complex Ventilators!\"Read MoreAccording to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, the challenge many state leaders on the call expressed was getting \"increased testing capacity.\" Pennsylvania needs the reagents and test kits, and requests for similar testing supplies, he said, was the \"general cry\" from the other governors. \"We all expressed that hope today that we could move toward that and the vice president assured us that the federal government was moving as quickly as possible toward that end,\" he added. Pence said Monday's call with governors was \"very productive.\" \"We heard again, not only the fact that we are making progress in slowing the spread. We're seeing very encouraging signs even in hotspots around the country their cases are leveling and in some cases going down,\" Pence said Monday afternoon at FEMA Headquarters following the call. Governors have been pleading for federal testing help for more than a month, as a shortage of testing supplies and a backlog in private labs made it nearly impossible for the states to reach the level of testing needed to reduce social distancing guidelines. Last week, Trump grew frustrated after a slew of phone calls on reopening the economy grew repetitive, with business leaders, governors and lawmakers all stressing the need for more testing to reopen the economy. This week, White House aides, under the direction of the President's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are trying to determine the best way to deal with the testing supply chain to get the needed elements to the states, according to a source familiar with the issue.One hurdle has been figuring out how to accelerate the production of the testing supplies. The administration recently said it would employ the Defense Production Act to provide federal funding to a company to produce more testing swabs. But accelerating production for the reagents used for tests may pose a new challenge, given that they're often manufactured overseas and are therefore not subject to the act. While the President attempted to paint states' requests for help with testing as a partisan issue, it hasn't just been Democrats who have asked for federal assistance with testing. Governors on both sides of the aisle have said that without greater testing capabilities, businesses in their states will not be able to reopen. Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, for example, said Sunday that a lack of testing is the No. 1 problem in America and \"has been since the beginning of the crisis.\"\"The administration, I think, is trying to ramp up testing. They are doing some things with respect to private labs,\" Hogan said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"But to try and push this off to say that the governors have plenty of testing and they should just get to work on testing -- somehow we aren't doing our job -- is just absolutely false.\"And Tennessee's Republican Gov. Bill Lee underscored the importance of increased coronavirus testing, tweeting after Monday's call: \"This morning, I spoke with @VP and our nation's governors regarding expanded testing capacity & Tennessee's aggressive push to test outside of traditional COVID-19 symptoms. Ramping up our testing & health care capacity is a critical step to get Tennesseans back to work safely.\"\n\nCNN's Jason Hoffman and Kristina Sgueglia contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)Vice President Mike Pence claimed on Monday that much of the American public has a \"misunderstanding\" of his March 9 claim that 4 million coronavirus tests would be distributed by the end of that week.\n\nPence was doing again on Monday what he had done on March 9 and has done regularly since: leaving out a critical piece of information. This time, he failed to explain that it had been his own words that created the \"misunderstanding\" -- instead laying the confusion at the feet of the media and average citizens.Pence's comments on the subject of testing, including the remarks he was asked about on Monday, have consistently painted a picture that is far rosier than the actual situation on the ground. Unlike President Donald Trump, Pence has not been flat lying. Rather, he has misled by omission.Playing cheerleader for Trump, whose leadership he has unfailingly complimented, Pence has hailed incremental progress while declining to explain to the public that there are also serious problems.Read MoreThe 'distributed' testsAt a White House briefing on March 9, Pence said that in addition to 1 million coronavirus tests already distributed, 4 million would be distributed by the end of that week -- and that commercial labs were going to help produce \"a dramatic increase\" in the availability of testing.\"With the deployment of the commercial labs, we literally -- we literally are going to see a dramatic increase in the available -- availability of testing, and that's all a direct result of the President's leadership,\" he said. Pence's \"4 million\" number was misleading. A month later, Trump announced that 2 million tests had been conducted. (Trump put the number of conducted tests above 4 million only in mid-April.) And Pence had strongly suggested that the commercial labs he invoked would be able to process these 4 million tests.But when he was asked by a reporter on Monday what had gone wrong after the \"4 million\" promise, Pence blamed the reporter and \"a lot\" of the public, not himself, for the \"misunderstanding\" -- claiming he had never meant that 4 million tests could actually be completed quickly, since the \"old\" laboratory system was not then able to process so many. If Pence had wanted to make clear on March 9 that he did not mean 4 million people could actually get tested fast, he could have said so. Instead, he conveniently omitted it.Pence's office did not respond Tuesday to a request for comment.The testing websiteAt a coronavirus news conference on March 13, Pence touted a website that he claimed would allow Americans to type in their symptoms, get informed whether they should be tested and then be \"directed to one of these incredible companies that are going to give a little bit of their parking lot so that people can come by and do a drive-by test.\" He said that Walmart, CVS, Target and Walgreens were now \"going to come together to meet the needs of the American public.\"They weren't.The website was ready only for people in the San Francisco Bay Area; it did not expand beyond California until late April. And a full month after Trump and Pence had spoken, the companies they mentioned had opened fewer than a dozen parking lot testing sites. An overly cheery picturePoliticians of both parties and public health experts have raised alarm throughout the pandemic of major impediments to conducting coronavirus tests -- and have consistently said that not enough are being conducted. At various points in the crisis, they have reported insufficient laboratory capacity leading to long wait times for results, and shortages of required testing materials such as swabs and reagents.Pence's prepared remarks at White House briefings have tended to omit these complaints entirely in favor of cheery, Trump-praising progress reports. He declared March 19, for example, that \"testing is available in all 50 states and is becoming increasingly available literally every hour of the day,\" on March 24 that \"we have done more tests in the last eight days than were done in the previous eight weeks. And it's because of the public-private partnership that the President forged with commercial labs.\" Pence is correct that there has been real progress in testing during the month of April. The number of tests conducted has increased from March and is now more than 5 million total, according to the White House. But Pence's relentlessly upbeat updates since March have not clearly communicated to Americans that there have been significant problems around the country. His latest commentsAt Monday's briefing, Pence touted a comment from Assistant Secretary for Health Brett Giroir, their testing coordinator, that governors' plans for next month mean that the US will easily reach a total of 8 million tests conducted in the month.\"But what the President brought about with this public-private partnership has brought us to the point where we've done 5.4 million tests to date. And, literally, you just heard that by next month it could -- we could be doing as many as 2 million tests a week all across the country to give the American people confidence that we can reopen and get our economy moving again,\" Pence said.Some experts say the US needs to do more than 2 million tests per week to safely reopen -- from at least 3 million per week, in the view of a Rockefeller Foundation analysis, to as many as 20 million tests per day, according to one Harvard University analysis.",

        "body": "(CNN)The Pentagon is considering banning new recruits from joining the military if they have been hospitalized for the coronavirus unless they get a waiver from the service they want to sign up with, according to a defense official.\n\nThe official said the guidance is being put in place because there is little understanding of the \"long-term\" effects of the virus and there is a concern that potential recruits who have been hospitalized may need further medical assessments.The new policy is being finalized to set medical restrictions on recruits who may have tested positive or have been treated for Covid-19. Department of Defense medical waivers are required for a wide variety of medical conditions ranging from heart disease to a loss of vision.The Military Times was first to report the news.Months into the pandemic, the virus is posing significant medical challenges to the military on several fronts. Read MoreThere is a particular concern over whether a sufficient number of recruits will be able to join before a rigorous enough testing regime is in place to ensure they are healthy enough to enter training.The fact that sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt are still testing positive weeks after the coronavirus outbreak on the ship is underlining the need to solve the medical mystery of why some people carry the virus but have no symptoms and may continue to test negative, according to several Navy officials.It's a priority for the military which lives and operates in close quarters, and especially for sailors on ships at sea for months. The Pentagon recognizes it's crucial to ensure that testing for virus is accurate enough that units can safely deploy.Defense Secretary Mark Esper said at the Pentagon Tuesday that the department would randomly test groups of people \"to understand how many asymptomatic or carriers are maybe out there.\" The focus of attention is on trying to understand how much of the force may be asymptomatic but still have the virus.\"One of the challenges that we know is asymptomatic transmission of the disease. It's something we have known for quite a while but what we didn't really appreciate until the TR was the fact we are experiencing very high rates in the military,\" Esper said during an online Brookings Institution event on Monday. The Navy calculates asymptomatic rates among the Roosevelt crew may have reached 60% or greater initially. Seventeen sailors that had tested negative while they were sequestered off the ship for 14 days are now being tested again after three of them tested positive even though they had no symptoms, according to a navy official.",

        "body": "(CNN)Many patients with severe cases of Covid-19 have been shown to have extremely low levels of oxygen in the blood. Others who have tested positive find themselves experiencing shortness of breath.\n\nPerhaps that's why people are so interested lately in pulse oximeters, medical devices that measure the saturation of oxygen in red blood cells.Pulse oximeters were sold out on the websites of CVS and Walgreens, a search on Friday showed. US sales of pulse oximeters spiked on January 20 when the country's first Covid-19 case was confirmed, and again in mid-February, according to Quartz. While the rate of increase has slowed, sales have continued to grow each week since, the outlet reported. Meanwhile, Google searches for \"pulse oximeters\" spiked in early April and reached a peak in recent days, after emergency room physician Richard Levitan published an op-ed in The New York Times suggesting that the devices could provide early warnings about a need for treatment against Covid-19.So, should you go out and buy one? Here's what to know. Read MoreWhat a pulse oximeter isA pulse oximeter is a medical device that measures the saturation of oxygen in a person's red blood cells. It typically clips to your finger, though it can also be attached at the ear, forehead, nose or toes. The device works by shining a light through the skin, which is then analyzed to determine how much oxygen is being carried in the blood.Physicians and other medical professionals use pulse oximeters on patients experiencing shortness of breath or those who have a lung or heart conditions to determine if they're getting enough oxygen. Health care professionals routinely use them in hospitals and clinics when checking vital signs.Pulse oximeters are occasionally used in home settings for people who have underlying health conditions. They can also be found on Amazon, in pharmacies and in medical supply stores, although prices and quality can vary widely.One doctor suggests widespread screeningLevitan, who spent 10 days in New York treating pneumonia caused by the coronavirus, wrote in The New York Times that pulse oximeters could detect a form of oxygen deprivation in which patients don't experience shortness of breath, despite low oxygen levels and pneumonia readings through chest X-rays.According to Levitan, the devices signaled to two emergency physicians he knew that they needed treatment early on, and both went to the hospital and recovered.\"Widespread pulse oximetry screening for Covid pneumonia -- whether people check themselves on home devices or go to clinics or doctors' offices -- could provide an early warning system for the kinds of breathing problems associated with Covid pneumonia,\" he wrote.But you probably don't need one, experts sayExperts with the American Lung Association and the American Thoracic Society said that for most people, having a pulse oximeter at home wouldn't be particularly helpful in detecting the virus.\"If the question is, 'Would it be a good early indicator if somebody has Covid-19 infection?', I would say probably not,\" said Dr. J. Randall Curtis, a professor of pulmonary and critical care medicine at the University of Washington.That's because low oxygen levels are a relatively late indicator that a person has Covid-19, Curtis said. People who potentially have the illness will likely experience other symptoms, like fever, dry cough, body aches or fatigue, that would prompt them to seek medical attention days before they noticed a drop in their blood oxygen levels.It's also possible that people using pulse oximeters at home could see inaccurate readings. Nail polish, artificial nails, cold hands and poor circulation are all things that can interfere with the light used by the devices and result in false numbers, says Dr. David Hill, a pulmonary and critical care physician and a spokesman for the American Lung Association.\"One reason not to encourage everyone to go out and get one is there's a higher likelihood of having falsely low readings in a normal population,\" he said. \"Then those people are going to be calling physicians or going into emergency rooms that are already busy for potentially something that's nothing.\"There are instances when it would make sense to use pulse oximetry at home, both Curtis and Hill said. People who have already tested positive for Covid-19 and are recovering at home might want to consult their doctor about using a pulse oximeter to monitor whether they need oxygen or more supportive care. But those who are healthy and aren't experiencing symptoms can probably just save the $50 or so that they might otherwise spend on the device, Hill said.",

        "body": "(CNN)Turns out, all those selfies we've edited and posted on social media could be more problematic than we thought.\n\nA recent study, published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, found a \"consistent and direct link\" between posting edited photos on Instagram and eating disorder risk factors -- such as concerns over a person's weight and shape, as well as urges to exercise and to restrict food intake.The study's release comes amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has left many people suffering with eating disorders facing new challenges. Support groups estimate that as many as 30 million people in the US are living with an eating disorder.\"Although people may think it's harmless to post edited photos to Instagram, we found this increases eating disorder risk,\" Pamela Keel, a professor at Florida State University and co-author of the study, told CNN. \"It's important for people to know how to use social media safely as they turn more to these platforms to stay connected during this pandemic.\"Read More'That activity was not okay'Keel and her team of researchers at the university, who released the study's findings on Wednesday, surveyed 2,485 undergraduate students (76% female), asking whether they use editing apps that go beyond Instagram's filters in altering a person's appearance before they post. Students also answered questions related to their attitudes about eating, their anxiety levels, and depression symptoms. About 26.6% of the respondents -- one in three women, and one in 14 men -- said that they were editing photos before uploading them to their Instagram accounts, according to the study.The study found higher levels of anxiety and eating pathology for respondents who said they post edited photos to Instagram. People who said they posted edited photos were almost twice as likely to score above the threshold for a probable eating disorder than those who didn't, Keel said.However, that's not what the study's authors found most shocking. Previous research has already pointed to links between using social media and increased body dissatisfaction.So Keel and her team decided to take their research further by conducting an experiment specifically looking at whether the actual act of posting edited photos increases the risk factors for eating disorders. In the experiment, 80 students -- among those who said they use editing apps -- had their photos taken by the researchers over a neutral background. Students were asked to look at the photo of themselves for one minute, then they completed a questionnaire to establish their baseline levels around variables associated with disordered eating, anxiety and depression. After that, they were randomly assigned to one of four possible tasks: editing and posting the picture, posting the picture without editing it, editing the picture without posting it, or neither editing nor posting the picture. They then answered more questions, which allowed the researchers to note any changes in their perceptions from the baseline they established initially.Researchers discovered that posting a picture, edited or not, caused people to feel more concerned about their weight and shape. They also saw that the combination of editing and posting the photo was associated with an even more significant increase in those concerns.\"That's important,\" Keel said, \"because those weight and shape concerns are the most potent risk factor for the development of an eating disorder. So we were able to see that in real time that that's just, that activity was not okay.\" How editing and posting photos can impact your mental healthThe practice of editing photos often forces people to identify something wrong with their appearance, according to Keel.\"You have to first go through the process of saying: what's wrong with what I look like? What do I fix?\"Putting a photo out there for others to look at, right after going through this mental inventory of flaws \"might not feel very reassuring,\" Keel added. Still, the study also concluded that the negative consequences of posting edited photos may be temporary. A follow-up with the surveyed students, conducted 24 hours after the initial study, found the effects of the experiment had largely waned. However, the study also required participants to take a 24-hour break from social media, a deviation from their habit of spending on average at least one hour per day on Instagram.Editing ourselves to perfectionThe results of the study confirm what some experts who specialize in eating disorder prevention have known to be true.\"We are not surprised that this study found that editing your own photos is shown to increase risk,\" Claire Mysko, CEO of the National Eating Disorders Association, told CNN.\"We live in a society obsessed with celebrity and influencer culture that values unrealistic and narrow ideals of beauty. This culture stokes comparison and the impulse to edit ourselves to 'perfection'.\"Some people have criticized platforms like Instagram for not doing enough to remove harmful content for users who are at higher risk of developing an eating disorder, or are already affected by one. Carolyn Merrell, global head of policy programs at Instagram, said the platform regularly consults with experts, including the National Eating Disorders Association, \"to develop resources that encourage people to share real moments, find supportive communities, and manage any pressure they may feel.\"\"While we do not allow content that promotes or encourages eating disorders, we recognize that people may feel pressure to look a certain way on social media,\" she told CNN.\"We recognize that people, especially young people, experience anxiety and pressure to portray a 'perfect life' or body image on social media, rather than engage in authentic expression.\"Merell said Instagram has also launched initiatives, such as the 2019 \"Pressure to be Perfect\" campaign. The initiative offered toolkits for teens and parents to \"help them learn ways to mitigate pressures on the platform, while still feeling comfortable expressing themselves,\" Merell said.Moving forward: less editing, more self acceptanceKeel doesn't think that the developers of social media platforms were actively trying to cause harm. But she said she believes in the importance of \"establishing that social media use can be harmful,\" in order to let people know \"what things they might want to avoid.\"\"It's even better if we can identify positive things that people could do, positive uses of social media that would actually make them feel better about themselves and reduce their anxiety,\" Keel said. \"That's the future direction we're interested in.\"The professor, who practices what she preaches, said she will participate in a virtual dance flash mob held over Zoom this upcoming Saturday, called \"Shake it for Self Acceptance.\" \"It's about loving yourself as you are and being strong. The whole point of it is for us to get out there as we really are, no filters, no adjustments.\"Let's strive for more of that on the internet.",

        "body": "(CNN)Republican Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, the lone senator so far who has tested positive for Covid-19, is pressing forward with his business in the Capitol while not wearing a mask, asserting that it's \"nearly certain\" he won't get the disease again.\n\n\"Well, we know the history of science for the last 200 years has said that the norm is that when you do get an infection you develop immunity,\" Paul, one of the few senators not wearing a mask, told CNN on Wednesday. \"I've been tested for antibodies and so I would say the likelihood that I have immunity is nearly certain.\"\"Absolutely,\" said Paul, a physician who owned his own ophthalmology practice, when asked if he was that confident he wouldn't get the disease again.Researchers hope there will be some immunity after infection, as with many other viruses. But the question of immunity isn't settled for this new virus, and if having it once does provide immunity, it's not clear for how long. There isn't much data on reinfection yet either, and scientists say more research is needed.The World Health Organization said on April 25 that \"no study has evaluated ... whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans.\"Read MoreWHO added there's not \"enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an 'immunity passport' or 'risk-free certificate,'\" warning that people who assume that they are immune to a second infection might be ignoring important public health advice.Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, has said he's \"willing to bet anything\" that people won't get the disease again after they've been infected, but he cautioned it's still not known for sure.In March, Paul came under fire in the Senate after he carried on his business for several days after being tested for Covid-19, including going to the Senate gym, swimming in the senators' pool and dining daily with his colleagues. Once he learned he was positive, he returned to Kentucky. Paul was sharply criticized by senators from both parties for potentially putting them at risk.Asked on Wednesday if he should have gone into quarantine immediately once he took the test in March, Paul criticized the media for \"unfair\" coverage, saying he was advised by public health officials not to quarantine after he got tested. His office had said he only got tested out of an abundance of caution due to a pre-existing condition and was not experiencing any symptoms. He had attended a March 7 dinner in Louisville where two attendees later tested positive.\"I think the media was very unfair,\" Paul said, criticizing CNN and other news outlets. \"So I was advised directly by health officials not to quarantine ... I was advised not to, I had no symptoms, I had no contact with someone (who had the disease), so I had no official indications to quarantine.\"While he was recovering, Paul missed the vote to approve the sweeping $2 trillion stimulus law, the largest rescue package in American history, which was approved 96-0 in the Senate. Paul revealed on Wednesday he would have voted against the legislation.\"I've never voted for money for anything unless it were taken from another part of the budget or had a responsible means to fund it,\" Paul told CNN. \"So, I haven't been for any of this funding.\"",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)US doctors say they may have seen a possible complication of coronavirus infection in a young child: a rare inflammatory condition called Kawasaki disease.\n\nNational Health Service England sent an alert to doctors and on Sunday the Paediatric Intensive Care Society tweeted it out to members. It warned about a small increase in cases of critically ill children with \"common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters\" with some children testing positive for Covid-19. There have also been some reports in Italy and Spain, doctors said.A team at Stanford Children's Hospital said they had also seen a case. They described the case of a 6-month-old girl admitted to the hospital with Kawasaki disease and later also diagnosed with coronavirus.Kawasaki disease causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart. It is usually treatable and most children recover without serious problems, but it can be deadly. No one knows what causes Kawasaki disease, but some studies have pointed to a link between viruses or a bacterial infection.Read MoreThe child in this case was initially diagnosed with a viral infection at an urgent care, the Stanford team said. She was fussy, had a fever, and didn't eat. She didn't have a cough or congestion. A flu test was negative and doctors diagnosed her with a viral infection. She later tested positive for Covid-19.On the second day she had a fever and a blotchy rash. A chest x-ray showed a small white spot in her mid-lung so doctors sent her to the emergency room, the team reported in the journal in the journal Hospital Pediatrics.The baby's symptoms appeared to be Kawasaki disease, so she was given intravenous immunoglobulin and high-dose aspirin, a standard treatment. Two weeks after she was discharged, she had no respiratory symptoms and is doing well.The authors of the study suggest that since the coronavirus is new, and not all symptoms in children are known, scientists will want to further research the potential association of Kawasaki Disease with the infection.Dr. Brad Segal, who worked on the case, said the team was surprised when the test came back positive for Covid-19, \"In hindsight, looking at it, it's not entirely shocking that this association was possible,\" he told CNN.\"Kawasaki disease itself is often preceded by a respiratory or gastrointestinal illness,\" Segal, who works in Child Neurology at Stanford Children's Hospital, said. \"This has been known about Kawasaki disease for quite some time. No one completely understands it, but the model suggests it's triggered by an infection in a sort of immune dysregulation.\"Segal doesn't believe they have seen any other cases of Kawasaki associated with coronavirus at his hospital and he thinks that if this is a complication associated with the coronavirus that is most likely uncommon.\"In this case with SARS Covid-19, I think it's still too early to know whether it's something specific to the pathophysiology, or if it's just because it's another run of the mill infection,\" Segal said.The team has been wondering when other groups of clinicians would report seeing something similar, but he hadn't heard anything until his father emailed him the CNN story about the UK alert. \"I don't, though, think we are going to see a wave of these cases,\" Segal said. \"This isn't something that families, even if they have coronavirus really need to worry about, based on what we know so far.\"According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention most cases in children so far have reported only mild symptoms and less than 2% of cases in the US were in children as of April 2. \"I think this is going to be a subset, of a subset, of a subset of individuals who develop it,\" Segal said. \"As far as we can tell, this is something exceedingly uncommon.\"\n\nCNN's Jacqueline Howard, Michael Nedelman, Simon Cullen, and Amy Woodyatt contributed to this report",

        "body": "Read this before you venture out in public\n\nBy Scottie Andrew, CNN\n\nUpdated 1501 GMT (2301 HKT) April 30, 2020\n\n(CNN)The best way to curb the spread of Covid-19 is to stay home if you can.\n\nThat's true even now that more than half of US states will start reopening nonessential businesses like salons, restaurants and gyms. This isn't an immediate return to normalcy -- health officials have warned that reopening now could mean a resurgence of the virus. So if you're reentering public spaces, it's imperative to do it safely. Try not to visit them all, says Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University Milken Institute of Public Health. Read MoreShe suggests you choose one of these nonessential places to visit, then avoid the rest to limit your exposures to other people. For instance, if you go to your polling place to vote, don't also go out to eat that night or to get your hair cut. The more public places you visit, the higher your likelihood of becoming infected or infecting others. Restaurants Wearing a mask clearly isn't practical when you're dining in. Opt to sit outdoors: If a restaurant offers outdoor seating, ask to sit there, at least six feet away from other diners. The virus circulates more effectively in enclosed spaces when you're around the same people for extended periods of time, Wen said -- even for the length of a dinner. Check out their safety protocols: Dr. David Aronoff, director of Vanderbilt University Medical Center's Division of Infectious Diseases and professor of medicine, suggests digging into the restaurant's safety protocol before you go. Are employees properly outfitted with masks? Are tables arranged far enough apart? If you don't feel safe or comfortable eating there, rethink it or order takeout.\n\nWash your hands: Remember to wash your hands when you arrive and again before you eat. But that's advice that should outlast the pandemic. Beaches and parksThere's nothing inherently bad about being outside. In fact, spending time outdoors is an excellent way to de-stress in this bizarre time, Aronoff says -- as long as you do it safely.Stick to the guidelines: Many beaches are reopening for walking, running or surfing, and those are OK to do while you're there, as long as you can maintain distance from others. Just don't try sunbathing or lounging. Whether you're at a beach or public park, it's fine to work out alone or with another member of your household, if you've been isolating together, Aronoff says.\n\nKnow when it's too crowded to stay: If you arrive at a beach or park that's packed, and you won't be able to maintain six feet of distance from others, turn back around. Avoid games: Avoid playing team sports like basketball or beach volleyball, too, Aronoff advises. Group gatherings still aren't recommended, and those sports require close contact. GymsThere are certainly risks that come with working out in a gym: People are breathing heavily while they exercise in an enclosed space, sweating and touching shared equipment. That's not to say you can't make it work. Choose machines far apart from other gymgoers: Think two to three treadmills apart (and always at least six feet), Wen suggests. Gym owners should mitigate this by limiting the number of members allowed in a space at one time.\n\nWipe them down: If you're using free weights, wipe them down before and after use. If the gym doesn't have wipes, bring your own. Same goes for machines after you use them, Wen said.\n\nAvoid group classes: It's wise to avoid group fitness classes right now, she said. But if you have to attend or lead one, it may be safer to do them outside, where you're able to maintain some distance. SalonsIt's impossible to keep six feet of distance from a hair stylist or nail technician, so consider that before you go -- that already puts you and the employee at a higher risk. Check out the safety protocols: Are the work stations at the salon or barber shop properly distanced? Are employees wearing masks or face shields, gloves and smocks? Do they disinfect tools in between clients? Are employees regularly screened for symptoms? If you'll already be in close quarters with employees, you'll want to eliminate other risks, Wen said. Wait outside: While you wait for your appointment, sit outside, distanced from other people, until it's safe to enter, Wen said. Submit to a temperature screening: In Georgia, where salons were permitted to reopen, businesses are encouraged to use a touchless thermometer to screen customers. Anyone with a temperature over 99 degrees will be sent home, per those guidelines. Public transportation and ride shareAsk yourself before you ride: Do I absolutely need to use this service for an essential task? Will I take it to visit an essential location? If the answer is no, don't go, Wen said. Consider alternatives: \"Reserve public transportation for the people who have to take it,\" like essential workers, she said. And if you don't need it, consider alternate means of transport, like walking, biking or taking your own car if you have one. Look at peak hours: If you're someone who must use public transportation, Wen suggests looking into the service's peak hours. If there are fewer people at a certain time, try to hitch a ride at that time. Watch what you touch: And be mindful of every surface you touch. You may need to hold a hand rail or shut a car door, but be careful not to touch your face with your hands before you've washed them. AirportsAirports are emptier now, but many have closed some security checkpoints to consolidate staff. You may need to wait in line, so keep your distance from others and keep your mask on unless a TSA agent asks you to remove it. Limit your contact in the terminal: If you can, sit away from other passengers waiting to board. Bring your own food if you're worried about hunger -- many terminal restaurants and shops are closed. Carry wipes: You can carry disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizers in your carry-on luggage, so keep them close for when you board your plane. You'll want to wipe down the tray table, seat belt buckle, the air vent over your head -- anything a previous passenger might've touched throughout the flight. If possible, sit apart: And if you can help it, try not to sit in the same row as another person. At least one airline -- Alaska Airlines -- is offering passengers a refund if they can't seat them away from other people.\n\nClinicsThroughout the pandemic, physicians have asked people to postpone nonessential health care visits. But many clinics are restarting those now. Be mindful of your surroundings: If you have an appointment, be mindful in the waiting room. Try to sit six feet away from others, and avoid touching those months-old magazines or books left out for guests -- anything that others might've touched. Leave unnecessary guests at home: If you can avoid bringing your children, partner or friend with you to the clinic, you should. That way, they'll limit their exposures to other people and won't potentially infect others.\n\nCall before you go: And always call your physician's office before walking in or scheduling an appointment. They may ask about your symptoms before allowing you to come in, or they may've temporarily transitioned to telehealth for the time being. Polling places Voting requires a lot of touch. If you can't mail in your ballot, follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's advice for in-person voting. Keep your distance: Like always, stay six feet apart from other voters when you're waiting in line or in the booths. And there should be hand sanitizer (remember, it must have at least 60% alcohol to be effective) you can use before and after you use a voting machine or complete your paper ballot. Consider off-peak hours: If you can, come to the polling place at an off-time, when fewer voters will be packed into the room with you. Post officeBefore you visit your local US Postal Service branch, see if you can complete your service online. You can buy stamps and change mailing addresses online or by mail without an in-person visit. Observe the protocols: But if you do need to go in, maintain your distance from other customers. Your wait time may be delayed because of this. You may interact with employees behind \"sneeze guards,\" clear barriers that separate you. That's a good thing -- the USPS has installed those across the country, and they won't interfere with your transaction. Wash your hands later: Of course, wash your hands before and after your visit. Mail isn't thought to harbor the coronavirus, but using shared payment terminals and pens at the office could expose you.Grocery storeSupermarkets were one of the only places people could go before states began to reopen. You'll still need to practice social distancing while you're there now. Plan your trip: Bring a list of foods you're there to get. It's good to have a general sense of where they're located in the store so you won't spend more time in the store than you need to. Some ingredients to be out of stock, so prepare some backups. Wipe down carts and baskets: Use a disinfectant wipe to clean handles another customer might've touched. Follow the flow of traffic: Many stores have imposed one-way traffic in aisles to avoid tight squeezes. The directions aren't always straightforward, so look for arrows on the ground to orient yourself.",

        "body": "(CNN)Researchers in the UK said Wednesday they have seen an \"unprecedented cluster\" of eight children with rare inflammatory problems amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe cases, they said, resemble a severe form of Kawasaki disease -- a rare condition that causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart.Separately on Wednesday, the New York State Department of Health reported 64 suspected cases of a similar syndrome, which they called \"Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with COVID-19.\"In the British study, all of the children were previously fit and well, according to Shelley Riphagen and colleagues at Evelina London Children's Hospital. Five of the children received mechanical ventilation through a tube in the windpipe, and one who needed extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO -- a device that takes over for the heart and lungs -- later died of a stroke.Four of the children had known exposure to coronavirus, and two eventually tested positive. Six of the children were of Afro-Caribbean descent, and five were boys.Read MoreBritain issues an \"urgent alert\" on the syndromeThe British researchers, who published their findings in the Lancet medical journal, said the case cluster formed the basis of a national alert. In late April, Britain's National Health Service sent an urgent alert to doctors saying they had seen cases of atypical Kawasaki disease that could be linked to coronavirus.As their paper went to press, the researchers said they had treated more than 20 children with similar signs. The first ten of these children tested positive for coronavirus antibodies -- including the eight who made up the original cluster of cases. That suggests they had been exposed to the virus in the past, even if their diagnostic test came back negative at the time.\"We suggest that this clinical picture represents a new phenomenon affecting previously asymptomatic children with SARS-CoV-2 infection manifesting as a hyperinflammatory syndrome with multiorgan involvement similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome,\" the researchers wrote.Dr. Jon Cohen, emeritus professor of infectious diseases at Brighton & Sussex Medical School, said it's possible that something other than coronavirus triggered the cases.Cohen, who was not involved with the research, told the Science Media Centre that \"the clinical syndrome described, that of atypical Kawasaki shock syndrome, or toxic shock syndrome, can be precipitated by various stimuli and it is conceivable that this cluster was caused not by [Covid-19] but as a result of some other infective or non-infective stimulus.\"Even so, Cohen said \"the media reports that followed the initial description of these cases resulted in similar clusters being described in several other specialist centers, lending credence to the fact that this is indeed a new, but thankfully rare, concerning clinical syndrome.\"New York State reports 64 suspected cases with similar signsSimilar cases have been reported in the United States. On Monday, for example, New York City's health department issued an alert about 15 children hospitalized with an inflammatory syndrome possibly linked to the coronavirus. Two days later, the state health department issued an advisory spurred by 64 suspected cases.\"Thankfully most children with COVID-19 only experience mild symptoms, but in some, a dangerous inflammatory syndrome can develop,\" New York State Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said in a statement.According to the advisory, the syndrome can include persistent fever, abdominal symptoms, rash and cardiovascular symptoms requiring intensive care. In New York City, at least five patients required a ventilator and more than half of the cases required blood pressure support.Last month, a team at Stanford Children's Hospital described the case of a 6-month-old girl who was admitted to the hospital with Kawasaki disease and later diagnosed with coronavirus.She eventually recovered, but Dr. Brad Segal, who worked on the case, said the team was surprised when the girl's test came back positive for Covid-19. \"In hindsight, looking at it, it's not entirely shocking that this association was possible,\" he told CNN at the time.\"Kawasaki disease itself is often preceded by a respiratory or gastrointestinal illness,\" said Segal, who works in child neurology at Stanford Children's Hospital. \"This has been known about Kawasaki disease for quite some time. No one completely understands it, but the model suggests it's triggered by an infection in a sort of immune dysregulation.\"",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Williamson Memorial Hospital was more than the place where Carole Steele had surgery on her elbow. It was more than the place that treated her husband Samuel when his severe allergies make it hard for him to breathe.\n\nOne doctor there was her grandniece's godfather. Another was a trusted friend.Going to the hospital was \"like going home to us,\" the 73-year-old retired schoolteacher said. \"For Samuel and I, that is the only hospital we have ever known.\" Now, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, the hospital will close its doors Tuesday after serving the community for more than 100 years. The only hospital in the coal mining community of Mingo County, West Virginia, Williamson Memorial filed bankruptcy last year.And it's not alone. As the deadly virus has spread beyond urban hotspots, many more small hospitals across the country are on the verge of financial ruin as they've been forced to cancel elective procedures, one of the few dependable sources of revenue. Read MoreWilliamson Memorial and similar facilities have been struggling since long before the pandemic -- at least 170 rural hospitals have shut down since 2005, according to University of North Carolina research on rural hospital closures. But even as hospitals in cities like New York City and Detroit have been deluged with coronavirus patients, many rural facilities now have the opposite problem: their beds are near-empty, their operating rooms are silent, and they're bleeding cash. \"It's a scary time for small, rural hospitals right now,\" said Michael Kozar, CEO of Northwest Florida Community Hospital in Chipley, Florida, a Panhandle town of about 3,500 people. \"If you're not in a surge market, you're sitting there and watching your business go to zero.\"More than 100 hospitals and hospital systems around the country have already furloughed tens of thousands of employees, according to a tally by industry news outlet Becker's Hospital Review. They've sent home nurses and support staffers who would be deemed essential under state stay-home orders. And many of the rural areas with hospitals that have closed or are at risk of doing so have large elderly populations and patients with heart disease and elevated rates of health complications like obesity and diabetes, which can make the virus more deadly, according to experts. Rural communities also have higher rates of uninsured patients. As of Saturday, more than 80% of rural counties nationwide reported positive cases of Covid-19, totaling more than 34,500 people, according to data from the University of Iowa. If infection numbers rise in those areas, as public health experts predict, cash-strapped hospitals might not have the resources to handle a surge.The crisis is a \"match in a tinder box,\" said Alan Morgan, CEO of the National Rural Health Association. \"And when it lights -- it's going to be devastating.\"Closing during a pandemicFor years, rural hospitals have suffered because their patient populations are decreasing and they've been hit with reductions in federal funding through Medicaid and Medicare. Nineteen rural hospitals closed in 2019, the most of any year on record, said Mark Holmes, a health policy professor and the director of UNC's Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research, which has tracked the closings. Slightly less than half of the 170 rural facilities that shuttered in the last 15 years have reopened in some form, finding second lives as nursing homes, rehabilitation centers or part-time urgent care clinics, Holmes said. But most of these provide a fraction of the services they once did. Now, coronavirus has forced hospitals around the country to cancel non-essential procedures like colonoscopies, mammograms and physical therapy that helped many stay afloat. \"Facilities are just bleeding through cash right now,\" said Ryan Kelly, executive director of the Mississippi and Alabama Rural Health Associations. \"They're just dying on the vine, and it opens up the question of who's going to treat these patients when they close.\"The number of closed hospitals is almost guaranteed to rise in the coming weeks -- starting with Williamson Memorial. A 76-bed hospital tucked into the wooded hills overlooking the riverside town of Williamson -- home to West Virginia's first building constructed entirely of coal -- it's been serving residents since around 1920.Mingo County's population has steadily declined in recent years, according to the Census Bureau. Many of the patients coming to the hospital have no insurance or depend on Medicaid and Medicare, which don't fully reimburse the costs of treatment, said Dr. Donovan Beckett, who runs a clinic connected with the hospital. By the time it filed for bankruptcy in October 2019, Williamson Memorial was more than $1 million in debt, according to court records. Gene Preston came on as the hospital's CEO a day after the bankruptcy filing. The plan was to work with Williamson Health & Wellness Center, which bought the hospital's assets, and offload overhead as well as put an urgent care facility alongside the emergency room, he said. The ER generated the hospital's greatest revenue, said Preston. But along came Covid-19 and, following social distancing rules and governed by the fear of getting close to those possibly infected, fewer people went to the hospital. Emergency room visits dropped significantly and, like other health care facilities, Williamson Memorial stopped doing elective procedures, another dependable profit source, he said. \"If not for Covid, we were on track to work it out,\" Preston said. \"When Covid hit, every hospital that was looking at partnering with us retreated to solve their own issues.\" Beckett and Preston still hope to team with a business partner to reopen the hospital. State officials announced that the clinic had acquired the hospital's assets on April 1. But Beckett fears finding such a partner may now be harder. In the meantime, the clinic is jumping through numerous state and federal regulatory hurdles -- which Beckett said could take months -- to lay the groundwork in case a deal is struck. Doctors at the hospital are used to treating patients who overdose on drugs, victims of grisly car crashes on the region's winding mountain roads, and coal miners injured on the job. During their last days at work, the skeleton staff that remains at the hospital has tackled coronavirus, testing 35 people and treating two patients who came back positive. \"I'm always amazed at our population,\" said Beckett, who grew up in Williamson. \"We've had people that are coal mining families who have been through hard times, and they get through those by relying on each other.\"Despite its imminent shuttering, the importance of the hospital was highlighted last month when the National Guard inspected the facility as a possible overflow location to help with Covid-19 testing and treatment. The looming closure is devastating news for patients like Steele, who knows that she and her husband are at elevated risk from the coronavirus. Now, if they do get sick, they're going to have to drive across the state line to Kentucky or go to other hospitals that are at least 30 minutes away.\"We care about the people (at the hospital) and they care about us,\" Steele said, her voice breaking a little. \"We will do what we have to do, but we won't enjoy it.\" Hospital workers furloughed: 'This is uncharted water'Usually, Dr. John Tedesco would be performing surgeries. But with most operations put on hold during the pandemic, the cosmetic surgeon, who treats a lot of skin cancer, has hardly seen the inside of his operating room in McAlester, Oklahoma, for weeks.\"We've put those folks off for now, postponed them,\" Tedesco said of his skin cancer surgeries. \"It doesn't stop the cancer from growing. And it doesn't stop anxiety from building that you're left untreated.\"With surgeries on hold, Tedesco is seeing patients via telemedicine and doing administrative planning as the chief of staff at McAlester Regional Health Center to prepare the hospital for a return to some surgeries next week. And, hospital officials say, 352 employees in the hospital had their hours cut, while everyone else is facing a pay cut. That's the new normal in rural Oklahoma: Even health care employees who seem like they'd be the very definition of essential are seeing their work cut as hospitals struggle to stay solvent. The staff has never faced anything quite like the pandemic, said David Keith, the hospital's CEO, adding that more than a dozen surrounding counties depend on them. \"Within an hour's drive, there's no one else,\" Keith said. One reason why: Oklahoma, which has the nation's second-highest uninsured rate, is a hotspot for rural hospital closings, with seven shutting down since 2016. The state government's refusal so far to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act has likely made an impact -- multiple studies have found that states that didn't expand the program have seen more hospital closures.Oklahoma voters will decide in June on a ballot measure to expand Medicaid, while Gov. Kevin Stitt has proposed his own more limited plan for expansion.Meanwhile, the pandemic has made it even harder for already financially vulnerable rural hospitals to survive. Seventy miles east at Eastern Oklahoma Medical Center, a 25-bed hospital in the small city of Poteau, CEO Bob Carter has spent the last few weeks shutting down two sections of his facility that brought in money -- obstetrics and surgical departments. The hospital has furloughed 52 employees, while Carter, his administrative team, physicians and mid-level nurse practitioners agreed to take significant pay cuts. \"I think that speaks volume about life in a small community, in a small hospital,\" he said. \"It's about taking care of each other.\"Stitt, one of the few US governors who hasn't issued a sweeping statewide stay-at-home order, announced this month that his administration would allow elective surgeries to resume starting April 24, which some hospital leaders say will be a big help. Still, while Carter said he is confident eastern Oklahoma will come out of this, fears about the hospital's future -- and what it would mean for the community if it closed -- have kept him awake at night.\"This is uncharted water for every one of us,\" Carter said. Federal lifelines only go so farThe federal government threw struggling hospitals a lifeline last month -- but rural hospital leaders say more help is desperately needed.The relief package passed by Congress, known as the CARES Act, includes a $100 billion fund for hospitals and other health care providers to make up for coronavirus-related expenses or lost revenue. For some hospitals, the relief won't go very far. Eastern Oklahoma hospital received a $502,000 grant from the act -- which will last just two weeks, Carter said. The hospital received $1.75 million in advances on its Medicare payments, but Carter said he was worried to use it because the hospital had to begin repaying that money in 120 days. Dr. Randy Tobler is an OB-GYN and CEO of Scotland County Hospital in the northern Missouri town of Memphis. It applied for and received advanced funding from Medicare which will help the struggling hospital cover expenses through at least May, though the funding must be repaid. In March, the hospital eliminated jobs and furloughed staff. All the clinicians took a pay cut, Tobler said.\"It makes me cry -- so many people have banded together,\" he said. \"It's like an Army platoon charging up the hill.\"The hospital has treated coronavirus patients like Danielle and Jake Bair, who tested positive after coming down with fevers and coughs late last month. They say their symptoms have since improved. Being able to talk to a doctor who was intimately familiar with her own history as a cancer survivor was a huge help during the ordeal, said Danielle. Without Scotland, she'd have to drive an hour or two to get to the nearest hospital. \"When I've had to go to the doctor in other [places,] I have to re-explain my case,\" Danielle said. \"But when I go to my local emergency room here, they already know me. Not only does my doctor know me, but he has talked with his colleagues about my case. I know that I'm immediately getting the right care.\"Shuttered hospitals leave holes in careAs more rural hospitals face the possibility of shutting down, communities trying to understand what that would mean can look to Marks, Mississippi, a town in the state's northwest, which lost its only hospital three and a half years ago. Quitman County Hospital served patients in what has long been one of the US's poorest counties -- Martin Luther King Jr. preached about children in Marks \"walking the streets with no shoes to wear\" during his last Sunday sermon before his assassination. Many of those who came to the hospital's emergency room had no insurance, and it couldn't stay in business, local officials said.Known locally as \"the Q,\" the single-floor hospital with about two dozen beds was a community institution and the county's largest employer, said Lonnie Moore, a nurse practitioner who worked at the hospital. When it closed in September 2016, \"it broke peoples' hearts,\" he said. Now the county only has a part-time clinic operating across the street from the vacant hospital, with three doctors and several nurse practitioners splitting their work between three neighboring counties, said Moore, who works at the clinic. The nearest hospital still open is about a 20-minute drive from Marks. Paul Hester, who's worked for the county ambulance service since 1972, said one person from Quitman County has died in an ambulance while on the way to a neighboring county since 2016 -- and there have been other close calls. \"Twenty minutes, compared to five minutes, makes a big difference,\" Hester said. Having a 24-hour emergency room in the county would \"help tremendously,\" he said.Quitman County only has 13 confirmed coronavirus cases so far -- but that puts it in the top 11% of counties in the US by number of cases per capita, according to a CNN analysis of case data from Johns Hopkins University. While the local clinic is providing some testing and treatment to people who test positive, patients who need to be hospitalized are being sent to neighboring counties. \"It's very, very scary and nerve-wracking to be facing this without a hospital,\" said Velma Wilson, the county administrator. \"The numbers are going up, so if we do become a hotspot, managing Covid-19 would be a major concern for this area.\"Mary Williams, a nurse practitioner who started her career at the now-shuttered Quitman hospital, has two family members in the county who tested positive for Covid-19 and had to be driven long distances to get urgent care. One of her relatives had to be transferred to a hospital more than an hour away to be put on a ventilator for more than a week, Williams said. Another of her relatives spent time at the Veterans Affairs hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, before being released.If the Quitman hospital was still in business, Williams said she thought both of her family members would be in better situations. \"If the hospital's just down the street, you're going to go there if you're feeling bad,\" Williams said. \"If you know the hospital is miles away, you're going to wait until you can't take it anymore.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)At least five sailors who had returned to the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier have tested positive for coronavirus despite extensive efforts by the US Navy to prevent another outbreak on the ship, according to a US defense official.\n\nMore than 1,000 members of the ship's nearly 4,900 member crew had tested positive following the outbreak aboard the ship in March.The Navy had instituted several screening procedures to enable those who had recovered to return to the ship following two negative tests.The official said that one of the sailors suddenly started experiencing symptoms when they returned and the other four that tested positive had been in close proximity to that sailor.The new cases were first reported by The New York Times.Read MoreAn additional 18 sailors who were also in close proximity to those who tested positive have also been taken off the ship out of \"an abundance of caution,\" the official said.The official said the initial suggestion is the new cases may be the result of a testing issue rather than a renewed outbreak.After evacuating some 4,000 sailors from the ship to Guam, the Navy had been returning sailors to the Roosevelt following a period of quarantine and isolation in the hopes of getting the aircraft carrier to sea as soon as possible.Inquiry in progressThe outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier triggered a chain of events that led to the firing of the ship's commanding officer, and the resignation of the acting Navy secretary.Last month the Navy announced that it was launching a broader inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the outbreak, effectively delaying its initial recommendation that the ship's commanding officer be reinstated.The announcement came days after Secretary of Defense Mark Esper declined to immediately endorse the Navy's original investigation into the issue, which included a recommendation to reinstate Capt. Brett Crozier.US officials told CNN that senior Navy officials had recommended that Crozier be reinstated but Esper was not prepared to immediately endorse that recommendation and the wider inquiry was launched the following week.Crozier was fired for what then-acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said was poor judgment for too widely disseminating a warning among Navy officials about the spread of the virus aboard his vessel, a warning that eventually made its way into the press.While Modly publicly accused Crozier of sending his letter of warning to 20 to 30 people, the email to which the letter was attached shows that Crozier sent it to 10 people including his direct superior, according to a copy of the email obtained by The Washington Post.\"I believe if there is ever a time to ask for help it is now regardless of the impact on my career,\" Crozier wrote in his email, the contents of which a US official directly familiar with the message confirmed to CNN.Modly resigned days later over his handling of the incident, actions which included a $240,000 trip to Guam where he slammed Crozier and admonished sailors for giving Crozier a rousing send off in public remarks to the crew.This story has been updated with additional background.",

        "body": "Dr. Tanya Altmann is a pediatrician, spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, school physician at Viewpoint School in Southern California and mom of three school-age boys.\n\n(CNN)Because Covid-19 scientific and medical information changes frequently, our nation is going to need adaptable guidelines to safely ring the school bell this fall.\n\nAs I see it, we need to solve three problems. First, we need strategies to keep this particular coronavirus from entering campuses nationwide. Second, we need measures to decrease person-to-person transmission. Third, we need to quickly test, diagnose, isolate and contact trace when needed. Although school districts will be looking to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) guidelines released today and earlier guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, different considerations must be made for each school in collaboration with local and state public health departments on when it is safe to reopen and bring children back on campuses across the country. It's important for parents to know that child health is a priority, and that is why the AAP continues to emphasize the importance of school physicals including any needed vaccines for your child prior to the first day of school to help prevent an outbreak of other preventable infectious disease such as pertussis (whooping cough) or measles.Read MoreKids and parents know that most viruses, including this new coronavirus, spread mainly person-to-person when in close contact. When an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks, microscopic respiratory droplets are produced and can land in the mouths or noses of those nearby -- or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. These invisible virus particles also land on surfaces, and if touched by another person who then touches the eyes, nose, or mouth, can cause infection. As we know, not everyone with Covid-19 has symptoms, so the virus can even be spread asymptomatically.How to keep an invisible virus out of schoolHow do you keep an invisible virus from entering a schoolyard or classroom? Creating a school environment that supports social distancing will help -- staggering start times, staggering academic days, limiting volunteers and visitors on campus. Screening is also necessary -- every morning by a parent at home or upon arrival, with questionnaires, temperature checks, or even Covid-19 surveillance testing.Once students are on campus, we decrease transmission by \"de-densifying,\" limiting activities where large groups of students are in close proximity. Ideally, students will be grouped into smaller classes, remain in the same desk or room as much as possible, and teachers or specialists will rotate class to class to minimize movement of students around campus. Virtual assemblies and library timeAssemblies and even library time can be virtual. Librarians can read a virtual book and show students options that can be delivered to class for students to take home and read. Lunches will be eaten in class or with social distancing, and playground structures may close, with an emphasis on non-touch sports and recess. Kids can still run and kick a soccer ball with their own class, but recess time may be staggered between classes to limit the number of students on the school yard. Schools may also limit the items kids can touch, such playground equipment (or thoroughly clean equipment between each class).This will be a \"new normal\" school day, and it will take some time for students, teachers and families to adapt. But kids are resilient, and they will still learn and socialize in as safe as an environment as possible. And it's important to note that this isn't forever.Of course, hygiene measures such as frequent handwashing breaks prior to entering class, before lunch, after using bathroom and upon exiting classrooms will be key. Schools may plan for one-way traffic flow through campus as needed. Schools will need to be cleaned or defogged every evening and all surfaces disinfected thoroughly and frequently.Will students wear masks?Then there is the great mask debate, as masks do play an important role in decreasing transmission of the virus, especially since Covid-19 can be acquired through asymptomatic transmission. Having young elementary school kids wear masks though can pose its own issues as young kids tend to touch their face more when they wear masks and lack skills to properly put masks on and take off. For middle school and high school students, teachers and school staff, wearing face masks will play an important role in decreasing transmission. In the younger grades, educators can be masked to protect the student and themselves.There may be a way to educate younger elementary students on proper mask wearing, but for preschool and kindergarten, I'm not sure it's feasible. We will need to rely on frequent hand washing, social distancing and the usual education on covering coughs and sneezes for the youngest students.Despite these best practices, at some point, somebody will get Covid-19. How we test, diagnose, isolate and contact trace will be critical to decrease transmission of infection to others. Isolating Covid-19 patientsSchools may need an isolation room where a child can wait for parent pick up. School nurses and administrators whose role it is to have contact with such students should be provided appropriate personal protective equipment. Similar to pertussis and other infectious disease outbreaks, schools will need protocols in place when sick kids, or those with mild cough and runny nose as many students have all winter, can return to school. Such guidelines may include a negative Covid-19 test, 3 days without fever and other specific symptoms before returning to school. When a student is identified as having Covid-19, measures will be in place, similar to lice notes sent home letting parents know that a child may have been exposed. And at what point is an entire class quarantined, an entire grade, or the entire school? If classes are truly kept separate from other classes, this will decrease the need to send home entire grades or close an entire school.Children will need access to online learningWhen kids are sent home to quarantine -- or for vulnerable children whose parents don't feel comfortable sending them to school -- virtual or on-line school options will need to be available so teachers and schools may be taxed with running in person and on-line school simultaneously.Schools will need to work with local pediatricians and health clinics to help quickly evaluate and test children when needed. In addition, school families and students can help by sewing masks or even produce 3D printing face shields. Local public health departments will also play an important role in helping schools test, isolate and contact trace to keep Covid-19 cases at a minimum and prevent outbreaks.Of course, options will vary from school to school based on the number of students, size of the campus and flexibility of families to adapt to new schedules and routines. Sadly, Covid-19 and the resulting education gap will afflict schools disproportionately in dense urban centers with socioeconomic disparity. This is where creativity and innovation come into play. Teachers, administrators and even older students are very good at problem solving such issues, and I look forward to seeing what they have to say and how they continue to solve the problem at hand -- to keep kids healthy, safe and learning.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)A US Navy destroyer performing a counter narcotics mission has been hit by an outbreak of at least 18 coronavirus cases, a US Navy official tells CNN.\n\nThe USS Kidd is the second ship to be impacted by a major outbreak of the virus while at sea following the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt.The Pentagon later confirmed that there has been an outbreak on the ship, with more than one sailor testing positive out of a crew of around 330. The ship is assigned to the recently enhanced counter narcotics mission in the Caribbean/Eastern Pacific aimed at countering illicit drug trafficking.The first sailor that tested positive was medevac'd off the ship when he displayed symptoms, according to Pentagon spokesperson Jonathan Hoffman, and tested positive at a medical treatment facility in San Antonio. \"The Sailor is stable and receiving care at a medical treatment facility in San Antonio, Texas,\" the Navy said in a statement Friday.Read MoreThere have since been other sailors on the ship who have tested positive and the Navy statement added that \"testing continues, and we expect additional cases.\"\"They are preparing to return to port, where they will undertake efforts to clean the ship. They will remove a portion of the crew from the ship. And work to get everybody back to health and get the ship back to sea,\" said Hoffman.An eight member Navy medical team has flown out to the ship and is conducting contact tracing and isolating individuals who may have been exposed, according to Hoffman.News of the outbreak aboard the USS Kidd comes as the number of cases aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt continues to increase.The Navy said Thursday that 840 sailors from the ship have tested positive for coronavirus and 100% of the crew has been tested. Four sailors are being treated for coronavirus symptoms in US Naval Hospital Guam.More than 4,000 members of the crew have been moved ashore to Guam. The handing of the outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier which led to the firing of the ship's commanding officer, Capt. Brett Crozier and the resignation of the acting Navy Secretary, has been the subject of a Navy investigation, the results of which are due to be briefed to Defense Secretary Mark Esper later on Friday.\"Later today Secretary Esper will meet with the Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Gilday to discuss the results of the vice chief of naval operations Admiral Burke's investigation into the circumstances surrounding the covid outbreak on the Teddy Roosevelt,\" Hoffman said.He added that Esper \"is going into this with an open mind and he is generally inclined to support navy leadership and their decisions but he will go into it with an open mind.\"On Wednesday a senior Navy official told CNN there were coronavirus cases on 26 US Navy warships, and another 14 have been hit by the virus but the crew members impacted have recovered.",

Lamar Alexander of Tennessee will self-quarantine for 14 days after a staffer in his office tested positive for the novel coronavirus, his office announced Sunday evening.\n\nAlexander's chief of staff David Cleary said in a statement that the Republican senator tested negative for the virus on May 7 and hasn't shown any symptoms, but \"out of an abundance of caution, has decided not to return to Washington, DC, and will self-quarantine in Tennessee for 14 days.\"\"Almost all of the senator's Washington, DC, staff are working from home, and there is no need for any other staff member to self-quarantine,\" Cleary said, noting that the staffer who tested positive is \"recovering at home and is doing well.\"Alexander, the GOP chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, will still chair the committee's hearing on Tuesday by video conference, the statement said.

Read MoreThe hearing was already going to feature remote testimony from Dr. Robert Redfield, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, both of whom are self-quarantining following potential exposures to the virus last week.The other two witnesses -- Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services -- had been planning to appear in person but will now do so remotely.That shift comes after Fauci told CNN's Jake Tapper on Saturday that he would begin a \"modified quarantine\" after a potential exposure to the virus.\"After consulting with Dr. Fauci, and in an abundance of caution for our witnesses, senators, and the staff, all four Administration witnesses will appear by videoconference due to these unusual circumstances,\" Alexander said in a statement earlier Sunday. He said he consulted with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Saturday about making a change to administration policies. The administration had previously opposed having its officials testify remotely.The upcoming hearing will give senators on the panel a chance to hear \"about what federal, state and local governments are doing to help Americans go back to work and back to school as rapidly and safely as possible,\" according to a release from the committee.\n\nCNN's Manu Raju, Dana Bash, Nicky Robertson, Devan Cole and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(Kaiser Health News)Older adults with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, have several \"atypical\" symptoms, complicating efforts to ensure they get timely and appropriate treatment, according to physicians.\n\nCovid-19 is typically signaled by three symptoms: a fever, an insistent cough and shortness of breath. But older adults -- the age group most at risk of severe complications or death from this condition -- may have none of these characteristics.Instead, seniors may seem \"off\" -- not acting like themselves -- early on after being infected by the coronavirus. They may sleep more than usual or stop eating. They may seem unusually apathetic or confused, losing orientation to their surroundings. They may become dizzy and fall. Sometimes, seniors stop speaking or simply collapse.\"With a lot of conditions, older adults don't present in a typical way, and we're seeing that with Covid-19 as well,\" said Dr. Camille Vaughan, section chief of geriatrics and gerontology at Emory University.Altered immune responseRead MoreThe reason has to do with how older bodies respond to illness and infection.At advanced ages, \"someone's immune response may be blunted and their ability to regulate temperature may be altered,\" said Dr. Joseph Ouslander, a professor of geriatric medicine at Florida Atlantic University's Schmidt College of Medicine.\"Underlying chronic illnesses can mask or interfere with signs of infection,\" he said. \"Some older people, whether from age-related changes or previous neurologic issues such as a stroke, may have altered cough reflexes. Others with cognitive impairment may not be able to communicate their symptoms.\"Read early signalsRecognizing danger signs is important: If early symptoms of Covid-19 are missed, seniors may deteriorate before getting needed care. And people may go in and out of their homes without adequate protective measures, risking the spread of infection.Dr. Quratulain Syed, an Atlanta geriatrician, describes a man in his 80s who she treated in mid-March. Over a period of days, this patient, who had heart disease, diabetes and moderate cognitive impairment, stopped walking and became incontinent and profoundly lethargic. But he didn't have a fever or a cough. His only respiratory symptom: sneezing off and on.The man's elderly spouse called 911 twice. Both times, paramedics checked his vital signs and declared he was OK. After another worried call from the overwhelmed spouse, Syed insisted the patient be taken to the hospital, where he tested positive for Covid-19.\"I was quite concerned about the paramedics and health aides who'd been in the house and who hadn't used PPE [personal protective equipment],\" Syed said.Anecdotal case reportingDr. Sam Torbati, medical director of the Ruth and Harry Roman Emergency Department at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, describes treating seniors who initially appear to be trauma patients but are found to have Covid-19.\"They get weak and dehydrated,\" he said, \"and when they stand to walk, they collapse and injure themselves badly.\"Torbati has seen older adults who are profoundly disoriented and unable to speak and who appear at first to have suffered strokes.\"When we test them, we discover that what's producing these changes is a central nervous system effect of coronavirus,\" he said.Dr. Laura Perry, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, saw a patient like this several weeks ago. The woman, in her 80s, had what seemed to be a cold before becoming very confused. In the hospital, she couldn't identify where she was or stay awake during an examination. Perry diagnosed hypoactive delirium, an altered mental state in which people become inactive and drowsy. The patient tested positive for coronavirus and is still in the ICU.Dr. Anthony Perry, an associate professor of geriatric medicine at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago, tells of an 81-year-old woman with nausea, vomiting and diarrhea who tested positive for Covid-19 in the emergency room. After receiving IV fluids, oxygen and medication for her intestinal upset, she returned home after two days and is doing well.Another 80-year-old Rush patient with similar symptoms -- nausea and vomiting, but no cough, fever or shortness of breath -- is in intensive care after getting a positive Covid-19 test and due to be put on a ventilator. The difference? This patient is frail with \"a lot of cardiovascular disease,\" Perry said. Other than that, it's not yet clear why some older patients do well while others do not.Data collection of atypical symptomsSo far, reports of cases like these have been anecdotal. But a few physicians are trying to gather more systematic information.In Switzerland, Dr. Sylvain Nguyen, a geriatrician at the University of Lausanne Hospital Center, has put together a list of typical and atypical symptoms in older Covid-19 patients in a forthcoming paper in the Revue M\u00e9dicale Suisse. Included on the atypical list are changes in a patient's usual status, delirium, falls, fatigue, lethargy, low blood pressure, painful swallowing, fainting, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and the loss of smell and taste.Data comes from hospitals and nursing homes in Switzerland, Italy and France, Nguyen said in an email.On the front lines, physicians need to make sure they carefully assess an older patient's symptoms.Other complicating factors\"While we have to have a high suspicion of Covid-19 because it's so dangerous in the older population, there are many other things to consider,\" said Dr. Kathleen Unroe, a geriatrician at Indiana University's School of Medicine.Seniors may also do poorly because their routines have changed. In nursing homes and most assisted living centers, activities have stopped and \"residents are going to get weaker and more deconditioned because they're not walking to and from the dining hall,\" she said.At home, isolated seniors may not be getting as much help with medication management or other essential needs from family members who are keeping their distance, other experts suggested. Or they may have become apathetic or depressed.\"I'd want to know 'What's the potential this person has had an exposure [to the coronavirus], especially in the last two weeks?'\" said Vaughan of Emory. \"Do they have home health personnel coming in? Have they gotten together with other family members? Are chronic conditions being controlled? Is there another diagnosis that seems more likely?\"\"Someone may be just having a bad day. But if they're not themselves for a couple of days, absolutely reach out to a primary care doctor or a local health system hotline to see if they meet the threshold for [coronavirus] testing,\" Vaughan advised. \"Be persistent. If you get a 'no' the first time and things aren't improving, call back and ask again.\"\n\nKaiser Health News (KHN) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Leah Blomberg's voice is still raspy from having a tube stuck down her throat for nine days.\n\nHer muscles are so weak, it takes her 45 minutes to take a quick shower.Now, as she struggles to recover from coronavirus, she wants protesters to stop \"crying and complaining\" about shelter-in-place orders, like the one in her state of Wisconsin that just got extended until May 26.\"I spent 9 days in a medically induced coma, on a ventilator due to this virus. I spent another 9 days in the ICU having horrible hallucinations from the meds,\" Blomberg posted on Facebook.\"I basically had to learn how to walk again due to muscle atrophy from being 100% bedridden for 2 weeks. I'M LUCKY TO BE ALIVE,\" the post continued. \"Stay in your house. Take the money they government is giving you. ... Stop complaining and be thankful for your health. Thank you Governor Evers for caring more about our HEALTH than our WEALTH.\"Read MoreHer post garnered praise and criticism as hundreds of protesters across the country demanded governors end stay-at-home orders and reopen all businesses. Blomberg said she empathizes with protesters who are struggling financially -- she, too, lost her job as a real estate receptionist during this pandemic. But she echoed health officials who said the country isn't ready to reopen because this outbreak is not yet under control. As of Tuesday, more than 788,900 people have been infected in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 42,400 have died in the past two months. Blomberg said the protesters' demands are shortsighted because the virus is still spreading unabated.\"If you're in a hospital bed, you're not making any money anyway. In fact, you're putting yourself in further debt,\" Blomberg told CNN.\"If you're dead, it doesn't matter anyway -- you're not going to be able to provide for your family. You're going to have your medical bills, your funeral costs, you're going to be leaving that for them on top of it all.\" 'People don't understand how easily this spreads'Like many millennials, Blomberg said she didn't think she'd suffer severe complications from coronavirus. She started feeling flu-like symptoms on March 19. \"I just felt like I got hit by a truck,\" Blomberg said \"All the energy was gone, and literally everything in my body ached.\"Then she lost her senses of taste and smell, symptoms that are common with Covid-19.\"It wasn't until the 24th when I didn't have the energy to make it to the bathroom in time -- when finally said to my husband, 'Take me to the ER,'\" Blomberg said. \"They immediately called an ambulance to take me to a hospital that was accepting Covid patients. And when I got there, they said, 'You're not getting enough oxygen. We're going to have to intubate you.' So I was put in a medically induced coma and put on a ventilator.\"She tested positive for coronavirus but still has \"absolutely no idea\" how she got infected. \"We didn't have anybody in our close circle that has gotten sick or died from this,\" Blomberg said. \"I didn't know I was at risk. I'm 35. I have no underlying medical conditions that would have compromised my immunity.\" But since sharing her story on Facebook, she's received a torrent of messages from others who were suddenly impacted by Covid-19.\"I've gotten messages from people in Texas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Florida, Pennsylvania,\" Blomberg said. \"A lot of these people reaching out either have been through what I've been through, or have a family member going through it. And people don't understand how easily this spreads.\" Q&A: Why worry about coronavirus when the flu also kills many Americans?Struggling to walk againBlomberg's nine days in a coma led to muscle atrophy -- the wasting or loss of muscle tissue. \"The recovery is probably the worst,\" she said. \"Basically it's having to learn to walk again, because your muscles .... it's like you've never used them before.\"What used to be a 15-minute shower \"is now 45 minutes ... and that's trying to do everything as quickly as possible,\" she said. Her physical anguish is now compounded by the financial pain of hospital bills. She's only received a portion of her medical bills, but owes $11,000 so far.Blomberg laughed when she thought about how quickly her life has changed in the past few weeks.\"Not only do I not have a job, but now I don't have this money\" for medical bills, she said.A message for the protestersBlomberg hopes sharing her ordeal will prevent others from suffering. And that means encouraging protesters to stay home and obey shelter-in-place orders. \"A lot of those people will not understand until it happens to them or someone they love. And it's really sad,\" Blomberg said.\"If you think things are tight now, if you get sick and get to the hospital, these 5-digit bills, 6-digit bills -- it's going to be even worse.\"\n\nInteractive: A guide to helping and getting help during the coronavirus crisis\n\nShe's not just concerned for the protesters, but also for everyone else they could infect through asymptomatic spread. That includes health care workers, some of whom have died from Covid-19. \"That's a slap in the face: 'Oh yes, thank you to all these workers taking care of the sick ... and oh, by the way, you have Covid now.'\" Blomberg said.\"There are hospital workers who have been put on ventilators and haven't made it. I pray I haven't infected any of the people who took such great care of me.\"Why are medical workers getting sick with or dying from coronavirus? Like many Covid-19 patients, Blomberg said the hospital she was treated in was frantically busy. \"I was next to the nurses' station, and I constantly heard their alarms going off to go to patients' rooms,\" she said. \"If we were to open up right now, (hospitals) would definitely be overwhelmed.\" When she sees protesters wanting to reopen the country right now, \"all I can do is just shake my head,\" Blomberg said. \"We have to wait for the medical community to say it's OK. They're the ones who know what's going on. They're the ones who know, who have the facts, who have all the data. They're the ones who we ultimately should be listening to.\"In the meantime, Blomberg wants everyone to know \"this could happen to anyone.\" \"It's so frustrating -- to know how severe and how awful this is, and you still get people saying, 'It's a hoax. There's no one in hospitals. There's no one dying.' Open your eyes,\" she said. \"There are plenty, plenty of people in hospitals, (and) too many people dying.\"",

        "body": "Leah Blomberg and Marco Paolone both called an ambulance when their coronavirus symptoms worsened. Both spent time in intensive care, both were unconscious for days, and both were on a ventilator.\n\nThey were lucky -- they survived a disease which has so far killed more than 230,000 people around the world. But while Blomberg, an American, walked away with medical bills totaling several thousands of dollars, Paolone's treatment was free. In his home country of Italy, cost isn't something coronavirus patients need to worry about.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic is exposing the deep divide between how health care is approached in the US and in Europe. In Italy, like on much of the continent, the system is publicly funded and almost entirely free for anyone who needs it. Meanwhile the United States is the only developed nation without universal health care.\n\n\"People do not avoid health care because of cost in Europe,\" said Reggie D. Williams II, an international health policy expert at the US-based Commonwealth Fund. \"Americans unfortunately face a dual burden of worrying about access to care ... and then affordability.\"\n\nHealth systems everywhere are being stretched by the pandemic. Hundreds of thousands of people around the world suddenly need the same treatment. The problems are similar across the board: inadequate testing capacity, high demand for hospital beds, lack of ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE) and medical staff.\n\nHealth experts say it's too early to pass final judgments on which countries did well and which failed because the pandemic is far from over. But there are lessons to be learned already.\n\nRifat Atun, a professor of Global Health Systems at Harvard University in the US, said the evidence so far suggests that more centralized, publicly funded systems with universal coverage and a solid chain of command and control have been weathering the crisis better. They've been able to scale up testing faster, coordinate the response, pool resources and reduce death rates.\n\n\"The chain is as strong as the weakest link,\" he said. \"In the US, there isn't any one health system per se, but multiple systems in each state, and within each state there are different subsystems, so it has been very difficult to have a clever, coordinated response -- and that has implications because, you know, viruses don't recognize borders from one state to another.\"\n\nOne place, however where the US stands apart from other countries is in how much the pandemic is costing the people infected by the virus.\n\nPaolone, who is 56 and lives in Monte Silvano in central eastern Italy, called an ambulance last month after experiencing persistent chest pain. He was sent to an emergency room and later diagnosed with Covid-19 -- something he did not expect. He found himself in an isolation unit with nurses wrapped head to toe in protective gear that reminded him of spacesuits checking on him through a glass window.\n\n\"I had an oxygen mask, but I couldn't breathe ... there was a bell next to my bed and I rang the bell,\" he said. He woke up six days later, in a different hospital. \"The doctors and nurses applauded when I woke up and they told me I was brought [in] by a helicopter.\"\n\nBlomberg's Covid-19 journey sounds worryingly similar. Days of fatigue and pain, a decision to call an ambulance, a medically induced coma and a ventilator.\n\nBoth Paolone and Blomberg have a long recovery ahead of them. But unlike Blomberg, Paolone doesn't have to worry about the cost of the treatment that saved his life. \"I didn't pay for anything. Not a cent,\" he said. He doesn't have private health insurance and is currently unemployed, but that doesn't affect his access to health care. The Italian system is funded through taxes; primary and inpatient care are free at the point of use for all citizens and permanent residents.\n\nBlomberg, 35, lives in Muskego, Wisconsin. She has lost her job during the pandemic, but has medical insurance through her husband's employer -- unlike the 28 million Americans who, according to the US Census Bureau, were uninsured in 2018. But even with the insurance, the bill she is facing for her Covid-19 treatment is eye-watering.\n\n\"The ambulance ride was two grand on its own,\" she said.\n\nBlomberg has so far received bills covering only some of her treatment and prescriptions. \"They were only for the doctors' visits for the first few days I was at the hospital and each doctor visit cost me between $300 [and] $400.\"\n\nUnited Healthcare, Blomberg's insurer, told CNN it was waiving cost-sharing for Covid-19 treatments for its members in Medicare, Medicaid, individual market and certain employer-sponsored health insurance plans. But others who have United Healthcare policies through their jobs may have to pay for their care.\n\nBlomberg hasn't received any indication that her charges would be waived.\n\nShe was too sick to care about the cost of her treatment when calling the ambulance. \"My concern was staying alive, it wasn't the bills,\" she said. \"I can take the rest of my life paying that back.\"\n\nBut study after study shows money is a major consideration for many Americans.\n\nAccording to the Commonwealth Fund, even before the Covid-19 crisis, one in three adults in the US skipped medical care because of the cost, compared to one in 10 in the UK, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden. When the foundation surveyed people in the US about the coronavirus, two-thirds said cost would be a very important factor in their decision to get care if they had symptoms.\n\nEven those who have health insurance may not seek care that quickly, largely because they may face hefty deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for doctors' visits, emergency room trips and treatment. The roughly 153 million Americans who have coverage through their jobs have to shell out about $1,655 a year, on average, before their coverage kicks in, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\n\"I'm sure cost has been a deterrent to many people accessing services ... and in fact, if we look at the US, a large majority of those who are dying are those from underprivileged groups,\" Atun said. \"This suggests to me that those individuals are typically not accessing services, probably delaying their decisions and presenting late.\"\n\nThis is a dangerous approach, particularly when dealing with a highly contagious virus. \"It makes it very difficult to mitigate and control the pandemic ... if people don't go and have a test, we don't know whether they are infected and that has implications on policy,\" said Liina-Kaisa Tynkkynen, an assistant professor of Health Sciences at Tampere University in Finland.\n\nSince the outbreak began, many major health insurers in the US have said they will waive out-of-pocket costs for many of their policyholders for coronavirus care in hospitals. And the Trump administration said it will reimburse hospitals for treating uninsured coronavirus patients and is requiring hospitals that receive federal aid not to bill patients at higher rates if the hospital or doctors are not in their insurers' network. Blomberg said that decision leaves people like her wondering whether they would have been better off uninsured.\n\nThe US also has other health care flaws that could make it harder to combat the virus. It has fewer practicing physicians per 1,000 people than many developed countries, and it lags behind other wealthy nations in hospitals per million people and hospital beds per capita, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nOn top of that, health insurance is often tied to Americans' employment status -- which means that some of the 26.5 million people who have filed for unemployment because of this pandemic are also at risk of losing their coverage.\n\n\"The crisis underscores the value of having a universal public health system as well as a wider social security system,\" Tynkkynen said. \"When this sort of crisis happens, it doesn't only affect people's health but also their social well-being, their employment, their economic situation,\" she added.\n\nThe system isn't starved for money. The US spends nearly 17% of its GDP on health care, roughly twice the average among other developed nations. Yet despite all that money, the US is trailing behind other countries in performance. The Commonwealth Fund has been comparing health care systems in high-income countries for two decades, looking at quality of care, access, administrative efficiency, equity and health outcomes and healthy lives. According to the fund's Roosa Tikkanen, the US has come last overall in every single one of the fund's comparison reports.\n\nFor many experts, the pandemic lays bare all the reasons for major health reform in the US.\n\n\"There is a lot of resources within the health care system in the United States that can be channeled to achieving the goal of universal coverage,\" Williams said. \"Yes, there are the political barriers. Yes, there are barriers around taxation and trusting government, but I think this pandemic has shown that a lack of universal coverage really allows many people to fall in between the cracks.\"\n\nBlomberg said she would prefer a universal coverage system to her private health insurance. \"I think it would be much, much better for everybody,\" she said, quickly adding that she is pretty certain the system won't change any time soon. \"I don't see universal health care being an actual option right now,\" she said.\n\n\"Part of the problem is, you know, the people making these decisions, they don't have to worry about it. Because they are completely covered under government jobs. They're making a ridiculous amount of money. And if people aren't affected by something, then it's not going to change their opinions on things,\" she said.",

At the time, she didn't believe the virus was affecting pregnant women as much, she said, and thought she would face flu-like symptoms. She decided to ride it out in self-quarantine.But then she began having respiratory issues.\"That's when I just couldn't take it anymore,\" Chancay told CNN.Read MoreAlmost immediately after arriving at a Connecticut hospital, she was told she would have to be put into a coma and have an emergency C-section to deliver her baby early, she said.\"It was told to me right away and that's when I called my family and told them 'hey, I'm going under,'\" she said. \"And that's the last time they heard from me.\"When she woke up, it was April 1 and she had a one-pound baby named Zion, born 14 weeks early.But instead of holding her in her arms, Chancay met her daughter for the first time from a webcam.

        "body": "New York (CNN Business)Sheryl Sandberg didn't make a habit of celebrating her birthday until her husband Dave Goldberg died in 2015. Now, she's grateful to celebrate every year.\n\nIt's the kind of \"post-traumatic growth\" she's encouraging people to tap into now as they grapple with loss and hardship caused by coronavirus, the Facebook (FB) COO told CNN's Poppy Harlow in an interview Monday. In addition to her role at Facebook, Sandberg is the author of \"Option B,\" a book she wrote in 2017 with psychologist and Wharton School professor Adam Grant about grieving and building resilience in the face of trauma. \"Resilience is not a thing we get a little bit of when we're born. Resilience is a muscle and we build it,\" Sandberg said. \"We build it in ourselves, and we build it in each other. It's about how quickly we recover and rebound from the worst events of life. And right now, everyone's living in Option B.\"Sandberg said she and Grant are releasing a portion of the book for free in an effort to help people cope with the pandemic. She told Harlow that her family is grappling with their own coronavirus-related loss: the death of her fiance's cousin. Sandberg got engaged to Kelton Global CEO Tom Bernthal in February. Read More\"We're like so many other families where we're mourning the loss of someone who was so important in his whole life, so important to the whole family, and not able to come together and have a funeral,\" Sandberg said. She urged people who know someone facing death or loss to reach out -- and keep reaching out. \"One of the things that happens when people face loss is they then face a lot of silence from other people. People call the first week ... but then after that they don't know what to say,\" Sandberg said. \"Remembering to call and reach out not just day one but day five and year five, is a really important part of this.\"Sandberg said it's also important for communities to build \"collective resilience,\" encouraging people to support one another despite coronavirus keeping people physically apart. She referenced an example of collective resilience from a Facebook user: a woman who has asthma and a newborn baby, but whose husband is an emergency room doctor treating coronavirus patients. The woman used Facebook to find a stranger to lend the family an RV for the husband to sleep in, and then the woman started a Facebook group to connect RV owners with healthcare workers. \"That is people helping other people, but also that story shows how communities come together and give a lot of people a lot of hope that they'll get through this crisis, which in turn builds that resilience muscle for everyone involved,\" she said. Sandberg also spoke about Facebook's efforts to contribute to that collective resilience, which include combating coronavirus misinformation on its platforms and a new partnership with Carnegie Mellon University that will gather data on the spread of coronavirus symptoms. The company also plans to provide $100 million in grants to small businesses struggling because of coronavirus, including $40 million in grants to American small businesses, many of which have had trouble accessing federal assistance. Facebook has also canceled all in-person employee gatherings of more than 50 people through June 2021. Sandberg added that the company told workers to expect not to return to the office until at least the end of May and possibly longer. She said Facebook is paying \"absolutely everyone,\" including contractors, part-time workers and employees whose jobs cannot be done from home, during the disruption.\"Every single one of us has a deep responsibility to do what they can,\" she said.",

        "body": "London (CNN)Moves by countries to reopen schools that were shut to prevent the spread of coronavirus could risk a second wave of infections, some studies suggest.\n\nMost cases of Covid-19 in children are mild, but studies suggest kids may play a major role in transmitting the virus to each other and to vulnerable adults -- and that keeping schools closed for longer may help stop the spread of the coronavirus.One study conducted in China and published in the journal Science last week suggested that keeping schools closed could reduce infections and delay the epidemic. Researchers from China, Boston and Italy performed contact surveys in Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected, and Shanghai, China's largest city. They estimated that removing all interactions normally seen in schools for children up to 14 years old would lead to a reduction in the average daily number of new cases of about 42%, while reducing children's interactions to those typically seen during vacation periods could reduce new cases by 64%.Read More\"Overall, school-based closure policies are not sufficient to entirely prevent a Covid-19 outbreak, but they can impact disease dynamics, and hence hospital surge capacity,\" said the researchers.The paper states that children ages 0-14 are about a third as likely to be infected with coronavirus as adults, but experts told CNN that the research does not have sufficient data to be reliable.Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the paper is based on contact tracing and self-reported symptoms, so it does not record asymptomatic infections. It also only looks at specific locations in China, where there could be other factors that affect transmission, he said.A study from Shenzen, in southeastern China, published in the Lancet journal in April found that children had the same risk of contracting the coronavirus as the rest of the population but rarely developed severe symptoms. Another study posted on the German Research network Zoonotic Infectious Diseases in April suggested that children were less likely to be severely affected by Covid-19, but did not show whether their chances of being infected were lower. Experts told CNN the paper had not been peer reviewed and there were methodological issues that affected being able to make conclusions.Despite reservations on the available data, Clarke agreed that countries should be cautious in reopening schools.\"None of this stuff is definitive, but it's building up a picture,\" said Clarke. \"At this stage, when we just don't know enough about the susceptibility of children to picking up the virus and transmitting it, then we should err on the side of caution.\"Countries including China, Taiwan, Denmark and Israel have reopened schools and others are considering doing the same. The UK is reportedly weighing up reopening schools for younger children on June 1.Clarke said of the UK: \"I think it is too early at this stage to reopen schools.\"\"It could be a driver for a second wave. Everything we do, to some extent, lifting restrictions, will put upward pressure on the R rate, on the R number [the reproduction rate, which shows how many people each infected person will transmit the disease to on average]. So, you know, it's just a case of picking those which put the least upward pressure on the R number.\"Any opportunity for people to mix will put upward pressure on that.\"He added that since we know children can spread flu, \"it is not unreasonable to suspect\" that they may be able to spread the coronavirus.Clarke noted that the Science study only looked at social distancing rather than the effects of measures such as decontamination, which are being employed in many of the schools where children are returning to work.In Denmark, for example, classrooms were given deep cleans, desks were placed well apart and children were taught outside where possible when younger students returned on April 15 after a month of closure.Dr. Tom Wingfield, Senior Clinical Lecturer and Honorary Consultant Physician at Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine, told CNN that there were many different ways to reopen schools, including partial reopening for certain age groups and staggered hours. \"I just don't think there's evidence to help us say whether one of those things is better than the other. But I think I think the evidence across the board does show that school closures will reduce transmission, alongside a raft of other other social distancing interventions,\" he said.He said it was also important to think about how children interact -- \"what the family units look like, how many vulnerable people are within those family units, and that I imagine will change slightly from country to country in terms of intergenerational households and especially for example, amongst certain ethnic minority groups.\"Clarke warned that when schools closed for the summer during the swine flu epidemic in 2009, \"normal cases dropped like a stone, and then went racing back up again in sort of mid-September.\"\"It takes a few weeks for these things to get going,\" he added.Case numbers are falling in many countries after social distancing and school closures were implemented. Now that it appears governments may be able to safely relax some restrictions, many are eager to get students back to school, particularly young children, to allow their parents to return to work.But as long as we still don't know how infectious children really are, leaders will need to be vigilant to make sure that a return to the classroom doesn't mean a return to the worst levels of the pandemic.",

        "body": "(CNN)Enforced lockdowns. Isolation from friends and loved ones. Loss of job, income, economic stability.\n\nGrief and loss on so many levels -- from missing milestones such as birthdays and graduations to severe illness and death. Difficult times made worse by the fear of an invisible, deadly enemy who strikes via the very air we breathe.Such is the anxiety-ridden reality of living in the age of coronavirus for many people around the world. While some of us may be coping well right now, experts worry our emotional resilience will begin to fray as the threat of Covid-19 drags on.\"We're living constantly with a level of fear, a heightened state of arousal, much like Vietnam vets and Iraqi vets live with every day,\" said trauma counselor Jane Webber, a professor of counselor education at Kean University in New Jersey.Read More\"And our sympathetic nervous system can only stay in that overwhelmed, almost frenetic state for so long before we crash,\" said Webber, who counseled survivors and families during 9/11's tragic aftermath.\"I call it 'chronic threat response' -- the continued state of being in a hyper-aroused survival mode,\" said trauma psychologist Shauna Springer, who has spent a decade working with military veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, also known as PTSD.\"Chronic threat response is an escalation of many of the same symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress -- sleep problems, floods of anxiety, irritability, difficulties concentrating and a hair-trigger startle response,\" Springer said.What are some of the signs that our coping skills are becoming threadbare and our anxieties may turn dark and more dangerous?Poor sleep\"When nightmares become a regular thing and our sleep quality is consistently bad, that is often the first sign that we may need to take action to improve our mental health,\" said Springer, author of a new book called \"Warrior: How to Support Those Who Protect Us.\" Poor sleep is a double-edged sword: Not only does anxiety create poor sleep, a lack of quality sleep can lead to anxiety, stress and depression, a sort of circular impact. The good news is that exercise and practicing good sleep hygiene can often help get us back on track.A focus on bad news As we shelter in place, a focus on watching alarming media reports on the growth of the virus and the devastation to the economy is another warning flag, according to Springer.\"If we are spending our days soaking in this general anxiety and dread about what may happen, in a sort of foxhole waiting for bad news, that's another sign that things are getting into a more clinical range,\" she said. \"And there's the guilt of taking our feelings out on loved ones, which is likely to happen when you're in close quarters with people for a long time and you haven't adjusted to that.\"Loss of interest and pleasureAn even more serious sign, Springer said, is when we lose the taste for connection to others and stop reaching out to friends and family.\"When we can't find pleasure in anything and we begin to feel numb rather than connecting with others and doing things we value or want to do with our lives, that's a sign that we may need help and support, she said. Helplessness or crippling anxietyIf the current threat of Covid-19 has reawakened feelings of helplessness, such as in the face of violence at home, or from a loss of identity and purpose after being fired or furloughed from a job, that can also be a key sign of risk, experts said.\"An overwhelming feeling of helplessness is what often leads to trauma symptoms,\" Springer said. \"Those of us who've been let go from a job can feel as if we've lost our identity, due to the absence of the roles and relationships that give our lives meaning, and therefore we feel helpless. We can be at risk.\"Helplessness can turn to a dark and crippling anxiety, which is another sign that we need help. \"Crippling anxiety is where you feel constantly flooded with feelings of panic and this nameless dread about what may unfold,\" Springer said. \"You don't have a sense of a hopeful future. Anxiety creates tunnel vision and it really puts us in a state of fight or flight.\"And when we are in that survival mode for a prolonged period of time, that's when anxiety goes into a darker phase and it really warrants clinical support,\" she said.Thoughts of suicide Being so hopeless and anxious that we begin to think of ending our life is, of course, a sign that immediate professional help is needed, experts said.\"Military veterans say this is when 'whispers of our demons' begin to take over,\" Springer said. \"When we start to script out a story in our heads of how others won't miss us or that we're a burden to those that we love, that is a critical sign that we need to get help immediately.\"What to do to help yourselfReach out and connect, just not physically. The first thing to do is stay socially connected with friends and loved ones even though you're physically apart. Technology is a great way for many of us to do that, but some in the family, such as grandparents, may be as adept at using Facebook, Facetime and Zoom, for example.\"Instead of just relying on social media, we can make a list of the 10 or 20 people that we care the most about and put them in our phone on a rotating basis,\" Springer said. \"We're going to call one of those people every day.\"Next, Springer suggested adding more people from our outer ring of friends and associates that we may not be as close to and put those people into that daily call rotation. That's especially critical if you think those people may be especially isolated right now. \"Reaching out and connecting with people, especially those who are especially isolated, and giving them space to talk about their experience and anxiety during this unprecedented time of anxiety and then sharing our own experience is how we will get through this,\" she said. \"When we connect, we survive.\"Breathe deeply. In therapy sessions, Webber said, \"the thing we teach most is deep breathing. It's free, it doesn't cost anything and it really works.\" Here's how to do it properly, she says: Breathe through the nose, hold it and then exhale very slowly out through your mouth like you're breathing through a straw.\"And when you breathe slowly out, you improve your whole picture of life and you reduce your nervousness,\" Webber said. Practice gratitude. Science has shown that people who practice gratitude are happier and more optimistic -- and you can easily teach yourself how to do it.\"One thing I recommend to everyone in scary times is to write two or three things each day of what you're grateful for. It shifts your view of the world,\" Webber said. \"I'm grateful for my daughter because she is home with me right now. I'm grateful for my son, the nurse. I'm grateful for my other son who has figured out every possible way of getting food online that there is in the entire county,\" she added with a chuckle. Take control of your mental state. Fight back against anxiety turning darker, experts suggested, by taking control of how you think. \"One of the ways to do that is to take out a sheet of paper, put a line down the middle and on one side write down the things we can't control right now, and on the other write what we can control,\" Springer said. \"And then we form a plan of action that allows us to move on those things that we can control.'This stops us from \"soaking in that feeling of helplessness or if you will just be sitting in our foxhole and waiting for more bad news to come,\" she said. \"We're actually moving on things that we want to be doing with our lives, even if there are some very challenging circumstances right now.\"For some people that may not feel possible, especially if they lost a job or were furloughed when the economy came to a screeching halt. \"Losing a job is a seismic stressor, one of the most stressful things that can happen to you,\" Springer said. \"But you can sit and ponder on your negative situation or you can use the time to learn something new or deepen yourself or gain some skills.\"She points to the many high quality, inexpensive or free training programs on the internet today that can add skills to your profession or even help you transition to something new. \"So people can use this time to build skills and become smarter and stronger and more prepared for when the workforce really kicks back in and full force,\" Springer said.Establish a schedule. Our days and nights are blending together, and many people find themselves working more hours, or if they can't work, fretting about finances. One way to fight back to is establish a schedule that separates work or job search from family and play time, especially exercise, which is critical for boosting our mental mood. Meditation or mindfulness are also excellent options to schedule into our day, experts said.\"We have to create routines in order to get through this absolutely surrealistic world right now,\" Webber said. \"Focus on the little things, such as making a lunch in a special way, knitting, crocheting, meditation, mindfulness, yoga or walking or running to do something physical to help us reach a more calm mental state.\"Be careful with media, especially social media. Be sure to limit the amount of time you spend watching the news, especially if you feel it makes you anxious, experts said. That can also apply to social media, said Arthur Evans, the CEO of the American Psychological Association, in a recent interview for the Washington Journal section of CSPAN.\"There is a lot of misinformation on social media,\" Evans said. \"When you couple that with a lot of contradictory information, it creates more anxiety for people.\"For example, he said, social media is filled with conspiracy theories and other wrong information that \"is contradicting what we are hearing from professionals who really know and understand these issues ... so limiting the information to reliable sources, sources you can trust, goes a long way in helping manage that stress.\"Crack a smile. It's long been said that \"laughter is the best medicine,\" and that applies to the anxiety of our times, experts said.\"Remember, you can't be anxious and smile at the same time. That's a physiological thing,\" Webber said. So watch funny movies, listen to comedy routines, ask everyone you talk to on the phone to tell you a joke. Give back to them by doing the same.Stay optimistic. There are so many unknowns when it comes to this new disease that is terrorizing the world. Will it ease over the warmer summer months? Get better or worse as the world begins to open back up? Even worse, will it return with a vengeance in the fall and winter? Don't let those unknowns shake you or take away your optimism, Webber said.\"I consider optimism both healthy and an Achilles heel, because of course, being too optimistic might let you down,\" she said. \"But if I had the choice, optimism is always better than pessimism. And optimism is always better than realism. If we have hope that the best will come, we might be disappointed, but that hope, I always believe, will get to the person that you love.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)In hospitals around the world, doctors are shaking their heads in disbelief as they watch Covid-19 patients who should be comatose or \"seizing\" from hypoxia -- a lack of oxygen in the body's tissues -- check social media, chat with nurses and barely complain of discomfort while breathing.\n\nSome have dubbed them \"happy hypoxics,\" a terrible misnomer for what could be a long, slow recovery -- or worse.The proper medical term is \"silent hypoxia.\" It happens when people are unaware they are being deprived of oxygen and are therefore showing up to the hospital in much worse health than they realize.Typically, these patients have experienced some Covid-19 symptoms for two to seven days before they show up at the hospital complaining of sudden chest tightness or an inability to breathe deeply, said Dr. Richard Levitan, who's been an emergency room physician for some 30 years. While he practices at Littleton Regional Healthcare in New Hampshire, Levitan recently spent almost two weeks volunteering in the emergency room of a New York City hospital near the epicenter of the city's devastating outbreak.Read MoreThere he watched patients come into the emergency room with blood oxygen levels as low as 50%, so low they should have been incoherent, even unconscious. Normal blood oxygen saturation is between 95% and 100%, and anything below 90% is considered abnormal.In addition, Levitan said, scans of these patients' lungs showed signs of pneumonia so severe they should be in terrible pain as they gasp for their next breath.\"Their X-ray's looked awful, their oxygen was terrible, and yet they're completely awake, alert on a cell phone, and they all said is they've been somewhat sick for days,\" he said. \"And then only recently did they notice either shortness of breath or fatigue or something else,\" Levitan added. \"That's what is so fascinating about this disease and also so terrible.\"It's terrible because by the time a person realizes they are having trouble taking a deep breath and reaches out for help, they are already dangerously sick. \"Some may ultimately require a ventilator.\" Levitan said, \"As levels of carbon dioxide rise, fluid builds up in the air sacs and the lungs become stiff, leading to acute respiratory failure.\" How can this happen?Doctors speculate that, for some people, Covid-19 lung problems progress in a way that isn't immediately apparent. As patients focus on battling such symptoms as fever and diarrhea, the body begins fighting back against the lack of oxygen by speeding up breathing to compensate. \"Just imagine that you had a full glass of air, and now that cup becomes half full,\" said critical care pulmonologist Dr. Cedric Rutland, a spokesperson for the American Lung Association.\"What are you naturally going to do? You're going to try to fill it twice as fast because you lost half,\" said Rutland, who is also a assistant clinical professor at the University of California, Riverside.People may not be aware of their more rapid breathing rate and don't seek help, yet blood oxygen levels continue to fall. In the meantime, the body slowly becomes somewhat adjusted to the lower levels of oxygen, much like what happens when a person travels to a higher altitude.By the time these patients get to the hospital with crippled lungs and crashing oxygen levels, \"this has been taking place for a bit of time.\" Rutland said. \"So your body is kind of used to it.\"Yet the damage has already taken place. Not only are the lungs severely ravaged, the lack of oxygen may have already comprised other organs in the body, such as the heart, kidneys and brain.A silent hypoxia that progresses rapidly to respiratory failure may explain why some younger Covid-19 patients with no underlying health conditions have died suddenly after not experiencing any serious shortness of breath. Trying to avoid ventilatorsEarly in the crisis, doctors were putting nearly everyone who came in with breathing difficulties on ventilators. Now they reserve those for the severely sick, realizing that other measures, such as supplemental oxygen and body positioning, may work just as well for some patients. In 2012, Levitan coauthored a paper in which doctors offered 50 patients supplemental oxygen instead of ventilators and positioned them on their sides and tummy, positions often used to help open the lower lungs. \"We found two out of three patients can avoid a ventilator during the first 24 hours by putting them on oxygen and doing these positioning maneuvers, such as laying them prone on their stomach,\" he said.Keeping patients off ventilators is a huge win-win for doctors and patients. Ventilators are scarce and need to be reserved for the sickest of patients. But even if every hospital had a surplus of ventilators, there are many reasons to try other methods first. In addition to a tube inserted down the nose into the stomach or surgically implanted into the trachea via the throat, patients can have tubes implanted for feeding and to use the restroom. Breathing tubes aren't pleasant. Many patients require multiple sedatives so they don't pull them out. Bacteria can easily grow, causing \"ventilator-associated pneumonia.\" There is an increased risk of blood clots. Finally, people on ventilators have to be \"weaned off,\" a painful and scary experience during which some people struggle. Once they do manage to reduce their dependence, about a third of patients on ventilators come out of the experience with anxiety, depression or delirium, often referred to as \"ventilator brain.\"Early detection is keyLevitan recently wrote an opinion piece for the New York Times in which he called for earlier diagnosis of Covid-19 respiratory concerns by having people with mild symptoms use pulse oximeters during their two-week quarantine to monitor their blood oxygen levels.\"Widespread pulse oximetry screening for Covid pneumonia -- whether people check themselves on home devices or go to clinics or doctors' offices -- could provide an early warning system for the kinds of breathing problems associated with Covid pneumonia,\" he wrote. However, questions remain about the merits of home use of pulse oximeters to measure blood oxygen levels. First, a number of the devices on the market may not be accurate. A 2016 study found only two of six popular oximeters met the criteria for accuracy set by the International Organization for Standardization, an independent, non-governmental international organization dedicated to setting global standards.In addition, misuse can affect readings. The device must be worn correctly; hands should be at room temperature; and dark nail polish can affect readings, as can holding your breath.Rutland is encouraging patients he sees via telemedicine to use oximeters to monitor their oxygen levels. He feels the devices, while not perfect, provide doctors with a way to triage regular patients they can't see in person during isolation. \"As long as someone has a home oximeter and you know the person well enough, you can help them monitor this at home to get a jump start on whether or not they need to go to the hospital,\" he said.\"I believe pulse oximetry is incredibly valuable if we were to use it in the window of time that the disease begins to gather strength, which is usually five to 10 days out from when someone is first infected,\" Levitan said.\"Then the other thing is to measure inflammatory markers when we observe them in the hospital and use the variety of medicines at our disposal to address inflammation. It's time to get ahead of this virus instead of chasing it.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Popular social media posts are filled with inaccuracies about science. They could damage public health during this coronavirus pandemic, the authors of two separate studies say.\n\nOne study found that more than one in four of the most popular YouTube videos about the novel coronavirus contained misinformation. Another found that vaccine skeptics were winning the battle for Facebook engagement.More than 70% of adults turn to the internet to learn about health and healthcare, a team of researchers in Canada said. They analyzed popular YouTube videos on a single day earlier this year, filtering for those that mentioned coronavirus.Excluding videos that weren't in English, that ran for more than an hour, or didn't have audio or visual content, they wound up with 69 videos twith a total of 257,804,146 views. They rated each based on factual content covering symptoms, prevention, treatments epidemiology and viral spread. The videos came from a variety of sources such as network news -- which made up the largest portion of videos -- entertainment videos, internet based news operations, professional YouTube stars, newspapers, educational institutions and government agencies.Read MoreNearly 50 of the videos, or 72%, got the facts right. The one in four that didn't had either misleading or inaccurate information, Heidi Oi-Yee Li of the University of Ottawa and colleagues in Canada wrote in the online journal BMJ Global Health. More than 62 million people looked at the most misleading YouTube videos,Past studies looking at YouTube usage found the platform has been key in spreading vital information about how to keep people safe in a pandemic or public health emergency. If this many videos are inaccurate, there's a \"significant potential for harm,\" Li and colleagues wrote.\"YouTube is a powerful, untapped educational tool that should be better mobilized by health professionals,\" they wrote. Too often, government information is static and not interesting. Public health agencies could benefit if they were to team up with people who understand how to best communicate on YouTube, the researchers said.In another study, researchers looked at scientific information on Facebook and found a similar static message from official public health leaders made these messages less impactful. People who have not made up their minds about vaccines may be more influenced by what they see on social media this study published Wednesday in the journal Nature found, and that could be a real problem during the coronavirus pandemic,. This research collaboration between scholars at George Washington University, University of Miami, Michigan State University and Los Alamos National Laboratory looked at comments from more than 100 million Facebook users in a variety of online communities that discussed vaccines during the 2019 measles outbreak. The conversations were spirited and the contributors spanned several countries and communicated in several languages.Among Facebook users, opinions seemed to fall into three camps: people who were pro-vaccine, those who were anti-vaccine and the undecided. Even undecided social media users were still highly engaged with the topic, researchers said. The researchers looked to see how individuals from one group interacted with the others, and created a map to track these conversations.What they found was that while there were fewer people who did not believe in vaccines, there were nearly three times the number of anti-vaccination groups on Facebook. That larger number of groups, in part, allowed those communities to become more entangled with the undecided communities, which swayed some opinions. The anti-vaccine communicators tended to have a variety of messages and could join more conversations because of that variety.\"Even though they are numerically small, they appear big online because they have so many flavors of arguments and narratives,\" said study co-author Neil Johnson. Some messages focused on ideas that vaccines caused health problems. Other messages emphasized free choice. Others spun conspiracy theories. Pro-vaccine posters, like members of state public health departments, tended to concentrate their communication efforts on one message: vaccines protect public health. Having just one message cost them the opportunity to communicate with some of the medium-sized groups that weren't as visible as others. Johnson, a professor of physics at the George Washington University who heads the initiative in Complexity and Data Science, said that the team was about to wrap up the study when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. They continue to monitor these groups and found the distrust of establishment and science had transferred to the pandemic. \"It's just morphed. It's almost like it become the perfect storm for Covid, this kind of online behavior that distrust science, and because they're already organized and embedded in groups like the local pet lovers association,\" Johnson said. \"Previously they may have had a hard job talking with the local pet lovers association about vaccines, but now everybody's talking about Covid and possible vaccines, so it's kind of their moment.\" Johnson said we tend to trust people in our own communities, so when our Uncle Arthur tells us something about our dog that is absolutely correct, that the vet hasn't mentioned yet, you start to trust your Uncle Arthur most. \"We trust people in our communities because of this kind of interaction,\" Johnson said. \"Then when they turn around and tell me something about how Bill Gates is behind a particular vaccine, and you better watch out because he's going to inject you with something, you might actually give it some kind of credence.\"The people who are spreading the anti-vaccine message online are not \"crazies\" or \"flat Earth\" people, instead they are people that are sort of \"grabbing somewhere\" and putting two and two together and \"just getting the wrong answer,\" Johnson said. But then \"everyone around them thinks they've got the right answer.\" Johnson said he was \"very skeptical\" when he started the study. He thought the conversations online would look like a battle between government establishment science, with health recommendation in the middle, and then small disorganized communities trying to pick away at it. But that's not it at all. \"It's more like the anti-vaxxers are embedded with the local pet club and with the parent teachers and you know, the establishment science health public health experts, it's almost like they were sitting in an entirely different battlefield,\" Johnson said. \"And to them it looks like they've won, but they haven't, because it's just them on that battlefield.\" Johnson said he is already seeing people in these groups saying that they won't get a Covid-19 vaccine and they will rely on others to be vaccinated so they will be safe. He hopes this study will help public health officials think through new communication strategies to reach more with their message.",

    "Sorting Fact from Fiction: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's coronavirus podcast for May 4": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "(CNN)As conspiracy theories and myths about Covid-19 continue to spread, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta sets the record straight on some of the most inaccurate information floating around the internet.\n\nYou can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.Robin Meade, CNN \"Morning Express\" anchor: Why do some people believe that there could be a link between 5G and coronavirus? Alisyn Camerota, CNN \"New Day\" anchor: This is beyond snake oil. Dr. Ashish Jha, Harvard Global Health Institute director: And the point is now we're spending all of our time talking about what we should be doing with Lysol.Read MoreDr. Sanjay Gupta: Since I started reporting on the coronavirus, I've heard a lot of myths and theories about it.The outbreak has unleashed so much information, the World Health Organization has called it an infodemic. And there's so much misinformation that goes along with it.Today I'm going to try and set the record straight on some inaccurate information that's been circulating on social media and the internet.I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\" Gupta: Number one: Does remdesivir cure coronavirus? Well first of all, last week, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency-use authorization for remdesivir. Remdesivir is not a cure. But it's a start, and it could be a very important start.This is an experimental drug, an antiviral. I've been reporting on it since 2014, when it was tested as an experimental treatment for Ebola.It didn't work back then, but recently, a government-funded study found that hospitalized patients who took remdesivir intraveneously recovered about four days faster than patients who didn't. The benefit on average was about 31 percent.That's similar to the effect that the drug Tamiflu has on the flu. Tamiflu also doesn't cure patients, but it can reduce how long they are sick and how severe that sickness is.So let me tell you what this FDA emergency-use authorization really means: The FDA is allowing the use of this drug remdesivir for adults and children suspected or confirmed to have Covid-19, who also have severe disease, which includes low blood oxygen levels. For now, this is a medication that has to be administered in a hospital through an IV, by a health care provider.Now, keep in mind, emergency use authorization doesn't mean that this is an FDA-approved drug -- but it is a sign that the FDA believes that the benefits of this drug outweigh the risks in certain patients.Now I want to remind you that this study has nothing to do with how soon we might see a vaccine for the coronavirus. Number two: Injesting disinfectants can possibly treat the virus. Listener: Just to make sure, you shouldn't drink Lysol, right? Gupta: I know you probably know the answer to this one already. And the reason that we're talking about it is because it still seems to be a source of confusion for some people.Let me be clear about this. Under no circumstances should you ingest or inject any cleaning products. Even a very small amount can get you very sick and possibly even kill you.Lysol's manufacturer issued a statement clarifying that its products should never be administered into the human body. Still, there was a reported uptick in calls in places like Maryland and Illinois about people ingesting disinfectants to try and kill the virus. This is dangerous. It won't work, and it could get you really sick.So let me repeat it once more. Don't drink any cleaning products.Number three: Listener: Can I get the coronavirus through drinking regular tap water or in a swimming pool? Gupta: Well, a little bit of good news here. You don't need to worry about getting Covid-19 in your tap water. According to the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], most municipal drinking water systems should remove or inactivate the virus. As for swimming pools, there's no evidence that the virus can be spread through the water in pools, hot tubs or water play areas. Proper maintenance along with the use of disinfection agents should inactivate the virus in the water. But that doesn't mean pools may not be shut down in certain areas this summer. Health officials advise staying at least 6 feet away from others because the virus is a respiratory disease. In other words, you probably won't get the coronavirus from the water, but you could get it from someone close to you in the water. Number four: The novel coronavirus is no worse than the flu.Two doctors in Bakersfield, California recently held a press conference to declare just that.Dr. Dan Erickson: Is the flu less dangerous than Covid? Let's look at the death rates. No, it's not. They're similar in prevalance and in death rate. So we are saying that our response now, now that we know the facts, it's time to get back to work. Gupta: That was Dr. Dan Erickson. He and another doctor came under fire for downplaying Covid-19. In fact, the American College of Emergency Physicians called the claims reckless, untested and inconsistent with any current science or epidemiology regarding Covid-19. It is true that there are similarities, but Dr. Anthony Fauci [director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases], for example, has warned that coronavirus could be 10 times more lethal than the flu.Here's one thing to keep in mind. Flu can be very deadly. About 0.1% of people who become infected with the flu will die from it. In any given year, 30 million people to 40 million people may become infected. And that means 30,000 to 40,000 people will die. But here's some big differences. First of all, the flu's been around for a while. So if you've been around on this planet for a while, you probably have some immunity to it, even if the flu virus changes a bit season to season. And finally, there is a vaccine for the flu. Now, the vaccine may not protect you entirely. But it could shorten the duration if you get it. By the way, that doctor's video, which has been shared on YouTube, has since been taken down for violating the platform's policy on misinformation.Number five: 5G networks are spreading the virus. Donie O'Sullivan, CNN \"New Day\" reporter: Conspiracy theorists, now again using no actual facts or reliable information, are linking 5G to the spread of the coronavirus. Gupta: There are a lot of baseless conspiracy theories floating around the internet about the origins of the virus and how it spreads -- this is one of them. A hoax started in the fringes of the internet suggested that 5G -- that's the ultra-fast wireless technology -- is responsible for the spread of the coronavirus. Regardless of what you might think about wireless technology, there is no connection between that sort of technology and a highly transmissible virus. Still, some celebrities shared these claims to their millions of followers on social media.In April, there were reports that people actually tried to burn down cell phone towers in the U.K. Officials were concerned that this was motivated by these conspiracy theories. I want you to listen to how Dr. Fauci responded when asked about this in a Snapchat interview:Dr. Anthony Fauci: That's thoroughly preposterous. Untrue. And actually ridiculous. 5G doesn't impact on the immune system. Gupta: Number six: Can I give the coronavirus to my pets? Can I get it from them? Listener: If the virus started in animals, could they be even more susceptible to the virus than we are? Gupta: The cat is out of the bag, so to speak, on this one. It looks like pets, especially cats and dogs, can contract Covid-19. At least two cats and a dog have tested positive in the United States. We are learning they can get it from humans, and in rare situations, pass it on to other pets. The CDC recommends treating your pets as you would other human family members -- that means you don't let them interact with others outside the home. Some lions and tigers at the Bronx Zoo also tested positive for the virus. The zoo says a staff member likely infected the cats. But as things stand now, currently, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading Covid-19 in humans. We'll keep talking about this because the bottom line is there's a lot of useful information on the internet. But some of it is wrong, and some of it can be dangerous. We are learning more every day about the coronavirus, especially about symptoms and prevention and treatment. I suggest you try and do what I do. Always check your sources. Be really diligent about this, and see who else can corroborate something that you might be hearing. Health professionals are always going to be a good source, but again, we are all learning together.We'll be back tomorrow.

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nThokoza, South Africa (CNN)When President Donald Trump mused recently about injecting household disinfectants as treatment for Covid-19 in the White House briefing room, South Africans were reminded of their own dark past.\n\nTwo decades ago, the country's health minister announced that beetroot or garlic could treat HIV/AIDS.South Africa's president Thabo Mbeki at the time falsely believed that HIV treatments could be poisonous, so he kept proven, lifesaving antiretrovirals (ARVs) from those in need. In all, South Africa's official AIDS denials and misinformation cost the lives of more than 300,000 people, according to several studies.\"We can't have a large number of people dying,\" Dr. Yogan Pillay, a senior official at the Department of Health, said. \"We came from a period where we had large numbers of South Africans dying from HIV. We can't repeat that now and we shouldn't.\"Read MoreAn ambitious initiativeIt is the memory of that past failure, South African health officials say, that is driving their fight against this new virus and it is the considerable resources they have since built up against HIV, that could provide their best weapon in fighting Covid-19.After years of dithering under Mbeki, the South African government drastically changed course against HIV because of civil society lawsuits and a change in leadership. They put millions of people on ARVs and recruited an army of community health workers to inform the public of the dangers of AIDS and the importance of testing.They were able to mount this fight, in large part, because of an ambitious initiative launched by another US Republican president.Former President George W. Bush's President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), announced in 2003, is arguably the single most successful international US public health response.More than 14 million people are on ARVs because of PEPFAR. When it began, fewer than 50,000 people in sub-Saharan Africa could access the life-sustaining drugs.\"Quite frankly, without the PEPFAR investment in South Africa, we wouldn't have more than a million people on treatment, a significant reduction in the number of deaths from HIV and TB, or the significant increase in our life expectancy,\" Dr. Pillay said.Pillay said that there are currently roughly eight million HIV positive people in South Africa, with more than two million infected people not on antiretrovirals.A sweeping lockdownThose numbers mean that South Africa has the world's largest HIV burden, which helped to convince South African scientists and officials to recommend a sweeping lockdown as Covid-19 struck the country.Countries around the world are under lockdown, but South Africa's is one of the strictest and it was instituted before a single confirmed Covid-19 death and in a country already in an economic recession.\"This was a very tough decision for the government to take,\" Dr. Pillay said, \"but they took it because they didn't want to repeat the mistakes of ... our early response to HIV.\"In a middle-income country with the world's greatest levels of inequality, South Africa has managed to drastically flatten its infection curve early while much richer countries like the UK and the United States have struggled to do so. South Africa has distinct disadvantages to those wealthy nations. Millions live in townships and informal settlements across the country where the lockdowns make sense in principle, but not really in practice.Townships like Thokoza, in the southeast of Johannesburg, are a nightmare scenario for combating a respiratory disease. But here, too, the country's experience with HIV is helping its battle.Around 35,000 government and PEPFAR supported health workers are now actively screening for the disease in communities they already work, conducting routine health checks, according to Pillay. They have already screened nearly six million people for Covid-19, according to the latest figures from the country's Department of Health.Community health worker Anito Pato said that the trust she has built up with the community allows her to address fear of the new virus right away. She goes door-to-door in Thokoza to check for symptoms of Covid-19 and refer the sick for testing.\"They didn't know much about Covid-19 and they think it is affecting the rich people, not them,\" Pato said. \"We try to explain to them why we are screening and what corona is.\"A man in a blue work shirt called Pato over during her visit. He wanted a test. Pato explained that there aren't enough tests right now and that he should go to the clinic or the mobile testing center they have set up if he gets the symptoms.\"AIDS is better because we have got treatment,\" the man, Salvin Tawananda, told CNN, \"But corona, people are just scared.\"The government and US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) are closely monitoring efforts in Thokoza and other townships, where social distancing is all but impossible, and failure could be disastrous.\"It is very hard for people here to adhere to those lockdown rules and that is even more reason why we should be out there looking for the disease before it takes over these communities,\" said Dr. Meredith McMorrow, a CDC official based in South Africa.\"South Africa was certainly the hardest hit by HIV and it concerns us that it will be the hardest hit by Covid-19 as well that is why we are doing everything we can to get ready right now.\"Covid-19's effect on HIV patientsMcMorrow's concern comes from not yet knowing Covid-19's effects on HIV positive people.To date, studies in China and elsewhere are inconclusive, but Megan Doherty, the head of the WHO's global HIV program, said it pays to be extremely cautious with any emerging disease.\"Because this is an unprecedented pandemic, we just don't know how it reacts in all situations,\" she said. \"We just don't know enough about the interactions between HIV and Covid-19 and how patients with both infections will do.\"ARVs are being tested as possible therapeutics for COVID-19 in clinical trials.Dr. Larry Corey, now president and director emeritus of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, helped develop the first effective ARV treatment.He said he is skeptical that ARVs designed for HIV will become a broad-based treatment for Covid-19.\"The best ARVs that are discovered are highly specific to each virus,\" he said.Corey, who now leads the global HIV-vaccine trial network, said regardless of the results of ARV trials in Covid-19 treatment, South Africa is well placed to play a critical part in the next phase of this pandemic, because of its HIV infrastructure and experience with HIV vaccine trials.\"I feel proud of my communities,\" said Pato, as she moved down a narrow path leading to another section of corrugated iron shacks. \"I feel like I am a bullet to shoot this disease. It must not control us. We must control this corona.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Nearly every state in the US is moving toward reopening from pandemic closures, but a leading researcher warns that doing so puts the country on an \"unfortunate trajectory\" to more coronavirus deaths.\n\nAn influential model cited often by the White House now predicts that 147,000 people in the nation will die from the virus by August, the researcher behind the model Dr. Chris Murray told CNN's Don Lemon Tuesday. It's an increase of 10,000 deaths from two days earlier and double what was projected two weeks ago. \"We originally had thought that people would go the distance, keep social distance in place right until the end of May,\" Murray said. \"But what's happened is states have relaxed early.\"Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said states can begin to reopen safely if they meet guidelines on declining cases and have a strong testing and contact tracing infrastructure in place.\"Most states don't meet that. A few do. They can probably open up safely. But most states don't. Until we have those in place, we should not be opening up unless we're willing to take a risk of having large outbreaks,\" he said.Read More\"Opening up prematurely just sets us up for big outbreaks, which will force us to shut down again.\"At least 48 states will be partially reopened by Sunday in the midst of a pandemic that has infected more than 1.3 million people and killed over 82,000, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Nationally, cases and deaths have been slowly trending downward over the past few weeks, but that decline is not spread evenly among states. The below map, which looks at the average new cases in the past week compared to the previous week, shows that nine states have seen increases, 22 have seen decreases and 19 have remained about steady.Still, the reopenings do not mean that states are returning to normal. The University of California System says it likely won't fully reopen in the fall. Even in Georgia, the state with the most aggressive reopening, bars and nightclubs will remain closed through the end of the month, and restaurants can only reopen with limited capacity.WHO official says coronavirus could become endemicThe novel coronavirus may never go away and may join the mix of viruses that kill people around the world every year, said Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization health emergencies program.\"This virus just may become another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away. HIV hasn't gone away,\" Ryan said during a media briefing in Geneva on Wednesday.\"I'm not comparing the two diseases but I think it is important that we're realistic. I don't think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear,\" Ryan added.The holy grail in the pandemic response remains a coronavirus vaccine. With a vaccine, \"we may have a shot at eliminating this virus, but that vaccine will have to be available, it will have to be highly effective, it will have to be made available to everyone and we'll have to use it,\" Ryan said. \"This disease may settle into a long-term problem or it may not be.\"Separately, in an unprecedented move for US vaccine makers, they're considering whether to whether to work together on coronavirus vaccine trials. They're considering two approaches. One is more typical and involves each company working independently on its own trial, according to two members of the Accelerating Covid-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines group, or ACTIV, which was organized last month by the National Institutes of Health. The second, the group members said, involves several vaccine developers working in one large trial -- an unprecedented method for vaccine development in the United States. The third phase of vaccine trials typically involve thousands of study subjects, some of whom are randomly assigned to get the vaccine, and others who are injected with a placebo, a substance that does nothing. The researchers then wait and see if there is a difference in Covid-19 infections rates between the vaccine group and the control group. If the vaccine developers band together in one large phase 3 trial of all of their experimental vaccines, they could all use the same placebo group and wouldn't have to recruit their own. Members of ACTIV's clinical trials working group are expected to discuss the options on a call Wednesday.States turn to contact tracingFirst it was ventilators, and then testing. Now, states are turning their focus toward contact tracing as weapons in the battle against coronavirus. New Orleans is taking the unusual step of requiring restaurants with open dining rooms to take reservations with a name and a phone number and keep them for at least 21 days so they can track down people if a case arises.\"Contract tracing comes with the responsibility of all of us,\" Mayor LaToya Cantrell said at a news conference. \"General public, know where you're going, take ... notes (to) remind yourself of where you've been,\" she said.She said she doesn't know how many will be in Orleans Parish yet, but the state is hiring contact tracers -- which several governors said Tuesday they are doing as well.The state of New Jersey is planning to develop a community contact tracing core that could employ 1,000 to 5,000 people, state Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said in a news conference. The job could pay up to $25 dollars an hour, Gov. Phil Murphy said. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced an online tool for contact tracing officials are calling the \"Healthy Georgia Collaborative.\" The tool will help in allowing \"Georgians to identify contacts and monitor symptoms.\"Kemp said there are \"nearly 250 staff in the field today,\" and that the Department of Public Health \"plans to have 1,000 staff deployed in the weeks ahead.\"In Washington state, hundreds of members of the National Guard will be used as part of an interim contact tracing group until more workers and volunteers are trained. They will not have law enforcement power but \"simply will be talking to people and helping prevent others from getting sick,\" Gov. Jay Inslee said.California and its schools prepare for the long haulWhile restrictions will continue to be loosened and lifted, Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Tuesday that Los Angeles County should expect to remain under some form of a stay at home order for at least another three months.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti urged residents not to \"freak out\" at the thought of months of more precautions and said that the city will be following the data available.But schools across the state are making decisions for them.The California State University system has announced plans to cancel nearly all in-person classes for the fall semester in favor of virtual learning, and the University of California System says it likely won't fully reopen in the fall either. \"It's not an easy decision,\" Dr. William Schaffner, Vanderbilt professor of infectious diseases told CNN's Chris Cuomo of schools considering fall semester plans. \"As with all of these things, I say there is not a right decision nor wrong decision, only tough decisions.\" Though Garcetti hopes the city can find a safe way to send K-12 students back to school in the fall, he said they should also prepare to pick back up with online classes.\n\nCNN's Jason Hanna, Eric Levenson, Cheri Mossburg, Jamie Gumbrecht, Sarah Moon, Jen Christensen, Maggie Fox and Jon Passantino contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Fitness centers are starting to reopen around the country. Whether you are ready to go back or prefer to exercise at home, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta shares some tips on how to stay active and safe.\n\nYou can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.Radford Slough, Urban Body Fitness: Welcome to Urban Body Fitness. You come in the entrance-only door and look what it says: Urban Body Fitness is doing what we can to give you a safe place to work out. Wash your hands, please put your used hand towel at the front desk. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: What you're hearing is a tour of Urban Body Fitness. It's a gym in Atlanta that reopened its doors in May. And you're also hearing the new policies they now have in place. Read MoreSlough: You'll have to sign your Covid-19 waiver. You're gonna grab a towel right there and you're going to wait. And the staff will unlock this little gate. Gupta: As of today, most states have partially reopened or have eased stay-at-home restrictions. For some, gyms are part of this first phase of reopening. I like to work out -- I do it every day. But a lot of people are concerned about going back to their local gym because we're in the middle of a pandemic. Gyms in particular can pose a high risk for spreading the virus -- they are usually packed with people. You need to share equipment. And let's be honest, physical distancing can be a real challenge there.So in this episode, we're gonna hear from epidemiologist Saskia Popescu about the risks of going to the gym. What are they?We're also gonna talk to the owner of Urban Body Fitness, Radford Slough, on what exactly to expect if you do decide to go. And if you're not ready yet, we're also gonna talk about how to stay physically fit from home. That's crucial.I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\" Saskia Popescu, HonorHealth senior infection preventionist: So I think there are ways to keep yourself safe, but you need to do some homework. You need to be mindful that this is an increased risk task. Gupta: We had the chance to sit down with Saskia Popescu, who's a senior infection prevention epidemiologist with the HonorHealth hospital system. She lives in Arizona, where gyms are part of the first phase of reopening. We wanted to know -- how does she feel about that? Popescu: I'm very conflicted by it, mostly because I think, as we've all seen, there's a lot of states that are opening prematurely. And I think that gives a lot of concern for me and to a lot of people in public health and health care, simply because most people want to get back to their normal lives. They want to go back to the gym and the restaurants and the salons and everything like that. And if things reopen, they're going to assume it's safe. And if we open things prematurely without a phased, incremental approach, it's very, very possible we're going to see big spikes in cases again. Gupta: We are in this age of social and physical distancing, and Saskia points out the new challenges facing gym-goers and also gym owners. Popescu: I also think of gyms as having so many high-touch surfaces and equipment, and that is so challenging to keep clean. But also, you have to really rely on customers and business owners to be doing things not only right, but consistently. And there's a lot of room for mistakes. Gupta: Saskia used to go to a small local gym. It's closed now, but if it were to reopen this week, would she go? Popescu: I don't see Arizona's numbers consistently down trending, so I personally would not be doing that simply because I don't see the data to support it, and I'm not going to contribute to that risk. That being said, I've really encouraged you know, friends who have gyms and things like that, how to go about it safely. Gupta: Saskia says that if your state still has stay-at-home orders in place, any unnecessary contact is going to increase the risk of getting the virus. But if your local gym is reopening and you want to go, Saskia does have some recommendations. Popescu: I encourage people to do a couple of things. The first is look at your state and local health department and see what the data is showing in terms of Covid-19 cases. If you're still seeing a lot of spikes, some roller coasters in numbers, and not that steady decline over a couple of weeks, maybe give it a second guess, maybe try and stay home. So do your homework, and then talk to your gym and ask what they're doing to keep you safe. Gupta: Here's the thing, there's so much going that we've never had to think about before. And Saskia thinks that things can be done safely, but that it's very dependent on what businesses do to counter the risk of infection. Here's some of her advice for gym owners -- and what you should be looking out for when you go to the gym, as well. Popescu: So a lot of that is really that environmental disinfection and cleaning and making sure you have really stringent policies in place to get it done. It's going to require more people and more time. Because you absolutely need to be cleaning that equipment between use.So what I encourage people to do is before you invest in a disinfection product, go onto the EPA's website and make sure that it is under the list N, meaning it would be effective against SARS-CoV-2. That's a huge piece. Maybe doing a prescreening of staff before shift and even, you know, guests coming in. Gloves are another question. I think unfortunately, I see gloves misused too frequently. I see people wearing the same pair of gloves all day. I would rather you not wear gloves unless you are super aware of how frequently you have to change them. And I'd rather you just wash your hands or use hand sanitizer. Gupta: And one more concern -- masks. We wear them outside, but should people wear masks when working out? Popescu: I don't necessarily encourage people to wear masks when they're working out because it can cause breathing issues. I mean, there are respiratory concerns for people wearing them while jogging and things like that. So, you know, wearing a mask when you enter the gym and when you're in the locker room, that's helpful. Gupta: With masks, people need to think about their own comfort level and also the intensity of their workout. So those are some of the risks and recommendations. But what does the new normal actually look like when a gym does reopen? Slough: You come in the door. Yes, that's equipment being set aside to be cleaned. Wash your hands this way. And you walk in. Gupta: We spoke with Radford Slough, owner of Urban Body Fitness in downtown Atlanta.Slough: So we're trying to be open, but as safely as we possibly can. So for both our staff and for our members, because -- two-sided street there, and I certainly don't want to be known as the place to go get sick. So when you walk in our front door, the first thing you do is you go wash your hands. We have forehead thermometers, so non-touch. So we take your temperature. Then we're eliminating the people that are in denial about being sick because we're doing a strict 98.6. And if you blow your 98.6, you're in a four-week ban right off the bat. We won't let you in for four weeks. Gupta: It's strict. Of course, there's a lot of people who have no symptoms and still carry the virus. But if your temperature does check out, you can go into the gym. According to Radford, each person is then given a Lysol spray bottle. Slough: And you're to clean when you pick it up and clean when you put it down, as far as pieces of equipment. And once you've done your whole workout, you bring that spray bottle back. We clean the cleaning bottle before we give it out to somebody else. So we actually Lysol the Lysol bottle. Gupta: The gym is also only allowing 30 people at a time, and they're not doing any group classes for now.It's important to point out these policies are for Radford Slough's gym -- your gym may be different. Some gyms, for example, are requiring members to make reservations ahead of time.How your own gym is reopening depends a lot on your state's guidelines, as well as the gym's own policies. This is something you should probably take a few minutes to look up.The decision to go back to the gym is up to you. And truth is, a lot of life is a risk-reward proposition. So do your homework, listen to your local health officials, look at your state's Covid-19 cases, see what direction they're going in, and then make an informed choice from there.But for those of you who are looking to stay fit at home, there's something in this episode for you as well.We crowdsourced a bunch of people in the fitness industry to see what they say.Here's New York City trainer Gerren Liles with some pretty straightforward advice. Gerren Liles: Move, move, move. Periodically, get up. Go from your living room to the bedroom. From the bedroom to the kitchen. Walk up the stairs. Walk down the stairs.I also like to recommend doing small workouts throughout the day instead of just doing one long workout at a particular point in your day just to remain active. Gupta: And I always like to point out that exercising isn't just to benefit your physical health. It's good to remember that we need to keep our minds healthy as well. Here's fitness trainer Jeanette Jenkins.Jenkins: You're not working out just so you can look good, but you're working out because this is the tool that's going to decrease your risk of every illness. It's going to help with your mental health. It's going to help regulate your hormones. It's going to help improve your immunity.Gupta: And, of course, you can always take a walk or run outdoors. The risk of getting the virus while you're running is really low, but it's not zero. Same rules apply -- just maintain physical distance. With all the heavy breathing, you may even want to double the usual 6 feet to 12 feet, just to be safe. When I run, I make sure to run when it's less crowded. I try and do it early in the morning or late at night. And if I see someone in front of me, I switch to the other side of the road. This is important. There are a lot of ways we can stay fit, both physically and mentally. And for people at home, which is most of us nowadays, we have a special bonus episode today with celebrity fitness trainer Jeanette Jenkins. She's going to walk you through some stretches you can even do from your desk. I'll be doing 'em. I hope you join us as well. We'll be back tomorrow, thanks for listening.\n\nIf you have questions, please record them as a voice memo and email them to asksanjay@cnn.com -- we might even include them in our next podcast.\n\nYou can also head to cnn.com/coronavirus and sign up for our daily newsletter, which features the latest updates on this fast-moving story from CNN journalists around the globe.

        "body": "(CNN)By now, you've likely heard the main pieces of advice to avoid the coronavirus.\n\nWear a mask. Wash your hands with soap. Stay at least 6 feet from others. If you do gather with others, go outside rather than inside.Still, there's one more aspect to infection that has received less attention. Growing evidence suggests that Covid-19 infection, like with other illnesses, is related to prolonged time exposed to the virus. The longer you stay in an environment that may contain the virus, the higher the risk of getting sick. Dr. Erin Bromage, a comparative immunologist and professor of biology at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, summed it up with a short and sweet equation: \"Successful Infection = Exposure to Virus x Time.\"Bromage's simplified formula was part of a recent blog post explaining ways to lower your risk of catching Covid-19 that has been read over 15 million times in the past two weeks, he told CNN.Read MoreThe main idea is that people get infected when they are exposed to a certain amount of viral particles. That viral threshold can be reached by an infected person's sneeze or cough, which releases a large number of viral particles into the air. But an infected person talking or even just breathing still releases some virus into the air, and over a long period of time in an enclosed space, that could still infect others.\"The longer time you spend in that environment -- so minutes or hours in there -- the more virus you breathe in, the more it can build up and then establish infection,\" Bromage said. \"So it's always a balance of exposure and time. If you get a high level of exposure, it's a short time (to infection, and if you get a) low level of exposure, it's a longer time before that infection can establish.\"The importance of time exposed to a virus is relevant for all infectious diseases, from measles to tuberculosis to Covid-19, said Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease specialist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York.Indeed, it's the underlying theory behind contact tracing, which tries to locate and contact anyone who has spent prolonged time near an infected person.Bromage said his simple formula suggests that a short shopping trip comes with a comparatively low risk of infection -- but employees in those same stores for eight-hour shifts have a higher risk.\"Even if there is virus in that environment, you hopefully haven't had that extended time needed to get to that infectious dose. The employees, though, are in that environment all day,\" he said. \"So what wouldn't infect you and I because it didn't get to that infectious dose number, has a much stronger effect or larger effect on an employee that gets that low dose all day.\"Gym class, restaurant and choir practice as examplesSeveral case studies of Covid-19 outbreaks over the past few months show the dangers of spending a long time in an enclosed space with an infected person, including at a choir practice in Washington state, a restaurant in China and a fitness studio in South Korea.In Washington state, a single infected person attended a two-and-a-half hour choir practice on March 10, according to a report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of the 61 attendees, 53 people, or 87% of the group, developed Covid-19 afterward, the report said.No one reported physical contact between the attendees at the practices, but they sat close together. The report said the chairs were 6-10 inches apart, but there were empty seats between some of the members. The choir broke into two groups for part of the practice, and members moved closer together for that 45-minute session, they said.Another example of the dangers of prolonged exposure came at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, on January 24. Over lunch that lasted about an hour, an infected person spread the virus to four people at their table, two people at a nearby table and three people at another nearby table.The study concluded that the transmission of the virus was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation at the restaurant and recommended restaurants increase the distance between tables as well as improve their ventilation.Finally, researchers in South Korea linked more than 100 coronavirus infections to a four-hour fitness instructor workshop from mid-February, according to research published in Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal from the CDC. Almost 30 instructors participated in the original workshop, which was held in Cheonan, South Korea. They trained intensely for four hours, and while none had symptoms at the time, eight instructors eventually tested positive for the virus.Less than a month later, researchers had identified 112 coronavirus cases linked to dance classes in a dozen different facilities. Half of the cases were the result of direct transmission from instructors to students, and some people went on to infect others outside of class. The classes linked to transmission had between five to 22 students and took place in small spaces for almost an hour. Out of 217 students exposed to infected instructors, 57 of them, or about one in four, ended up testing positive.How long is too long?Because experimenting with viruses on humans is unethical, data is limited on exactly how much exposure and time are needed for an infection. The number also varies by person, as older or immuno-compromised people have lower thresholds to infection.\"Data are insufficient to precisely define the duration of time that constitutes a prolonged exposure,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. \"Recommendations vary on the length of time of exposure but 15 min of close exposure can be used as an operational definition.\"Sepkowitz similarly said that shorter exposure times are safer, but there is no hard and fast rule for how long is too long.\"Everyone has a little bit of risk per minute, and it's a cumulative thing,\" he said.The other part of Bromage's equation -- the issue of \"exposure to virus\" -- also varies depending on the actions within that enclosed space. For example, he said that louder places are riskier because infected people emit more virus when they talk loudly or when they sing, such as in the chorus case study in Washington.Quieter places with fewer airborne particles may also be lower risk. In the South Korea fitness case study, one of the infected instructors taught Pilates and yoga, and none of her students contracted the virus.\"We hypothesize that the lower intensity of Pilates and yoga did not cause the same transmission effects as those of the more intense fitness dance classes,\" the researchers said.\n\nCNN's Arman Azad contributed to this report.",

        "body": "New York (CNN Business)A handful of states and cities have mandated that shoppers wear coverings in grocery stores and other public places as they try to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut retailers are struggling with how to convince their customers to follow the requirements. Major chains have yet to ban those who don't put on masks, even as labor advocates push for more protections for frontline workers.Stores are reluctant to antagonize shoppers by turning them away.Wegmans, for example, wants to minimize \"the likelihood of conflicts in our stores\" and will \"not put our people in the position of having to deny entry to our stores,\" even in states where masks in public settings are required, a representative said.At Stop & Shop, workers are telling customers who don't wear masks in the states where they are required to \"expedite their shopping trip, and then requesting that they wear a mask next time,\" a spokesperson said.Read MoreHowever, anxious workers and their allies are calling for policies ordering customers to wear masks or face coverings to protect them and other shoppers from the virus. The virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even if people do not display symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\"Keeping grocery stores safe for both customers and workers means everyone must wear masks,\" said Marc Perrone, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. \"We are urging both elected leaders and grocery chains to make masks mandatory for both customers and workers.\"'Not the mask police'Decisions around customers wearing masks are playing out against the backdrop of more grocery and retail workers getting sick from the virus and dying; some states planning to reopen retail stores that have been shuttered during the crisis; and mixed signals from public officials.More than 60% of Americans report that they have worn a mask on their face outside of their homes, Gallup said Friday.Several smaller grocers have started requiring that all their customers wear masks inside stores, yet larger chains like Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Whole Foods, CVS (CVS) and others have stopped short of this step. \"It can be a bit more difficult to enforce this requirement in parts of the country where it's not mandatory,\" said a Walmart spokesperson. The company wants to \"avoid situations that may create a confrontation\" with workers. Some grocery workers believe that their companies' failure to make shoppers wear a mask puts them at risk.\"They allow the customers to freely walk around the store without masks,\" said Dionna Richardson, a cashier at Ralph's grocery store in Los Angeles and a member of the United Food and Commercial Workers union. Los Angeles has required that customers wear a mask or covering in stores, but Richardson said Ralph's was not enforcing the regulation. Ralphs is owned by Kroger (KR).Richardson said she asked a customer to wear a mask, but was reprimanded by her store leader. \"I was told that it was none of my business and that I was not the mask police.\"A representative for Ralph's did not comment on Richardson's account, but said Ralph's requires customers to cover their faces and states its policy on signs posted on the front door of all stores.\"If a customer attempts to enter our store without a face covering, they are directed back to their vehicle to retrieve their face covering or something suitable to cover their mouth and nose,\" the representative said. \"A store leader may also provide a face mask for the customer to use, where available, for free.\"Shifting guidelinesNew Jersey, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Hawaii, Miami, Austin, Washington, DC, and others have recently ordered shoppers to wear masks or face coverings in stores. Their requirements differ, however, and most do not come with a penalty for either shoppers or stores.Nellie Brown, director of workplace health and safety programs at Cornell University's Institute of Labor Relations, said if a state has made requirements on masks, \"that would take precedence.\" However, \"if a state were silent on the issue, the store could make its own requirements.\" She believes a \"mask requirement of customers would protect employees, as well as other customers.\" Instead of forcing customers to wear masks, big grocers and retailers have taken safety steps such as screening workers' temperatures, installing plexiglass dividers at cash registers, adding social distancing signs and markers, and enforcing customer capacity limits. But a handful of smaller grocers around the country are prohibiting customers from shopping without a mask, even where it's not required, including Nugget Market, a chain of 15 stores in California.\"I know this might upset a few of you and I apologize in advance, but this will offer all of us the most protection!\" CEO Eric Stille said in a statement on April 8. \"Extreme times call for extreme measures and I feel this is what's best to help curb the spread of the virus and protect us all.\" In Memphis, Cordelia's Market is requiring customers to wear masks.\"We have a fair amount of not only customers, but also elderly employees,\" said grocery manager Angelina Mazzanti. \"We know that we're going to have some pushback from customers.\" Customers can buy a mask or bandana at the store if they don't have one, she added. Smart & Final, a chain of more than 300 stores in California, is also doing this. \"If a customer doesn't have a mask or face covering, we politely ask them to return with one or they can purchase one in our store,\" a spokesperson said.",

        "body": "Shauna Springer, the chief psychologist for the Stella Center, is one of the nation's leading experts on PTSD and trauma. Known as \"Doc Springer\" in the military and veterans' communities, she has worked with hundreds of veterans over the past decade. Her next book, \"WARRIOR: How to Support Those Who Protect Us,\" published on May 18. The views expressed here are her own.\n\n(CNN)Suffering from anxiety attacks, sleepless nights and surges of irritability, people around the world are experiencing the same emotional trauma that military veterans have felt for decades.\n\nThis is especially the case for our frontline healthcare workers, and those who support them. Those who serve in our healthcare system are the tip of the spear in the battle against the novel coronavirus. Doctors, nurses, technicians, EMT's and paramedics, embedded behavioral health providers and hospital cleaning staff -- all of whom are risking their lives to save ours -- face another threat. It's the increased risk of trauma from doing their jobs under such extremely difficult circumstances. Many of these warriors are also military veterans. Because they are able to compare this situation to being in the combat zone, it carries a lot of weight when they tell me this is creating more trauma than they experienced during their military service. They also tell me that it's a punch in the gut to see people clustered together, doing outdoor workouts and other social gatherings that could put them at continued risk. They need Americans to make the connection that our behavior has a direct impact on their safety, and the safety of those they love.Read MoreHealthcare workers are warriors in scrubsHere are some ways to understand what they're going through and how you can support them. An invisible enemy. The threat they are fighting is impossible to see and even harder to contain. Since the virus is invisible, and there is a delay between infection and the presence of detectable symptoms, our healthcare workers must try to stay two steps ahead of what they can't see. A battlefield mindset. Like our nation's warriors, our healthcare workers are expected to be ever vigilant to a threat that has life or death stakes. They may not meet criteria for a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), but many will have a condition that I call \"chronic threat response.\"Chronic threat response is defined by an escalation of many of the hyperarousal symptoms associated with post-traumatic stress -- sleep difficulties, floods of anxiety, irritability, problems concentrating, and a hair-trigger startle response.Everyone can be re-assigned. In the military, one's \"MOS\" is one's \"military occupational specialty.\" Yet, for many veterans, there can be a loose connection between their MOS on paper and what they do when deployed to the combat zone. When we need \"all hands on deck\" in a time of war, anyone can be reassigned to fill a critical gap-- as door gunners, convoy truck drivers or other roles that may be far outside their role on paper. Right now, health care workers are also being asked to step up in ways that may not align with their training.Physical and emotional exhaustion. Because we need them, healthcare workers are being asked to push through exhaustion. Like our warriors, healthcare workers have training and skills that cannot be replaced by others in our society. To live in this perpetual crisis state, many of our healthcare workers have effectively moved into hotels near their work or are sleeping in the hospitals and medical facilities between shifts.Working despite equipment shortages. In the early days of the Iraq War, we did not have the infrastructure or the necessary equipment to protect our warriors. They traveled in Humvees without special armor and many did not have the body armor that was provided as the conflict played out. Likewise, equipment shortages mean many of our healthcare workers are not properly equipped with personal protective equipment to face the coronavirus threat.Impossible choices with limited information. The best medics in the military know that they cannot save everyone or make the right call in every case based on the limited information they have. Healthcare workers are facing those wartime-like decisions now, and we can see it in the \"1,000 mile stare\" experienced by many veterans. Their haunted look is created by a level of trauma combined with emotional exhaustion that cannot be put into words.They see trauma they will never forget. They are seeing things that are hard to put into words -- traumas that will burn themselves into their memories forever. As one military veteran and ICU nurse in my network said, \"I return to another shift and hold the hand of an elderly man or a very young woman who had to die alone because we cannot allow visitors right now.\"Guilt over who can't be saved. When health care workers lose a patient, it weighs on them. Even if they know that logically they made the best choice they could, the feeling of helplessness is a burden that weighs on our healthcare providers. They may have nightmares that emphasize a loss of control.They risk losing their colleagues. As they work to stem the tide of this threat, thealthcare workers are bracing themselves for some of their colleagues to fall ill and potentially die from the threat. And when they lose a colleague, like our warfighters, they may feel a suffocating form of survivor guilt, wondering why they were spared when their fellow workers have fallen.Their family's sacrifice. Health care workers are burdened by the knowledge that their families are impacted by their absence, and the risks they take to do their jobs. They know their families, including their partners, young kids and elderly parents in fragile health, are separated from them during a time of skyrocketing anxiety. Let's support our health care workersUnlike those often unseen sacrifices made by those who serve in foreign war zones, we can directly witness our healthcare workers' sacrifices. That may make it easier to support them from just a few miles away. Here's how to help. Offer support proactively. Trauma is inherently destabilizing and disorienting, so don't ask them if they need anything. Offer meals, laundry support, treats for their kids (all delivered without contact) or even a card that says thank you. Those on the frontlines of care will benefit from a proactive approach that does not wait for them to \"opt in\" to get support.Don't require resilience. In the fluid chaos of this crisis, our health care workers will struggle at times. They will be tested more than most of us. From working with military veterans, I know that during times of personal struggle, the memory of being called \"resilient\" can push a person away from the support of others, into a kind of solitary mental exile. I would suggest the alternative goal of encouraging our healthcare workers to draw strength not from their own resilience, but from leaning on us to support them well as they face these unprecedented challenges.Offer a safe space to express emotion. Many people withdraw from others' grief and loss, feeling unsure of how to support those who are grieving. One of the most helpful things we can do is to create an emotionally safe space and allow others in our lives to feel and express whatever they are thinking and feeling. This is a gift we give them, especially at a time when we ourselves are carrying extra anxiety and stress. We can bear witness to their pain, and trust them to draw strength from our support.Step up to make masks. Psychologically, it's not good for any of us to sit in our foxholes and wait for more bad news. If you have skills with your hands, you are needed right now. You can make good use of your time and skills to protect our healthcare workers in practical ways -- by sewing masks and making additional protective gear. Just as we called out an under-appreciated workforce during World War II to make munitions to protect our nation, let this be a call to our society's makers to use their skills to do battle on this deadly virus.Share their stories to encourage social distancing. Despite urgent warnings from credible healthcare authorities, lockdowns in major cities, and laws passed to enforce social distancing, many people still aren't taking these measures seriously. One of the best ways to influence our peers is to tap into the good will most Americans feel right now for those in the military and first responder communities. These fellow citizens are making tremendous personal sacrifices. Consider your decision to wear a mask and practice social distancing another thank you for their sacrifice.",

        "body": "Washington (CNN)The Supreme Court on Friday denied a request from New York and other states to block the Trump administration's controversial \"public charge\" rule during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe rule makes it more difficult for immigrants to obtain legal status if they use public benefits such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers.Earlier in the term, a 5-4 court said the rule could go into effect nationwide while legal challenges played out, but the states had asked the justices to reconsider that decision given the implications of the virus. The court denied the request with no noted dissents but indicated the states could ask district court for further relief. New York Attorney General Letitia James on Friday confirmed that she would be asking the US District Court for the Southern District of New York to halt implementation of the rule.New York, Connecticut, Vermont and New York City had asked the justices to block the rule nationwide, arguing that while they are trying to stop the spread of coronavirus, the government's rule is deterring some immigrants from accessing health care and public benefits that are \"essential tools for protecting the public at large\" by limiting the \"spread and severity\" of the virus.Read More\"Such narrow and temporary relief\" is warranted, James argued.In the petition, James provided examples of the impact of the rule on immigrants. \"A physician in Connecticut has spoken with patients who had symptoms consistent with Covid-19,\" James wrote, \"but were afraid to obtain Covid-19 testing or seek treatment due to concerns about the Public Charge Rule and fears that they could not afford to pay for treatment.\"She said the unwillingness for immigrants to come forward jeopardized their safety but also the public at large.\"Immigrants who lack testing and treatment are also more likely to spread the virus to other people inadvertently, contributing to the current exponential growth of infection rates and fatalities,\" she said.A county in Illinois and immigrant rights groups in the state also asked the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision. The two cases had been on separate tracks.In court papers, the Trump administration told the justices to reject the request in the New York case.

Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is currently president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global non-profit initiative that is part of the global public health organization Vital Strategies. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.\n\n(CNN)The Covid-19 pandemic is a global, all-hands-on-deck moment. Every day, it asks a great deal from all of us, from policymakers and epidemiologists to health care professionals to every person who stays at home to protect others. It's forcing us to find new ways to work together to flatten the curve, protect our health care workers, strengthen public health and bring us all closer to the end of this crisis.\n\nIt's only natural that the biggest tech companies, including Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft, are stepping up as well, not only by donating to Covid-19 relief efforts, but also by harnessing their unique ability to rapidly solve problems and scale solutions. In the pandemic, the commitment to apply technology solutions to societal problems can help save lives and restore the economy, if it is channeled into the right solutions. That means these tech titans should focus on their expertise and share what they know. They should provide solutions that support our existing public health infrastructure. And most fundamentally, they should know when not to step up, sometimes resisting the temptation to help in order to follow that age-old promise in the Hippocratic oath, do no harm -- especially to the public trust that is crucial for effective response to the pandemic.Crises can provide fertile soil for a bias toward action, even when an action isn't needed. In a global pandemic, that bias often takes the form of an overreaction of surveillance. Ideas such as using apps for proximity-based automated contact tracing, as attempted in China and South Korea, and as Google and Apple have begun to explore, make assumptions about uptake and accuracy that are implausible. Worse, to make them more feasible could mean making participation hidden or coercive, threatening the very trust that an effective and democratic public health system needs. We've learned that lesson of surveillance too many times in the post-9/11 world. Proximity-based tracing applications may have some role supporting comprehensive contact tracing programs in the future, but only if they avoid over-promising, address privacy and feasibility barriers, and demonstrate accuracy and value.What tech companies can do is navigate the waters they know and focus on what they do best. Facebook, Twitter and Google, for example, have become not just ways to stay connected to people -- especially important in the midst of physical isolation -- but also places people turn to for information. That's why we were pleased to see these companies quickly elevate information from trusted sources to the top of news feeds and search pages, and for YouTube to aggressively take down harmful misinformation. Pinterest, Apple and others have released apps that facilitate health education and self assessment. There is still room for improvement, but these have been promising steps.For the next steps, tech companies can help by telling us what they've learned. The expertise tech companies bring to the fight against Covid-19 is powered by data insights that could be transformational if opened to the public. Google and Facebook, for example, recently announced their work to make Community Mobility Reports and a Mobility Dashboard available to the public, providing de-identified, aggregate data on how communities are responding to shelter-at-home orders and physical distancing. Big tech is learning more and benefits us all by sharing what it knows freely and publicly.Read MoreThese companies can also help by empowering us to do our jobs better. Not by creating something new, but by empowering the people who have been doing this work for decades. Carnegie Mellon University's Delphi epidemiological research center worked to develop a way to forecast where Covid-19 may hit next. They searched for a survey tool broad enough to launch their new symptom mapping project and found a partner in Facebook, which opened the survey to users of its platform. With this massive community of users, these epidemiologists were able to connect with a wealth of information that can inform our responses on the front lines and help us prepare for and possibly prevent future outbreaks. As epidemiologists, we are enthusiastic about this new data feed. It has the potential to serve as a crucial early warning system that can help save lives and preserve economic activity.One of our most important public health activities moving forward will be contact tracing. Apple, Google and Microsoft can contribute by helping public health workers do their job more effectively. Partnerships between our public health experts and our nation's leading technologists can be transformational in ways that will continue improving our health long after Covid-19 is no longer the emergency it is today.We are at a unique moment in human history, but not just because of this pandemic. Outbreaks of disease have left their scars throughout history. What makes this time unique is that we have, at our fingertips, a wealth of information, data and insights that would have been unimaginable in pandemics of the past. If we and the companies that hold this data use it well by building on expertise, sharing de-identified data widely, supporting public health and focusing on doing no harm, we can turn a new chapter in how humanity fights these invisible viral enemies with more interconnected human intelligence.",

        "body": "(CNN)With nearly all states partially reopened this week, backlash and frustrations are growing Friday as Americans struggle with ways to combat the deadly coronavirus.\n\nMore than 45 states by Sunday will have relaxed restrictions on some combination of businesses, services or parks, hoping to lift economies crushed by a pandemic that has killed nearly 76,000 people in the United States and infected over 1.2 million. In the past week, tensions between two goals -- a desire to keep people healthy and a desire to get people working -- have been increasingly laid bare, with groups asserting one is being emphasized at the cost of the other.More than two-thirds of Americans -- 68% -- are concerned about their states being reopened too quickly, according to a new poll from Pew Research Center. But after weeks of stay-at-home orders, protesters have taken to the streets for days, demanding states allow businesses to reopen. Even mandates to wear masks to stop the spread of the virus have become a flashpoint, leading to one alleged killing in Michigan and accusations of government overreach. Read MoreAnd the dire financial news continues. The US economy lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the government said Friday -- by far the most sudden and largest decline since it began tracking the data in 1939. That's on top of 870,000 jobs lost in March. The tally for those two months is more than double the US jobs lost during the financial crisis of 2007-2008.Meanwhile, evidence continued emerging this week that the virus is hitting certain vulnerable communities -- such as those at nursing homes and prisons -- the hardest. Experts say relaxed social distancing restrictions will make death tolls worse than they would have been. One model from the University of Washington projects 134,000 coronavirus deaths nationwide by August, nearly double its previous forecast.States are not ready to reopen, experts warnHealth experts warn that states have not met the federal guidelines for reopening, including aggressive testing and tracing, and a downward trajectory of documented cases in a 14-day period. Reopening risks setting off another wave of the pandemic and its effects will not be immediately known. \"It will be at least two to three weeks before we see an increase in the number of infections because it takes time for individuals to infect others and for them to display symptoms,\" said data scientist Youyang Gu, whose coronavirus projection model is cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Lifting measures prematurely could lead to a rebound of the virus, putting the US in the \"same boat that we were a few weeks ago,\" when the number of infections skyrocketed daily, said Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. New guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers more detailed reopening suggestions beyond the ones provided last month by the administration, including specifics for schools and churches. But the Trump administration will not implement it, a senior CDC official said Thursday. Calls to wear masks become a flashpointTo slow the predicted spread of the virus, some cities are asking people to wear masks in public places. But those guidelines have been met with resistance, leading to confrontations. In Michigan, two incidents involving masks made headlines nationwide. In one, a Family Dollar security guard was shot dead after he told a woman to wear a face mask, officials said. Police also arrested a man who allegedly wiped his nose on the sleeve of a Dollar Tree employee who asked him to wear a mask. Protesters have flocked the Michigan Capitol for days, demanding an end to the state of emergency in place through May 28. But Gov. Gretchen Whitmer also relaxed restrictions so some businesses can reopen and the public can participate in outdoor activities like golf and motorized boating.Hundreds of miles away, the city of Stillwater, Oklahoma, revoked an order requiring residents to wear face coverings inside buildings after workers received threats. Steven Taylor, a clinical psychologist and author of \"The Psychology of Pandemics,\" said people tend to rebel when they're told what to do, even when the measures are to protect them.\"People value their freedoms,\" he said. \"They may become distressed or indignant or morally outraged when people are trying to encroach on their freedoms.\"The virus is hitting hard in some vulnerable communities As some people rebel against protective measures, the virus continues to hit hard in places where social distancing is not an option. Thousands of inmates have tested positive for coronavirus in federal and state prisons -- many of whom showed no symptoms. In Ohio, more than 20% of the people infected with coronavirus are prisoners. And in Colorado, the state's largest outbreak is in a correctional facility. Things are just as bad in nursing homes, where the population is especially vulnerable. In Louisiana, more than 30% of the state's coronavirus deaths are from nursing homes and long-term care facilities. In New Hampshire, they make up nearly 80% of the cases while in Arkansas, almost half of all of the state's cases are in prisons and nursing homes. Officials in several states have called for more testing in correctional facilities and nursing homes. \"Nursing homes have been ground zero for Covid-19,\" said Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.It's taken a deadly toll on the black communityAmerica has an inequality problem and the coronavirus crisis is making it worse.The pandemic is leaving few people untouched, but the toll is far more deadly for African Americans, who are dying at higher numbers.African Americans make up 13.4% of the American population. But counties with higher black populations account for more than half of all coronavirus cases and almost 60% of deaths, according to a new study.Disparities, including access to health care, are likely to blame, researchers concluded.\"Structural factors including health care access, density of households, unemployment, pervasive discrimination and others drive these disparities,\" researchers said. \"Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for Covid-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.\"The study involved scientists from Emory and Johns Hopkins universities, the University of Mississippi Medical Center and Georgetown University.Of the more than 3,100 counties researchers studied coronavirus cases from late January to mid-April, they found deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties.\n\nCNN's Scottie Andrew and Maggie Fox contributed to this report",

He is the editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book \"Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos.\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles at CNN.\n\n(CNN)What is most galling as the nation faces its worse crisis since World War II is how the Trump family keeps demanding recognition for their brilliant work and also our thanks for the catastrophic mess they have helped land us all in.\n\nCase in point is Jared Kushner, who has fallen upwards throughout his life, inheriting a vast real estate empire and then making one of the worst purchases in the history of Manhattan, which was buying the office building 666 Fifth Avenue for a then-record $1.8 billion in 2007, a lemon which was only finally taken off his hands after his father-in-law became president. So, perhaps it was only fitting that he was awarded the job of shadow secretary of state at the beginning of the Trump administration.Kushner was in charge of managing the US-China portfolio, a responsibility that drew criticism, given Kushner's own business interests with China.He also destroyed any vestige of American leadership in the Middle East with his promotion of the reckless Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his sabotage of the two-state solution in Israel. Read MoreAccording to officials cited by The New York Times, early on in the Covid-19 crisis, Kushner privately agreed with his father-in-law that this whole coronavirus thing was being overblown by the lamestream media.Kushner then championed a new Google site where you could go and get your virus symptoms tested. His father-in-law touted 1,700 Google engineers who were working on the site at a White House news conference in March. If that sounds like a fantasy, it was. And now, Kushner comes to Fox News, the Pravda of the Trump administration, to marvel on Wednesday that the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus is \"a great success story,\" claim that that \"we have all the testing we need to start opening the country\" and state his hope that \"by July, the country's really rocking again.\" This is as more than 60,000 Americans lie dead -- more than the death toll of the Vietnam War -- and more than 1 million have been confirmed to have been infected with the virus with no end in sight. There is widespread agreement among experts that we don't have the testing capabilities to return to any semblance of normal life and also that a second wave of infections could hit the country badly later in the year. During World War II, the United States had Franklin Delano Roosevelt and George Marshall to navigate us through a crisis that saw the US spend more than a third of its GDP and during which more than 12 million Americans donned military uniforms.Today, we have a completely unreliable President -- anyone can get a coronavirus test, the virus will disappear when the warm weather comes, the list of Trump's whoppers goes on and on and on and on -- and his feckless son-in-law as coronavirus czar prattling on about bringing more private sector efficiency to government. Meanwhile, Trump demands thanks from governors when he is just barely doing his job as president. This is the kind of thing we expect in a banana republic: the nepotistic incompetence and the demands from the public to lavish praise on the brilliant ruling family. It would be laughable if there weren't so many lives lost already and so many more in our future.So, Jared Kushner, we, the American public, want to thank you for your service.",

        "body": "(CNN)Esron Torres' grandfather was admitted to a hospital in Manaus, Brazil, with a finger wound. Days later, he was buried in one of the city's many overcrowded cemeteries. A handful of relatives attended the small ceremony, while others listened over the phone as the family's patriarch was laid to rest.\n\nAccording to his death certificate, it was not the wound that killed him, but Covid-19.The tragedy highlights the massive healthcare crisis facing this city, the capital of the northwestern state of Amazonas, and the strain on local institutions' ability to contain the coronavirus.Officials have attributed just 532 deaths to Covid-19 in Manaus, but the actual total is likely much higher. City data shows that 2,435 people were buried in April alone, compared with 871 burials during the same month a year ago. Shocking images have also emerged of excavators digging mass graves at the Parque Taruma cemetery, to accommodate the spike in burials. Manaus mayor Arthur Virgilio Neto told CNN Brasil he feels the city has been \"abandoned\" during the health crisis. \"I would like to create awareness around the world because I can't seem to get Brazil to wake up to the strategic importance of my state and my region,\" Neto said.Read MoreOvercrowded hospitals The pandemic has left many of the city's public hospitals overcrowded with nowhere to treat patients, doctors in Manaus told CNN Brasil. They also said overcrowding made it challenging to isolate those who may be presenting Covid-19 symptoms. Torres says his 69-year-old grandfather was placed in the same hospital room with at least two people who appeared to be suffering from coronavirus symptoms, after his blood pressure shot up during a minor surgical procedure. His death certificate later confirmed he had died from complications from Covid-19, according to Torres. Though he was not tested before hospitalization, Torres said his grandfather had not shown any symptoms consistent with coronavirus before entering the hospital and believes he caught the virus while in intensive care. Now, his main concern is keeping his grandmother safe. \"My grandmother is also a part of this at-risk group, so she's now our main concern,\" Esron said. Sandra, another Manaus resident, shared a similar story. CNN agreed to use only her first name because of the sensitive details she shared. Sitting outside a different public hospital, she said her mother had been checked-in after suffering a stroke. When her mother started displaying some symptoms consistent with Covid-19, she was moved into a room with people who had tested positive for the virus. \"She is lying in there surrounded by people who have that Covid disease. They are all mixed together in the emergency room,\" Sandra said, as she yelled outside the hospital and fought back tears. \"There are people in there with the virus who are contaminating others.\" Tests later showed she had contracted coronavirus. Sandra believes she was infected while she was hospitalized, although this could not be confirmed by CNN. 'No rules or norms' Dr. M\u00e1rio Vianna, the president of the Amazonas Doctors' Union, said hospital maternity wards have become high-risk areas for the spread of coronavirus infections.\"The maternity wards became one of the main areas for infections because there isn't an isolation plan,\" Vianna told CNN Brasil. \"There are no rules or norms for isolation.\" Vianna also said doctors are being exposed to the coronavirus, due to low staffing levels and lack of personal protection equipment (PPE), and that many go to work in fear of dying or of losing colleagues.\"Lives are being lost due to the incompetence of several authorities,\" Vianna said. \"I blame the deaths of healthcare professionals on the government, which didn't provide any protections. It's a criminal situation.\" The Health Ministry did not respond to CNN's questions on whether doctors were ill-equipped to handle the pandemic. Vianna himself tested positive for coronavirus on April 21st and recently appeared in a hospital bed, with breathing tubes in his nostrils during a May 1st video message of support to fellow medical workers. 'Stay home'The gravity of the pandemic has not always been publicly acknowledged by Brazil's top leadership.President Jair Bolsonaro has compared the coronavirus to a \"little flu,\" pressured governors and mayors to lift quarantine measures in order to boost the economy and has attended rallies and protests in Brasilia with massive crowds of supporters.On Tuesday, Bolsonaro predicted that Health Ministry data would show that \"the worst had passed.\" In fact, that national death toll announced later that day was the highest on record. On Wednesday, it rose again.Mayor Neto said that he thinks the worst is still ahead, predicting that infections could peak in Manaus in May. Manaus is globally known as the gateway to the Amazon rainforest region, and Neto has called on world leaders and climate activists, including Greta Thunberg, for help. In a video posted to his personal Twitter account, Neto asked Thunberg to help bring awareness to the situation in Manaus. Thunberg retweeted a photo on May 5th showing mass graves in Manaus to her 4.1 million followers with the hashtag #SOSAMAZONIA.Health Minister Nelson Teich traveled to Manaus on Monday, where he visited several hospitals and met with local authorities, including Neto. The Health Ministry on Monday said it hired and brought in 267 medical professionals to support the city's health teams. The Ministry also provided additional PPE, including N95 masks, goggles and hand sanitizers. To date, Brazil has confirmed more than 125,000 coronavirus cases and at least 8,536 deaths. At least 9,243 of these cases have been registered in the state of Amazonas, with more than half of those cases in Manaus, according to the latest data released by the state's health secretary.

    "The Doctor Will See You Now ... Online: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's coronavirus podcast for May 6": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "(CNN)As health care systems across the country focus on fighting the coronavirus pandemic, many have halted nonessential and non-emergency services. But plenty of people still need medical care for other reasons. What should you do if you need a doctor right now?\n\nFor some, the answer lies in telemedicine. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta speaks to Dr. Gregory Esper, who leads Emory University's telehealth initiatives, about how technology is changing the way health care is delivered.You can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.Dia Sue-Wah-Sing: I felt like I had symptoms about two weeks prior, and I was just concerned about having to have an emergency trip to the hospital during the pandemic. But because I knew the appointment hadn't yet been fully flat-out canceled yet, then I was like, OK, I'm just going to ride this out. Dr. Sanjay Gupta: Two weeks before Dia Sue-Wah-Sing had a previously scheduled doctor's appointment in April, she started experiencing some pain in her side. Read MoreBut with concerns of Covid-19 cases overrunning hospitals, Dia was faced with a question many of us are asking right now: Should I still go in to see my doctor?Today, we'll talk about when to seek care not related to Covid-19, and how doctors and hospitals are reaching their patients from a distance.I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\"Sue-Wah-Sing: It's like, running and being dehydrated and having like a significant cramp on your side.Gupta: At the beginning of April, in the middle of this pandemic, Dia Sue-Wah-Sing began having some pain. At first, she didn't know what it was. Sue-Wah-Sing: Oh, maybe I just like slept funny, or you know, sometimes you're like, maybe I'm just sitting in a weird spot because we're all doing a lot of Zoom and trying to get cozy for those. But I'd had it for a while, and I had it for a few days. Gupta: Then, Dia began to recognize the symptoms. She has a history of kidney stones and realized that that would explain the pain. Fortunately, Dia was scheduled for a routine ultrasound on April 15. Because she was nervous about Covid-19, Dia initially wasn't sure if she should go in for her appointment. So she called the hospital and spoke to a nurse about what they were doing to keep patients safe.Sue-Wah-Sing: She talked about general precautions that the hospital had in place. So there are checkpoints, they have less entrances open. You know, there is kind of that basic medical screening. So, you know, have you traveled? Do you have a fever? Do you have a new cough? Gupta: After speaking with the nurse, Dia decided to go in for her appointment. So, on April 15, she drove to the hospital and had an ultrasound of her kidney.Sue-Wah-Sing: And it was like kind of being at the airport. There were two booth setups that were legitimately like health-screening checkpoints. So it's like there's hand-sanitizing stations, sanitize your hands, come to the booth, say who you are, check in. And in the waiting room, they had it cornered off. And they had 2 meters or 6 feet apart for the waiting room chairs. So you could only sit in selected chairs. Gupta: Dia was in and out of the hospital in less than an hour. Later that day, she got a call from her doctor to discuss the results.Sue-Wah-Sing: We went through my symptoms, my imaging. And the next steps. So I thought it was kind of nice because I think sometimes your physicians don't always look at your stuff until you're like, hold on. Who are you again? But I think they have the time to take a breath right now, that they actually are coming to the table prepared in the telemedicine appointments. So it's like, huh, this is the most efficient it's been. I should do this all the time. Instead of, you know, being there for two-thirds of the day. Gupta: Because of the coronavirus pandemic, Dia's experience has become a common one. Hospitals have quickly taken their services online, doctors are seeing their patients on video or over the phone, and medical records are being shared more often electronically. It's a process that minimizes exposure to the virus and could also save people some travel and wait time.These practices are a part of what's known as telemedicine. The number of medicare beneficiaries who received telemedicine visits rose from 10,000 a week to 300,000 a week in the last week of March, according to the Wall Street Journal. To learn more about it, I spoke to my colleague Dr. Gregory Esper, a neurologist and also director of telemedicine at Emory University.Gupta: Whenever I'm looking at new technology as a doctor, but also as a journalist in the back of my mind, I'm asking myself, is this technology just a substitute for what already exists or is it adding value in a way that this technology can do differently in some way? How about with telemedicine? Is it just a substitute for an in-person visit? Or can it do things that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do? Dr. Gregory Esper, professor and vice chairman of Emory University's department of neurology: One of my favorite examples is there was a Parkinson's patient who was falling at home, and the Parkinson's physician looked at their environment and noticed that there were multiple trip hazards in place on the floor and directed the patients to take care of all of those trip hazards by moving the shoes or moving this or moving that to clear walkways. So that is something we haven't seen before, which is an advantage to telehealth. But here's another one. Let's say that the patient desires more frequent contact with their provider, but they live 200 miles away. Telemedicine becomes the venue by which that contact happens. Gupta: So as a neurologist, if you're doing a telehealth visit the right way. What does that entail? What does that visit look like? Esper: Well, it starts far before I see the patient. It starts when our staff is contacting the patients and asking them if they would be comfortable to do a telemedicine visit. Then we schedule the appointment, and we'll have the medical assistants prep those patients. And then the patient will be ready for the physician. And then we open the video and then we, we actually begin the conversation with a consent. We actually will ask the patient, is it OK for us to continue with this telemedicine visit? And the patient will generally say, yes. And then we proceed. We do the history. Tell me about your headache? What side is it on? Patient might point to the side. Is your vision affected? Do you have nausea? And we then proceed to a physical examination. There are so many things that we can do on video that will help us confirm our hypothesis for what's happening in the history. Gupta: When the patient is seeing you or the health care provider on a screen, what are you seeing in addition to the patient? Are you able to look at previous laboratory values that the patient may have had drawn through their blood or previous scan results? Esper: Everything that is accessible in an in-person visit is accessible in a telemedicine visit. And we have actually implemented systemwide capabilities for image capture where we are asking the patients to upload their MRIs, or their prior scans, or we can obtain those from partner organizations that have electronic connections with us. Gupta: It's been really interesting, Dr. Esper, with my kids at home and doing Zoom school. You know, one of the things that comes up sometimes with three kids is just the speed of the connection and then downloading things at the same time. How much of a factor is that just in terms of the quality of the online services? Esper: Well, I think it ranges from people who actually don't have internet service in their area, for which we do telephonic visits, to those who have spotty coverage, in which the video is a little bit choppy. And part of getting comfortable with the technology is learning how to mitigate those factors during the examination. Gupta: Because of the novel coronavirus, the government has temporarily allowed Medicare and some other health insurers to cover these sorts of procedures. We're going to see how that carries out going forward. But how is the coverage? Esper: Medicare has really stepped up and has made it easy and not a barrier, I would say, for patients to get care because the reimbursement is at parity compared to what it was before. Gupta: I remember hearing at the White House when they said there is going to be a significant investment in telehealth necessary, because of the contagiousness of this virus. How much has telehealth changed? Just even over the last few months now? Esper: Well, I can give you some statistics from Emory. We basically were doing zero outpatient telemedicine at the beginning of March. Since that time, we have trained and certified almost 2,200 physicians, residents, fellows to do telemedicine and do it in the right way. And we have seen almost 50,000 patients since the beginning of March through audio video telemedicine. Gupta: So from basically zero, as far as patient care, to 50,000. Is this now here to stay? Or will it go back, do you think, once the Covid pandemic is addressed? Esper: Well, I can tell you that my hope is that it is here to stay because I think it is a critical care model for us to be able to continue, especially for those patients who have difficulty making it to appointments, that potentially need more frequent follow-up; for patients where you need to see them in their own environment, which is their home. And we hope there is no going back. It's not the solution for everything, but it certainly is an arrow in our quiver for how to take care of patients effectively. Gupta: Telemedicine is being used for so many health services right now. So, for those of you who are wondering whether you can or should get your mammogram, see your dentist, take your child to the pediatrician, see someone for your mental health. ... Here's what CNN found:For preventative check-ups, like mammograms or colonoscopies, until things change, you might have to wait until your hospital reopens before doing it. But do check with your doctor for details.For parents, if it's urgent, try to take your child to the ER at a chidren's hospital, if possible. If it's not urgent, talk to your primary care doctor and get their advice.As for dentists, they're unfortunately at very high risk of catching the virus because it spreads through droplets of saliva in the air. That's why most dentist offices have canceled everything but emergency procedures. But no matter the situation, still call your dentist, and they'll walk you through it.If you're hearing a pattern here, you're right. The bottom line is, if you're feeling unwell, still call your doctor. They may even have more time nowadays to take your call. They can help you figure it out and make the safest possible plan for your care. But if it's an emergency, especially if you're experiencing chest pain, or shortness of breath, or stroke symptoms, don't hesitate then. Just call 911 and get to the nearest emergency room. We'll be back tomorrow.

    "The Latest on Testing: Dr. Sanjay Gupta's coronavirus podcast for May 5": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "(CNN)We've addressed early questions about testing for Covid-19, but plenty remain. CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta explains the latest on the different types of coronavirus tests and how well they work.\n\nYou can listen on your favorite podcast app or read the transcript below.Dr. Sanjay Gupta: When you were a kid, did you ever make one of those pinhole cameras? Where you cut a little hole into a piece of cardboard and then looked through it? Well, in some ways, that's kind of how we're looking at the coronavirus noawadays: through a tiny little window.Part of the reason we haven't been able to get a bigger picture is because this is a new coronavirus, and we're learning as we go along. We've also had inadequate testing across the nation, so the inability to know the true extent of this outbreak becomes a major barrier in terms of getting the country back to work. We need clearer vision, and so far, we haven't had that.Read MoreI'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\"Gupta: There are currently only two types of coronavirus tests available in the United States. Because I'm a health care worker who still takes care of patients in the hospital, I've had both of them. Doctor: I'm going to give you a little poke over here. OK? Gupta: OK.Doctor: Poke. You doing OK?Gupta: Yep.Doctor: And just like that, we're all done.Gupta: That's it. OK.Doctor: Let's get you wrapped up. Gupta: Early on, there were some significant delays in testing, and there was also the release of a flawed test, which really put us far behind. Since then, there have been a lot of unauthorized, unvalidated tests, which have flooded the market. The most common and most accurate test we have is called a PCR test -- a polymerase chain reaction test. Now that's the one that detects whether or not someone is currently infected with Covid-19. It involves a saliva test in some cases, or more commonly, a nasal swab. CNN's [Anchor] Brooke Baldwin referred to it as a \"brain tickler.\"Brooke Baldwin, CNN News Anchor: Oooooh!Doctor: One more. ... All done.Baldwin: [giggle]Gupta: So that gets sent off to a lab, where the genetic material is extracted. And because there's such a small amount of that genetic material, it is then amplified. That's the polymerase chain reaction. If all goes well, results usually come back within a few hours, but it can take a few days if you have to send it to a lab somewhere.Then there are the antibody tests. Those are the ones that can determine whether or not someone has had Covid-19 in the past and might have some immunity to it now. Those involve collecting a small blood sample, either through a needle in the vein or through a blood spot sample. But here's the problem: Antibody tests have not been consistently accurate. There are a lot of bad tests out there, and it's still unclear how much those antibodies might protect you from the virus in the future. When you're testing for the virus, the biggest problem would be having a false negative. Why? Because you would think that you don't have the virus, and then you might go back out into the community, into a nursing home, into a hospital -- and potentially infect people. With the antibody test, what you're really hoping to avoid is a false positive. Then, someone might feel that they have the antibodies, thus feel that they are protected, go out into the community, to a hospital, to a nursing home and spread the virus. So with the diagnostic virus test, you really have to reduce false negatives; with the antibody test, you really have to reduce false positives. Kevin de Le\u00f3n, senior fellow at University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy: The promise of the immunology test to find out if we have the antibodies is huge.Gupta: That's Kevin de Le\u00f3n, senior fellow at the University of Southern California's Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy. The institute supports test sites across Los Angeles.De Le\u00f3n: This can influence policy makers at the local, at the state and federal level. That can actually inform us when it comes to social distancing. If I'm immune, and scientifically I've been proven to be immune, then I can reenter the workforce and I can play a bigger role in making sure we're safer. Gupta: A company called Roche announced that it received emergency-use authorization -- EUA -- for an antibody test it claims is more accurate than most. Roche says it has already started shipping its new test to leading labs around the world.Here's Roche CEO Severin Schwan.Severin Schwan, Roche CEO: It's really special because it's so accurate, it's almost near-perfect accuracy. And what that allows us is to really reliably test whether a person has been infected by the coronavirus or not, irrespective of whether you had symptoms or not. Gupta: Now there's another kind of test that could be useful here. It's called an antigen test. Again, the test for the virus is the PCR or diagnostic test. The test for the antibody is called a serology test. And now the antigen tests look for a protein on the surface of the virus. You may have already had one of these if you've ever had a test for strep throat or the flu.Here's the problem: A reliable antigen test for the coronavirus isn't yet available in the United States, but the hope is that we'll soon have something that works kind of like an at-home pregnancy test, where a test strip would change color to tell if you might have the virus.Frederick Nolte is a pathology professor and the head of coronavirus testing at the Medical University of South Carolina. Frederick Nolte, Medical University of South Carolina professor and director of clinical laboratories: Antigen detection has been part of the diagnostic landscape for a number of years, and it has a number of appeals. It can be done relatively quickly, it's inexpensive, it can be deployed in a number of clinical settings outside of the laboratory, near to patients. But the chief concern with it has been the sensitivity. Gupta: And a low sensitivity means a high false negative. And with high false negatives, people feel that they don't have the virus, and they go back out into the community and potentially continue the spread.So \"How available are PCR and antibody tests to the general public?\" is probably the question I get more than any other.Well, as of Monday, Johns Hopkins University's Covid Tracking Project was reporting over 7 million people in the United States have been tested. And they mean the diagnostic, or PCR test, in this case. But again, the initial rollout of those tests was fraught with problems. And that caused major delays in the country's early response to the pandemic. Those problems are being addressed now, but there are still supply chain shortages. The PCR test requires certain transport mediums, reagents and, yes, nasal swabs. And those things have been in short supply. But just last week, the mayor of Los Angeles announced free diagnostic testing for all of the county's residents. Eric Garcetti, mayor of Los Angeles: Because we know the 10 million residents in L.A. county need that. It's critical for us opening up in the future.Gupta: That's Mayor Eric Garcetti on CNN.Garcetti: And we wanted to be the first big city in America to take the advice of doctors around the country saying, \"You have to find the silent spreaders. This is a silent killer,\" that people without symptoms who can spread this are a critical piece of knowledge in order to open up in the future.Gupta: And in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio says the city will produce its own Covid-19 test kits, in partnership with a 3D printing company.Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City: We realized we had to find another source. The global market wasn't working. There weren't sources around this country that were reliable enough, so we decided we would make our own. And this has had to be put together very quickly. So we're really in uncharted territory creating these test kits in New York City. Gupta: Again, it's these nasal swabs that have been in such short supply in so many places around the country.Now there are also plenty of antibody tests floating around that haven't been reviewed or validated by the FDA. The agency said Monday that it was tightening its policy to keep unproven and even fraudulent tests from entering the market. It's been a big problem.In one study of 12 antibody tests, four were shown to deliver false positive results more than 10% of the time. Remember, if you're testing for antibodies and you get a false positive, people may incorrectly assume they now have the antibodies and are protected and then go out into public and keep spreading. You really want to get that false positive rate under 2% -- as low as possible, really.The future could lie in at-home testing. Antigen tests would be the easiest to mass-produce for home use. But again, like I said, we don't yet have a reliable antigen test for Covid-19. White house coronavirus task force member Dr. Deborah Birx said this last month, on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"Dr. Deborah Birx, coronavirus response coordinator, White House Coronavirus Task Force: We have to have a breakthrough innovation in testing. We have to be able to detect antigens, rather than constantly trying to detect the actual live virus or the viral particles itself. And to really move into antigen testing. Gupta: If an antigen test is approved and mass-produced, it may serve as a valuable screening tool, but it's probably not going to replace the PCR saliva or swab tests when it comes to diagnosing Covid-19. The antigen test in this case would just be used to screen. The PCR test would still be the most accurate. According to The Guardian, scientists working for the U.S. military have designed a PCR test that has the potential to detect the virus as early as just 24 hours after it's contracted. That could help stop infected people from spreading the virus before they even show symptoms. And keep in mind, a lot of people never show symptoms but can still spread the virus. It's another promising \"maybe.\" And remember this: Testing does need to go hand in hand with contact tracing. Once you find out who is infected, that person needs to be isolated. And then everyone who has had close contact with that person needs to be traced. And sometimes those people need to be quaratined as well. Test, trace and hopefully treat. My colleague Anderson Cooper and I asked Bill Gates about this at CNN's town hall last week. Bill Gates, philanthropist: If you want to try and open up, this contact-tracing thing has got to be taken seriously. South Korea took it seriously. It looks like there's an effort in New York that [former] Mayor Bloomberg is helping out with that will do some of that. That's a necessary part of reopening is to have the quick turnaround tests that actually low-income people can get access to, but the contact tracing to follow up so those people hear very quickly if they've been infected.Gupta: Things are getting better, but it is clear that we're still not where we need to be. It's a brutal truth, but one that needs to be told. There aren't enough PCR or diagnostic tests to meet demand, and the antibody tests haven't been as accurate as they need to be. And this is exactly why I keep advising people to behave like you have the virus. A lack of tests means a lack of knowledge.The availability of quicker, easier and more accurate testing is crucial to get the country back on its feet. We'll be back tomorrow.

Dr. Ken Duckworth, chief medical officer, National Alliance of Mental Illness: I do worry about our first responders and health care workers, in terms of the trauma they are exposed to.Ana Cabrera, CNN Anchor: Even physicians are victims of this unprecedented public emergency.Read MoreDr. Sanjay Gupta: Since the beginning of this pandemic, health care workers have been dealing with this virus head-on, putting their own physical health at risk.According to a CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] report released in April, more than 9,0000 health care workers have been infected with the coronavirus. ... And because of the limited data we have, that number is likely higher. But we shouldn't forget the other risks our health care workers are facing. I'm talking about the emotional and psychological ones. [Pots and pans banging, people cheering for health care workers]Gupta: Every night in cities around the world, we celebrate our health care workers. But the thing is, even before this pandemic, their jobs were demanding. They're in high-stress life-and-death situations with long hours. So in this episode, I want to talk about the pandemic's psychological cost to the people on the front lines -- and what's being done to help them. I'm Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. And this is \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\" Dr. Philip Breen: She was a doctor. Every bit of the word that a doctor should be. She put her life on the line to take care of other people. Gupta: That is Dr. Lorna Breen's father. Last week, Dr. Breen, a New York City emergency room doctor, died by suicide. She had actually contracted Covid-19 herself. After recovering she went back to work. Breen: She was like the fireman who runs into the burning building to save another life and doesn't regard anything about herself. Gupta: There is so much about this virus that is new and unfamiliar, making everyday life more challenging. I've heard that from my colleagues. Every day they wonder: Are they safe? And if their families and loved ones are safe as well. I recently spoke with Dr. Steven McDonald. He's an ER doctor at the same hospital as Dr. Breen. He's been on the front line for weeks, taking care of patient after patient ... after patient. New York has been the US' pandemic epicenter, with more than 321,000 people infected and 25,000 deaths. I asked Dr. McDonald about how he's coping with his everyday reality as well as the loss of a colleague, and how he's taking care of his own mental health. Gupta: So how is life, Dr. McDonald? Dr. Steven McDonald: First of all, things are changing day-to-day. I think life a month ago looked very different than only two weeks ago than it does today. Thankfully, emergency department volumes are significantly down. But also, as you can imagine, the tenor of my department is depressed. We just lost one of our faculty members, one of our physicians. And so there's definitely a pall that's been cast over my department -- in addition to this pandemic. Gupta: I'm so sorry to hear that. I don't think people always recognize both the physical and psychological toll on frontline workers like yourself. At what point for you did it become something that was personally frightening? McDonald: As we were approaching the peak, I would walk into the emergency room and it was in a state of chaos. And it was overwhelming to an extent that I had never really seen before. It felt -- I keep describing it as though a caged animal had been kind of let loose, and no one could see it or get it back into the cage. Gupta: Wow. You know, I've been -- I finished med school in 1993, so I've been doing this for a long time. And typically, you know, the family is there. There's an additional line of support. But what you're describing is people who are coming in, almost always by themselves because families can't come in. And now they find themselves in a position where they may suddenly die. It's tough. I don't mean to paint it so stark, but it sounds like that is the reality, at least in some of these situations. Let me ask: How worried were you about contracting the virus yourself? McDonald: If I'm being honest, you know, early on, I think this was probably mid-March when this was first starting. I had a moment at home by myself, borne out of complete irrationality, where I suddenly was convinced that I was going to die of this. I can't explain to you where that came from. I think it was just maybe having read a couple too many of these cases and having talked to a couple of colleagues who had pronounced young people dead of this. And I just suddenly was gripped by that conviction. And it was frightening. It was really frightening, just to feel like there's nothing that I can do in this. I have truly no agency over my death in some regard. There's no amount of PPE that will protect me from this. And I know that to be irrational. I know that to not be true, but I was so gripped by it in one moment.Gupta: I agree with you, and I think that's a really interesting way to put it. You know, we do all the right things, but there are things in life, especially with a microscopic virus that's inexplicable. So you're really putting yourself at risk.McDonald: Right.Gupta: Did you ever think about sitting it out? Saying, you know what? It's not worth it. McDonald: You know, I did have a moment where -- I think it was a Sunday night and I had my first shift in a couple of weeks on the Monday. And I was, to be totally honest with you, I was a wreck. I was a wreck. I was calling family and friends. And I was really upset. And I was thinking about the number of people who I was going to have to pronounce dead or have to have end-of-life conversations with. And I found it so overwhelming in the abstract on that Sunday night. I thankfully have a great support network, a great therapist -- and spoke with her a bit and was able to sort of pull myself together and work and be a physician the next day. But that was a difficult 24 hours.Gupta: You know, Steven, it's always struck me that even within the medical community, there is still a stigma about seeking therapy, seeking mental health support. Yet it's so important, maybe never more important, than it is right now. Do you sense that stigma? I mean, has it manifested at all in your life? McDonald: I mean, you know, absolutely. I would say physicians don't talk about mental health issues. I don't know if any job is really that open about this, but I think medicine in general breeds a culture of silence about this. Gupta: And you do hear about physicians who die by suicide. Compared to the general community, it's typically higher across the board. There was a lot of news about Dr. Breen lately. And I know you knew her somewhat. When you heard this, were you surprised? McDonald: Absolutely. I was completely floored. She always -- again, I only knew her in a professional capacity, but she struck me as someone who was so self-possessed and so capable, really tough as nails and able to deal with any situation head-on.And, you know, I esteem all of my colleagues as being that tough. Gupta: Has there been anything good that's come out of this for you? McDonald: So I think there has been incredible camaraderie among physicians. At the peak of this, we had orthopedists and urologists coming down and managing critically ill patients and doing blood draws and doing things that are way below their level of training just to help out, and to see colleagues who were so willing to be part of this effort was really inspiring. You know, secondly, and I think this remains to be borne out, but one hope that I have: This virus, I think is sort of peeling back the onion skin and showing us at the core of American society, things that really need attention on a federal and legislative level.So, the inequalities that this is exposing, the problems in the health care system that this is exposing. And I hope that these are conversations that are started and carry weight and are not forgotten after we beat this thing. Gupta: Camaraderie as well, you're absolutely right about -- I've seen that in our own hospital. Although it does make me think of this joke that you probably heard: the definition of a double-blind study? McDonald: No? Gupta: Two orthopedic surgeons trying to read an EKG. McDonald: Hahahaha. I love that. I will not be telling that to my orthopedic colleagues, but I love that. Gupta: I want to ask you about, you know, if there's been a best moment and a worst moment. McDonald: Yes. Worst moment for me was. ... It was during the peak, and I was coming into a shift. I received sign-out on probably 40 patients who were all critically ill.And so I was in this awful situation where I was pulled into one room to be with a critical patient who was dying. And then the nurse comes and gets me and says, you also have a critical patient who's dying in this other room. And so I run through to this other room, and this woman is near death. Her heart has nearly stopped. Her oxygen levels are falling. She's already on a ventilator. She was in her late 80s. And the team is, the team of residents is looking to me, to ask: What are we going to do when this woman's heart stops, as it appears it's going to in the next 10 seconds, 15 seconds? And this woman had no established advanced directives. And we had made multiple attempts to get in touch with family and were unable to. And, you know, all the data shows that someone of this age who's already on a ventilator, this person is not going to live no matter what interventions you make. And so, talking to you now, it seems very obvious to not attempt to prolong life. But in that moment, it was very hard for me to make that decision. It was -- there was no clarity about it. And so, I declined to perform CPR. But then I felt terribly about that in the moment. That was really the lowest moment I've had during this, where I just felt like I ended someone's life without any data. I guess, in terms of bright spots of this -- so you're familiar, I'm sure, with the 7 o'clock clap for providers and essential workers. And so, after Lorna Breen's passing, I was working that next day. And we did at 7 o'clock go out to the front of the emergency department. All the doctors who were able and the nurses and everyone, and we just had a hell of a clap for those whom we've lost. And it doesn't in any way redeem what's happened. But it was a really nice moment of camaraderie and to celebrate the accomplishments of those whom we've lost, including Dr. Breen. Gupta: Wow. Well, I mean, going back to the worst moment for a second, for what it's worth, Steven, that was a tough decision. I'm sorry that obviously left such a mark on you. But from what you described, you know, it was the correct decision. McDonald: Thank you. Gupta: Do you worry that you're suffering from post-traumatic stress? McDonald: It's hard to say. I mean, I think like post-traumatic stress disorder, when you're in the thick of it, you don't think about it. And it's only once things calm down that you begin to have things like flashbacks or intrusive thoughts. So far, I've been very fortunate in that I have not had those symptoms, but I can't tell you with any certainty that I won't in the future. And so that is a perpetual source of anxiety and concern. Gupta: Well, I mean, I will clap harder and cheer even louder after hearing your story about how that made you feel. I mean, it's the least I think that people can do and people really owe you a debt of gratitude. So, thank you very much. There'll be books written about the sort of work that you've done. I know you're in the midst of it right now, so it's hard to sense that, but thank you. McDonald: Thank you. Thank you so much. Gupta: Like Dr. McDonald said, doctors are facing so many challenges right now. There are these long, demanding shifts, the risk of exposure to the virus and the number of patients that are dying, which is unlike anything we have ever dealt with before. Dr. John Krystal, Yale University professor of psychiatry and neuroscience and Yale-New Haven Hospital chief of psychiatry: You know you think of the first wave of illness being the wave of patients coming in and presenting with illness. But for these health care workers, the stresses are somewhat cumulative. And so you can think of a second wave of stress coming through for the Covid health care workers. Gupta: That was Dr. John Krystal. He heads the psychiatry department at both Yale University and Yale-New Haven Hospital. He's been tasked with leading a group that identifies health care providers who are struggling and provides them with support. Krystal: One kind of support that we have is giving people a place they can drop into any day they want, every day, five days a week. We have what we call stress and resilience town halls. They're open to everybody in the community: staff, trainees, doctors.The idea was they should connect to deal with the isolation that they're often feeling. They should unload, you know, they should just share what it is that they're going through and then to learn a few skills. And so we teach people relaxation skills, and we teach people sleep hygiene. And so far, I think in our community, over 1,400 people have made use of them. Gupta: Dr. Krystal and his team also established a buddy system -- pairing health care workers with their peers. And then they dispatched volunteers to provide psychological support to anyone who wants it, over the phone. But both Dr. Krystal and Dr. McDonald bring up a more deeply rooted issue about the culture of medicine. Krystal: You know, some of the challenges are that some of the characteristics that we have historically admired most about physicians: They're willing to sacrifice themselves for others, their reluctance to complain about things. All of those are admirable, wonderful traits, but somehow, we haven't always inculcated in the values of our medical system that self-care is as much a duty and a responsibility as caring for the patient. And my hope is that this is an opportunity to have broader discussion about that. And to make it OK for more doctors who need help to seek help. Gupta: This pandemic has really tried and tested the best of us. But I am thankful that mental health services are available for our doctors and medical workers who need it the most. A fund was recently set up in honor of Dr. Breen -- it's called the Dr. Lorna Breen Heroes' Fund, and it's there to provide mental health services to medical workers.It's my sincere hope that the support that's been marshaled to help health care workers in this pandemic will last beyond this moment -- that they'll become a fixture in the way we think about care. We'll be back tomorrow.

        "body": "(CNN)The United States will have to be able to perform millions of coronavirus tests each week before restrictions can be safely lifted, economists and public health experts say in two different plans for reopening society.\n\nThe two reports differ in their recommendations for just how much testing is needed. One calls for 3 to 30 million tests a week, while the other says the country will need to be doing 20 million tests a day to get a handle on the pandemic.Both proposals, though, cast doubt on the country's readiness to relax social distancing measures, which some states are already beginning to do.So far, the US has only performed about 4 million coronavirus tests, and governors have reported continued shortages of the materials needed to run tests, from chemical reagents to swabs.But experts say testing will be critical as the country returns to some sense of normalcy. Without testing, they say, officials won't be able to detect new infections and notify those who have been exposed so they can avoid infecting others. Read MoreAnd without contact tracing and targeted isolation -- both of which rely on testing -- there could be a resurgence of cases that again threatens to overwhelm the health care system, the reports warn.They echo what World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said last month: \"We have a simple message for all countries: test, test, test.\"While many have called for increases in testing, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said in a Friday press briefing that \"it is beyond the possibility to test everyone in this country every day.\"It's just not possible.\"Top names in health care say millions of tests will be neededOne plan, released Tuesday by the Rockefeller Foundation, says the US should expand testing capacity to 3 million tests per week within the next two months, a level that could allow parts of the economy to restart. The country should further expand capacity to 30 million tests per week over the next six months, the proposal says.A who's who of experts contributed to the plan, including Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer, former FDA commissioner Mark McClellan and cardiologist Eric Topol, founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute.The proposal calls for an emergency network to coordinate testing nationwide. It says coronavirus outbreaks will continue for the foreseeable future given how contagious the virus is and how little immunity the population has against it. Because the virus is new to humanity, virtually everyone is susceptible to infection.\"Reopening the economy will be most successful if we move decisively to both increase testing capacity and optimally deploy testing supplies,\" the authors said, noting that their plan would be \"the largest public health testing program in American history.\"Widespread testing would be paired with contact tracing, and the proposal calls for a \"Covid Community Healthcare Corps\" of up to 300,000 people to find people exposed to the virus. New technology -- including digital apps -- could help track cases.The plan would cost the US around $100 billion, according to the Rockefeller Foundation, which says it is investing an initial $15 million into the project.Up to 20 million tests could be needed each day, Harvard report saysAccording to a different group of experts, whose work was also supported by the Rockefeller Foundation, the US will need to deliver at least 5 million tests per day by early June to begin reopening. It says as many as 20 million tests per day would be needed to fully remobilize the economy, ideally by late July.The \"Roadmap to Pandemic Resilience,\" published Monday by Harvard University's Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics, argues that without widespread testing, state and local officials will get caught in cycles of opening up and then clamping down again on commerce and free movement.\"What we need to do is much bigger than most people realize,\" the report reads. It recommended an approach called \"targeted isolation.\" Under the scheme, tests are given to those who have symptoms and those with presumed exposures, such as health care workers.People who have had contact with a confirmed case are tested, too. While anybody who tests positive would need to self-isolate, those who test negative wouldn't necessarily have to go into quarantine -- unless they're waiting for initial test results.That would allow people with possible exposures to continue participating in society -- so long as they're tested regularly during the virus' \"incubation period.\"Plan calls for federal coordinationTo oversee the mass increase in testing, the Harvard report called on the federal government to set up a \"Pandemic Testing Board.\"The board would have \"strong but narrow powers\" and would have \"the job of securing the testing supply and the infrastructure necessary for deployment of testing.\"At least 100,000 personnel would be needed to assist with contract tracing, the report said, citing earlier research from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.But even 20 million tests a day may not be enough to protect public health. Facing an emergency, the report said universal testing might be required as an alternative to national quarantine. As many as 100 million tests a day could be needed, with tests administered through work or school.\"By the time we know if we need to do that,\" the team wrote, \"we should be in a better position to know how to do it.\"",

        "body": "Life is still happening, from birthdays to memorials, and we are looking for ways to honor these moments from afar.\n\nCNN Underscored has interviewed experts and found the best options to help you cope during this uncertain time. Find all our coronavirus-related coverage here, and let us know your thoughts here.\n\nSending a colorful flower arrangement during this time of social distancing may be the perfect way to brighten someone's day. Life is still happening, from birthdays to babies to memorials and beyond, and we are looking for ways to honor these moments from afar. So, from sunflowers and succulents to roses and ranunculus, here are 10 reasons -- and coordinating arrangements -- to send a bouquet to a family member, friend or co-worker.\n\nSo, you'll have to throw a virtual birthday party this year. But at least the guest of honor will have a beautiful bouquet of blooms to admire! Filled with daisy pompoms, spray roses and sunflowers, this bright and cheery arrangement comes in a rustic tin vase and features a \"happy birthday\" sign. Let the virtual singing commence! If you're celebrating the birthday of a child or someone with more of a dog-loving silly side, splurge on this a-DOG-able in a Basket ($59.99; 1-800-Flowers.com) arrangement.\n\nMost of us are currently unable to host or attend funerals and memorial services. It can be devastating to not be able to honor the loss of those who have impacted your life in person. Share your sympathy with a spathiphyllum floor plant -- better known as a peace lily. The blooming plant arrives in a lovely hand-woven, white-dipped basket, stands more than 2 feet tall and will serve as a tribute to the life of your loved one much longer than a floral arrangement would.\n\nWhether someone helped you with something big (brought you disinfecting wipes when you thought there weren't any to be found!) or small (helped you figure out this whole virtual happy hour Skype thing!), nothing says \"thank you\" quite like a gorgeous bouquet. This bright blue, hardy hydrangea plant is chic in a modern slate pot rimmed in copper and should last for seasons to come.\n\nYou had a great couple of dates and can really see this relationship going somewhere. But shelter-in-place orders are going to delay things a bit. Continue the romance with this lovely bouquet, blooming with Love, Bogart and Carabella roses, plus ranunculus and raffine dianthus, all in shades of coral and peach. Add a simple glass vase for $12, or upgrade to a gold or charcoal style for $25.\n\nWhen you look at traditional anniversary gifts by year, flowers are recommended four years into the marriage. But, really, we can't think of anyone who would be disappointed at receiving a bouquet every anniversary (although we wouldn't turn down the addition of gold jewelry for year 14 -- just saying). It's likely that your favorite restaurant is closed, but if it offers delivery, order a meal, pop some bubbly and decorate the table with this peachy arrangement of Campanella, Free Spirit, and Star Blush roses. You can also splurge on the 48-stem $84 upgrade, plus an extra $10 for a signature vase to really wow your one and only.\n\nPeonies are said to symbolize good fortune, so fete the new grad in your life with this sweet pink bouquet. It's disappointing to have to miss such an important rite of passage, but this elegant, delicious-smelling arrangement in its blue Mason jar is a sweet way to say, \"You rock!\"\n\nNew parents may be stressed, sleep-deprived and, of course, totally smitten with their baby. Not being able to call on Grandma for help during this time is surely not making things easier. Surprise them with this too-cute ceramic unicorn vase overflowing with peach roses and miniature carnations, pink spray roses and waxflowers, white alstroemeria and blue sinuata statice, plus huckleberry and pitta negra. We're pretty sure they'll be smitten with you, too.\n\nMaybe your best friend got furloughed. Or your sister is knee-deep in work-from-home stress coupled with managing online school for her school-aged kids. Or you just really miss hanging out with your go-to happy hour pal. When you haven't been able to see your mom/sister/college roommate/favorite co-worker/all of the above in weeks, but you still want to let them know they're on your mind, this cheery, colorful bouquet of 30 assorted California-grown Gerbera daisies (that comes with a sleek rose-gold sloped metal vase) should do the trick.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson said, \"The greatest gift is a portion of thyself.\" The next best? A stunning bouquet that arrives unexpectedly. Especially this particular bouquet, which features alstroemeria, eucalyptus and a succulent that -- genius! -- can be planted later. It's a lovely way to let Mom and Dad know they're in your thoughts, whether they live nearby and you're missing your weekly get-togethers, or far away and you're just counting down the days until travel bans ease up so you can plan a trip.\n\nWhat a time to be recovering from surgery, recuperating from an illness or dealing with covid-19 symptoms. This graceful double-stemmed yellow orchid housed in an understated white ceramic vase may not offer healing properties, but it's bound to bring a smile to the face of its recipient.",

        "body": "Life is still happening from birthdays to babies to memorials and beyond and we are looking for ways to honor these moments from afar.\n\nCNN Underscored has interviewed experts and found the best options to help you cope during this uncertain time. Find all our coronavirus-related coverage here, and let us know your thoughts here.\n\nSending a colorful flower arrangement during this time of social distancing may be the perfect way to brighten someone's day. Life is still happening, from birthdays to babies to memorials and beyond, and we are looking for ways to honor these moments from afar. So, from sunflowers and succulents to roses and ranunculus, here are 10 reasons -- and coordinating arrangements -- to send a bouquet to a family member, friend or co-worker.\n\nSo, you'll have to throw a virtual birthday party this year. But at least the guest of honor will have a beautiful bouquet of blooms to admire! Filled with daisy pompoms, spray roses and sunflowers, this bright and cheery arrangement comes in a rustic tin vase and features a \"happy birthday\" sign. Let the virtual singing commence! If you're celebrating the birthday of a child or someone with more of a dog-loving silly side, splurge on this a-DOG-able in a Basket ($59.99; 1800flowers.com) arrangement.\n\nMost of us are currently unable to host or attend funerals and memorial services. It can be devastating to not be able to honor the loss of those who have impacted your life in person. Share your sympathy with a spathiphyllum floor plant -- better known as a peace lily. The blooming plant arrives in a lovely hand-woven, white-dipped basket, stands more than 2 feet tall and will serve as a tribute to the life of your loved one much longer than a floral arrangement would.\n\nWhether someone helped you with something big (brought you disinfecting wipes when you thought there weren't any to be found!) or small (helped you figure out this whole virtual happy hour Skype thing!), nothing says \"thank you\" quite like a gorgeous bouquet. This bright blue, hardy hydrangea plant is chic in a modern slate pot rimmed in copper and should last for seasons to come.\n\nYou had a great couple of dates and can really see this relationship going somewhere. But shelter-in-place orders are going to delay things a bit. Continue the romance with this lovely bouquet, blooming with Love, Bogart and Carabella roses, plus ranunculus and raffine dianthus, all in shades of coral and peach. Add a simple glass vase for $12, or upgrade to a gold or charcoal style for $25.\n\nWhen you look at traditional anniversary gifts by year, flowers are recommended four years into the marriage. But, really, we can't think of anyone who would be disappointed at receiving a bouquet every anniversary (although we wouldn't turn down the addition of gold jewelry for year 14 -- just saying). It's likely that your favorite restaurant is closed, but if it offers delivery, order a meal, pop some bubbly and decorate the table with this peachy arrangement of Campanella, Free Spirit, and Star Blush roses. You can also splurge on the 48-stem $84 upgrade, plus an extra $10 for a signature vase to really wow your one and only.\n\nPeonies are said to symbolize good fortune, so fete the new grad in your life with this sweet pink bouquet. It's disappointing to have to miss such an important rite of passage, but this elegant, delicious-smelling arrangement in its blue Mason jar is a sweet way to say, \"You rock!\"\n\nNew parents may be stressed, sleep-deprived and, of course, totally smitten with their baby. Not being able to call on Grandma for help during this time is surely not making things easier. Surprise them with this too-cute ceramic unicorn vase overflowing with peach roses and miniature carnations, pink spray roses and waxflowers, white alstroemeria and blue sinuata statice, plus huckleberry and pitta negra. We're pretty sure they'll be smitten with you, too.\n\nMaybe your best friend got furloughed. Or your sister is knee-deep in work-from-home stress coupled with managing online school for her school-aged kids. Or you just really miss hanging out with your go-to happy hour pal. When you haven't been able to see your mom/sister/college roommate/favorite co-worker/all of the above in weeks, but you still want to let them know they're on your mind, this cheery, colorful bouquet of 30 assorted California-grown Gerbera daisies (that comes with a sleek rose-gold sloped metal vase) should do the trick.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson said, \"The greatest gift is a portion of thyself.\" The next best? A stunning bouquet that arrives unexpectedly. Especially this particular bouquet, which features alstroemeria, eucalyptus and a succulent that -- genius! -- can be planted later. It's a lovely way to let Mom and Dad know they're in your thoughts, whether they live nearby and you're missing your weekly get-togethers, or far away and you're just counting down the days until travel bans ease up so you can plan a trip.\n\nWhat a time to be recovering from surgery, recuperating from an illness or dealing with covid-19 symptoms. This graceful double-stemmed yellow orchid housed in an understated white ceramic vase may not offer healing properties, but it's bound to bring a smile to the face of its recipient.",

        "body": "(CNN)Stop worrying about those runners and cyclists without a mask, whom you scoff at as you walk outside. Worry instead about the loud talkers in crowded indoor spaces.\n\nThat's according to Erin Bromage, a University of Massachusetts Dartmouth associate professor of biology, who started a blog about the ways in which coronavirus spreads to keep his family and friends informed. It turns out other people liked his smart, practical way of explaining the virus and risky behavior. His latest post, \"The Risks -- Know Them -- Avoid Them,\" went viral and gained more than 13 million views in about a week.The explainer illustrated how breathing versus talking loudly versus sneezing can put out different amounts of respiratory droplets in the air. \"A big part of me writing these posts is just to give some tangible advice to friends, family, about what risks they should really be worrying about and wasting mental energy on,\" he told CNN's John Berman on \"New Day.\"Read More\"Not a lot of my friends know what we should be doing now in this brave new world,\" Bromage said. \"I was trying to give them the tools they need to know if you end up indoors -- which we're going to -- in an environment where there seems like there's a lot of people, and it just doesn't feel right, then that's a situation that you should avoid. Use your feet, find somewhere else that feels more comfortable for you.\"Bromage, who also showed how an outbreak can occur even while social distancing in workplaces and other enclosed areas, answered more questions for CNN. His responses are lightly edited for clarity.CNN: Why are grocery stores, bike riders and inconsiderate runners less of a concern when compared to sharing enclosed spaces like an office or restaurant?Bromage: It comes down to the concentration of the virus in the air and the length of exposure. In larger spaces with better ventilation or outdoors, the concentration of the virus can be diluted in the larger volume of the air. The lower the virus burden in the air, the longer you can be in that environment before receiving an infectious dose.CNN: What is the difference between sneezing, talking loudly and singing in terms of virus transmission?Bromage: Respiratory droplet emission follows this sequence. Talking loudly emits a lesser amount of droplets than singing. Sneezing emits the most. The more force by which a sound leaves your mouth, the more respiratory particles are emitted, and they travel a further distance.CNN: If people have a cold or other virus, should they stay away from everyone as if they had Covid-19?Bromage: If Covid-19 is prevalent in your area and you have symptoms in the Covid-19 spectrum, you need to treat your sickness as Covid-19. If you are sick, you should stay home and you should limit interactions with household members.CNN: As states reopen, where can people go and where should they reconsider going?Bromage: People should go to any outdoor space with ample room for social distancing, such as beaches, parks and trails. However, they should limit their time in outdoor spaces where social distancing can't be maintained most of the time -- any crowded spot, such as the protests we have been seeing lately. People should also limit how much time they spend in any indoor spaces with poor air exchange and lots of people with no effective ability to social distance. I hope when we reopen, none of these places will exist, and guidelines would have been put in place to stop it from occurring. I believe that almost every business can engineer their space to ensure that they limit numbers of people at one time to a number that is determined by air exchange and size of their facility. CNN: What steps are you taking to keep safe in your home and community?Bromage: We repeatedly remind ourselves to wash our hands and not to touch our faces! If we go grocery shopping or hiking on a local trail, we wash our hands immediately after coming back to the house. We open packages in the garage and leave packaging outside.For the groceries that come in plastic packaging that will be refrigerated or frozen, we wipe down the packaging using disinfectant wipes. We allow the packaging to dry before we put those items into the fridge or freezer. All pantry items are just put away as usual.We wear masks in public where we can't socially distance all the time. We have higher-quality masks for environments where we linger, like the grocery store or work. And we have lower-quality masks for short interaction. We use a neck sleeve or T-shirt mask to pull up in places like a forest trail where we might have to pass within 6 feet of other people.CNN: What do you wish people would take away from your post?Bromage: With knowledge, you can limit your risk of infection and so you can take power away from the fear of the virus. People should know that enclosed spaces with lots of people and poor airflow are problematic. So avoid them when possible. And finally, feel comfortable in indoor or outdoor environments when you have plenty of space and good airflow.",

    "The coronavirus pandemic could push telemedicine into the mainstream": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "San Francisco (CNN Business)Telemedicine has been around for more than two decades, but its adoption among Americans has been relatively low. The coronavirus pandemic is quickly changing that.\n\nWith millions of people around the country forced to stay home in lockdown and worried about potentially exposing themselves to the virus, many of them are turning to telemedicine companies' virtual consultation services. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most people that contract the coronavirus only suffer mild illness and can recover without leaving their homes. Telemedicine companies are stepping in to give patients a chance to talk through their symptoms and decide if they need to be hospitalized.CareClix, a virtual health platform based in Alexandria, VA, has more than 20 million users across the US and says it saw a 50% increase in usage in March. Zipnosis, another telemedicine company based in Minneapolis, reported a 3,600% increase in virtual visits on its platform over an 11-day period last month. \"Unfortunately, it's taken some pretty extraordinary circumstances, but I think this will be a watershed moment for the industry,\" Zipnosis CEO Jon Pearce told CNN Business. \"Certainly in the past few weeks with Covid, I think people's desire to have trusted advice from medical providers is just gone through the roof ... and that's what we can facilitate in a very fast fashion. And more importantly, we can facilitate that without leaving your home.\"Both companies have different approaches to telemedicine. Read MoreCareClix, founded in 2012, connects patients to doctors through an on-demand video platform that attempts to recreate the in-person experience in a virtual setting -- similar to chatting with your doctor on FaceTime. \"We really try to mimic what's done in brick and mortar,\" said CareClix co-founder and CEO John Korangy. \"From the user's perspective for the patient and... the doctor, they're not doing anything different than they would if you came and saw me face to face. The only thing different is now we have a monitor in between us.\" While CareClix's technology is used by hospital networks and healthcare providers around the US, the company also has an internal team of doctors that can provide remote services to patients. Zipnosis, on the other hand, operates in what is known as asynchronous care -- where the doctor and patient don't need to be in the same place (even virtually) at the same time. The company, founded over a decade ago, has users fill out a virtual questionnaire through a chatbot-like tool that packages their responses for a doctor to review and diagnose. Zipnosis claims this can dramatically speed up the process, allowing doctors to make a diagnosis in an average of 89 seconds. \"Instead of talking to a doctor over video, you would answer a series of yes [or] no questions,\" Pearce said, \"the same questions they would be asking you in real life when instead of doing that, we have a really smart computer system do it.\"Telemedicine has its limitations -- some complex diagnoses and treatment may require in-person interactions. If a patient appears particularly sick, telemedicine companies will recommend they go to a clinic or hospital. But the technology can play an important role in easing some of the initial load from walk-ins, particularly as the global pandemic places strain on the healthcare system and makes people nervous about being exposed to the virus. \"What's happening is that people are worried,\" said Ann Mond Johnson, CEO of the American Telemedicine Association, a non-profit organization focused on increasing the adoption of virtual health technologies. \"People don't know really what to do, where to go, whether or not they should get a test for the virus. And so the hospitals are really deeply concerned about managing exposure.\"CareClix has begun offering free Covid-19 evaluations to its users, while over 40% of health care providers that use Zipnosis's technology are also offering free screenings. Johnson says telemedicine as a concept has been around for more than 25 years, but its adoption by both patients and doctors was relatively slow until the crisis. And there are still psychological barriers that need to be broken through.\"In point of fact, you all know that you've interacted with a physician or a clinician and have had them provide a lot of services to you without ever laying hands on you,\" she said. \"So part of it is overcoming this myth that somehow it's second class medicine.\"But the extraordinary circumstances created by the coronavirus appear to be leading to a breakout moment that telemedicine companies hope will sustain even after the crisis passes. \"It's been a desire of the industry for a long time where we stopped talking about telemedicine or virtual care and it just becomes healthcare,\" said Pearce. \"And I think this will be the catalyst for that.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Local plant nurseries are seeing spikes in seed sales.\n\nPeople are starting vegetable gardens big and small, including a plethora of backyard plots and windowsill herbs. Some plant lovers are engaged in community gardens where they work in timed shifts, maintaining proper distance while wearing masks and cleansing tools for the next use. As people sheltering in place take up hobbies and start projects to fill the time during the coronavirus pandemic, gardening is blooming. Caring for a garden can be a respite from the horrors of the pandemic, as it serves several natural desires related to accomplishment, community and belonging and staying connected with nature. Read MoreIt can get partners and the whole family outside, happily bonding while doing an activity together. It can also help to alleviate food insecurity as some incomes dwindle and concerns about the food supply grow. \"There's just a greater cohesiveness within the family unit that occurs outside with your hands in the dirt,\" said Charlie Hall, professor and Ellison Chair of the department of horticultural sciences at Texas A&M University. \"There's not as much eye-rolling when teenagers are told to do something, not as much fighting between siblings. There's fewer harsh words between spouses.\"Fulfilling human needsGetting your hands in the dirt keeps you connected to nature while we're staying indoors more these days. The orderliness gardening requires, with its rules and rows, can carry over into the manageability of other life tasks, Hall said. And the calmness of the activity may relieve some pent-up frustrations.\"Your cortisol levels go down dramatically when you're in the midst of gardening,\" Hall said. \"And cortisol is the stress hormone in your body, so you're less stressed.\"There's a risk-reward ratio inherent in gardening. You have to learn to balance weather that may thwart your efforts. But that experience bears sweet tomatoes or refreshing cucumbers -- offering a tangible sense of accomplishment when we're floundering around, looking for something to focus our minds. \"You're able to see the fruit of that effort,\" Hall said. \"That's a teachable moment in people's lives.\" And gardening may have a fitting philosophical lesson for us during this time. \"Sometimes pruning occurs,\" Hall said. \"That's where the [correction in times of stress comes from]. You prune a plant so that it's even healthier when it comes out from its pruning.\"As plants need water, fertilizer and sunlight to grow, we're nurtured by challenge and engagement with things we enjoy, Hall added. And when plants grow so well they outgrow the space in which they're needed, gardeners must replant them in a different space where they have the room to thrive. \"People move up into bigger areas of responsibility during their careers. There's all kinds of metaphors that come out of gardening and how it applies to everyday life,\" Hall said. \"Sometimes you have to be transplanted into areas where you could grow even further.\" Good for your overall healthGardening can be a coping mechanism during this unsettling stage of life, but it also comes with benefits for your physical and mental health. One study found gardening, among other leisurely activities, may prevent brain shrinkage in older adults. Our cognitive abilities, including learning and memory, largely depend on the size of our brains. Gardening has also been connected with mindfulness and alleviation of depressive symptoms. It's a mild form of activity offering respite from staring at your screen all day. And it can improve hand-eye coordination and finger flexion -- the ability to bend your joints -- that carries over to everyday life. How to start a home gardenMay is not too late to start a garden. Here's how to begin a vegetable garden for beginners, according to The Old Farmer's Almanac, a print and online periodical providing planting charts for gardeners, sky schedules, weather forecasts and recipes since 1792. Pick the right spot. Choosing a suitable location is important because it affects the quality of the vegetables, the guide says. Most vegetables need at least six hours of sunlight daily, so pick a sunny location. If you're not buying soil, you should have the soil in your yard tested for lead. Lead contamination is common in urban areas due to years of industrial development and pollution from manmade toxins, according to Garden Collage Magazine. If your vegetables are contaminated from the soil, that could mean lead poisoning for you or any pets roaming around. You can have your soil assessed by sending several samples to a testing site for a low cost. Plant the vegetables in damp, not totally saturated, soil. If you have soil that doesn't drain well, plant vegetables in a pot that's raised from the ground. You should also garden in a place where your plants can remain stable -- exposure to strong winds, floods or constant foot traffic could damage your plants.Choose a plot size. Beginners should start small, considering what they can handle and what they'll actually eat, the guide suggests. The size it recommends is 11 rows wide, each 10 feet long. But this guideline is to feed a family of four through an entire summer, so feel free to downsize if it's just you. Make sure there's enough space between each row to be able to easily walk through to weed and harvest your plants. The rows shouldn't be more than 4 feet wide, as you probably won't be able to reach over a bigger width to care for the vegetables. Select your vegetables (or any other produce). There are several vegetables that are common and easy to grow: tomatoes, radishes, chard, zucchini squash, peppers, cabbage, lettuce and carrots. Also consider what you like to eat, and again, how much you're likely to consume. Here's a guide to figuring out which vegetables grow best in your state. You could buy individual starter plants or opt to start from scratch with seeds. But the seeds should be high quality, the guide says, so your money isn't wasted if the seeds don't germinate. The almanac recommends buying seeds from a plant nursery; you can order them online, too. Decide where and when to plant. Planting one or two vegetables doesn't require much strategic planning. But if you're growing a whole garden, you'll have to think about where each vegetable will go and when it needs to be planted. Some vegetables, such as lettuce and root vegetables, grow in the spring. Others, including tomatoes and peppers, should be planted in the warmer months. Plant taller vegetables on the north side of your garden so they don't shade shorter plants. Check to see whether the information along with your plant says it needs a permanent bed. Lastly, stagger your plantings. Don't plant all your seeds at one time, or you'll have a vegetable bounty that needs to be harvested and consumed in a tight time window. If you stagger your plantings, you'll have a steady supply of food coming in.",

        "body": "(CNN)As coronavirus restrictions in the US are loosened, public health officials and state leaders have urged residents to continue practicing social distancing in order to prevent another spike in cases.\n\nBut Americans in prisons and nursing homes often don't have that option. In some states, those facilities make up a startling number of coronavirus cases. Across federal and state prisons, thousands of inmates have tested positive for the virus -- many of whom showed no symptoms when they were infected. In Ohio, more than 20% of the people infected with coronavirus are prisoners. And in Colorado, the state's largest outbreak is in a correctional facility. The numbers are similarly harrowing in nursing homes and are facilities across the country.In Louisiana, more than 30% of the state's coronavirus deaths are nursing home residents. In New Hampshire, long-term care facility residents make up nearly 80% of the state's cases. Read More\"Nursing homes have been ground zero for Covid-19,\" Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said last month.Officials across states have pushed to ramp up testing in both correctional facilities and nursing homes in hopes of catching up to the widespread numbers as family members stuck outside and separated from their loved ones wait for updates. In one state, half of all cases are in prisons and nursing homesIn Arkansas, almost half of all of the state's cases are in prisons and nursing homes. More than 1,000 inmates have tested positive for the virus, according to Dr. Nate Smith, the Director of the Arkansas Department of Health, and 876 of them are in a single correctional facility. A total of 261 nursing home residents and 148 staff members have also been infected, with at least 32 deaths in the state connected to the facilities. Arkansas has reported a total of 3,611 cases and 87 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. And in Ohio, people behind bars make up 20% of the state's total infections. More than 4,300 inmates have tested positive for the virus in total, according to data from the state's department of corrections. Ohio has recorded at least 21,576 cases of the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University. More than 2,100 Ohio inmates are currently positive -- 1,353 of whom are housed in a single facility, according to the corrections department data. At least 40 inmates have died. More than 480 staff members are also positive and two have died. \"The reason that you are seeing numbers out of our prisons, that are much, much higher than other places is because we made a decision to go test everybody. And when we've got a hotspot we move in and we've surged testing in,\" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said late last month.Largest outbreak in Colorado is a prisonIn Colorado, the state's largest hotspot is the Sterling Correctional Facility, which according to state data has reported 262 positive results -- about 10% of the facility's total inmate population.Corrections officials tested more than 400 inmates last month after eight were initially found to be infected. \"Given the insidious nature of this virus we had suspected that despite seeing a relatively low number of inmates with symptoms, the number of positives was potentially much higher,\" Department of Corrections Executive Director Dean Williams said when the widespread testing was first ordered in late April. In a news release this month, the state's department of corrections said that since mid-April inmates in the facility have been required to remain in their cells and can only leave to use the restroom or shower. Meals and medications are also delivered to the living units. The next largest outbreak, with 84 cases, is also a prison in Denver. Colorado has reported more than 17,830 cases and at least 919 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.80% of New Hampshire deaths in nursing homes New Hamshire Health Commissioner Lori Shibinette said Wednesday that while the state has begun seeing its community transmission, illness rates and hospitalizations start to level out or decline, the trend has not been the same in long-term care facilities.\"Based on our numbers in long-term care to date, we took some very aggressive action early on and I think at this point it's time to take further steps to address some of the long term care testing issues,\" Shibinette said. \"To date, we have tested over 1,000 nursing home residents across the state, which is a great number, we want to test more.\"About 111 people have died in New Hampshire -- 78% of whom were people associated with long-term care facility outbreaks, Shibinette said. \"I'm upset,\" says Andrew Delisle, whose mom died in one of the state's nursing homes, according to CNN affiliate WMUR. \"Do I think it could've been prevented? Probably. Would it have been inevitable? The way things have spread and the way things are going on, it may have. I think there's going to be a lot of soul searching.\"Shibinette said the state was rolling out a new plan for long-term care facilities in which, every week, the state will randomly select about 10% of its facilities and ask for swabs from 10% of the residents. The state's goal is to offer testing to all long-term care and nursing home staff members every seven to 10 days.In Louisiana, more than 30% of the state's deaths come from nursing home residents. On Monday, the Louisiana Department of Health reported that 688 nursing home residents had died and an additional 50 deaths were reported among residents of other adult residential facilities. Louisiana has recorded 30,399 cases and 2,167 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Half of New Jersey deaths in long-term care facilitiesNew Jersey's care facilities have also been hard hit. More than 50% of the state's deaths come from long-term care facilities, according to data posted by the New Jersey Department of Health. On Monday, Gov. Phil Murphy said he spoke with the National Guard over the possibility of using non-medical members to assist nursing homes. Those duties will include taking on janitorial, kitchen, security, logistics and general purpose roles, state officials said.\"We're asking for medical assistance, and that they would work under a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse, help with site testing, janitorial, cooking, meal service, family communication, administrative work, security, logistics, such as making sure that supplies and equipment are where they need to be, and then general purpose,\" Commissioner of Health Judith Persichilli said Monday. \"We've been on the phone and working with the General and his team all weekend and throughout today, so we hope to have something more positive in the next several days, but they've been more than wanting to help out. It's just to make sure that we put them in the right spots,\" Persichilli added.\n\nCNN's Jamiel Lynch, Jamie Gumbrecht, Kay Jones, Andy Rose, Dave Alsup, Rebekah Riess, and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

This counterattack is already showing preliminary results, but much of our effort will be for naught if we fully demobilize once this battle is won.There's a reason why militaries don't demobilize after each war. To face ongoing threats, our militaries maintain ongoing capabilities. Even though we've faced terrible pandemics before, we're now suffering unnecessarily because we've not applied their lessons to our ongoing war with deadly pathogens.Read MoreIf any military had failed as spectacularly as the world's governments have in preparing for and preventing this crisis, their leaders would have been summarily fired. The commanders who replaced them would then be judged by their ability to do everything possible to prevent the next crisis.As the levers of state power and public health around the world now shift into gear, we can expect better results over the coming months, potentially including ongoing development of one or more Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutic strategies for critical careBut even once we have a vaccine, we can't allow a full demobilization because as bad as this virus is, future pandemics could be even worse.The novel coronavirus hits the rare sweet spot for infectious diseases. It causes illness but many people have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, facilitating spread. It wasn't so deadly that it immobilized its new hosts immediately or, as would be the case with Ebola, provoked an immediate quarantine of affected areas. It succeeded in part because the true threat wasn't immediately recognized.The world of biology is dynamic by definition, so there has always been the chance that deadly viruses like this would jump from animals to humans. It's always been a question of when, not if. Through our destruction of national habitats, population growth, international travel, industrial scale animal husbandry and other actions, however, our species has massively exacerbated this threat.But naturally occurring viruses might pale in comparison to the viruses that could potentially be created by the powerful new tools of synthetic biology -- agents precision-engineered to cause harm.A recent piece in the journal Nature Medicine assessing the likely origins of the novel coronavirus concluded that, whatever the origins of the outbreak itself, SARS-CoV-2 is most likely naturally occurring because of the relatively inefficient way it hijacks human cells. In other words, if a malicious genetic engineer was intentionally manipulating a virus to be deadly and contagious, they could potentially do a much better job. In 2017, University of Alberta in Canada synthesized an extinct horsepox virus, a cousin of smallpox, for around $100,000. This science has advanced so rapidly and the cost has come down so precipitously that the same feat could today be achieved for just a few thousand dollars. Unlike nuclear weapons, the development of which need the type of massive infrastructure usually reserved for nation states, developing a synthetic pathogen is now within the capacity of many groups or even individuals distributed across the globe. The next pandemic may not be an accident of nature.But if we think about our struggle against any and all infectious agents as a battlefield, which we should, then we should learn from our most effective militaries about how best to prepare for what may be heading our way.Here's the plan:1. Maintain essential capabilities: The soldiers in our fight against deadly pathogens are our public health officials, doctors, government planners and data modelers. To build the standing capabilities we'll need for this fight, we must invest the necessary time and money to prepare for rare but inevitable events. With disease outbreaks, you pay a bit now for readiness or you pay a lot later for response, only with more human suffering added to the price tag. Once we have these personnel in place, we must plan and train like our lives depend on it. They do.2. Develop global and local surveillance networks: Militaries invest massive resources in monitoring their enemy's every action through satellite networks, spies and data analytics. To be ready for the next pandemic, we must develop new sensor systems that can identify new infectious agents in real time and use advanced data analytics to identify worrisome patterns of diseases well before a major outbreak emerges. 3. Build and maintain a network of alliances: Few militaries can succeed alone, and no country can protect itself from a deadly pathogen on its own. Pandemic preparedness must become a core and ongoing component of international cooperation. The World Health Organization can play the central role in this process, but only if it has the resources, staff and mandate to succeed. We must make that happen. 4. Build emergency response capacity: Militaries have expeditionary forces to take the battle to the enemy wherever a threat originates. We need the same capabilities for pandemics. The moment a tripwire is triggered indicating a potential pathogenic outbreak, trained emergency response teams, both national and international, must be ready to mobilize and equipped with tools and authority to respond.5. Forward-deployed personnel and weaponry: Transporting personnel and equipment to faraway locations is expensive and slow, which is why leading militaries deploy people and equipment near the theaters where they will most likely be needed. The organization of the US Strategic National Stockpile may need a review to put more medical equipment closer to the front lines in major urban centers. In recent years, the US government pulled back some of the personnel on the ground in foreign countries working in disease prevention. As we are now seeing, if we don't fight the skirmish of a pathogenic agent at its source, we can end up fighting a major war everywhere else.6. Invest in the defensive weapons of the future: Militaries are always building the next generation of weapons and working to counter the enemy's latest innovations. We now need to step up our efforts to create vaccine platforms that can rapidly counter novel threats as well as universal vaccines designed to target entire classes of viruses. Here, the growing power of synthetic biology to quickly design, build and deploy countermeasures in near-real time can be a powerful force for good.There is little doubt that we were not ready for the terrible and largely preventable crisis we now face. Our poorly planned, underresourced and haphazard global response has led to over 200,000 deaths, massively disrupted our lives and caused trillions of dollars in economic fallout.Shame on us if we are caught unprepared the next time.",

        "body": "(CNN)\"What day is it, again?\"\n\nIt's become a common refrain during the coronavirus pandemic, a reflection of both how all of the days seem to blur together and how lately, we find ourselves forgetting even the simplest of details. Our internal clocks are shot. Tuesdays are Thursdays are Wednesdays are Sundays. There are no weekdays, or weekends. There is only yesterday, today and tomorrow. Along with these feelings of disorientation, it may seem like it's getting harder to concentrate and taking longer to complete tasks, as if our brains are just working more slowly.If it feels like your brain is turning into mush, you're not alone. Experts say it all has to do with how the pandemic is affecting our cognitive health -- meaning, our ability to clearly think, learn and remember.Read More\"It is a perfect storm between changes in environment, loss of social anchors and increases in cognitive stress,\" said Elissa Epel, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. \"And then on top of that, most of us are not getting the quality sleep that we used to.\"Here's what's going on, and what we can do about it.Our usual routines are goneMuch like our bodies depend on environmental cues like sunlight to regulate our circadian rhythms, they also rely on physical and social cues, explains Epel.Those cues include routines like morning and evening commutes, set mealtimes or weekly religious services that help us keep track of what day it is.For those confined to our homes, those routines have largely disappeared. Days have lost their usual structure, meaning once-clear boundaries are now blurred. \"We've lost all of the routine of a typical week, and that means having weekends as a boundary or as a separation or something to look forward to,\" Epel said. \"Now the weekend is the same as a weekday.\"Because work is home and home is work for many people, some may find themselves working longer hours or into the weekends. Gone are the happy hours, concerts or sporting events that once separated weekdays from weekends, causing the days to just drag on.The loss of routine also means more mental energy is spent on determining what each day will consist of.\"When we had our routines, you don't really think about that stuff,\" said Lynn Bufka, associate executive director for practice research and policy at the American Psychological Association. \"So while your commute may be tiring, there's not a second dialogue in your head, trying to figure out what has to happen this day.\"For those who still need to go into work, routines may look a lot different. And there's the added mental strain of remembering to socially distance, wear masks and avoid touching surfaces. All of that can contribute to a sense of disorientation.We're multitasking a lot moreAnother reason we can't keep track of the days?We're multitasking a lot more. Many people are finding themselves balancing multiple responsibilities, such as homeschooling children or caring for an elderly family member -- all while holding down a full-time job or coping with the stress of a layoff.Because all of those things are now happening in the same place, and often at the same time, we may find ourselves switching in between tasks more frequently. Or we're overstimulated from using multiple screens or consuming news too many times a day. All of these things, Epel said, increase our cognitive load -- in other words, they use up more of our mental resources.\"Our working memory is a limited resource,\" Epel said. \"We can easily tax it by trying to engage in too many activities at once or trying to multitask in our mind.\"That's why you might find yourself struggling to recall basic information or perform the tasks you used to with the same efficiency.\"When (people are) attempting to multitask, it makes it more difficult to encode the information that's in front of them,\" said Inger Burnett-Zeigler, associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Northwestern University. \"Then the information is not stored and they can't remember what they were doing or what they were saying a moment or a few moments later on.\"Those disruptions are causing stressNot being able to remember what day it is can also be a symptom of stress, explains Burnett-Zeigler.The pandemic is becoming a source of chronic stress given that it's been going on for weeks, or even months for some people, she said. High stress levels impair our concentration and attention, and can affect short-term memory.Another effect of stress? It can worsen our quality of sleep.\"Often if you're feeling stressed or you're feeling anxious, those thoughts and feelings can show up and either make it more difficult to fall asleep or more difficult to stay asleep,\" Burnett-Zeigler said. That sleeplessness, in turn, can further cognitive impairment, attention and concentration issues and short-term memory loss, she said.Then again, time is relativeSo what can we do about all this?The psychiatrists and psychologists we spoke to recommended trying to maintain a sense of structure, to the extent possible. Going to bed and waking up at the same time each day is one strategy.They also recommended taking frequent breaks, exercising, eating healthy and limiting news consumption.And if it makes you feel better, no one knows what day it is anymore. Time is an illusion.",

        "body": "(CNN)Life as we know it in much of the world has been turned upside down by the coronavirus. But two countries have been widely held up as examples of how to handle a pandemic: South Korea and Germany.\n\nTheir approaches were markedly different -- but each is now in the enviable position of being able to ease restrictions imposed to quash the spread of coronavirus with some confidence that infections won't immediately spike again.So how are they preparing to return to \"normal\" life? In one word: Cautiously. And those watching enviously from other countries may notice that much remains far from normal.South Korea -- which in February had the largest outbreak outside of China -- used a combination of widespread testing, aggressive contact tracing, stern public health measures and digital technology to contain the coronavirus without having to impose a widespread lockdown. It also maintained a strict quarantine regime.Thanks to these measures, newly diagnosed cases have slowed to a trickle and the national death toll stood at 256 as of Friday, according to its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Read MoreAgainst that backdrop, the South Korean government on Wednesday started to relax its strict social distancing rules, imposed on March 22, but only in line with a set of guidelines referred to as the \"distancing in daily life\" policy.According to these guidelines, people should stay at home if they become sick with suspected Covid-19 symptoms, continue to keep a distance of 2 meters (6 feet) from others, wash their hands for 30 seconds and keep rooms well ventilated and disinfected regularly. Those aged over 65 and in high-risk groups should continue to stay home and avoid enclosed and crowded spaces.As the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated, the policy \"should not be interpreted as implying a return to 'normalcy' as before the outbreak but rather as an effort to achieve both infectious disease prevention/control and everyday life.\"In line with this, South Korea's baseball season resumed Tuesday -- but with games played in empty stadiums, while umpires and base coaches wore masks. In one game, instead of the ceremonial first pitch, there was a socially distant start as a boy in a big clear balloon walked from the mound to the catcher.Children will start to return to school from May 13. Speaking Monday, South Korean education minister Yoo Eun-Hae told students what to expect in this new, post-coronavirus reality. \"As soon as you arrive at a class, you will need to wipe your desk while windows should be opened frequently,\" she said. \"You will also be required to wear a mask except for at mealtimes and maintain double arm's length distance when you are on the move or are standing in line. You must remember these rules and we urge you keep them.\"South Korea's Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a briefing Sunday that closed facilities would reopen gradually and that events and gatherings would be allowed as long as they abide by disinfection guidelines.\"It is so refreshing and stress-relieving to finally be out,\" Ju Eun-song, a 32-year-old store sales assistant, told AFP news agency as the restrictions were eased Wednesday. \"As we wrap up social distancing, we're at a stage where people are getting used to daily life distancing,\" Jo Jae-hong, a 38-year-old businessman, told the news agency. But the emergence Friday of more than a dozen new cases linked to an individual who visited three nightclubs in Seoul last weekend served as a warning of how quickly the virus can regain a foothold. Officials swiftly advised clubs and bars to close for the next month.Dr. Peter Drobac, a global health expert at the Oxford Sa\u00efd Business School, believes that other governments' experiences indicate that a cautious approach is the right one.\"There's no strict recipe that will work elsewhere, but there is a set of principles,\" he told CNN by email. \"First, flatten the curve -- or better still, crush the curve -- until there is a sustained decrease in new cases. Opening up when you still have uncontrolled community spread, as in parts of the US, is lunacy.\"Secondly, he said, countries must make sure their health system can cope without crisis measures and that health care workers have the necessary protective equipment; thirdly, massive testing capacity must be in place.\"Fourth, contact tracing -- which requires people and technology -- and a plan to isolate cases and quarantine contacts. Isolation should not be done at home! That's where the most transmission happens. I don't understand why this is being ignored in the UK and the US.\"Lastly, high-risk and vulnerable groups must be protected, he said, as people's renewed mobility increases the risk of new infections.\"The key to reopening is to offset that risk with testing, tracing, and isolation,\" he said. \"These are tried and true interventions that break chains of transmission. It doesn't mean you can get back to normal, but it increases the chances that you can start to open up safely.\"Other countries can learn a lot from South Korea, he said.\"It's easy to talk about 'test, trace, isolate' but hard to do. When you look at the robustness of South Korea's response, it's a terrific set of lessons that can be replicated,\" Drobac said. \"The other important factor in South Korea appears to be transparent communication and public trust. It's going to be harder in places where the response was mismanaged or politicized, like the US and UK.\"Germans can 'afford courage'Germany is also taking a step-by-step approach to reopening for business after a weeks-long lockdown.Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germans on Wednesday that they could \"afford a bit of courage,\" but cautioned that \"we have to watch that this thing does not slip out of our hands.\"Limits on social contact would remain in place until June 5, she said, but people can now meet with members of one other household as well as their own. People must still remain 1.5 meters (5 feet) apart and cover their mouths and noses in public. Shops can reopen but with additional hygiene measures, Merkel added, speaking at a news conference following a video meeting with the prime ministers of Germany's 16 states. \"The first phase of the pandemic is behind us but we are still at the beginning and it will be with us for a long time,\" Merkel said.Germany's top football league, the Bundesliga, will resume play from May 16 -- but under tight restrictions and without spectators. It will be the first major European league to return to action.Germany's coronavirus response is widely seen as a success story in Europe. The country's Covid-19 death toll has stayed relatively low compared to other countries and its well-resourced health system allowed its hospitals to accept patients from other, more embattled, European countries. Germany's advanced diagnostics industry meant it was able to conduct mass testing from early on.The coronavirus reproduction rate -- a crucial measure -- is estimated to have fallen to 0.65, the country's disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), said Thursday. That means that on average, 100 people will infect 65 others.Currently, Germany is able to carry out 964,000 coronavirus tests per week, the RKI said, although only about one-third of that capacity was used in the past week.Germany's relatively cautious approach to reopening appears prudent, Drobac said.\"Daily new cases have dropped into the hundreds -- this is not trivial, but it's a level that can hopefully be managed with a strong system for testing, tracing and isolation,\" he said. Germany's decentralized governance system, coupled with national coordination, means there is useful local flexibility to decide exactly how and when to ease social distancing recommendations, he said. \"Big cities may need to move more slowly than rural areas, for example. But importantly, Germany has instituted a trigger -- if new cases rise above 50 per 100,000, it automatically halts the easing of social distancing. I don't know if it will work, but it looks like a smart approach based on the evidence we have.\"Lifting lockdown 'slowly but surely'Elsewhere, urgent discussion continues on how to lift restrictions on people's lives and reboot the economy without jeopardizing the progress made in curtailing the spread of the coronavirus. And even as measures are eased, citizens face a very different reality.In Italy, some 4 million people were allowed to return to work this week -- many of them construction and factory workers -- and Italians were again permitted to visit family members in the same region. Bars and restaurants reopened, but only for takeaway orders. Government and church leaders also announced Thursday that masses and weddings could be celebrated in churches from May 18, after being banned for almost two months. But services will not look quite the same.According to the protocol agreed by leaders, the priest and worshipers will have to wear masks. The priest will give communion wearing gloves and must be careful \"avoiding any contact with the faithful's hands.\"Worshipers will also have to maintain a one-meter (3-foot) distance from others, inside and outside the church, and anyone with a fever will not be admitted.France will also begin lifting stay-at-home restrictions as of Monday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said Thursday. He said it would be a \"very gradual process\" in order to \"slowly but surely\" lift lockdown measures.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to give a televised address Sunday on his nation's restrictions. Newspaper headlines have suggested a significant relaxation is on the cards. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, hosting the daily Covid-19 briefing at Downing Street on Thursday, said any measures would only be \"incremental\" and \"relatively modest.\"Meanwhile, in the United States, while some press for a faster reopening of businesses hit hard by stay-at-home orders, others fear the peak of Covid-19 infections is still to come in certain states, or that a second wave of infections may be worse than the first.Drobac cautions that the idea of choosing between prioritizing public health or the economy \"is a fallacy.\"\"The only way to address the economic crisis is to address the public health crisis. Remember, a lockdown is not a solution -- it's an emergency stopgap that buys time to develop a strategy and prepare,\" he said.\"Right now there are dozens, if not hundreds, of little experiments happening around the world as countries and communities try to open back up. We will learn a lot from this period about what the new normal should look like for the next couple years.\"\n\nCNN's Yoonjung Seo and Sophie Jeong in Seoul contributed to this report.

        "body": "New Delhi, India (CNN)In January this year, Kerala became the first Indian state to report a coronavirus case. Now, four months later, it claims it has flattened the curve.\n\nAlthough India has been under a strict nationwide lockdown since late March, cases have continued to rise -- the country of 1.3 billion now has more than 74,000 confirmed cases, including more than 2,400 deaths.But Kerala, a thin strip on the country's southern coast, has appeared to buck that trend.Although its has a population of around 36 million -- almost as big as Canada -- it has reported just 519 cases and four deaths. As of Saturday, it had only 16 active cases, according to the state's finance minister, Thomas Isaac.For comparison, Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in India, has reported more than 23,000 cases, including more than 860 deaths. Read MoreEven accounting for their different population sizes, the states have very different outbreaks. Maharashtra has around 19 cases per 100,000, while Kerala has about 1. By way of comparison the United States, which has the world's highest reported death toll, has around 415 cases per 100,000 people.Experts say part of Kerala's success is thanks to swift action and learning from past outbreaks. But Kerala also shows how disparate India is -- and how much a person's chances against the virus depend on where in the country they live.What Kerala did rightAt the center of Kerala's response was woman who has been nicknamed \"the coronavirus slayer.\"In the second week of January -- before the state, and by extension India, had reported its first coronavirus case -- Kerala's Minister of Health and Social Welfare, KK Shailaja, noticed reports of a virus spreading in Wuhan, China.With many students from Kerala studying in Wuhan, KK Shailaja suspected it was just a matter of time before the virus arrived in the state. In late January, the ministry set up 18 expert groups for different facets of the outbreak control, covering everything from contact tracing and screening, to logistics and mental health. \"We planned everything,\" she says.From January 24, the government screened all passengers returning from China, and sent all symptomatic patients to designated isolation facilities. On January 30, Kerala confirmed its first coronavirus patient -- a student who had been studying in Wuhan. Authorities identified the first patient by screening all 172 passengers on a plane from Wuhan, and isolating three students who had minor symptoms in hospital. They were also able to trace more than 70 people who had been in close contact with the students, Shailaja said.And even when there were no new cases, the state continued being vigilant. \"Some asked us why we were being so overactive because there were no cases now in Kerala,\" she says. \"We were told we over reacting but we didn't withdraw our teams because we were reading about this virus going to other countries.\"As Oommen Kurian, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation, put it: \"(Kerala) reacted as if it's a very deadly disease from the beginning when people were actually doubtful across the world about the deadliness of the virus.\" Back in 2018, the state was hit by an outbreak of Nipah virus, which killed 18 people within a few weeks. There is no treatment or vaccine for Nipah, which has a fatality rate of between 40 to 75% -- much higher than Covid-19.Kerala managed to contain the disease in a short space of time -- and the most important thing was contact tracing, Shailaja said. \"We understood that for any contagious virus, the first thing we have to do is contact tracing and to break the chain,\" she said. \"If we trace the contact properly, we can isolate the person from others and we can break the chain and flatten the curve of the epidemic. This is the same thing we applied here.\"\"Kerala acted from the beginning ... and has not lowered its guard yet,\" said Rajeev Sadanandan, Kerala's former health secretary and the chief executive of non-profit Health Systems Transformation Platform. \"No other Indian state did anything remotely comparable.\"How Kerala comparesHundreds of miles north in the state of Maharashtra, health authorities haven't seen the same success. The state -- which has roughly the same population size as Japan -- has the largest number of cases of anywhere in India. Many of those are in Mumbai, one of India's most populous cities, which is home to a number of slums. According to Amey Ghole, Health Committee Chairman of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai, the city took the outbreak seriously \"from day one.\"\"On February 19, we found our first patient and admitted them to hospital. We were the first to stop flights from China. Maharashtra was the first state to lockdown the cinemas and malls,\" he said.The state took other measures. On March 16, the state health minister, Rajesh Tope, announced that it would use indelible ink to stamp the hands of individuals who have been asked to self-quarantine at their own homes to prevent them from going out. The state created containment zones and cordoned off areas, Ghole said. Authorities have been testing in slums -- which have been a big concern in India -- and increased the number of beds in quarantine facilities, he said. But according to Kurian, Maharashtra didn't act as quickly as Kerala. Like much of the rest of the world, they were biding their time. \"Maharashtra was reactive,\" he added, rather than proactive.Sadanandan said Maharashtra had no contact tracing system, so when cases showed up at hospitals, they had no way of using information about their contacts to prevent further spread. Once infection reaches the community, prevention doesn't work, said Sadanandan. In places where community spread has taken hold, it's already too late to put in place Kerala's strategy of quarantining high-risk people, testing and treating them, and tracking everyone they have had contact with. \"Slums or any community are the endpoints. The battle is lost when it has reached the community,\" he said. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has repeatedly denied any community transmission across India.Unlike Kerala, Maharashtra hadn't dealt with a recent viral outbreak, so they weren't as prepared for the onslaught, Kurian said. Now, it's too late to bring in strong contact tracing, he said. If Maharashtra were to start contact tracing now, it would have an uphill task -- it now has more than 23,000 confirmed cases, who have likely each been in touch with a number of people. \"The thing about contact tracing is that it is very easy to get overwhelmed if you go over the threshold,\" he said. \"The silent spread has already happened in Maharashtra.\"Why Kerala's success isn't a surpriseIn a way, it's no surprise that Kerala has had success against the coronavirus -- it already has some of the best healthcare outcomes in India. According to government statistics, Kerala has a comparatively high number of public healthcare centers. It also has the lowest maternal mortality rate, one of the lowest infant mortality rates, and the highest life expectancy at birth of any Indian state, at 74.2 for a man.According to Sadanandan, Kerala has a good primary care system and well-trained health workers. Those things, in turn, meant the government health system had credibility and trust with the public, Sadanandan said.It also helped that Kerala's literacy rate is high, with around 94% of the population literate, according to the 2011 Census, compared with the national average of 73%. That improved the state's ability to communicate the risk, said Kurian.\"Education was seen as an investment in Kerala for a long time,\" Kurian added.And Kerala is relatively well-off. In 2017-2018, the latest year for which statistics are available, it had a per capita GDP of 184,000 Indian rupees, compared with a nationwide average of 114,958. Kerala's health outcomes are not the norm. Healthcare -- and social indicators such as access to safe drinking water that influence healthcare outcomes -- vary widely between different states, Sadanandan said. Maharashtra's health outcomes fall far behind Kerala. Male life expectancy is 69.9, and its infant mortality rate is almost twice as high as Kerala's, with 19 deaths per 1,000 live births, compared with 10. Although Maharashtra has some of the best hospitals in India, according to Kurian, some of those have been compromised because the virus has spread to health care workers and within hospitals. Last month, the Indian Medical Association said doctors in India faced challenges of being attacked and had a lack of personal protective equipment.\"Many doctors have tested positive for the virus already and those of us working on the frontlines at government hospitals live in hostels where effective social distancing is not possible,\" a Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors spokesperson said.What the future holdsWhile Kerala has flattened the curve for now, the challenges aren't over. \"We are bracing ourselves for the 3rd wave,\" Isaac, the state's finance minister, tweeted. Kerala's chief minister, Pinarayi Vijayan, has a similar sentiment: \"Til those who are undergoing treatment are fully cured and those under observation complete their quarantine period, we cannot let our guard down one bit.\"India's lockdown is set to lift later this month, and some experts expect cases to increase. India stopped commercial flights into the country in March, but last week it began repatriation flights for Indians overseas who are stranded or lost their jobs. Kerala has large numbers of people working and living overseas, meaning many of those being repatriated will be headed for Kerala.And Kerala has the oldest population in India, making its population potentially more vulnerable -- 13% of the population are aged 60 or older, compared with the nationwide average of 8.2%. In Maharashtra, for comparison, 9.1% of the population are 60 or older. Kurian warns that it's not the time to be complacent. \"The real fight is just coming. Once the international travelers come back and the migrants come back and the local economy starts operating again, That is when the next wave will hit Kerala, and if they're caught napping, it will look a lot like Mumbai.\"In 2017, Indian workers around the world sent $69 billion back home -- and 19% of those remittances went to Kerala, the highest proportion of any state, according to India's Central Bank. But Kurian points out that if some of Kerala's overseas workers have now lost their jobs, that could impact Kerala's overall economy. \"Kerala is best practice sponsored by the rest of the world,\" he said. \"The money that is supporting Kerala's public sector response, that tap has been turned off.\"But Sadanandan is more optimistic -- he thinks the same prevention strategy that worked before can continue to work now.\"If prevention works with one, it can work with millions,\" he said. \"There would be hiccups but I expect the inherent strength of Kerala to survive the threat.\"\n\nCNN's Vedika Sud, Swati Gupta and Esha Mitra contributed to this story from New Delhi.",

        "body": "(CNN)Study subjects who received Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine had positive early results, according to the biotech company, which partnered with the National Institutes of Health to develop the vaccine.\n\nIf future studies go well, the company's vaccine could be available to the public as early as January, Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer, told CNN. \"This is absolutely good news and news that we think many have been waiting for for quite some time,\" Zaks said. Read More These early data come from the Phase 1 clinical trial, which typically studies a small number of people and focuses on whether a vaccine is safe and elicits an immune response.\n\nThe results of the study, which was led by the National Institutes Health, have not been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. Moderna, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, is one of eight developers worldwide doing human clinical trials with a vaccine against the novel coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. Two others, Pfizer and Inovio, are also in the United States, one is at the University of Oxford in Britain, and four are in China. Moderna has vaccinated dozens of study participants and measured antibodies in eight of them. All eight developed neutralizing antibodies to the virus at levels reaching or exceeding the levels seen in people who've naturally recovered from Covid-19, according to the company. Neutralizing antibodies bind to the virus, disabling it from attacking human cells. \"We've demonstrated that these antibodies, this immune response, can actually block the virus,\" Zaks said. \"I think this is a very important first step in our journey towards having a vaccine.\" A vaccine specialist who is not involved in Moderna's work said the company's results are \"great.\" \"It shows that not only did the antibody bind to the virus, but it prevented the virus from infecting the cells,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the NIH panel that's setting a framework for vaccine studies in the US.\n\nWhile the vaccine had promising results in the lab, it's not known if it will protect people in the real world. The US Food and Drug Administration has cleared the company to begin Phase 2 trials, which typically involve several hundred of people, and Moderna plans to start large-scale clinical trials, known as Phase 3 trials, in July, which typically involve tens of thousands of people. Offit said before the pandemic, vaccine developers would typically test out their product in thousands of people before moving on to Phase 3, but that Moderna is \"extremely unlikely\" to have vaccinated that many by July, since they've only vaccinated dozens so far. He said it makes sense to Moderna to move into Phase 3 without vaccinating that many people, given that Covid-19 is killing thousands of people each day. \"This is a different time,\" Offit said. In January, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergies and Infectious Diseases, said it would take about 12 to 18 months to get a vaccine on the market. Zaks said he agreed with that estimate for Moderna's vaccine, putting a delivery date somewhere between January and June of next year. In the Moderna study, three participants developed fever and other flu-like symptoms when they received the vaccine at a dose of 250 micrograms. Moderna anticipates the Phase 3 study on dosage will be between 25 and 100 micrograms. So far, the Moderna study subjects who were vaccinated even at 25 and 100 micrograms achieved antibody levels similar to or even higher than people who naturally became infected with coronavirus. But it's not clear whether natural infection confers immunity to re-infection, and so similarly it's not clear whether vaccination confers immunity. \"That's a good question, and the truth is, we don't know that yet,\" Zaks said. \"We are going to have to conduct formal efficacy trials where you vaccinate many, many people, and then you monitor them in the ensuing months to make sure they don't get sick.\"\n\nCNN's Devon Sayers contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)The numbers of daily new reported coronavirus cases appear to be dropping in most states as the majority of the country takes steps to open their economies -- though there are plenty of caveats.\n\nBelow, we'll examine which states' daily rates are rising or falling the steepest in relation to each other. Because this involves ranking states, we've adjusted for population.First, a word on how case rates may, or may not, be important. Some public health experts say declining case rates should be one guide for figuring when states should relax social distancing restrictions. On the other hand, uneven testing rates should affect how states' positive case rates rise and fall. For example, case rates may rise as testing rates increase. But even then, many public health experts say, states still aren't testing enough, so even if they've recently ramped it up, they still might not be capturing an accurate picture.Read More\"I am not ready at all to breathe a sigh of relief,\" Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the division of infectious diseases at University of Alabama at Birmingham, told CNN's \"New Day\" on Friday about the apparent decline in some states' case rates.One reason: \"How many people are being tested? Are we getting a really accurate estimate?\" she asked. And experts have warned of more waves ahead as social restrictions relax.Having said that, here are the states with the largest changes in seven-day, average daily case rates over the past week.Maps and charts: See daily new cases for each state in the past 14 days3 states with cases falling fastest NEW JERSEYThis appears to be relatively bright news for hard-hit New Jersey, second in the country only to New York for the number of total reported cases (143,600+) and deaths (10,100+). New cases per 100,000 people dropped almost 38% this past week, from 25 cases per 100,000 to about 16.The state has had one of the more strict and longest-enduring stay-at-home orders. One of the few nonessential things to open there were parks and golf courses. Nonessential construction and curbside retail pickup can reopen Monday, while ocean and lakefront beaches could reopen with limits on May 22.Tracking coronavirus deaths MISSOURINew cases per 100,000 people dropped about 35% this past week, from nearly 4 cases per 100,000 to 2.6.This state generally began allowing all businesses to reopen May 4, provided they could abide by certain social distancing guidelines. Indoor retail businesses must limit their number of customers to no more than 25% of normal capacity, and local communities can choose stricter rules if they choose. IDAHONew cases per 100,000 people dropped nearly 35% this past week, from roughly 1.6 cases per 100,000 to 1.1.Idaho's stay-at-home order expired May 1, and most businesses were allowed to open, with restrictions for distancing and sanitation. More will open soon: Starting Saturday, restaurants can open for dine-in with certain protocols. Indoor gyms, recreation facilities, hair salons and other close contact services also can open with restrictions.A note of transparency: Vermont and Alaska technically belong on this list. They had the largest (54%) and third-largest (35%) declines in new cases per 100,000 people this past week. But they already started with small amounts of new cases, and any change was going to look outsize. To highlight a state here, we required they started last week with at least roughly two new cases per 100,000. Vermont and Alaska had less than one.3 states with cases rising fastest SOUTH DAKOTANew cases per 100,000 people jumped 134% this past week, from nearly seven cases per 100,000 to about 15.The state reported an unusually high two-day spike in tests late last week, according to the COVID Tracking Project, though it's not clear to what extent that contributed to the spike.State officials intend to intensify testing. Starting next week, all residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities, as well as staff members, will be tested, state health department Secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon said Thursday.South Dakota has a relatively few 3,800 cases, but with less than 1 million people, it's in the country's top 20 states for cases per 100,000 people.\"We're watching (the virus) march further and further west to less populated states, and even less populated states are seeing a caseload,\" Maureen Miller, infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, told \"New Day\" Friday, without specifically referring to South Dakota. \"So that is how the wave works. It's going to bubble up in different places over time.\" ARKANSASNew cases per 100,000 people increased almost 50% this past week, from about two cases per 100,000 to roughly three.The state started reopening some businesses May 4, and starting this week restaurants were allowed to let diners inside -- as long as they operate a a third of their normal capacity.Waves of infection have been hitting the country at different times, said Marrazzo of UAB. New York may be declining because it was already very hard hit, \"but if you go into a place that hasn't really experienced their upswing yet, you're going to see a very different pattern,\" she said, though she did not specifically address Arkansas. MAINENew cases per 100,000 people rose nearly 32% this past week, from 2.1 cases per 100,000 to 2.8.Maine is under a stay-at-home order through at least May 31, though certain types of businesses have been reopening, starting May 1.One to watch: Georgia Georgia made some of the earliest and most extensive moves to loosen restrictions. Gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, hair and nail salons and massage therapists were able to reopen April 24, with certain rules. Other businesses followed later.A shelter-in-place order ended April 30, except for \"medically fragile and elderly Georgians,\" who generally must stay home until June 12.The state's case rates have appeared steady, even three weeks after those first reopening steps. This week, the state ranked near the middle of country's pack. Its reported cases decreased by about 6% this week -- from nearly seven cases per 100,000 to around six.Maureen Miller, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University, said she still suspects that \"cases are simmering right now,\" and it's still possible hospitalizations and deaths could increase in the next few weeks because of the loosened restrictions.But there is \"not the amount of testing that would be required to ensure that we know what's going on\" in Georgia, she told \"New Day\" on Friday.Just because businesses are allowed to open doesn't mean all are doing so, and \"just because things are open doesn't mean (everyone) is going out,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said Friday, citing what he's seen where he lives in the Atlanta area.\"I think you just got to wait a little bit longer and make sure these trends continue,\" he said.Gov. Brian Kemp said May 7 that the state had doubled its testing capacity from what it was weeks earlier. He said Thursday that testing was now available for all Georgians, regardless of whether they had symptoms, and that they could contact their local sate health department branch to get scheduled.\n\nCNN's Sergio Hernandez contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n\"Covid Heroes and Newsmakers\" is a weekly social media series featuring live interviews with African heroes serving their communities and newsmakers driving strategy as the continent faces Covid-19. Watch every Wednesday on CNN Africa Instagram.\n\nLagos, Nigeria (CNN)How do you explain coronavirus to children? Make a cartoon!\n\nNigerian filmmaker Niyi Akinmolayan has created a 90-second animation to help children understand why they have to stay indoors to help stem the spread of coronavirus. First made in English and three Nigerian languages, it's been shared for free online and dubbed into languages spoken across the globe. The animated short tells the story of Habeeb and his older sister, Funke. Habeeb gets bored of staying indoors and tries to sneak out of the house to play soccer. He is warned by his sister, who tells him about coronavirus and its dangers.\"You can get the deadly coronavirus. Do you know what will happen when you do? You will bring the coronavirus home and then infect everyone. Mummy will be sick; no more jollof rice. Daddy will be sick; no more going out to see movies \" Funke says in the video. Habeeb insists on going out and is confronted by the coronavirus monster. The confrontation makes him realize the need to stay indoors. The cartoon also explains the importance of washing one's hands thoroughly. Read MoreSome of Nigeria's states including Lagos, its commercial center, and Abuja, the capital city, have been on lockdown since March 30.Akinmolayan, who has directed hit Nollywood movies like \"The Set Up,\" \"Chief Daddy\" and \"The Wedding Party 2,\" said he was inspired to create the coronavirus cartoon as he struggled to explain the need for lockdowns to his 5-year-old son. \"You want to tell your child not to go outside, but you need to explain why he needs to stay inside. Beyond that, you need to explain why he constantly has to wash his hands with soap and water. ... It was really hard until I came up with the idea of the coronavirus monster,\" he told CNN.\"I explained that the monster will take Mummy and Daddy and there would be no more ice cream and great food,\" he added. \"And that was when it occurred to me that a lot of parents were probably facing the same challenge.\"Creating the coronavirus monster Akinmolayan made the short through his Lagos-based production company, Anthill Studios. His crew worked on it from their homes and opted for animation so everyone could practice social distancing, he said.\"I figured out that one of the best ways to explain it (coronavirus) was with graphics and animations so that we wouldn't have real people gather in one place to film,\" he said.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nWatch the recap of our chat with Film Director, @Niyi_Akinmolayan whose animation of a coronavirus monster has gone global and has been played in countries such as Brazil and Turkey. He chatted with CNN's @stephbusari about using film to make information on coronavirus accessible to indigenous language speakers \u2800 #cnnafricacovidheroes #nigeria #cnnafrica\n\nA post shared by CNN Africa (@cnnafrica) on Apr 27, 2020 at 9:12am PDT\n\nThe cartoon is being distributed for free. Made in English and the Nigerian languages of Yoruba, Hausa, and Igbo, it has been translated to French, Swahili and Portuguese and shared widely on some broadcast TV stations, Akinmolayan said.\"I created a Google Drive and put all the videos there, including the soundtrack and made it public,\" he said. \"I said anyone could record a language over it or just do a subtitle. Some guys in Ivory Coast did a French version, guys in East Africa did a Swahili version. I stumbled on the Brazilian one. It was on Turkey's national television and on TV in China, too.\"Countering misinformation Separate from the coronavirus monster, Akinmolayan and his team created an animation that answers the most frequently asked questions about coronavirus, which has infected 1,700 people in Nigeria as of late Wednesday, with 51 deaths recorded, according to the West African nation's center for disease control. \"There was so much misinformation out there, a lot of false news. I realized that it was because people didn't understand what the virus was about. I figured out that one of the best ways to explain it was with graphics and animations,\" he said.Watch CNN's full iinterview with Niyi Akinmolayan\n\nIt's 1 minute, 47 seconds long and uses infographics to explain the need to wash hands with soap, maintain social distance and stay indoors. It also explains how the virus can be contracted and details symptoms like cough, high temperature and difficulty breathing. The video relies on credible sources like the World Health Organization, Akinmolayan said, and has been recreated in French, Portuguese and Swahili and widely shared in countries like Brazil, Kenya and China.\"I also noticed that all the messages been disseminated were in English and that was why it was easy to flood WhatsApp with wrong information,\" he explained. \"It was being shared by parents and grandparents who probably didn't care about the Big English.\" Nollywood and animationsNigeria's movie industry is worth 239 billion naira (about $612 million), producing large numbers of films every year. But the industry does not produce as many cartoons. Akinmolayan who has produced animated films such as \"Malika,\" inspired by the 16th-century Nigerian ruler Queen Amina, wants the industry to make more animations that can be used to teach children history, culture and music. Like with his coronavirus monster animation, Akinmolayan wants to be able to make complicated topics easy to understand for children, he said.\"What we need to be thinking about is the power of children and producing family content,\" he said. \"We need to pass a lot of messages that hit at the level of kids.\"",

        "body": "New York (CNN Business)Sandra Kunz wanted to keep working as a Walmart (WMT) cashier even as the coronavirus spread.\n\nDespite a lung condition, the 72-year-old in Aurora, Colorado, needed to get her paycheck, according to her sister, Paula Spellman. Her husband, Gus, was injured and out of work, and the couple had bills due. Kunz died on April 20 from complications related to the coronavirus, her sister said. Gus, who was also sick from the virus, died two days before his wife.While it is unclear how the couple contracted the virus, Spellman said her sister had expressed concerns about customers at Walmart coughing on her at the cash register. \"I wish she didn't work there. I wish she had taken leave,\" Spellman said. \"I get angry because she should have been more protected.\"Read MoreWalmart says it has instituted several safety measures in its stores, including providing masks and erecting sneeze guards, or plexiglass barriers, to protect its workers from the coronavirus.The cash register has emerged as the most dangerous place in the store, according to public health and worker safety experts. Every item cashiers touch, scan and bag has been handled by customers and other workers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it is possible that a person can get coronavirus by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it.The job also entails being at arm's length from customers all day rather than the CDC-recommended six feet, making socially distancing nearly impossible, these experts said. The risks for shoppers are heightened as they move toward the register, too. If a cashier is infected, the employee could spread it to customers.\"The cashier spot is still the most dangerous since every customer passes this area and stands there for some time while groceries are moving down the counter,\" said Brandon Brown, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Riverside.'Most exposure'The virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity, even if they do not display symptoms, according to the CDC.\"Workers at the greatest risk are the workers with the most direct contact with other people,\" said Brian Brown-Cashdollar, program director at the Western New York Council on Occupational Safety and Health, a worker safety advocacy group. Cashiers \"have the most exposure.\"Spellman says that her sister expressed concerns to her about working behind the register without a mask. Walmart says it made masks available for workers in late March, including in Kunz's store, and began requiring workers to wear them on April 20. A spokesperson for Walmart said, \"Our hearts go out to Sandy Kunz and her loved ones. Her loss shows the devastating impact of the COVID-19 virus.\"Walmart added that, in addition to offering masks to employees, the store had taken other measures earlier in March, such as adding social distancing markers and cleaning checkout lanes and cash registers more frequently. The store installed sneeze guards and began limiting the number of customers inside the store earlier in April.Retailers have been stepping up their safety measures as the CDC's guidance on the virus evolves. In addition to Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), Kroger (KR), Whole Foods and others have installed sneeze guards at checkout lanes and added social distancing markers in lines. Retailers are limiting the number of customers inside the store at a time and are sanitizing checkout stations frequently. Companies are also expanding the use of contact-free payment options so customers don't have to touch screens or enter their pins. Some public health experts and labor advocates believe the measures are not stringent enough to protect cashiers, other employees and customers. For instance, major retailers like Kroger, Target and Whole Foods are not mandating that customers wear masks, except in states and cities where they are required. And workers complain that the requirements are often not enforced. Sneeze guards and self-checkoutWhile the Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration says stores should consider opening up every other cash register to keep workers safe, this is not a requirement and many stores are not taking this measure, said John Grant, president of Local 770 of the United Food and Commercial Workers in California, which represents 20,000 grocery workers. Around 27% of the workers at the local who have gotten sick from the virus have been cashiers, Grant said.Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and health economist at the Harvard Chan School of Public Health, said cashiers \"need N95 masks as much as health care workers.\" He believes that all stores also need to give their cashiers face shields because many coronavirus carriers are asymptomatic. In China, stores are sanitizing cash, and the United States \"should as well at some point.\" Cashiers also say limits on the number of customers inside stores are unevenly enforced and it's hard to keep customers separated in lines. At Kunz's Walmart in Aurora, for example, the local public health department briefly ordered the store to shut down in part because of complaints of \"lack of social distancing\" and \"too many people in the store at one time.\" The department has since allowed the store to reopen and said it has \"good safety and health measures in place.\" The plexiglass barriers companies have put up are of limited help, some cashiers say, because customers lean over or around the barriers to talk to them.\"It doesn't cover us properly,\" said one Target cashier in Louisiana affiliated with the workers' advocacy group Target Workers Unite who requested anonymity out of concern of retaliation. \"There's a considerable gap in the plexiglass on each register.\" A representative for Target declined to comment on the plexiglass but said \"we have introduced dozens of new safety measures at our stores,\" including reminding customers through loud speakers to observe social distancing rules. \"In any situation, if a team member feels uneasy about performing a specific task, we'd encourage them to have a conversation with their leader to determine if there are alternative tasks they could perform,\" the retailer said. Companies have expanded the use of self-checkout in recent years, but this also brings risks. \"Self-checkout may make physical distancing a challenge because of the frequent need for customer assistance,\" California's Occupational Safety and Health Administration says in guidelines.Workers have to clean down stations after each customer, retail employees say, and handling alcohol purchases is especially challenging. That's because a worker has to come over to ask the customer for ID, the customer has to remove a mask, and then the worker has to check to make sure they match.There are other concerns: \"At self-checkout, guests tend to crowd you when they need help, even with social distancing reminders,\" said a Target worker in North Carolina who is behind the cash register part time and also helps with self-checkout. This employee spoke under the condition of anonymity. Target declined to comment.",

        "body": "London (CNN)When Suryakant \"Suri\" Nathwani returned from the hospital, the reserved 81-year-old grabbed his son's hand and pleaded to be allowed to die at home. \"He said, 'Please promise me one thing: If I'm going to go, I'm going to go here. Do not take me back there,'\" his son Raj Nathwani said.\n\nDeath was not an outcome Raj, 55, was willing to accept -- but he knew his father's chances of surviving coronavirus were not in his favor. Raj had been tracking the virus since January, watching countless news reports: about the toll it had taken on multigenerational households; about medics in Italy's overstretched health system being too swamped to make home visits; about elderly people in China with pre-existing conditions -- including the one his father has -- having a higher chance of dying. \"I'm not a betting man, but if I was... [I would] definitely put my money on him not making it,\" Suri's family doctor, general practitioner Dr. Bharat Thacker, told CNN. The coronavirus pandemic has killed more than 219,000 people worldwide, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University in the US. Read MoreBut official death tolls are largely made up of patients who died in intensive care wards or other hospital departments. The number of people dying in the community -- many in their own homes or care homes -- are often under-reported.As he helped Suri up to bed after his arrival home from Watford General Hospital, on the outskirts of London, Raj worried whether the desperate series of events that had seen the virus spread across the globe would turn his father into another statistic.Raj, a director of insight at an advertising firm, remained outwardly positive: \"You're not going to die. We're going to look after you here,\" he told his father. What he did not know was just how successful he would be. The descent Raj, who had himself recovered from a heart attack last November, was prepared for the pandemic weeks before the UK lockdown began on March 23. He had been in self-isolation alongside his 80-year-old mother and his father, who has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), since March 11, because the entire household was considered to be at high risk from coronavirus. But his father's condition began to deteriorate on March 25. Suri's daily 10-minute walk outside the family home turned into a 45-minute stagger. His lung condition was flaring up. He looked fatigued, listless, and -- although he did not display the high temperature or persistent cough, which the NHS considered the main symptoms of the virus -- Raj suspected his father had Covid-19.Unbeknownst to the family, Suri's lungs were filling with liquid -- a fact that was spotted by paramedics called to the family's home the following day, when the octogenarian had trouble breathing.He was taken to hospital, but doctors called Raj shortly afterward. He says they told him they were 95% sure Suri had the virus, but that they wanted to discharge him and send him home. Raj says a senior consultant told him that if Suri's condition worsened they would not ventilate him \"because he felt his lungs, with ... COPD, would not be able to handle it.\"CNN has reached out to Watford General Hospital for comment on Suri's case, but has not received a response. CNN has seen Suri's discharge sheet, which includes a \"do not resuscitate\" (DNR) order that was completed upon his admission.Ventilation can be life-saving, but even in ordinary times, health practitioners warn that being admitted into intensive care gives no guarantee of recovery for older patients.Raj said he was left with two choices: \"Do I keep him there and risk never seeing him again, or do I bring him home and spend all my energy making it comfortable for him?\" He chose the latter, even at the risk of spreading the infection through the entire household. Before Suri returned to his Watford home -- in a local taxi, as there was no ambulance available to move him -- Raj spent the afternoon cleaning the house, isolating his mother on the ground floor, and turning his parents' first floor bedroom into a makeshift hospital ward. With little medical knowledge, or advice from the hospital on how to administer palliative care, Raj resorted to doing what he did best: collecting and analyzing data. He created a Google spreadsheet to help track his father's temperature, blood pressure and oxygen saturation readings -- vitals that could be measured with a store-bought thermometer, blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter. To limit the amount of time Raj spent in the room, an iPad was set up with a baby monitor app. This enabled the rest of his tight-knit family to help out, giving Raj's brother, Manish, who lives in the US, and his sons, who live nearby with their mother, the opportunity to check in on Suri, helping to ease his lonely isolation. It also meant they could take turns monitoring him when Raj needed to rest. The strategist also turned to a family friend, a general practice doctor, for advice. The GP advised on Suri's hydration, and kept track of his vital signs on the Google spreadsheet. Raj says that perhaps the key factor when it came to treating his father was the fact that their home was already equipped with a continuous positive airway pressure, or CPAP machine, for Suri's sleep apnea. \"When Dad's breathing got worse, I was advised to use the machine,\" he said, explaining that when his father's condition was at its most serious, the device -- which helps patients breathe more easily -- was being used for up to 16 hours a day on the doctor's advice. Three days after he was discharged, Suri was delirious, struggling to eat, and told Raj he thought he was close to the end. Raj believes this was because his brain was being starved of oxygen.The recoveryThe following day, Dr. Thacker called with the news that Suri's coronavirus test had come back positive. At that point, many British GPs like Thacker were struggling to get hold of full personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a full-length gown and gloves. Without PPE, it was unsafe for Thacker to make a home visit to coronavirus patients like Suri. \"If I went there and I got it, then not only are my family at risk, but so are my patients if I returned to the surgery,\" he told CNN.Instead he checked the Google spreadsheet, and recommended an antibiotic for a secondary lung infection Suri had developed. The GP also advised that Suri should be helped to lie on his stomach for a number of hours a day -- a practice known as prone positioning. Doctors have found that placing the sickest coronavirus patients on their stomachs can help increase the amount of oxygen getting into their lungs. Knowing the seriousness of Suri's condition, Thacker said a DNR notice was issued for the family's address so that any paramedics who were sent there knew not to resuscitate the man, since \"the outcome is going to be rather poor.\"Thankfully, it was not needed. Under his son's watchful eye, Suri gradually began to recover. Raj says he knew his father was on the road to recovery when he became strong enough to nag him. \"He began whingeing and said his tea was badly made. He then asked for some pizza and chips,\" Raj said. Eventually, Suri was given the all-clear, and by last week, he was walking the length of his garden with the help of a zimmer frame, or walker -- inspired by Capt. Tom Moore, the 100-year-old British war veteran who has raised millions of pounds for the UK's National Health Service by walking 100 laps of his garden.\"We truly had an action and 'go-to' team on tap that I trusted,\" Raj said, adding he did not have to rely on \"Dr. Google,\" because he had real doctors nearby to help. He said he appreciates that he and his father were in a more privileged position than many in the UK, where the virus is disproportionately affecting black and ethnic minority communities.Thacker, who has had a number of patients die of Covid-19, says he cannot put his finger on exactly what worked for Suri. \"Whether it was the family caring for him, or the available bio-data that made the difference -- we don't know,\" he said, adding: \"Perhaps it was just luck and not quite his time to go.\"In the darkest moments, sometimes a plan of action and a little luck are the only things people have.",

        "body": "\"Covid Heroes and Newsmakers\" is a weekly social media series featuring interviews with Africans driving strategy as the continent faces Covid-19. Watch on CNN Africa Instagram.\n\n(CNN)Africa has more than 30,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization. And while these numbers are relatively small compared to the rest of the world, the continent is not taking any chances in its fight against the virus.\n\nResidents are creating local solutions to help curb the spread of the virus. In Nigeria, tailors are handmaking protective gear like face masks and medical overalls. And in Kenya, even though schools are closed, one woman is providing food for schoolchildren from poor families. Now, in Ghana, a software engineering company, Cognate Systems, is using technology to track coronavirus symptoms and hotspots in the West African country. Using a platform called Opine Health Assistant, the company is able to record and track the frequency of coronavirus symptoms like a cough and high temperature in different parts of the country. Opine Health AssistantRead MoreThe Opine Health Assistant platform, launched March 26, collects information from residents about their possible coronavirus symptoms and location through a USSD short code, says Kwabena Nuamah, co-founder of Cognate Systems. USSD is a short code used mostly by mobile telecommunications networks and mobile money service providers like banks for transactions. When you dial a number that starts with * and ends with # to top up your phone credit or make a bank transfer, you are using USSD. \"To use the platform, they have to dial the short code *920*222# or *714*444# on their mobile phones and then follow the prompts to answer questions about symptoms and other risk factors,\" Nuamah told CNN.\"It is free to use and users can make use of it on any type of mobile device they have, even without credit,\" he added. Dialing the USSD code allows residents to fill a form with questions about their symptoms, who they have been in contact with, age-range, and travel history. It also asks if they need essential supplies such as food and shelter in the wake of the pandemic. Nuamah, who is also an artificial intelligence researcher in the UK, says the questions are coined from the coronavirus risk factors established by the WHO and are aimed at helping the platform make sense of the symptoms reported by the public\"When people fill the form, with the information they give us, we can analyze and predict if the person is likely to be infected by the virus. We can also use the location of those who have symptoms to predict new regions that are likely to get hit by the virus,\" he said. Data collected from USSD is built into Opine Health Assistant, and information provided by the public on coronavirus is visualized on maps and graphs to make it easier to understand, monitor, and share. Where does the data go?According to Nuamah, the data collected will be shared with public health experts, data scientists, relief providers, and disease surveillance teams who are better suited to understand the information and can use it to provide local solutions to coronavirus. Ghana currently has more than 2,000 recorded cases of the virus, and 18 deaths resulting from it, according to the WHO. Nuamah ays Opine Health Assistant is helping the country predict the next possible high-risk areas for the virus, so that it is better prepared to handle the pandemic. So far, 6,000 people have used it. \"We have seen some patterns over the past days that we launched. We have seen that the spread of the virus in Ghana has been mostly within the Greater Accra Region and the Ashanti region,\" he said. \"From the data we got, we were able to see certain patterns to suggest that the eastern region would have cases of the virus next before it was reported. And almost 24 hours after predicting the spread of the virus in that region, about 16 reported cases were reported there,\" he added. With the tool, he said, experts and disease surveillance agencies in Ghana can start preparing to contain coronavirus before it hits a particular region. Providing essential suppliesOpine Health Assistant also links the public with agencies and nonprofit organizations that provide essential supplies and relief materials. Part of the data collected at the point of filling the form generated by the USSD code is information on where a person lives and if they need essentials like food and shelter. \"For people who might need food or shelter, within the series of questions, there is a part that asks for their location. We pass the locations to relief providers who are in our databases like churches and NGOs,\" Nuamah said. \"If a person says he is in Accra, for example, and needs food. We share this information with relief providers in Accra so they can identify people in that region and match them with supplies,\" he added. Nuamah says the team has been in touch with the government of Ghana and one of their goals is to get the Ghanaian government to use their platform to identify coronavirus symptoms and hotspots. After the coronavirus pandemic, Opine Health Assistant will be used to monitor different diseases in Ghana, according to Nuamah.\"We are already thinking outside of the current pandemic. We want to, in the future, be able to give heads-up as to what type of viruses are coming from different parts of the globe. We don't want to be chasing cases after they have occurred, we want to be able to predict cases coming for different diseases.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Abie Rohrig had just turned 18 when he told his mom he would be donating a kidney to save a stranger's life. Her answer: No you're not. He did it anyway -- the organ went to a man about his age -- and his mom was so inspired she went and donated a kidney herself.\n\nSo Rohrig expected her to understand when he told her that, for the benefit of humanity, he may volunteer to become infected with Covid-19. It turns out \"she's more worried than she was about the kidney thing,\" said Rohrig, now a 20-year-old college student who lives with his parents in a New York City apartment.\"She was like, 'What? What? I don't know,'\" he said. \"She's skeptical.\"Rohrig is one of more than 16,000 people -- most of them young adults -- who have signaled their support for a controversial method of speeding up the development of a vaccine by intentionally infecting dozens of volunteers. The signees of the online registry -- a new website called 1 Day Sooner -- have all checked a box next to the statement: \"I am interested in being exposed to the coronavirus to speed up vaccine development.\" Read MoreThe practice is called a human-challenge study -- or controlled human infection study -- and it can truncate a conventional vaccine study by several months. The reason: Rather than waiting for months to assess what percentage thousands of vaccine-trial volunteers get infected with the disease in question while leading their day-to-day lives, a challenge trial is much simpler, in that it exposes about 100 volunteers directly to the pathogen -- via syringe, cocktail, mosquito bite or nasal spray after an experimental vaccine or placebo is administered. (If the Covid-19 study comes to fruition, experts say it would likely be administered by nose drop.)But if it's high reward, it's also high risk: Although Covid-19 is a much more deadly disease for the elderly and the compromised than healthy young adults, it is an unpredictable pathogen that has put star athletes in the hospital. What's more, should something go wrong, treatment options are limited.However, with the disease still raging after having killed more than 82,000 Americans and 291,000 people worldwide since it first appeared in China late last year, some say a riskier-than-normal study is justified. Challenge studies offer high reward, but also high risksThe notion of a human-challenge trial for Covid-19 was jump-started by a March 31 article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, which made the case that the nature of the global emergency warrants consideration of unconventional approaches. Co-authored by Nir Eyal of Rutgers, Marc Lipsitch of Harvard, and Peter Smith of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, the piece concluded that while a human challenge study would not be without risks, \"every week that vaccine rollout is delayed will be accompanied by many thousands of deaths globally.\"\"It's an idea that is controversial when people hear about it for the first time,\" Eyal, a bioethicist, told CNN. \"However, we show that if you select people in the right way and conduct the trial in the right way, it's surprisingly low risk and certainly within the bounds of what we already approve.\"Such a study would ultimately need the blessing of the US Food and Drug Administration. But the researchers' call for a challenge study has since been propelled by the popular support of those who have indicated on 1 Day Sooner -- which is incorporating as a nonprofit organization -- that they'd be willing guinea pigs. (This is just an informal expression of interest, not a binding contract.) The site, which was inspired by the scholarly article, launched in mid-April and is premised on the claim that shaving even one day from the long-distance race for a Covid-19 vaccine could save up to 7,120 lives. What a human challenge study for coronavirus could look likeAt some point, should a group of researchers decide to seriously explore the matter, the site would ask prospective volunteers to fill out pre-qualification questionnaires that would divulge more of their medical history, region of residence and other information that would help determine eligibility, said 1 Day Sooner's co-founder Josh Morrison. The researchers would then screen those forms for the most eligible applicants and would eventually seek approval from a research or medical center to host the study, he said. Morrison is a former corporate lawyer who gave up life in the fast lane to start a nonprofit organization called Waitlist Zero, which matches prospective kidney donors with recipients. Because business is at a near-standstill in the kidney-transplant world, Morrison found himself with a lot of spare time.\"I was like sitting at home in my apartment in New York City, just kind of depressed,\" he said. Morrison came across the Journal article while noodling around on the internet. \"And I thought, 'Well, would I want to do this?'\" he said. \"I'm pretty young, 34, and in good health. And so I thought, 'Yeah, I think I would.'\" The notion seems to be gaining traction in expert circles. On May 6, the World Health Organization released a report outlining \"key criteria for the ethical acceptability of Covid-19 human challenge studies.\" An FDA spokesperson told CNN that the agency would work with those who are interested in conducting human challenge trials to help them evaluate ethical and other issues. \"A formal determination about any specific human challenge trial proposal would be made by the FDA in the context of all the information that is available at that time,\" Michael Felberbaum wrote in an email. Conventional vaccine trials typically consist of three phases -- the first, in which fewer than 100 participants are dosed to determine the safety; the second, in which the number of participants ramps up into the hundreds; and the third, in which the study is broadened to include thousands of people. Typically, in that third phase, the participants return to their daily lives, and researchers -- over a period of months -- compare rates of infection between the placebo and test groups.A human-challenge trial can replace a third phase, the Journal article says, short-circuiting the timeline by several months because researchers don't have to wait for participants to get infected the organic way -- by interacting with people at work, at school, in houses of worship or in homes. Instead, they expose the volunteers to the pathogen right then and there, in the lab.A challenge trial can also serve as a bridge to a Phase 3 study, helping researchers determine which vaccine candidates are most promising; or it can pave the way for provisional licensure in emergency situations. For a Covid-19 trial of the sort that 1 Day Sooner is advocating, the setup would likely entail first injecting an experimental vaccine into the arms of about 50 volunteers and a placebo into 50 others, challenge-trial experts told CNN. Two to four weeks later, all 100 would be exposed to the virus -- perhaps via nose-drop. Ethical, safety concerns about knowns and unknownsHuman-challenge studies aren't new. They have played a key role in the development of several vaccines, including ones for malaria, flu and dengue. Without human-challenge studies, a new vaccine for typhoid couldn't have been brought to Zimbabwe on a provisional basis last year, human-challenge experts told CNN.The \"FDA approved a cholera vaccine simply on the basis of a human challenge,\" said Dr. Robert Read, an infectious-disease expert in the UK.The difference is that those diseases came with fewer unknowns than Covid-19, and clinicians running the trials were able to offer medical treatments -- such as antibiotics or antivirals -- to infected patients exhibiting symptoms.The closest thing to a treatment for Covid-19 is remdesivir, which has yet to be approved and whose effects are modest though significant.And although the idea of conducting a human-challenge trial for Covid-19 is catching on in the science community, some experts have raised serious concerns about safety.Read, head of clinical and experimental sciences at University of Southampton, points out that Covid-19 remains a mysterious pathogen, and researchers can't give volunteers an accurate sense of the risk associated with getting intentionally infected.\"You do have to be able to describe what you know of what could happen to them if they undertake a controlled infection, with complete clarity and honesty,\" said Read, who has himself conducted challenge trials -- he recently infected dozens of volunteers with whooping cough in search of a more effective vaccine. \"And I think lots of volunteers, when faced with the information, would probably not consent to it.\" An article published last week in Science -- the peer-reviewed journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science -- puts the mortality risk for adults ages 20-44 who are infected with the virus that causes Covid-19 at less than 0.2 percent. But the piece says that and other statistics on Covid-19 are derived from incomplete data points and small sample sizes.Generally, Covid-19 is much more lethal for people of all ages with preexisting health problems such as hypertension or diabetes, but some exceptions are especially alarming. Doctors have said that Covid-19 seems to be linked to a surge in strokes suffered by otherwise healthy adults in their 30s and 40s.Dr. Anna Durbin, a professor of international health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health -- who has led a human-challenge trial for dengue and worked on another for malaria -- said she would be interested to hear how some prospective volunteers would respond to these reports of \"cerebral vascular accidents.\" \"Millennials don't think they are going to get sick from this,\" said Durbin, who, like Read, is open to the idea of human challenge trials for Covid-19, but stresses that it is incumbent upon researchers to fully evaluate the risks of such a model and to share them to the fullest extent possible with prospective participants. \"We see lots of young people in the hospital on ventilators.\"Volunteers have different reasons for signing up -- some altruistic, some pragmaticRohrig said the frightening spate of young Covid-19 patients having strokes was news to him. \"That's jarring,\" he said. \"I know there is a non-trivial risk.\" And yet, Rohrig said he's almost certainly up for it. \"I know that there are risks, and if I were to do this, and it were to go poorly, then that would be terrible, my family would be really sad,\" Rohrig said. But \"someone has to step up. It seems like this just needs to happen.\"Coincidentally, the mortality risk of donating a kidney -- about 3 in 10,000 -- is about the same as the mortality risk for healthy people in their 20s who contract Covid-19, said Eyal of Rutgers. \"That's heartening,\" said Rohrig, who met the recipient of his donated kidney on Good Morning America last summer.Not all of the prospective volunteers are in their 20s. John Gentle, an entrepreneur in Alabama, turns 41 on Thursday. He has a wife and four kids. Like Rohrig, Gentle believes a challenge study would afford him a chance to make a societal contribution to the vaccine effort. But as the owner of a business that has him visiting warehouses and flying regularly, he figures he'll inevitably get infected -- so he might as well get it over with. \"I feel if I did it under a controlled environment, and I had an adverse reaction, my chances are much better in a controlled environment than I didn't know I had it for a week until something had deteriorated to the point I realized,\" Gentle said. Indeed, human challenge studies occur in tightly controlled settings. The report in the Journal of Infectious Diseases advises keeping the subjects in isolation for several weeks and guaranteeing them access to the state-of-the-art facilities of the health system, should the need arise. \"As a part of being in the trial they would be guaranteed excellent care if they needed it,\" Lipsitch, a Harvard epidemiologist, told CNN. \"Of course, you would expect nobody in the trial on average would need it, but averages don't always play out.\" Dr. Thomas Darton, an infectious disease expert at the University of Sheffield Medical School, conducted the human-challenge trials that led to the new typhoid vaccine. Over the years, he said, he has infected some 600 students with the disease. They typically ingest the disease via a sodium-bicarbonate drink resembling Alka-Seltzer and go home. There, they await the symptoms of typhoid -- for the study participants they include headache, fever and constipation -- which generally kick in within four or five days. At this point, he said, the volunteers with symptoms are given a regimen of antibiotics, which clear up the symptoms in a couple of days.\"We have extensive follow-up data and have not had any long-term problems identified,\" Darton said in an email. \"The model is safe and reproducible and is a model of mild symptomatic illness only.\"Not all requests for human-challenge studies are granted. In 2017, an ethics panel convened by the National Institutes of Health recommended against a proposal for the development of a Zika human challenge model. (Another panel reversed the recommendation in 2018, and clinical protocol for Zika human challenge development is under review by the FDA.) Human challenge studies have a checkered historyHuman challenge studies date all the way back to the first vaccine, for the highly lethal smallpox disease. The vaccine was developed in the late 18th century by physician Edward Jenner, who aimed to put a piece of folklore to the test: that milkmaids seemed to contract a milder form of the disease, called cowpox. In an experiment that today would warrant steep criminal charges, Jenner took pus from the scab of a milkmaid and inserted it into an incision on the arm of an 8-year-old boy. The child, James Phipps, developed a headache, chills and other mild symptoms, but when directly exposed to smallpox -- again through incisions on the arm -- he proved impervious. A century later, in Cuba, US Army surgeon Major Walter Reed headed up a study to prove that the yellow-fever pathogen that was killing American soldiers during the Spanish-American War was borne by mosquitoes. In the third phase of the study, three of the 10 participants who were bitten by infected mosquitoes died, but Reed was credited for proving the link. Building on that knowledge half a century later, in 1951, virologist Max Theiler won the Nobel Prize for developing a yellow fever vaccine. In one particularly egregious study, American researchers testing medications for sexually transmitted diseases in the 1940s sent syphilis-infected sex workers into a Guatemalan prison to cavort with unsuspecting inmates. More than 1,300 people were exposed to syphilis and other STDs. Today's standards for human-challenge trials are rigorous. Durbin of Johns Hopkins points out that it takes a minimum of six months of prep work to responsibly carry out a human-challenge trial. This is in part because a suitable strain of the virus -- and the proper dosage -- must be developed in a lab outfitted with high biosafety standards. Also, researchers must find medical centers that are willing to house the participants in isolation for the duration of the study and provide first-rate care to anyone who falls seriously ill. \"I think it's very important that you plan for these studies now ... and you get it right,\" Durbin said. \"Yes, it may take time for a good human challenge model to be developed, but if we wait too long to develop it, then I think the moment has passed.\" Caring for volunteers can get trickyOne of the trickier aspects of a challenge study is compensation. Pay too little, and the study may fail to attract candidates; pay too much, and people could be enticed by the money without thinking of their safety.The latter scenario played out with the yellow-fever trials, in which a participant who was hoping to start a farm in Cuba said it was a \"cold-blooded business decision.\" The May 7 article in Science -- which concludes that the extraordinary nature of the Covid-19 pandemic warrants laying the groundwork for controlled human-infection trials -- recommends \"several thousand dollars.\"Seema Shah, a bioethicist and associate professor at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine -- and an author of the Science article -- said participants of a recent 40-day human-challenge study for malaria were paid about $2,300.\"Some were very motivated by the money, but others were also interested in the experience, and still others have strong motivations to help others,\" she said, adding that some participants personally knew sufferers of malaria and some even donated some of their earnings to charities. The article in the Journal of Infectious Diseases likens the act of volunteering for a human-challenge trial to other public-service endeavors -- such as volunteer firefighting or organ donation. \"People are willing to take on life-threatening risk for other people's benefit and often not just as a job but as a form of altruistic behavior,\" Lipsitch said. \"We not only encourage that, but we completely depend on that in many sectors of our lives.\" Still, the onus is on the researchers to ensure that the participants stay safe. \"What keeps me up at night,\" said Durbin, \"is if I administer a challenge agent to somebody, and that person gets seriously ill or dies -- that's on me.\"",

The post also attracted more than 31,000 likes and thousands of retweets.Read More\"I have just spoken to Pedro and his daughter,\" Hern\u00e1ndez told his Twitter followers less than 24 hours after his initial post. \"You don't know how moved both of them were.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Tom Hanks is getting personal about the coronavirus battle that he and his wife Rita Wilson experienced.\n\nThe actor says although he didn't have symptoms as bad as Wilson, he felt \"wiped\" while in isolation at a hospital in Queensland, Australia last month. \"I was wiped after 12 minutes [of exercising]. I laid down in my hospital bed and just slept,\" Hanks told National Defense Radio Show. He recalled telling a medical professional who was treating him at the time, \"'I just had the weirdest thing. I just tried to do basic stretches and exercises on the floor and I couldn't even get halfway through.' And she looked at me through her glasses like she was talking to the dumbest human being. And she said, 'You have COVID-19.'\"He said that his wife had such bad nausea from the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, that at times she couldn't even walk.\"Rita went through a tougher time than I did,\" Hanks went on to say. \"She had a much higher fever and she had some other symptoms. She lost her sense of taste and smell. She got absolutely no joy from food for a better part of three weeks ... She was so nauseous she had to crawl on the floor from the bed to the facilities.\"Read MoreWilson recently spoke about her experience with COVID-19 to \"CBS This Morning.\"\"I felt extremely achy, uncomfortable, didn't want to be touched, and then the fever started,\" Wilson told Gayle King. She also discussed having a temperature of 102 degrees Fahrenheit and \"chills like I never had before.\"After recovering from coronavirus, the couple returned home to Los Angeles in late March.",

Currently the only authorized treatment is the experimental antiviral drug remdesivir, which also shortens the duration of illness but is limited in supply.Dr. Kwok-Yung Yuen at Hong Kong University and colleagues tested the HIV drug combination of ritonavir and lopanivir along with the general antiviral drug ribavirin and a multiple sclerosis drug called beta interferon.Patients in the study all had mild to moderate symptoms and were treated within seven days of testing positive. Some doctors think treating patients earlier in the course of the infection might be better.Yuen's team gave some patients only the HIV drug combination, often sold under the brand name Kaletra. Other were randomly assigned to get the lopinavir-ritonavir combination plus the antiviral drug ribavirin and injections of beta interferon.Read MoreThe patients who got the cocktail tested negative for coronavirus after seven days on average. Those who just got the HIV drugs were positive on average for 12 days, the team reported in the Lancet medical journal.Few side effects, study saysThe patients given the cocktail also felt better quicker -- within four days.\"Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir-ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,\" the researchers wrote.There were few side effects, they added.Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, who is treating coronavirus patients at the University of California San Francisco, said the study offers new hope in the pandemic.\"This study is really refreshing because it tells us remdesivir isn't the only game in town and maybe there are other options around,\" he told CNN.\"These drugs have a track record of safety,\" he said, adding they are also easily available.Doctors and pharmacists have complained that they don't know which hospitals and clinics will get remdesivir, which was given US Food and Drug Administration emergency use authorization after it was shown to reduce the duration of illness in Covid-19 patients.Chin-Hong said the Lancet study showed the possibility of other treatments.\"Maybe we can get this when we can't get the alleged magic bullet,\" he said.Many groups are testing various combinations of drugs against coronavirus. Nothing is likely to be a cure, doctors agree. \"In Covid-19 we don't have the luxury of time,\" Chin-Hong said. \"This is one of the treatment options where we are teaching old drugs new tricks. We don't have the time to take a drug rationally from beginning to end because we have a crisis right now. We have to make do with what we have.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)The US Army is asking technology companies to develop wearable sensors to detect early symptoms of coronavirus. This week they invited initial proposals for a $25 million contract to develop a device that uses existing technology as much as possible.\n\n\"There is a dire and urgent need for development of rapid, accurate wearable diagnostics to identify and isolate pre-symptomatic COVID-19 cases and track/prevent the spread of the virus,\" the Army said in an initial solicitation that was issued through a medical consortium.Whereever the sensor is worn on the body, possibly on the wrist like a watch or on a shirt or belt, the aim is it will provide indicators of a fever, respiratory difficulties, \"molecular biomarkers\" of exposure to the virus and even the presence of antibodies against it. If symptoms are detected then the service member can be fully tested, isolated and receive medical attention if necessary.It's all part of a broader military effort to contribute to efforts to battle the virus on everything from vaccine research to sewing face coverings. Many of the initiatives are similar to what is happening in civilian society, but there are efforts to adapt emerging battlefield technology to take on the pandemic.Read MoreAn Army team based at Fort Benning, Georgia, in charge of ensuring advanced warfighting capabilities for soldiers in close combat has adapted goggles used in battle to take the temperature of 300 troops in 25 minutes. The concept is important for high traffic areas such as public transportation, airports and buildings -- as well as for the safe movement of large numbers of military personnel, especially new recruits who may need to be screened and tested multiple times.The group was tested as the Army Infantry School was getting ready for additional training but needed a temperature check as an initial screening measure. The screeners were provided with a prototype of the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), goggles designed for soldiers to keep their eyes on a target while receiving information about what they are focused on.IVAS has a suite of heat and low light sensors along with a Microsoft software application for the battlefield. One of the project managers Tom Bowman says he realized the digital thermal sensors could quickly be modified to detect body temperatures. Four days later, Microsoft and the Army \"loaded in a new software application,\" which adapted the goggles to read body temperatures at a safe distance with little to no contact.In addition, a system with a tripod mounted infrared sensor to measure body temperature is being installed at the Pentagon where eventually more than 20,000 people will return to work. The system scans for just a second or two before they enter the building. Eventually more than 20 systems will be activated, including at the Pentagon's entrance and exit next to the Metro, one of the most heavily trafficked areas. Army officials tell CNN the units are calibrated for weather so even if it a hot summers day, they will be able to detect someone running a fever and refer them for medical testing to see if they have the virus.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A leading US model has upped its projected coronavirus death toll in August to 66,000 -- a 10% increase from its previous prediction.\n\nThe change came as states began updating their number of deaths, adding residents of nursing homes who officials are now counting as presumptive positives, Dr. Chris Murray, the director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, said Tuesday. But as those numbers grow higher and paint the pandemic as larger than previously thought, Murray said the dates of when social distancing measures can be relaxed should also be moved down. He said his team of experts were taken aback when states like Georgia -- which still has a high number of infections -- announced they'll be easing some restrictions. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp has said he expects an uptick in cases as many stores begin to reopen in the state this Friday, but said the state is prepared to handle them.\"If people start to go back to normal social interaction or even progressively go back, the risk of transmission will go up ... and then you go back to the sort of exponential rise that was happening before we put in social distancing,\" Murray told CNN. \"The risk is very great for resurgence from these early openings.\"Read MoreThat's as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director gave an ominous forecast of a possible second wave of the virus in the winter.\"There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield told The Washington Post. \"We're going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time. The US has so far recorded more than 825,300 infections and at least 45,075 deaths. Your coronavirus questions, answeredCalifornia town one of the first to try to test all its residentsTo safely move forward, experts have long emphasized the country should be able to track, trace and isolate cases. Bolinas, a remote Northern California community, may be one of the first in the world to attempt to test all of its residents for the virus and for the antibodies that may make people immune. Less than 2,000 people live in the town and in the first two days of testing, more than 700 residents showed up. The community-wide free testing is voluntary and part of a new study launched by the University of California, San Francisco, that's attempting to get a more complete understanding of how the virus is invisibly spreading.That unseen spread is something health officials all over the state are trying to tackle, now recommending coronavirus testing for asymptomatic people who live or work in high-risk environments such as nursing homes or hospitals. The new guidelines, from the state's department of health, were announced in an April 19 memo and make California the first state in the nation to broaden its guidelines for testing to include those without symptoms, state health officials told CNN. According to a spokesperson from the department, the previous guidance from the CDC was to test high-risk patients with symptoms and healthcare workers with symptoms.Meanwhile, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday the state is currently averaging 14,500 coronavirus tests a day.That number, he said, \"is still inadequate\" and the state has a long way to go before attempting to reopen. The US has so far conducted 4 million testsIn two different plans for reopening society, economists and public health experts have said millions of tests should be conducted each week before restrictions can be lifted. One report estimates three to 30 million tests should be conducted weekly, while the other says the US should be conducting 20 million tests each day to get a handle on the pandemic. So far, the country has performed about 4 million tests. And while federal officials tout the country has testing capacity, some state leaders -- including Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker -- have reported that while they may have the necessary machines, they're lacking the materials and staff to run them. A new test that was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration may mean Americans can mail in their results. The test would allow patients to collect their samples using an at-home test kit and then mail it into the lab for testing, the FDA said Tuesday. That test could be available in most states to consumers who have a doctor's order within the coming weeks, the agency said. \"Throughout this pandemic we have been facilitating test development to ensure patients access to accurate diagnostics, which includes supporting the development of reliable and accurate at-home sample collection options,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in the agency's announcement.The news comes as an announcement from another company warned of possibly misleading results.Abbott Laboratories, the maker of a rapid coronavirus test that's been widely used across the country and distributed by the federal government, warned its device can produce false negatives if a certain solution is used to move or store the patients' samples. The company told health care workers not to use \"viral transport media\" solutions on its device and instead said customers should only place swabs with patients' samples directly in the device.States are grappling with how to move forwardDespite the questions still surrounding tests in the US, many governors across the country have turned their attention to reopening their state's economy. Last week, the federal government said in order to do so, states should wait to see a 14-day continuous decline before thinking about lifting their measures -- the first of three phases of reopening. South Carolina and Georgia announced this week -- before either hit that milestone -- they'll be easing restrictions. Georgia's governor said workers and business owners need relief, adding that businesses including bowling alleys, body art studios and hair and nail salons can reopen this week. Theaters and restaurants can open their doors next week with social distancing restrictions. Kemp said that no local ordinance can restrict the openings, which will be implemented statewide. Mayors across the state were left astounded, many saying they're unprepared for such a move. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms told CNN Tuesday she's exploring whether the city has legal grounds for putting different orders in place than what Kemp has announced.\"I have searched my head and my heart on this, and I am at a loss as to what the governor is basing this decision on,\" she said.South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster announced retail stores selling furniture, books, music, flowers, clothing and accessories, as well as department stores, sporting goods stores and flea markets are allowed to open at 20% capacity -- or five people per 1,000 square feet. Beaches, he said, will reopen Tuesday at noon.In Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee announced most businesses across the state will be able to reopen May 1, once the state's stay-at-home order has expired -- but hinted some may be able to open even sooner. Other governors -- including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Newsom -- have announced they have partnered with neighboring states to come up with plans to reopen but have stopped short of giving a timeline just yet. Cuomo has highlighted that ramped up testing will be key in preparing the state. On Tuesday, he tweeted the state was planning to double its capacity to 40,000 tests per day, saying it was an \"ambitious\" goal but \"critical.\"\n\nCNN's Arman Azad, Augie Martin, Jacqueline Howard and Joe Sutton contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)In the tiny remote community of Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico, about one out of eight residents has been tested for Covid-19.\n\nThat's not because the virus is particularly widespread in this community in north central New Mexico, nestled between a national forest and an Apache Nation reservation. It's because in New Mexico, tests are free and plentiful. Some residents of Tierra Amarilla went to a one-day free testing event in town a few weeks ago, and if they missed that they can drive to a permanent testing center 45 minutes away. If residents don't have transportation, the Department of Health will come and test them in Tierra Amarilla. So far, the state has performed 89,032 coronavirus tests. That's more than any other state with around the same population. New Mexico has conducted around the same number of tests or more than states such as Oklahoma, Nevada and South Carolina, which have considerably larger populations. But not every state is like New Mexico. Months after federal officials said coronavirus testing would be plentiful, the tests are still hard to find in some parts of the country. Read More\"We want to test for this the way we test for HIV, that you can do it without worrying. That's not the case in many parts of the country,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. \"We have a patchwork of testing across the country.\" Limited testing, despite promises On a March 6th visit to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, President Donald Trump said \"anybody that wants a test can get a test.\" More than two months later, that's still not the case. It's not just a matter of having the tests themselves, but also having supplies like swabs and chemical reagents that are needed to run the tests. Since April 29, Michigan has had enough lab space to do 16,000 coronavirus tests a day, but has never done more than 11,000 tests a day, according to state data. \"We've never been able to get to full capacity because we are missing things in the supply chain,\" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on CNN's State of the Union on May 3. Dr. Rob Davidson, an emergency physician at a rural Michigan hospital, says there aren't enough tests for doctors and nurses on his staff, even though Whitmer said all essential workers should be tested. \"We don't know how we're going to get that system in place,\" Davidson said. Even labs associated with large academic medical centers are experiencing shortages. \"There are limited supplies and there are differences in which labs have been able to order which supplies and how much of the order shows up,\" said Heather Pierce, the senior director for science policy and regulatory counsel at the Association of American Medical Colleges. It's a variable situation, she added. \"One lab that has everything that it needs for one week doesn't necessarily know what it's going to get the next week,\" she said. Need for more tests As recorded cases of coronavirus continue to rise in the United States by 20,000 to 30,000 per day, public health officials have emphasized that more testing will bring the numbers down and help the nation find a pathway out of the pandemic. Once there is widespread testing, health experts say infected people can be identified and isolated, and close contacts can quarantine themselves at home. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, estimated on April 25 that the US is conducting approximately 1.5 to 2 million coronavirus tests per week. \"We probably should get up to twice that as we get into the next several weeks,\" Fauci said the same day during a Covid-19 briefing by the National Academy of Sciences. But according to the COVID Tracking Project, which records testing and patient data nationwide, just 1.5 million coronavirus tests were conducted between April 30 and May 6. Finding fixes Last week, the White House released a testing blueprint that said the federal government should be the \"supplier of last resort.\" It's up to the states to come up with testing plans and \"to identify and overcome barriers to efficient testing,\" including \"misallocation of supplies\" and \"logistical failures,\" according to the blueprint. Some states have had more success than others. New Mexico has more than 80 testing sites in all 33 counties. Not all operate at the same time -- some are permanent, others are drive-through or open for a few hours a day. The state offers free testing to anyone with symptoms of coronavirus, anyone who's been in close contact with someone who's had the virus, or anyone at high risk for contracting the virus, such as an essential worker or a nursing home resident. \"We believe testing is critical. We always have, and so it's a priority,\" said Kathy Kunkel, New Mexico's secretary of health. Some other states have also made it relatively easy for people to get tested. On April 2, Utah launched a website where residents can find out if they qualify for free testing at a drive-through. So far, nearly 20,000 tests have been administered by the \"TestUtah\" initiative. Despite the federal blueprint, Michigan hopes to receive some relief from the federal government. On May 3, a senior Trump administration official told CNN that the administration is sending the state 450,000 additional swabs and other supplies to help it meet its goal to perform 450,000 tests in May, which is more than three times the number of tests performed there from the beginning of the outbreak through the end of April. Others also see reason for optimism. \"Over the last several weeks it's become easier for me to order tests for people,\" said Adalja, the Hopkins physician. \"But the point is doctors and people have to be comfortable ordering tests and not worrying about supply chain issues.\"\n\nRyan Nobles and Sara Murray contributed to this story.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A US government review out Friday sheds light on early missteps of the administration in repatriating the first Americans from coronavirus-struck Wuhan, China, on January 29.\n\nWhile the summary report makes clear that all the individuals were asymptomatic, it echoes some of the concerns raised in February by a whistleblower from the Department of Health and Human Services, who complained that more than a dozen workers who received the evacuees lacked the proper training or protective gear. The report notes that no US government personnel involved in the repatriation and subsequent quarantine tested positive for or contracted Covid-19 as a result.The report was sent to congressional offices on Friday.Asked to respond to the findings, HHS replied that it had deployed an incident management team within hours after the flight's arrival that arrived at the base two days later \"and began providing appropriate guidance and prevention measures,\" and said the department immediately launched an investigation after receiving the whistleblower's complaint. Read More\"The investigation concluded that during the early days of what was an unprecedented repatriation of U.S. citizens from Wuhan, China, a rapidly evolving response meant that uniform infection-control and infection-prevention measures were not initially in place at March Air Force Base when repatriated Americans arrived on January 29,\" it said in a statement. According to the summary of the investigation by HHS' Office of the General Counsel obtained by CNN, the state of California was going to handle the repatriation of nearly 200 US citizens -- including diplomats and their families -- but at the last minute, it was decided the facility it was going to use was \"medically inadequate.\"HHS then stepped in, but without time to plan, \"there was no designated agency or official leading the repatriation effort\" when the plane landed at March Air Reserve Base east of Los Angeles, according to the report.As a result, appropriate safety protocols were not followed, according to the report. On the way out of China and during a refueling stop in Alaska, passengers were screened for symptoms of coronavirus. No one was symptomatic, according to HHS.\"Initially, no procedures were in place at March to ensure uniform infection-control and infection-prevention measures, including the proper use of personal protective equipment (PPE),\" the report states. \"Appropriate safety officers were not designated and in place from the outset of the deployment. Nor was an Infection Prevention Control Plan in place, a normal component of a deployment of this type.\"Clear, written instructions for proper PPE use were not disseminated and posted at March until February 1, three days after the evacuees arrived.\"Some officials \"were forced to use Riverside County California's PPE,\" the report adds. Food distributors at March also were not wearing personal protective equipment and were at times within 6 feet of repatriated individuals, according to the report.\"According to multiple interviewees, ACF [Administration for Children and Families] also directed HHS personnel to remove PPE to avoid 'bad optics.' Finally, according to multiple eyewitness accounts, the CDC lead at March repeatedly interacted closely with evacuees without donning appropriate PPE,\" the report states.The CDC ordered a federal 14-day quarantine for the evacuees on January 30. The HHS report says none of them tested positive for Covid-19.The problems described did not recur during the arrival of another evacuation flight at Travis Air Force Base a week later, according to the report.\"Written PPE protocols were in place and all U.S. Government personnel were trained in proper PPE and PPE usage before the arrival of evacuees at Travis,\" it states. \"Although there has been anecdotal evidence of breaches of PPE protocol at Travis, it appears that those breaches were the result of individual mistakes.\"\n\nCNN's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)New research and two February deaths confirmed as virus-related prove coronavirus was spreading in the US much earlier than experts initially thought.\n\nAn earlier spread may mean more people have been infected than officials estimate, which one researcher says might also mean the death toll of the virus is lower than it seems. But the pandemic, which has taken at least 49,963 lives in the US, is far from over. The World Health Organization said it will be \"weeks to months\" before the world knows what drugs can work against the virus. As efforts across the world to find an effective treatment are in progress, officials in the US have begun sweeping efforts to get a clear picture of the numbers of the virus in the country. The February 6 death of 57-year-old Patricia Dowd in Northern California is now the earliest known death in the country from the virus and shows the illness was circulating weeks before, a Santa Clara County official told CNN. The county announced the February 17 death of a 67-year-old man and the March 6 death of a third victim were also virus-related.Dr. Sara Cody, the Health Office and Public Health Director of Santa Clara County, California, said the victims were exposed to the virus two to three weeks prior to their deaths. Since none of them had a recent travel history, she said they were exposed in that community.Read More\"Obviously the virus was circulating and perhaps fairly widely in our county, which in some ways is not that surprising given that we're a very large county, very demographically diverse and there's a lot of travel to every corner of the world, including Asia,\" she said Thursday night. But at the time, officials had reassured the public the risk of catching the virus was low. The three victims had not gotten tested for the virus because testing at the time was very limited, the county said earlier this week, and was only restricted to people with a related travel history. Cody said her office began receiving reports at the time of the first two deaths that suggested a wider spread.\"We were hearing from a number of physicians about patients presenting with flu-like symptoms without travel history. We were asking ourselves early on what the extent of virus might be in the community, but all of the indicators we had suggested that it was very low risk and probably not much.\"This week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom asked coroners across the state to review cases dating back to December to determine whether they were also coronavirus related. Officials are tracing cases in other states tooAcross the country, a similar message: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that results of a study conducted on 3,000 New Yorkers show the virus was spreading in the region much earlier than previously thought.About 14% of the state's residents have antibodies, Cuomo said. Antibodies help show who may have previously had the virus and developed the antibodies as a result.\"It is significantly more widespread than most people had imagined and I think it confirms he point that (coronavirus) spread faster and it got here earlier than we originally believed,\" Cuomo said. But the results may also be a point of reassurance. If more people had the virus than experts believe, that may mean the virus' fatality rate may also be lower, Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at Johns Hopkins University, said.\"It tells us this virus is much more widespread than we thought,\" he said. \"The hospitalization rate may be much lower because the denominator (of people infected) is so much bigger.\"And, it also shows people have been developing some immunity. \"There are people that have mild illness that don't know they are sick, and those individuals may be part of how we move forward as we start to think about reopening certain parts of the country,\" he added. Researchers from Boston's Northeastern University now suggest the virus was being transmitted throughout American communities earlier than late February, Kate Coronges, the executive director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, said. What that means, Coronges said, is the first cases outside mainland China had already occurred before January. The WHO is now also tracking a number of studies across the world trying to determine how many people have been infected by the virus globally, according to Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, the technical lead for the coronavirus response with the agency.What the WHO is seeing, Van Kerkhove said, is that the number of people with antibodies globally ranges between 2 to 3%, and up to 14%, according to one study in Germany.'Weeks to months' away from effective treatmentThe agency is also tracking hundreds of coronavirus drug trials. \"Everyone in the world wants to know which drugs, which medications are going to work, which medications are going to save lives,\" Van Kerkhove said. \"Unfortunately, right now, we don't have any evidence one works, yet.\"It's critical that the studies are done and done well, Van Kerkhove said.The results, she added, \"can't come soon enough.\" But the world is \"weeks to months\" from knowing what works.The rapid efforts are similar to the ones who were taken by the experts who helped developed tests for the virus. Those types of tests, that typically take years to develop, are being created in weeks, US Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said. He said the FDA is continuously adjusting their criteria to make sure the tests they approve are accurate and reliable. \"But we also know that when they go out into the community, they're being used. We're going to get feedback about how they actually operate in the real world. They may be used under conditions that weren't originally tested, or things like that,\" Hahn said. \"We are always incorporating data that we hear and then adjusting our authorizations based on that. So this is an ongoing effort.\"He suggested that people use the FDA's website to ensure the tests they are using have been approved by the agency -- which has so far approved 62 diagnostic tests, four of which are antibody tests. The agency has 390 lab test developers working with the FDA to get authorization.\"What I can provide assurance to the American people is that those tests that we've reviewed and that we've authorized have gone through the criteria established for validity, reliability and reproducibility by the FDA,\" Hahn said.\n\nCNN's Kristina Sgueglia, Rebekah Riess, Jen Christensen, Wesley Bruer, Gisela Crespo and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Health officials across the country are warning Americans to refrain from celebrating Mother's Day in large crowds this year, urging that continued social distancing is still key to preventing more coronavirus cases.\n\nIn Pasadena, California, officials put out a warning after tracing a cluster of cases back to a birthday party, and in Louisiana the department of health recommended celebration alternatives -- like virtual brunch. \"Resist the temptation to hug your mom and maintain six feet of separation,\" the Louisiana Department of Public Health said. The reminders come as most states begin the first phase of reopening their economies despite a growing nationwide death toll. At least 78,794 Americans have died and more than 1,309,500 have been infected. Read MoreAnd last week brought another piece of alarming news: New York state officials believe that an inflammatory illness observed in dozens of youth -- killing two children and a teenager -- may be linked to the virus. But governors have begun relaxing measures across the US amid protests from residents and business owners who demanded an end to sweeping stay-at-home orders. And as states grapple with finding a path toward the new normal, more protests have taken shape across the country by residents who refused to put on face coverings. This is where states stand on reopeningPublic health experts have cautioned the US is not ready to begin reopening -- citing lack of sufficient testing and contact tracing efforts, among other reasons -- and that premature lifting of measures could mean a death toll twice as high as previously predicted. But the effects of the loosening measures won't become evident for a while. \"It will be at least two to three weeks before we see an increase in the number of infections because it takes time for individuals to infect others and for them to display symptoms,\" data scientist Youyang Gu, whose coronavirus projection model is cited by the CDC, told CNN. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading public health expert, has said if measures are lifted too early, the country could see a rebound of the virus which could land the US \"right back in the same boat that we were a few weeks ago.\"Coronavirus: You asked, we answeredTop health officials exposed to virusFauci is one of a handful of top government and health officials who announced they came in contact with an infected person at the White House. Fauci told CNN he will begin a \"modified quarantine\" after making a \"low risk\" contact with a White House staffer who tested positive for the virus. While Fauci was not in close proximity to the person, he said he will spend the next two weeks working from home and wearing a mask, adding he may go to his office, where he will be alone. Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will self-quarantine for two weeks after he was also exposed to a person at the White House who tested positive for the virus, a CDC spokesperson confirmed to CNN.Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, will also go into quarantine after coming into contact with an individual who tested positive for the virus, an FDA spokesman confirmed to CNN on Friday.Officials didn't identify the person to whom Hahn or Redfield were exposed. However, Katie Miller, the press secretary to Vice President Mike Pence, tested positive on Friday. She is known to often be in the White House coronavirus task force meetings.Track the virusAn illness seen in children may be linked to virusIn New York, state officials have partnered with federal officials to provide other states with information following the deaths of three youth that could be linked to the virus. A teenager and two children under eight years old died from an inflammatory illness observed in dozens of children in New York, state officials said Saturday. That illness could be linked to the virus, they said. \"We were laboring under the impression young people were not affected by Covid-19,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. \"We're not so sure that that is the fact anymore.\"Researchers still don't know whether coronavirus caused the syndrome. But this is under investigation, Cuomo said.\"We still have a lot to learn about this virus,\" he said.State officials had previously warned that dozens of children in the state had been hospitalized with a condition doctors described as \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome,\" and that it could be linked to coronavirus.The children had fever and symptoms similar to toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, the state had said. Kawasaki disease causes inflammation in the walls of blood vessels, including those that supply blood to the heart, which in rare cases can lead to deadly limitations in blood flow.Many of the children tested positive for the virus or had its antibodies, Cuomo said, but they didn't necessarily present with typical symptoms for the coronavirus disease, such as respiratory distress.\n\nCNN's Madeline Holcombe and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Dr. Amy Compton-Phillips is a CNN medical analyst. She is the chief clinical officer of Providence, a health system with 51 hospitals in the western US. The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN)Americans across the country have joined forces in fighting a common enemy: the Covid-19 pandemic. But one question starkly divides us during this crisis: Who is most at risk of dying from the virus? The answer does not reflect well on the US.\n\nMedical evidence has revealed that elderly people face an increased risk of dying from the disease, along with people of all ages who have chronic health issues, such as diabetes, obesity and hypertension. Among those with underlying conditions who are dying from the virus, a disproportionate number are living in poverty or are African American or Latinx. Why? Because these populations often do not have, or cannot afford, access to the preventive medicine that can help them stay healthy. A primary care provider's job is to keep people well, including managing highly treatable conditions such as diabetes and hypertension. Uncontrolled, these maladies can make a person vulnerable to potentially deadly diseases like Covid-19, as well as heart attacks and strokes.But it's not just Covid-19 that has had an outsized impact on communities of color and people with low incomes. The prohibitive cost of health care in the US means many people can't afford to take preventative action -- leading to more suffering down the line as they develop health conditions that could have avoided. A patient I'll call James recently came to the emergency department in Spokane, Washington, unable to speak or move the right side of his body. His stroke symptoms had started three days earlier, but he had unpaid hospital bills after a heart scare five years ago, and he dreaded engaging with the health care system again. He works at a convenience store and doesn't have health insurance. The price tag and out-of-pocket costs associated with the plans available on his state's insurance exchange had put coverage out of reach for him. Despite his father dying young of a heart attack and his mother having diabetes, he had not seen a doctor in years. Unfortunately, James's delay in seeking care for his stroke meant it was too late for him to take clot-busting medication. His best hope is rehab, which might help him recover the ability to speak, walk, and use his right arm. The frustrating thing for those of us who care for patients is that so much of their suffering is completely unnecessary. People who are able to control the risk factors of stroke (which include blood pressure, cholesterol and diabetes) are much less likely to need the expensive medical interventions we use regularly in American medicine. In James's case, generic blood pressure medicine can be purchased for as little as $48 a year; hospitalization for stroke and subsequent rehab could cost well over $20,000. We can do better for people like James, and we'd save a fortune as a society by doing so. The Covid-19 pandemic has cast the disparity between the haves and the have-nots in a harsh light. If people including low-wage workers, those experiencing homelessness, and the undocumented cannot afford to seek preventive care and testing, they risk their own lives, with the possibility of becoming super-spreaders if they have no choice but to continue working while sick.Read MoreUniversal access to primary care is essential for many Americans to improve the quality and length of their lives and to reduce the threat of contagion. Studies show primary care-oriented health care systems are associated with lower mortality rates and fewer heart disease and cancer deaths. The late Dr. Barbara Starfield, a pediatrician who advocated for universal primary care, demonstrated that across many countries, healthcare systems that offer comprehensive primary care improve population health at lower costs and with greater equity. Universal access to preventive care should be a right, not a privilege. If the US were to adopt universal primary care under a \"capitated\" model -- in which primary care doctors are paid fixed sums per patient -- a single, monthly fee would cover everything from annual physicals to skin checks, immunizations, pelvic exams, blood tests, and evaluation for and treatment of chronic diseases and other illnesses. This could be conducted either through in-person visits or via telehealth video chats, phone calls, and online messaging. Primary care physicians could also coordinate specialist care when necessary and serve as a quarterback when a patient's health needs get complex.With the government already funding nearly 40% of the care in the US through Medicare and Medicaid, and given the amounts that emergency care hospitals must absorb without being reimbursed, providing universal primary care should help lower overall health care costs over time by reducing the need for emergency room visits and hospitalizations. Further proof of the value of this approach is that other countries that are predominantly oriented toward primary care spend far less on health care per person than in the US. As we wage the battle against Covid-19, it has become all too clear that the US would benefit from universal primary care. We can keep private insurance and the high-end specialty care America excels in, while also revamping access to the basic, foundational health infrastructure in the US. By enabling universal access to primary care, we can eliminate some of the inequities illuminated by this pandemic. We can afford to make basic health care a human right rather than a privilege. Until the simple prevention and treatment of common ailments is within reach for all, everyone in this country will be vulnerable.",

        "body": "Washington (CNN)The USS Theodore Roosevelt is expected to return to sea this week after spending weeks in port in Guam following a major coronavirus outbreak on board in March, a US Navy official tells CNN.\n\nThe Associated Press first reported the ship is expected to leave port. The Navy's top medical officer said the ship is ready from a medical standpoint.Navy Surgeon General Rear Adm Bruce Gillingham told CNN in an exclusive interview he is \"very confident\" the Roosevelt is \"medically ready\" despite the fact a number of sailors tested positive for the virus after returning to the ship.More than 1,000 of the aircraft carrier's nearly 4,900-member crew had tested positive for Covid-19 following the outbreak. After evacuating some 4,000 sailors from the ship to Guam, the Navy had been returning sailors following a period of quarantine and isolation in the hopes of getting the aircraft carrier to sea as soon as possible.Read MoreThe Roosevelt has been carrying out some preliminary in-port exercises to test the operational readiness of key systems on board. Even though more than 600 hundred sailors are still in isolation, the ship will be able to go to sea as it has enough healthy crew members to run essential functions on board. Gillingham's medical assessment follows 14 sailors testing positive for the virus over the last week, after initially having been thought to have recovered and being allowed to return to the ship. The sailors had reported atypical body aches to the ship's medical team which caused them to be tested again. But it's believed they are not infectious, Gillingham said. \"Individuals may have persistent symptoms for quite a while, but given the information that we have to date, they're unlikely to be infectious at that point,\" he said.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates people are unlikely to be infectious 10 days after symptoms emerge, but the Navy is keeping sailors who tested positive in isolation for at least 14 days as an extra precaution to minimize the chances of infection once they are at sea.Gillingham emphasized that the sailors who recently tested positive self-reported the symptoms, which led to them being tested again. The ship has instituted strict social distancing measures ranging from one-way passageways and stairwells to extended meal hours so sailors can eat in smaller groups.Inquiry in progressThe outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier triggered a chain of events that led to the firing of the ship's commanding officer, and the resignation of the acting Navy secretary.Last month the Navy announced that it was launching a broader inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the outbreak, effectively delaying its initial recommendation that the ship's commanding officer be reinstated.The announcement came days after Secretary of Defense Mark Esper declined to immediately endorse the Navy's original investigation into the issue, which included a recommendation to reinstate Capt. Brett Crozier.US officials told CNN that senior Navy officials had recommended that Crozier be reinstated but Esper was not prepared to immediately endorse that recommendation and the wider inquiry was launched the following week.Crozier was fired for what then-acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said was poor judgment for too widely disseminating a warning among Navy officials about the spread of the virus aboard his vessel, a warning that eventually made its way into the press.While Modly publicly accused Crozier of sending his letter of warning to 20 to 30 people, the email to which the letter was attached shows that Crozier sent it to 10 people including his direct superior, according to a copy of the email obtained by The Washington Post.\"I believe if there is ever a time to ask for help it is now regardless of the impact on my career,\" Crozier wrote in his email, the contents of which a US official directly familiar with the message confirmed to CNN.Modly resigned days later over his handling of the incident, actions which included a $240,000 trip to Guam where he slammed Crozier and admonished sailors for giving Crozier a rousing send off in public remarks to the crew.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)When Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp issued a statewide shelter in place order for residents earlier this week, he attracted widespread criticism for saying he and state officials were just \"finding out that this virus is now transmitting before people see signs,\" despite publicly available findings that have circulated for weeks about such risks.\n\nThe statement drew incredulity from many, especially from some of those in the medical and public health community.\n\n\"It's just inexcusable,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said Thursday night. \"My kids, who go to school in Georgia, knew that a month ago. I can't even believe that.\"The governor's office says Kemp, a Republican, was referring to fresh guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said earlier this week that exposure risk could happen two days before symptoms begin. But Kemp's office, in response to questions about his public pronouncement, pointed to public statements they'd put out for weeks about the possibility of asymptomatic people spreading the virus.\"There is a significant risk that individuals who seem healthy could visit a facility and unintentionally endanger residents. As such, it is critical that we take these precautions to protect the frail and elderly,\" Kemp's office said in a March 16 news release about the need to restrict visitors from long-term care facilities.\"If you continue to go to work, school, or other gatherings -- even if you are not experiencing symptoms -- you may be putting others at risk,\" his office said on March 20, this time about the need for social distancing.Read MoreSuch statements are at odds with Kemp's comments Wednesday in Atlanta -- where the CDC is headquartered -- when he finally issued the statewide stay-at-home order that many experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, had already been calling for nationwide. \"What we've been telling people from directives from the CDC for weeks now that if you start feeling bad, stay home. Those individuals could have been infecting people before they ever felt bad. But we didn't know that until the last 24 hours,\" Kemp said.On Monday, the CDC updated its guidance on the period of exposure risk, upgrading it from the \"onset of symptoms\" to \"48 hours before symptom onset.\"That shift was a \"game changer\" that moved Kemp to issue the shelter in place order for all of Georgia, he said at Wednesday's news conference.LISTEN: The Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction PodcastBut as of January 30, the CDC was noting in its guidance for managing patients with coronavirus that \"clinical presentation among reported cases of 2019-nCoV infection varies in severity from asymptomatic infection or mild illness to severe or fatal illness.\"CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield was speaking publicly about the possibility of asymptomatic transmission as early as mid-February, when he expressed such concerns to Gupta. And a month later, Dr. Deborah Birx, one of the most visible members of the White House task force addressing the pandemic, warned of the reality of asymptomatic transmission.\"We know there is virus spread before you develop symptoms, and then we know that there's a large group -- we don't know the precise percent yet -- that actually is asymptomatic or has such mild cases that they continue to spread the virus,\" she said at the White House on March 16.When asked by CNN how Kemp could know of the possibility of asymptomatic spread for weeks but say Wednesday that \"we didn't know that until the last 24 hours,\" Cody Hall, a spokesman, said Kemp \"was referring to the updated CDC guidelines and Dr. Redfield's statements about the rate of transmission and prevalence of asymptomatic transmission -- not the existence of asymptomatic transmission.\"Meanwhile, correspondence among Georgia officials further suggests the risk of asymptomatic transmission was known for weeks before Kemp's order.An email obtained by progressive watchdog Accountable.US via a public records request and shared with CNN showed that the head of the state's Department of Public Health, Dr. Kathleen Toomey, was advised in early March to inform the public that people who didn't display symptoms of the virus could still spread it to others.\"Note that this encourages staying away from others even if a person may not me [sic] experiencing symptoms themselves, but a family member does. Why? Because there is a strong chance that a person could be infected but asymptomatic, but could still infect others,\" Pinar Keskinocak, the director of Georgia Tech's Center for Health and Humanitarian Systems, wrote in the email sent to Toomey and other state officials on March 2. The message was first reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.Asked about the disparity between Kemp's claim this week that state officials didn't know people could transmit the virus without symptoms despite the state's top health official having been told just that a month ago, Nancy Nydam, a spokeswoman for Toomey, pointed CNN to a news release from Thursday explaining Kemp's shelter in place order.\"For weeks it has been known that people who were positive for COVID-19 but did not have symptoms likely were able to transmit the virus,\" says the release, again reiterating Kemp's citation of the updated CDC guidance this week regarding potential spread among asymptomatic people.",

        "body": "Seoul, South Korea (CNN)A cluster of coronavirus cases connected to clubs frequented by South Korea's gay community has sparked an outpouring of hate speech towards the country's already-embattled LGBTQ population.\n\nMore than 100 cases have been linked to nightlife venues in the South Korean capital, and on Saturday, Seoul ordered all clubs and bars to temporarily close.The cluster has caused alarm in South Korea, which was among the first countries outside of China to deal with a large-scale coronavirus outbreak. In recent weeks, however, authorities had begun loosening restrictions as case numbers fell. The suggestion that the outbreak is linked to the city's gay scene has sparked a huge backlash against the LGBTQ community, including the 29-year-old man believed to be at the center of the cluster.Local media has emphasized his sexual orientation and reported that the clubs he visited are gay venues, although the venues do not openly describe themselves as such on their official websites or social media accounts. Read MoreThat reaction could make contact tracing harder, with people afraid to be associated with the LGBTQ community and having their sexuality outed. Although all three venues linked to the cluster asked for customers' full names and phone numbers on arrival, the city has been unable to contact almost 2,000 club-goers -- meaning they either avoided the calls or gave a false number, Seoul's mayor Park Won-soon said Monday.The city has had to employ other measures to track them. Using phone signal tower records, the city found that 10,905 people were in the vicinity of the clubs in the nightlife suburb of Itaewon between April 24 and May 6. Authorities have texted them all, saying they should get tested. Officials have also used credit cards to track almost 500 people, who have been asked to get tested and self-quarantine.The number of people who had been tested had nearly doubled between Sunday and Monday, after authorities began offering anonymous tests, Park said Tuesday. \"The growing number of condemnation and hate speech definitely does not help and only has adverse effects,\" he said. The outbreak also showed the need to always be on alert, Park said. \"If the disease penetrates Seoul, the Korean peninsula is penetrated,\" he said in an interview with CNN. \"We are seriously afraid, trying to find out the visitors as soon as possible.\"How the case unfoldedOn the night of May 1 and the early hours of May 2, a 29-year-old man visited several clubs in Itaewon, according to the South Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). On May 7, the man tested positive for Covid-19. At the time when the man went to the clubs, South Korea was still under strict social distancing rules, and citizens were encouraged to stay home and limit unnecessary contact with others. Those social distancing rules were lifted on May 6. KCDC deputy director Kwon Joon-wook said Tuesday that there are now two people identified as first showing symptoms on May 2 and said the Itaewon cluster may have \"various epicenters or sources.\"Under non-inforceable pandemic reporting guidelines that were drafted by Korea's journalist associations, media are told to avoid violating patients' privacy and using sensational language in reporting.But as the news broke, several South Korean media organizations reported that the bars the 29-year-old had visited were gay bars. That detail, coupled with the already-publicly available information about the man's age, district of residence, and movements, meant that the media had effectively outed him, potentially putting his employment at risk. South Korean authorities have urged the public not to target individuals or specific communities. Kwon said it was important to protect the personal information of those infected, and South Korean authorities have warned that leaking personal information of Covid-19 patients could also be a criminal offense. On Monday, a Ministry of Health official, Yoon Tae-ho, said that there had been a trend of \"criticism and hate against a certain group to which the infection occurred,\" without explicitly naming the LGBTQ community. \"Leaking personal information of confirmed patients or spreading baseless rumors not only harms other but could be criminally punished,\" Yoon added. In a statement, LGBT rights advocacy group, Solidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea, said the media's decision to reveal personal details of the 29-year-old patient had incited hatred and was a serious human rights violation.\"The attitude of media, who are obsessed with revealing the sexual orientation of the confirmed case and digging up information that has nothing to do with the disease, is adding a stigma of the disease to the hatred of minorities that has been prevalent in Korean society,\" the statement said. A wider issue of discriminationSolidarity for LGBT Human Rights of Korea also warned that discriminatory media reports would drive the coronavirus underground. \"It makes self-isolation and testing difficult,\" the statement said. That is also a concern of one 25-year-old in Seoul, who identifies as gay and who asked to be anonymous out of fear of discrimination,who says he was at two of the Itaewon clubs connected with the outbreak in early May.\"Gays feel cornered. Either out yourself and potentially ruin your life, or stay in the closet but risk spreading corona,\" he said. \"Gays are also feeling like there's this double standards, where they are being asked to be upstanding citizens and 'get tested for your country,' meanwhile the country treats them like dirt.\"South Korea has no comprehensive anti-discrimination laws to protect LGBTQ South Koreans, and compared to nearby democracies such as Japan and Taiwan, the country is less accepting of same-sex couples. LGBTQ soldiers serving in South Korea's military face abuse and discrimination, according to an Amnesty International report. Homosexual sex is illegal in the military whether it happens on or off base, and regardless of whether one party is not an enlisted soldier -- something that is not the case for heterosexual sex. The 25-year-old says the backlash to the latest cluster is only going to inflame that situation, with many in LGBTQ community afraid they might lose their jobs. Some have been threatened on the gay dating app Grindr, he added. \"Korea is such a homophobic place, these clubs are really a haven for these people,\" he says. \"I would hate to see them shut down permanently because of this virus or homophobia.\"The night out he had in early May was a normal evening, he says. \"Boys out dancing to K-pop, grabbing drinks, talking to old friends, really innocent stuff,\" he said. \"It's frustrating that the media is treating them all like sex clubs.\" How clubs should handle coronavirusThe outbreak has also highlighted the difficulty in containing outbreaks in clubs around the world -- regardless of the clubgoers' orientation. Bars are often frequented by young people -- and experts believe that while this demographic is less likely to die from the virus, they may have contributed to its spread. That's an issue that other countries are also thinking about. When New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced Monday that she was easing lockdown restrictions, she opted to delay opening the country's clubs and bars, pointing to South Korea's experience. Over the weekend, Hong Kong's famous nightlife district Lan Kwai Fong reopened, although clubs and karaoke bars remain closed.Allan Zeman, the chairman of Lan Kwai Fong, said that bars only filled about 50% of capacity, tables were spread out, patron's temperatures were taken and people needed to wear masks before they came inside. Patrons were also encouraged to leave their name and contact details. Over the weekend, many partygoers gathered on the street outside bars, which was \"pretty upsetting,\" he said.He expects that bars and clubs will be taking additional precautions -- such as temperature checks -- for some time, but doesn't expect people to stop going out altogether.\"It's human nature -- people want to go out, they want to enjoy themselves,\" he said. \"You need to otherwise you'll explode.\" Back in Seoul, the authorities are also trying to strike that balancing act. Park said citizens demand economic activities -- but at the same time, they needed to deal with coronavirus.\"We are living at the age of coronavirus and human beings (living in) coexistence.\"\n\nCNN's Sophie Jeong, Yoonjung Seo and Paula Hancocks contributed reporting from Seoul.",

        "body": "Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)The World Health Organization and health officials in the northern Nigerian state of Kano have launched a probe into reports of increases in unusual deaths, state Gov. Abdullahi Ganduje told CNN.\n\nA team of experts is gathering hospital records and interviewing families of those who died at home to determine the actual cause of death.Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari has also ordered a 14-day lockdown in Kano following the reported spike in deaths.Buhari said the government will deploy all \"human, material and technical\" assistance to contain the coronavirus in the state, and a team has been sent to investigate.Preliminary investigations by the state ministry of health suggest that the increase in mortality was not unusual compared to other years, Ganduje said. Read MoreStill, officials are interviewing cemetery workers, checking hospital records and asking residents about family members who died at home, the governor said.State officials had earlier said the \"mysterious deaths\" were not Covid-related and attributed the deaths to meningitis, diabetes, hypertension, and other illnesses, even though no autopsies have not been done.Kano isn't the only place to see an increase in deaths.In the US, deaths began to spike as Covid-19 started to spread.A Yale School of Public Health team, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, found about 15,000 excess deaths from March 1 to April 4. During the same time, states reported 8,000 deaths from Covid-19.A spike in deathsA gravedigger, Kabiru Nasidi Sabon-Sara, who has worked at the Dandolo Cemetery in Kano city for over 30 years, told CNN funerals carried out at the graveyard have doubled.Sabon-Sara said he began noticing the spike in deaths a day before Ramadan, and numbers have continued to rise since state authorities imposed a lockdown to curb a spread of the virus.\"In Dandolo we get between 35 to 40 burials, and it used to be less than that, between 13 to 15 at most in a day,\" Sabon-Sara said.He said one of the diggers who joined a funeral procession died, and some other diggers have been ill.\"We don't have anything to protect ourselves. Our colleagues are falling sick. We need assistance from the government,\" Sabon-Sara told CNN.Health workers faced a challenge in determining whether the deaths were coronavirus-related: the state's testing laboratory was not working at the time, Ganduje said. That made it difficult for health workers to collect samples for testing.Older patients affectedDr. Abubabar Nagoma, president of the Kano association of resident doctors who works at the government-owned Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, said there has been a rise in deaths among elderly patients in the state in recent weeks.He said while some had underlying illnesses such as diabetes, hypertension and previous strokes, they also had respiratory problems -- increasing concerns that they might have been coronavirus-related deaths.\"We're raising the high index of suspicion because of the age of some of the patients that died and the symptoms they experienced,\" Nagoma told CNN.\"We can't say the deaths are unconnected to the pandemic, and we can't say for sure it's Covid-19.\"Dr. Nura Abubakar of Kano's Medical Association said the lack of data about the situation during a pandemic has sparked speculation. Only a thorough probe could help put an end to it, Abubakar said.\"I know a woman who had breast cancer that died over the weekend,\" Abubakar said. \"We can say she succumbed to the illness, and we can't say she died of Covid-19 because she was not tested for the virus.\"Looming epidemicKano, Nigeria's largest northern city, has recorded 174 coronavirus cases and three deaths, according to Nigeria's Centre for Disease Control. According to a local media report, the state's sole testing center was forced to close last week after workers tested positive.The NCDC announced Tuesday that it had reopened the lab and planned to set up another testing center, but the delay and news of people dying had sparked concerns that the virus was spreading undetected in the state.The unconfirmed \"mysterious deaths\" have caused some apprehension among residents who are demanding answers, Maulid Warfa, head of the UNICEF office in Kano told CNN.Warfa said Kano had been battling other public health concerns, including high infant and maternal death rates, before the pandemic and it lacked the capacity to carry out enough tests to give a true picture of the situation.\"Kano only got its first laboratory about two weeks ago, and immediately that testing started, the numbers started jumping,\" she said.\n\nJournalist Aliyu Dahiru and CNN's Brent Swails and Maggie Fox contributed to the story.",

        "body": "(CNN)With much of the globe now under coronavirus-related restrictions, we have never been so tethered to our screens -- for work, to connect with friends, to unwind or to distract ourselves.\n\nOne new estimate suggested that adults are spending more than 13 hours a day using screens, a spike up from 10 hours a day a year ago. With children cut off from physically attending school, they are more reliant on laptops and tablets for online lessons and entertainment. And with our new routines likely to have a lot more screen time for the foreseeable future, experts say it's important to learn how to protect our eyes from suffering as a result. While there is no evidence of long-term eye damage from extended use of smartphones, computer screens or other devices, prolonged use can sometimes lead to blurred vision, eye fatigue, dry or irritated eyes and headaches, according to Moorfield Eye Hospital in London. Read MoreDr. Raj Maturi, the clinical spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology and a retina specialist, called these symptoms \"digital vision syndrome.\"He, along with the doctors at the Moorfield Eye Hospital, recommended a 20-20-20 approach -- for every 20 minutes spent at a screen you must take a break and look 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.\"When you are looking at a close target, your eyes are just training that one muscle at all time, and looking into the distance can relieve it,\" he said. Don't forget to blinkWhile it's close work, rather than screen use per se, that strains our eyes. Dr Maturi said that looking at bright devices can make us blink less, which leaves our eyes feeling dry. \"When things are bright, we blink less. It's behavioral. So we can train ourselves to blink more often and blink fully,\" he said. If you're already suffering from dry eyes, he recommended the use of artificial tears. Moorfields Eye Hospital also suggested using a humidifier, as well as making sure your work station is set up correctly. The top of your computer screen should be in line with your eyes and about 18 to 30 inches from where you're sitting and tilted back slightly, the hospital said in a blog post in April.Dr. Rachel Bishop, a spokesperson for the National Eye Institute, agreed that where your screen is positioned is important. \"If you are looking down, then your eyelid is shut a bit and you're not having as much evaporation -- which can help prevent dry eyes. If you're looking up high, your eye dries much quicker,\" she said.Other steps you can take include dimming the surrounding lights so that the screen is brighter in comparison and cleaning your computer screen regularly to avoid dust buildup, which can obscure the screen and cause eye irritation. If you or your children continue to have vision problems after making these fixes, experts recommended seeking advice from an ophthalmologist or optician as it could be a sign of an uncorrected eye problem like long-sightedness or astigmatism. If you're older than your late 30s and unable to see an eye care professional because of lockdown restrictions, there would be no harm in buying a cheap pair of drugstore reading glasses and seeing if they help, said Bishop.\"The focusing muscle in your eye changes as you age. You can focus up close when you're 20 for hours at a time and have no problems. But that ability declines as you age,\" said Dr Bishop.\"For people who aren't eager to have a medical appointment, the first thing is to try on some low-strength, over-the-counter reading glasses. Hold up something to read and pick the lowest number you can comfortably read at the distance you like to work,\" she said.Blue lightAnother potential concern is the \"blue light\" that digital devices emit, but Dr. Maturi said this affects our body clock, rather than our vision. But it's something worth paying attention to -- especially for kids who can get overstimulated easily. \"When we go outside we look at a blue sky, that's blue light,\" he said. \"The issue with blue light is at night. It can delay your ability to sleep quickly,\" he said.He suggested that people turn their devices to night mode or use e-readers with screens that more closely resemble a physical book. The key was to look at how many nits a display had -- a measurement of luminance or brightness, he added. To protect kids' eyes, parents should encourage them to spend as much time outside as possible -- within restrictions that are in place where you live to prevent the spread of Covid-19. The past two decades have seen a massive increase in myopia or short-sightedness among children -- and while scientists can't agree on exactly what has caused this rise and whether there's any link to screen use, they do know that spending time outdoors, especially in early childhood, can slow its progression.\"We should know more in a few years when research comes up with more answers, but for parents they have a dilemma because the school is now brought into the screen and kids social engagement are now brought into the screen and kids are playing their games on a screen,\" said Bishop.",

    "What Asian nations know about squashing Covid": {

        "body": "Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN)The number of Americans who have died from Covid-19 now significantly exceeds the total US troop fatalities during the Vietnam War.\n\nWhile the coronavirus continues to ravage the country, with confirmed cases exceeding 1 million and deaths rising by the day, some states are lifting stay at home orders in hopes of salvaging the economy. With so many lives at stake, it's time the United States looked to those countries in the Asia Pacific region that have successfully controlled the pandemic to figure out how to save ourselves and the economy. Several places in the Asia-Pacific, including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, have reported suppressing the reproduction number -- the average number of people who will catch the disease from a single infected person -- to below 1, without the need for continued, widespread lockdowns.They are now rapidly and successfully suppressing outbreaks of the disease by isolating those who are infected and their contacts who are likely to be infected. It's as if there are two worlds. Read MoreThe United States has had more than 66,000 deaths, or about 20 deaths per 100,000 people. The number of deaths per 100,000 people reported in Western European countries is also very high: Belgium, 67; France, 37; Italy, 47; Germany, 8; Spain, 53; and Sweden, 26. Meanwhile, the reported rates in Asia and Oceania are considerably lower: Australia, 0.4; China, 0.3; New Zealand, 0.4; South Korea, 0.5; Taiwan, 0.03. Despite the stark disparities, America seems blind to the strategies other countries have used to control the virus. How is it that one part of the world is succeeding, while the other part refuses to learn the lessons of success? On Tuesday, the The Wall Street Journal extolled the virtues of Germany's efforts in comparison with the United States, France, Italy, and Spain, without even a mention that Germany's mortality rate per million is itself more than 100 times higher than Taiwan and Hong Kong, and more than 10 times higher than in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea. How have these countries succeeded to date? Many have adopted nationwide public-health standards, using mobile technologies, professionalism of government, widespread use of face masks and hand sanitizers, and intensive public health services to isolate infected individuals or those likely to be infected. Testing has played an important role, but has not been the be-all-and-end-all as is sometimes believed in the United States.Vietnam has succeeded, for example, with contact tracing and an aggressive quarantine regime. When one person is confirmed positive, many of his or her close contacts -- even those without symptoms -- are isolated. As a result, Vietnam tested only a moderate number of people as a share of the population because it managed to contain outbreaks so effectively. Vietnam, with about 95 million people, has not reported a single Covid-19 death so far.In New Zealand, the government is starting to ease lockdown restrictions as officials say they are now in a position to test and trace any new clusters of infection. Here are the careful and precise words of New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. \"There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle. But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.\" There are similar success stories across much of the region. South Korea, which has dramatically broken the epidemic with aggressive testing, contact tracing and basic public health measures such as thermal monitoring, has also employed digital technology in the fight against Covid-19, according to a new report. South Korea uses a text alert system to keep the public informed, while various apps allow people to track new Covid-19 cases, make doctor's appointments or monitor hotspots to avoid. The government also uses apps to monitor people in quarantine, through self-reported symptoms and location tracking. Despite the fact that these apps may raise privacy issues in the United States, the upshot is an economy that is open, albeit cautiously so, together with a suppression of new infections.The US government has been utterly incapable of learning from these cases of success. President Donald Trump is incompetent and his appointees at Health and Human Services, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Transport Security Administration have failed to provide leadership. America First has put us first in deaths in the world, with tens of thousands of lives squandered as a result. We can save ourselves and our economy, if we look to and learn from the achievements of other nations. And if the federal government continues to fail, as seems likely, our governors and mayors must step forward to do the job.",

        "body": "Kaytlin Beckett is a prosecuting attorney in Utah. This essay is adapted from an email she wrote on her smartphone to CNN's Thomas Lake. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinions at CNN.\n\n(CNN)Though I am by no means anything special, I thought I'd share a bit of my experience with you. I think adding as many positive voices to the dialogue as possible is the only thing making this manageable for a large number of people.\n\nI'd rather hear messages of hope than ticker tapes about death tolls and unnerving and misinformed quotes from people who are in a position to know better and definitely in a position to do better. Not because I am blind to what's terrible, but because it's almost impossible to make good things happen if you're so often told nothing good can come from this. There is vastly more power in fighting for the good than there ever is in allowing yourself to soak up the bad.So here is my story. And thank you in advance for even taking the time.With the exception of FaceTime and Zoom, I haven't really seen any of my friends or family for over eight weeks. I spend 23 hours a day or more inside my apartment. I've read 18 books in that time period. I've taken up coloring like a toddler. I've resumed my love affair with midday naps, which I haven't enjoyed since undergrad. And I also haven't worn real pants in 64 days. I miss being outside and every day I wish I could be around people.My reality is that I will likely not have those opportunities for quite a while. Possibly months.Read MoreI am 34 years old. I work as a criminal prosecutor. In my spare time I do comedy, practice Muay Thai and love being outdoors. I usually hike year-round and love long-distance running. This last fall, I found myself feeling really rundown and thought I was just stressed out about a major criminal case I had been dealing with for the better part of the previous three years.In my mind there was no possibility that I was sick because I work out every day and I take care of myself. I was wrong. After multiple doctor visits and test after test, in February of this year I was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It is a very common form of leukemia, apparently one of the most common in the West. Only it's common for people in their 70s or older. And it's markedly more common for men than for women. I am told I am in the less than 5% of women in their 30s to be diagnosed with CLL. I was shocked.Like I said, I was healthy. I was just tired. I found out in the worst possible way. I visited a doctor on Super Bowl Sunday because my symptoms seemed to be getting worse. I brought a friend with me because I hate needles and after so many visits I just knew they would want to stick me with another one.The doctor came in and began reading from my chart without pausing for me to clarify anything or ask questions. It was more like an \"SNL\" skit than a real-life interaction. Mid-sentence she casually stated, \"I'm not in a position to talk to you about your lymphoma, so you'll need to follow up with your primary care physician.\"And then she just kept reading like a fourth-grader giving a class report on the state flower of Iowa. No pause. No words of comfort. No clarification. She was wrong about the lymphoma, but I did have cancer. I think about it now and my comedic instincts tell me that it would be hilarious to watch from the outside and maybe one day I'll be able to do it justice in that medium.I stupidly started doing every Internet search I could on the long-term prognosis for people with CLL. It was an awful idea and I absolutely do not recommend doing that to anyone newly diagnosed.Every site I found happily declared that people could live for up to 22 years with this diagnosis and most made it to the five-year mark. I guess that's positive if your starting point is 70, but mine was not. Even though no one knows what amount of time they'll get to do the things they really want to do, I knew for certain that 22 years was not enough for me.I was angry. That's the only way to describe it. I wasn't calm. I wasn't kind. I wasn't brave. I was just angry. It took me a few weeks and a very helpful hematologist to get a better grasp on what this meant. CLL is incurable. Notoriously so. To the point that they do not treat it until it becomes advanced enough that the symptoms are worse than the treatment itself.My genetic tests revealed that I have a very good prognosis. The things I believed I would be stripped of were not completely out of the realm of possibility. The dream job I had been applying for that required passing of a medical background might not be gone. I saw some hope.Weirdly, the best possible option for me is if the disease never progresses. It means I will always have leukemia. I will always have a compromised immune system. I will always be susceptible to other cancers. I will be required to get bloodwork and scans done every three months for the rest of my life and have the constant anxiety of wondering if this is the time when they tell me the bad news. That's my best-case scenario.I was coming to terms with that when this pandemic hit the US. I got an email from a hematologist explaining that my particular type of leukemia put me at critical risk of serious complications if I did get Covid-19. I needed to self-isolate immediately. That fear of dying I was coming to terms with came back pretty hard.I was forced to explain to my boss and supervisor that I had leukemia and needed to be able to work from home. Unless you've been through it, you can't really describe the way someone's countenance changes while you tell them you have cancer. Not necessarily in a bad way, but it is there. It's an odd feeling for someone who is very much used to forging through things alone. I loathed to tell anyone I was sick. They were immediately supportive and sent me home within an hour.This pandemic meant I would have to tell more people than I ever wanted to. I had to cancel my gym memberships. That was an outlet for me that I was devastated to lose. Since the orders to stay home were issued, my suburban neighborhood and the parks nearby are now too full for me to run in. I can't go hiking because the trailheads are packed with cars and I can't risk it. So I am home, in my little box, 23 hours a day.In recent weeks, I have seen so many people arguing that the economic impact of these restrictions is not worth it. I hear that and I can't help but feel like I am simply a faceless, voiceless number to those people.What they're really saying, is that I -- along with others who are sick and vulnerable -- am not worth it. That our lives and the lives of those who care for us do not matter -- that we carry less weight in the equation because we are already imperfect. I'd like those people to hear me when I say that I really truly do not want to die, but I am scared that someone else is making that decision for me. I know that doesn't sound like the positive story that I promised when I started this email, but it is. It absolutely is and here's why. When I got sick I was scared and totally alone because I was unwilling to tell anyone. That's just part of who I am. I don't want the people around me to worry. I want to look out for them.But I couldn't do that in this scenario. I could be angry and cry, which admittedly I still do sometimes because this is an adjustment and I am far from perfect. But when my brother FaceTimes me from Alaska so I can play peekaboo with my 1-year-old niece, I can't not laugh.When my mom sends me a text message to tell me that she picked up scones and coffee from my favorite local coffee shop and left them on my porch, I can't be angry. When the people I work with (who I had only been working with for a month before this pandemic) go out of their way to make sure I can continue working from home, I can't be anything other than grateful. When I step out on my porch to get my mail and there's a bottle of whisky and a roll of toilet paper waiting for me, it's a reminder that someone who I care deeply about also cares deeply about me.My gym started doing virtual classes and they were kind enough to deliver a punching bag to my apartment that had been sanitized. Seeing familiar faces and hearing familiar voices is more comforting than it ever was before. My family puts groceries in my car for me and I can wave to them from my third-floor window. I have an abundance of people checking up on me -- something I did not realize before. A month or so ago, I drove up the canyon near my home in a snowstorm, hoping no one would be on the trails and I could get outside. Unfortunately, the trails were packed. So I found a side road, parked my car, opened the tailgate and the moon roof, and let it snow on me for 45 minutes while listening to Sir Patrick Stewart reading sonnets on Twitter.A few weeks ago, I was singing \"Hamilton\" songs to my cat and forgot my windows were open until I heard one of my neighbors reverb, \"I am not throwing away MY SHOT!\" I laughed a lot longer than I should have about that. I wouldn't have done any of that if it wasn't for this stupid pandemic.I am so much luckier than most. I can work from home. I can still pay my bills. I could be sicker. A lot sicker. I can only imagine how difficult this is for people who are in active cancer treatment. The isolation seems impossibly difficult to handle some days, but then I remember how grateful I will be to see people again. To kiss someone I haven't been able to kiss in months. To hold my nieces and nephews. To dance stupidly with my gym friends.There is some distant light at the end of this horrible tunnel. I refuse to let the rhetoric make me angry. I have enough reasons to be angry. I like the challenge of finding reasons to be happy. And the more I do that the easier it becomes. There are so many people trying to do what they can in their own way. That's what matters most.And every time I forget that, I remember that I haven't had to wear real pants in 64 days.Thank you for listening.Stay healthy and safe,-KB",

        "body": "At some point, we will start returning to the office.\n\nSome people are looking forward to going back after stay-at-home orders are lifted. Others might be dreading it because they're afraid of getting sick at work, no longer have childcare or fear commuting on crowded public transportation.Here's what employees need to know about their rights when it comes to returning the office.What if I am not comfortable going back to work? It can be nerve racking to head back into the office while a global pandemic is still looming over everyone's head.Read MoreBut fearing that you might contract Covid-19 is not a legal reason to refuse to come to work if the company is lawfully permitted to open, according to Russ Adler, a labor and employment attorney in New York City. However, if a worker is concerned about an existing health condition or disability like having a compromised immune system, Adler said it might fall under the Americans with Disabilities Act or state or local disability laws, which may require employers to discuss potential accommodations. Workers who feel unsafe because of a specific concern at work, such as an employer not adequately cleaning a desk of a worker who tested positive for Covid-19, and make a complaint could be protected by the Occupational Safety and Health Act, according to Charles Jellinek, partner and co-leader, employment and labor, at law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner.OSHA requires employers to provide a work environment \"free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\"What if I no longer have child care? With schools and daycare centers shut down, many working parents have been pulling triple duty as a full-time parent, teacher and worker. And if they get called back to work before schools or daycares reopen, they could be stuck. Some working parents can get paid leave under the the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA) that Congress passed in March. The law requires qualified employers provide eligible employees with paid sick leave and expanded family and medical leave to care for a child whose school or childcare provider is no longer available for Covid-19 related reasons. Currently, the expanded benefits go through through December 31, 2020.To be eligible, the children have to be minors and employees have to work at a company with less than 500 employees.Can my employer require me to wear a face mask or other PPE? Generally, employees can be required to wear a mask while at work, according to Vanessa Matsis-McCready, assistant general counsel and director of human resources for Engage PEO.She added that if it is required, the employer should provide the mask.Employees who do not adhere to a company's rule regarding protective gear can be sent home, according to Sharon Perley Masling, a partner at Morgan Lewis. However, if a worker has a disability or health condition that makes it difficult to wear PPE, employers are required by the ADA to explore reasonable accommodations that would allow them to perform their jobs, she added.What if I don't want to comply with temperature checks? The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said that employers can check employees' body temperature, but the results are subject to confidentiality requirements.In addition, temperature checks should be conducted in a safe and non-discriminatory manner, said Jellinek.But be aware: \"An employee who refuses to be tested can be denied entry to the employer's premises, and that refusal and resulting absence from work can serve as a basis for employee discipline,\" he said.Does an employer have to notify staff if an employee is diagnosed with Covid-19?An employer is not required to alert staff if someone has tested positive, according to Adler, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't. \"They should inform employees that someone did test positive,\" he said. \"But they cannot reveal the identity without consent.\" Employers should also contact trace to alert potentially-exposed colleagues and send those employees home and implement safety protocols, said Matsis-McCready.Can my employer send me home if she thinks I am sick? Yes. According to the EEOC, an employer can send home an employee with Covid-19 or one who is showing symptoms associated with it. If you are worried about a coworker who is displaying signs of the virus, Matsis-McCready advises you share the concern confidentially with someone in the human resources department. Can an employer require a doctors note to return to the office? Employers can require a doctor's note for employees to return to the office, said Chai Feldblum, a partner at Morgan Lewis and former EEOC commissioner. However, given that many health care providers are overwhelmed, employers might instead rely on temperature checks and inquire about symptoms, she said.",

        "body": "London (CNN)As countries lie frozen in lockdown and billions of people lose their livelihoods, public figures are teasing a breakthrough that would mark the end of the crippling coronavirus pandemic: a vaccine.\n\nBut there is another, worst-case possibility: that no vaccine is ever developed. In this outcome, the public's hopes are repeatedly raised and then dashed, as various proposed solutions fall before the final hurdle. Instead of wiping out Covid-19, societies may instead learn to live with it. Cities would slowly open and some freedoms will be returned, but on a short leash, if experts' recommendations are followed. Testing and physical tracing will become part of our lives in the short term, but in many countries, an abrupt instruction to self-isolate could come at any time. Treatments may be developed -- but outbreaks of the disease could still occur each year, and the global death toll would continue to tick upwards.It's a path rarely publicly countenanced by politicians, who are speaking optimistically about human trials already underway to find a vaccine. But the possibility is taken very seriously by many experts -- because it's happened before. Several times.\"There are some viruses that we still do not have vaccines against,\" says Dr. David Nabarro, a professor of global health at Imperial College London, who also serves as a special envoy to the World Health Organization on Covid-19. \"We can't make an absolute assumption that a vaccine will appear at all, or if it does appear, whether it will pass all the tests of efficacy and safety.Read More\"It's absolutely essential that all societies everywhere get themselves into a position where they are able to defend against the coronavirus as a constant threat, and to be able to go about social life and economic activity with the virus in our midst,\" Nabarro tells CNN.Most experts remain confident that a Covid-19 vaccine will eventually be developed; in part because, unlike previous diseases like HIV and malaria, the coronavirus does not mutate rapidly.Many, including National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci, suggest it could happen in a year to 18 months. Other figures, like England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, have veered towards the more distant end of the spectrum, suggesting that a year may be too soon.But even if a vaccine is developed, bringing it to fruition in any of those timeframes would be a feat never achieved before. \"We've never accelerated a vaccine in a year to 18 months,\" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, tells CNN. \"It doesn't mean it's impossible, but it will be quite a heroic achievement.\"We need plan A, and a plan B,\" he says.When vaccines don't workIn 1984, the US Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler announced at a press conference in Washington, DC, that scientists had successfully identified the virus that later became known as HIV -- and predicted that a preventative vaccine would be ready for testing in two years.Nearly four decades and 32 million deaths later, the world is still waiting for an HIV vaccine.Instead of a breakthrough, Heckler's claim was followed by the loss of much of a generation of gay men and the painful shunning of their community in Western countries. For many years, a positive diagnosis was not only a death sentence; it ensured a person would spend their final months abandoned by their communities, while doctors debated in medical journals whether HIV patients were even worth saving. The search didn't end in the 1980s. In 1997, President Bill Clinton challenged the US to come up with a vaccine within a decade. Fourteen years ago, scientists said we were still about 10 years away. The difficulties in finding a vaccine began with the very nature of HIV/AIDS itself. \"Influenza is able to change itself from one year to the next so the natural infection or immunization the previous year doesn't infect you the following year. HIV does that during a single infection,\" explains Paul Offit, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist who co-invented the rotavirus vaccine. \"It continues to mutate in you, so it's like you're infected with a thousand different HIV strands,\" Offit tells CNN. \"(And) while it is mutating, it's also crippling your immune system.\" HIV poses very unique difficulties and Covid-19 does not possess its level of elusiveness, making experts generally more optimistic about finding a vaccine. But there have been other diseases that have confounded both scientists and the human body. An effective vaccine for dengue fever, which infects as many as 400,000 people a year according to the WHO, has eluded doctors for decades. In 2017, a large-scale effort to find one was suspended after it was found to worsen the symptoms of the disease.Similarly, it's been very difficult to develop vaccines for the common rhinoviruses and adenoviruses -- which, like coronaviruses, can cause cold symptoms. There's just one vaccine to prevent two strains of adenovirus, and it's not commercially available.\"You have high hopes, and then your hopes are dashed,\" says Nabarro, describing the slow and painful process of developing a vaccine. \"We're dealing with biological systems, we're not dealing with mechanical systems. It really depends so much on how the body reacts.\"Human trials are already underway at Oxford University in England for a coronavirus vaccine made from a chimpanzee virus, and in the US for a different vaccine, produced by Moderna.However, it is the testing process -- not the development -- that holds up and often scuppers the production of vaccines, adds Hotez, who worked on a vaccine to protect against SARS. \"The hard part is showing you can prove that it works and it's safe.\"Plan BIf the same fate befalls a Covid-19 vaccine, the virus could remain with us for many years. But the medical response to HIV/AIDS still provides a framework for living with a disease we can't stamp out.\"In HIV, we've been able to make that a chronic disease with antivirals. We've done what we've always hoped to do with cancer,\" Offit says. \"It's not the death sentence it was in the 1980s.\"The groundbreaking development of a daily preventative pill -- pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP -- has since led to hundreds of thousands of people at risk of contracting HIV being protected from the disease. A number of treatments are likewise being tested for Covid-19, as scientists hunt for a Plan B in parallel to the ongoing vaccine trials, but all of those trials are in very early stages. Scientists are looking at experimental anti-Ebola drug remdesivir, while blood plasma treatments are also being explored. Hydroxychloroquine, touted as a potential \"game changer\" by US President Donald Trump, has so found been found not to work on very sick patients. \"The drugs they've chosen are the best candidates,\" says Keith Neal, Emeritus Professor in the Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Nottingham. The problem, he says, has been the \"piecemeal approach\" to testing them.\"We have to do randomized controlled trials. It's ridiculous that only recently have we managed to get that off the ground,\" Neal, who reviews such tests for inclusion in medical journals, tells CNN. \"The papers that I'm getting to look at -- I'm just rejecting them on the grounds that they're not properly done.\"Now those fuller trials are off the ground, and if one of those drugs works for Covid-19 the signs should emerge \"within weeks,\" says Neal. The first may already have arrived; the US Food and Drug Administration told CNN it is in talks to make remdesivir available to patients after positive signs it could speed up recovery from the coronavirus.The knock-on effects of a successful treatment would be felt widely; if a drug can decrease a patient's average time spent in ICU even by by a few days, it would free up hospital capacity and could therefore greatly increase the willingness of governments to open up society.But how effective a treatment is would depend on which one works -- remdesivir is not in high supply internationally and scaling up its production would cause problems. And crucially, any treatment won't prevent infections occurring in society -- meaning the coronavirus would be easier to manage and the pandemic would subside, but the disease could be with us many years into the future. What life without a vaccine looks likeIf a vaccine can't be produced, life will not remain as it is now. It just might not go back to normal quickly. \"The lockdown is not sustainable economically, and possibly not politically,\" says Neal. \"So we need other things to control it.\"That means that, as countries start to creep out of their paralyses, experts would push governments to implement an awkward new way of living and interacting to buy the world time in the months, years or decades until Covid-19 can be eliminated by a vaccine.\"It is absolutely essential to work on being Covid-ready,\" Nabarro says. He calls for a new \"social contract\" in which citizens in every country, while starting to go about their normal lives, take personal responsibility to self-isolate if they show symptoms or come into contact with a potential Covid-19 case.It means the culture of shrugging off a cough or light cold symptoms and trudging into work should be over. Experts also predict a permanent change in attitudes towards remote working, with working from home, at least on some days, becoming a standard way of life for white collar employees. Companies would be expected to shift their rotas so that offices are never full unnecessarily.\"It (must) become a way of behaving that we all ascribe to personal responsibility ... treating those who are isolated as heroes rather than pariahs,\" says Nabarro. \"A collective pact for survival and well-being in the face of the threat of the virus.\"It's going to be difficult to do in poorer nations,\" he adds, so finding ways to support developing countries will become \"particularly politically tricky, but also very important.\" He cites tightly packed refugee and migrant settlements as areas of especially high concern.In the short term, Nabarro says a vast program of testing and contact tracing would need to be implemented to allow life to function alongside Covid-19 -- one which dwarfs any such program ever established to fight an outbreak, and which remains some time away in major countries like the US and the UK. \"Absolutely critical is going to be having a public health system in place that includes contact tracing, diagnosis in the workplace, monitoring for syndromic surveillance, early communication on whether we have to re-implement social distancing,\" adds Hotez. \"It's doable, but it's complicated and we really haven't done it before.\"Those systems could allow for some social interactions to return. \"If there's minimal transmission, it may indeed be possible to open things up for sporting events\" and other large gatherings, says Hotez -- but such a move would not be permanent and would continually be assessed by governments and public health bodies.That means the the Premier League, NFL and other mass events could go ahead with their schedules as long as athletes are getting regularly tested, and welcome in fans for weeks at a time -- perhaps separated within the stands -- before quickly shutting stadiums if the threat rises.\"Bars and pubs are probably last on the list as well, because they are overcrowded,\" suggests Neal. \"They could reopen as restaurants, with social distancing.\" Some European countries have signaled they will start allowing restaurants to serve customers at vastly reduced capacity.Restrictions are most likely to come back over the winter, with Hotez suggesting that Covid-19 peaks could occur every winter until a vaccine is introduced. And lockdowns, many of which are in the process of gradually being lifted, could return at any moment. \"From time to time there will be outbreaks, movement will be restricted -- and that may apply to parts of a country, or it may even apply to a whole country,\" Nabarro says.The more time passes, the more imposing becomes the hotly debated prospect of herd immunity -- reached when the majority of a given population, around 70% to 90%, becomes immune to an infectious disease. \"That does to some extent limit spread,\" Offit says -- \"although population immunity caused by natural infection is not the best way to provide population immunity. The best way is with a vaccine.\"Measles is the \"perfect example,\" says Offit -- before vaccines became widespread, \"every year 2 to 3 million people would get measles, and that would be true here too.\" In other words, the amount of death and suffering from Covid-19 would be vast even if a large portion of the population is not susceptible.All of these predictions are tempered by a general belief that a vaccine will, eventually, be developed. \"I do think there'll be vaccine -- there's plenty of money, there's plenty of interest and the target is clear,\" Offit says. But if previous outbreaks have proven anything, it's that hunts for vaccines are unpredictable. \"I don't think any vaccine has been developed quickly,\" Offit cautions. \"I'd be really amazed if we had something in 18 months.\"",

        "body": "London (CNN)UK paediatrics specialists have warned that a small but rising number of children are becoming ill with a rare syndrome that could be linked to coronavirus.\n\nOn Sunday the Paediatric Intensive Care Society UK (PICS) warned about a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children, some who had tested positive for Covid-19, presenting \"overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters.\" In a statement sent over the weekend to medical professionals who look after critically ill children, PICS said \"abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation.\"So what is Kawasaki disease and how worried should parents and carers be?What is Kawasaki disease?Read MoreKawasaki disease, also known as Kawasaki syndrome, is a rare childhood illness that causes the walls of the blood vessels in the body to become inflamed.According to the UK's National Health Service (NHS), the condition -- also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome -- mainly affects children under the age of 5, although it can affect children of any age. Symptoms include a high temperature lasting for five days or longer, alongside a rash, swollen glands in the neck, dry cracked lips, red fingers or toes and red eyes, according to the healthcare provider. If treated, the symptoms usually become less severe, the NHS said, adding that the disease is not contagious. \"Thankfully Kawasaki-like diseases are very rare, as currently are serious complications in children related to Covid-19, but it is important that clinicians are made aware of any potential emerging links so that they are able to give children and young people the right care fast,\" Professor Simon Kenny, NHS national clinical director for children and young people said in a statement sent to CNN on Monday. A condition that can lead to heart complicationsKawasaki disease is a leading cause of acquired heart disease in the United States, and serious complications can include aneurysms and coronary artery dilations, according to US healthcare company the Mayo Clinic.Standard treatment, which involves intravenous immunoglobulin and aspirin, can substantially decrease the development of coronary artery abnormalities, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says. According to the NHS, around 25% of children with the disease who do not receive treatment go on to experience heart complications, which can include conditions such as heart attacks and heart disease.However, the health care provider says that most children with Kawasaki disease make a full recovery if they receive prompt treatment. What causes Kawasaki disease?Experts admit that the causes of Kawasaki disease are not fully understood, but think that children who develop it could be genetically predisposed to it, having inherited certain genes from their parents. The disease itself is not contagious, according to the NHS, meaning that it is unlikely to be caused by a virus alone. The disease is more common in children from Northeast Asia, especially Japan and Korea, the NHS said. What is the link to Covid-19?The link between Kawasaki disease and Covid-19 is unclear, but health care professionals have reassured parents that the risk of children becoming severely ill with the virus remains low.In a report released in April, the CDC said that children diagnosed with coronavirus in the US typically have mild cases of the virus.The number of Covid-19 cases among children remains small and while some children and infants have been sick with Covid-19, adults make up most of the known cases to date, according to the CDC.Professor Rosalind Smyth, director and professor of child health, UCL Great Ormond St Institute of Child Health, said current evidence suggests that most children with Covid-19 who receive medical attention have mild symptoms, with about half having a fever, around 40% having a cough and less than 10% of reported cases having gastrointestinal symptoms.\"However, our understanding of this condition in children is limited. Covid-19 does present, in adults, as an inflammatory disease affecting a number of organs. We should investigate fully these children, with SARS-CoV-2, who present with a multi-system inflammatory disease to assess whether this is a presentation of Covid-19,\" Smyth said in a statement Monday.\n\nCNN's Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)It's been more than four months since China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, but so many questions are still unanswered about what we now know to be a coronavirus that's wreaked havoc and misery around the world -- including where the virus was, and when.\n\nCases were first reported outside China in Southeast Asia in January. The US reported its first case January 21, in Washington State. New York City didn't report a case until March 1.Recent revelations have thrown that timeline on its head. Studying the genealogy of the virus, we're starting to learn it has been outside China for much longer than thought, and researchers are now confident that the virus had been circulating around the globe much earlier. Here's what we now know about the shifting timeline of when the virus first appeared.Genetic analysis shows the virus spread around the world starting late last yearRead MoreResearcher Francois Balloux at the University College London Genetics Institute and his UK team may have narrowed the time window.They studied viral sequences from a global database, looking at samples from various places and times. What they found indicates that the virus wasn't infecting people before the end of last year and \"rules out any scenario that assumes\" the virus was circulating \"long before it was identified,\" the team wrote. Chinese scientists identified it as a novel coronavirus on January 7.The team is \"really, really, really confident\" that the virus didn't infect humans before late 2019, Balloux told CNN. But the team also found that people were getting infected in Europe, the United States and elsewhere at least weeks, if not months, before the first reported cases in January and February.US ground zero: Washington. Or was it California?Washington state was thought to be ground zero for the virus in the United States, and the first report of a death in the US was February 29, a patient in the Seattle area.The first known death was actually in California, though. Two people who died in Santa Clara County on February 6 and February 17 were infected, autopsies reported April 22 showed. Neither of the deceased had traveled to China and had no \"significant travel history,\" Dr. Sara Cody, the county's chief medical officer, said. \"(This) tells us we had community transfer far earlier than we had known,\" Cody said, \"And that indicates the virus was probably introduced and circulating far earlier than we had known.\"In March, researchers at the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University presented a model that suggested that while most of the world was still focused on China, the coronavirus had been silently spreading throughout the US, infecting about 28,000 people in major cities like New York and San Francisco by March 1, when the first case was confirmed in New York City.\"The disease spread under the radar,\" Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute, told CNN.New evidence from EuropeAnd there's now evidence that the virus was spreading in France weeks earlier than thought. Doctors in Paris went over old samples from patients who had flu-like symptoms, but didn't test positive with that virus, between December 2 and January 16. One, from a 42-year-old man who worked as a fishmonger, tested positive for the coronavirus. That man had not been to China and had no link to China, researchers said. That suggested that \"the disease was already spreading among the French population at the end of December, 2019,\" the team wrote.Europe's first case wasn't reported until January, and Italy, the country hit hardest by the virus there, reported its first two cases January 31. Were flu cases and heart attacks actually Covid-19? Now, authorities around the US are starting to go back and test to try and identify how early the virus had been circulating in their areas, looking at flu-like cases that weren't actually the flu.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn't start testing for coronavirus in people who had flu-like symptoms, but tested negative for the flu, until February 14. The Cook County Medical Examiner's Office said this week it will review deaths as far back as November that were ruled to be caused by heart attack or pneumonia at the time. If a positive case is found, the office will go back even further. \"The reason we want to do this is to see exactly how this virus came to Chicago and the neighboring suburbs and how it has spread,\" the county's chief medical examiner, Dr. Ponni Arunkumar, told CNN Wednesday. \"It will help public health, it will help the residents of Cook County understand how this disease came to Cook County.\"\n\nCNN's Maggie Fox, Omar Jimenez, Jason Hanna, Sarah Moon and Stella Chan contributed to this report.",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)Leah Blomberg and Marco Paolone both called an ambulance when their coronavirus symptoms worsened. Both spent time in intensive care. Both were on a ventilator. Both survived. But while Blomberg walked away with medical bills totaling several thousand dollars, Paolone's treatment was free.\n\nThe difference? She is an American. He is Italian. As the deadly novel coronavirus ravages the United States, millions of Americans have an extra thing to worry about: the cost of their treatment. Viewed from the outside, the pandemic appears to be amplifying the flaws of America's health and social security systems that have long puzzled the rest of the world. Liina-Kaisa Tynkkynen, a Finnish health and social policy researcher, said the crisis highlights the value of robust social security systems and universal healthcare. \"When this sort of crisis happens, it doesn't only affect people's health but also their social well-being, their employment, their economic situation,\" she added.Read MoreThe financial impact of the crisis has been devastating in the US. More than 30 million Americans have filed unemployment claims since the outbreak started. Food banks are running out of supplies as the demand surges.With the Federal Reserve warning the US economy is in the worst shape ever, it's no wonder then that the pressure to lift the lockdown is growing. More than half of US states will partially reopen by the end of the week. This comes despite the fact that few, if any, satisfy White House guidelines of declining infections for 14 straight days before an end to restrictions is contemplated. Experts have also warned against reopening a country facing shortages of coronavirus tests, which they've described as crucial to returning to normal life.The reopening is much more a patchwork of approaches than the Big Bang reopening once envisioned by President Donald Trump. Dr. Anthony Fauci said it was important to give governors \"wiggle room\" on reopening their states. But the nation's top infectious disease expert quickly added a stark reminder: \"don't wiggle too much.YOU ASKED.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYTrump goes after ChinaThe President said yesterday he has seen evidence that gives him a \"high degree of confidence\" the novel coronavirus originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China.Trump declined to provide details to back up his assertion, which contradicted a rare on-the-record statement from his own intelligence community which stated no such assessment has been made.The White House is putting together a long-term plan to punish China for the pandemic.The effort matches but goes far beyond Trump's strategy of blaming Beijing to distract from his own errors in predicting and handling the crisis, Kylie Atwood and Stephen Collinson report.Multiple sources inside the administration say there is an appetite to use various tools, including sanctions, canceling US debt obligations and drawing up new trade policies, to make clear to China, and to everyone else, where they feel the responsibility lies.Armed protesters in MichiganThe decision by Michigan's Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer to extend the state's coronavirus emergency declaration has sparked a new wave of anger. While a majority of US states are starting to reopen, Whitmer issued an executive order to keep the lockdown in place after the Republican-controlled legislature advanced a bill that would not have renewed the original declaration. Protesters, some armed, jammed inside the Michigan Capitol building yesterday. Hundreds more stood on the Capitol grounds.More than 41,000 people in Michigan have been infected with the coronavirus and at least 3,789 have died, according to state health officials. Only two states have more coronavirus-related deaths. Two more years of pandemic misery The virus is likely to keep spreading for at least another 18 months to two years -- until 60% to 70% of the US population has been infected, a team of pandemic experts has warned.They recommended that the US prepare for a worst-case scenario that includes a second big wave of coronavirus infections in the fall and winter. But even in the best-case scenario, people will continue to die from the virus in the future, they said.Crisis deepens in RussiaRussians are getting increasingly angry about their government's response to the coronavirus outbreak. Medical facilities in the country have emerged as one of the main breeding grounds for Covid-19, and two dozen hospitals have had to close for long quarantines, Mary Ilyushina writes. President Vladimir Putin himself is facing criticism for sending planeloads of protective gear to the United States, Italy, and Serbia, while some Russian doctors have had to sew their own masks and buy protective clothing from hardware stores. More than 100,000 Russians have been infected with coronavirus, including the country's Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin who announced yesterday that he tested positive.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYReport: China \"intentionally concealed\" severity of virusThe Chinese government intentionally concealed the severity of the coronavirus from the international community while it stockpiled imports and decreased exports, a Department of Homeland Security report found, according to an administration official familiar with it. The report, which assessed export and import data earlier this year, comes as the Trump administration formulates a long-term plan to punish China on multiple fronts for the pandemic, injecting a rancorous new element into a critical relationship already on a steep downward slide.How America's largest city deals with its deadAnanda Mooliya reassured his wife and two sons that he was fine, though they could hear his labored breathing from the next room over the sound of the TV. His wife made soup for him. Moments later, he died. Several hours would pass before his body was lifted off the floor and taken to a morgue -- and it was nearly three weeks before his cremation.The handling of Mooliya's body isn't unusual in these times. Coronavirus deaths have overwhelmed New York City's health care workers, morgues, funeral homes, crematories and cemeteries. On the day Mooliya died, there were 799 Covid-19 deaths in the state of New York -- a one-day high. To date, the state has recorded more than 24,000 deaths, most of them in NYC.Though the city doubled to about 2,000 its capacity to store bodies, funeral homes are still turning down cremations because they can't hold onto them. Cremations are delayed to mid-May and beyond. Bodies rest in refrigerated trailers in funeral home parking lots. Burials are backed up. Europe enters \"phase 2\" of reopeningItaly, the worst hit country in Europe, is entering phase two of reopening, after eight weeks in lockdown. Italians will now be able to travel within regions to visit relatives and \"significant\" relations (e.g. boyfriends, girlfriends and lovers) on a limited basis, so long as they wear masks, and up to 15 people will be allowed to attend funerals. More than 4 million Italians will be back to work, as factories and building sites resume activities -- but schools, hairdressers and many other commercial activities remain closed. It's not only Italy -- today marks a move toward normality for several EU countries. Shops are reopening in Greece, many schools are welcoming back students in Germany, and public transport will be allowed, with mandatory face masks, in Belgium. Meanwhile, the British government is deflecting questions over the country's death toll, which is now the second worst in Europe after Italy. Neighboring countries consider \"travel bubbles\"Australia and New Zealand are discussing the possibility of opening up borders to each other, creating a travel corridor -- or \"travel bubble\" -- between the two countries, after both appeared to successfully bring their outbreaks under control. While some experts say the approach could become a model for the rest of the world, others aren't so sure. Germany's interior minister is not taking up neighboring Austria's offer to welcome holidaymakers, telling Bild am Sonntag newspaper it was too early to lift border restrictions. Japan's \"internet cafe refugees\" Odd jobs on construction sites used to earn Takahashi enough money to pay for a private booth at one of Tokyo's internet cafes -- between $17 and $28 per night. But Japan's lockdown not only cost him his work, it has temporarily closed the cafe that was his de facto home, and left him sleeping rough at a Tokyo bus terminal.Now, Japanese authorities are providing emergency housing to support those like Takahashi, who were living in internet cafes.

The novel coronavirus doesn't affect everyone the same way.\n\nStories around the world paint a grim reality: Far from being an equalizer, the coronavirus has hit minorities and people from disadvantaged groups in disproportionate numbers. It is deepening the divide between rich and poor, fueling racism and xenophobia.Take Singapore, where migrant workers are suffering the brunt of the outbreak. Stuck in overcrowded dorm rooms, they have nowhere to escape to. They share toilets, shower stalls, laundry clothes lines and storage spaces, while lining up together to receive food.In India, Muslims have been targeted in attacks online and on the streets, accused of spreading the virus.

Without a vaccine in sight, governments need to test, trace and quarantine before safely lifting lockdowns, Angela Dewan writes. Though public health experts couldn't be clearer about the importance of effective testing, some political leaders are determined to push ahead despite testing shortfalls.People in the US state of Georgia can now get their nails done and their hair cut, after Governor Brian Kemp allowed some businesses to reopen yesterday.Kemp is going against the advice of the World Health Organization, which said that a good benchmark for adequate testing would be at least 10 negative cases for every confirmed positive case. Georgia has observed 101,000 tests, with a positive result rate of 21.6%.Compare that to Germany, which also has started to ease restrictions. By the end of last week, the country had tested more than 2 million people, with a positive result rate of 7.5%. Governor Kemp, nonetheless, defended his plan, saying on Twitter that his decision was data driven (without providing any data to back this up). Trump says disinfectant suggestion was sarcasm President Donald Trump has downplayed his earlier suggestion that medical experts look into the possibility of injecting disinfectants to treat the coronavirus.\"I was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you just to see what would happen,\" the President said yesterday.Trump was heavily criticized for floating the idea, and the makers of Lysol and Dettol warned strongly against putting disinfectants into the human body. Multiple sources have told CNN that there has been a concerted effort among Trump aides and allies to curtail his daily coronavirus briefings. One Trump ally told CNN that the disinfectant remark is exactly what they were worried about when they asked him to shorten his freewheeling press conferences.Nursing homes ravaged by the virus Nursing homes across the globe have struggled to cope with the coronavirus outbreak. Their jobs were already demanding, but now overwhelmed workers must identify, isolate and treat patients with the disease. Meanwhile, measures aimed at protecting residents from the spread of the disease have left them even more vulnerable and closed off from the public. Government documents show that supply shortages, lapses in care, a lack of transparency and inadequate infection control precautions have fueled the spread of coronavirus within America's nursing homes, Blake Ellis and Melanie Hicken report.The nursing home crisis is not unique to the US. In the United Kingdom, nursing home operators have denounced the government, saying they have been \"badly let down\" by the lack of support. In Italy, authorities have been investigating a string of health violations at elderly care homes. What's it like to be injected with an experimental vaccineWith one jab to his right shoulder, Sean Doyle found himself at the forefront of the world's fight against coronavirus. The 31-year-old medical student and PhD candidate was among the first people in the world to receive an experimental coronavirus vaccine injection. His friends and family were concerned. \"But they trusted my judgment,\" he said. As scientists race to develop an effective vaccine, the World Health Organization launched a new program yesterday to speed up vaccine development. And the UK announced yesterday it will host a global summit focused on finding a vaccine after starting its own trial earlier this week.But Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, says safety must come first. \"Unlike therapeutics, which are often first trialed in people with the late stage of a disease, vaccines are given to healthy people to prevent the disease,\" he said. \"The risk of causing illness or even death in an otherwise healthy person haunts everyone involved in the coronavirus response.\"ON OUR RADARGermany is racing to develop apps that can track the spread of the coronavirus, in an effort to prevent a second wave of infections when its economy reopens, Hadas Gold reports.

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)It was a big week for remdesivir.\n\nThe US Food and Drug Administration yesterday granted the experimental drug emergency-use authorization to treat hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19. The decision comes just days after a government-funded study found that patients who took remdesivir recovered faster than patients who did not.Gilead Pharmaceuticals originally designed the antiviral drug to treat Ebola, but results were disappointing. Instead, remdesivir has become the world's first authorized therapy treatment for Covid-19. Wall Street embraced the news mid-week, with stocks surging amid optimism for the drug's potential. Recent weeks have witnessed a relentless quest for a viable Covid-19 treatment, with at least 72 active trials underway in the US alone. These include experiments with the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, drugs that treat arthritis and a heartburn treatment. Read MoreStill, remdesivir is not the holy grail. While it may speed up recovery from Covid-19, it does not stop people from catching the novel coronavirus. Experts have repeatedly underlined that the pandemic will not subside until an effective vaccine is widely available. Human trials for a vaccine are under way in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany. But questions are mounting. A CNN investigation shows that the US is making a big bet on a company with unproven technology and a storied history. YOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: The flu kills more people than coronavirus. Why shut down the economy for this?A: This is no longer true. The US death toll from coronavirus this year has exceeded 65,000, surpassing the high-end estimate for flu deaths since October. The novel coronavirus is more dangerous than the flu for several reasons. It is much more contagious and has been killing victims at a much faster rate. The coronavirus incubation period seems much longer than that of the flu. With the flu, people typically start feeling sick one to four days after infection. For coronavirus, however, it can take up to 14 days for people to feel symptoms. The fact that it kept spreading in the southern hemisphere during its summer months suggests that, unlike the flu, warm weather won't slow its spread. Experts say many deaths could be prevented with access to existing flu vaccines. But there is no vaccine for the coronavirus.Send your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19?

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYIndia reports its biggest single-day jump in casesIndia's confirmed coronavirus cases jumped by 2,293 to 37,336 on Friday. The spike represents the country's biggest daily increase in cases, but it remains a remarkably low figure given India's population of 1.3 billion.Some experts say the numbers suggest the country's nationwide lockdown to halt the spread could be working, for now. And while testing rates per capita are very low in India, experts say the country seems to be catching most of the moderate and serious cases. If a huge surge in Covid-19 cases were not being caught by testing, experts add, hospitals would be crowded with cases and there would be a spike in flu-like symptoms. That has not been the case. India's strict lockdown measures were originally scheduled to lift Sunday, but they were recently extended for another two weeks.White House blocks Fauci from testifying The White House will keep Dr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the administration's coronavirus task force, from testifying before the Democratic-led House next week, even though he is scheduled to testify in the Republican-led Senate.The move will prevent a potential meeting between the blunt, high-ranking expert and lawmakers gearing up for an oversight battle, Jim Acosta and Caroline Kelly write. Fauci has repeatedly distanced himself from Trump's framing of the federal government's handling of the pandemic to strike a more somber tone.He came home from hospital to die. His son kept him aliveWhen Suri Nathwani returned from hospital, he pleaded with his son Raj to be allowed to die at home. Death was not an outcome Raj was willing to accept, but he knew his father's chances of surviving coronavirus were not good.Raj used a Google spreadsheet, store-bought health aids and a baby monitor to help save his dad from dying. Raj knew his father was on the road to recovery when he became strong enough to nag him. \"He began whingeing and said his tea was badly made. He then asked for some pizza and chips,\" Raj said.

The early intervention included closing the entire block, extensive testing and the quarantine of infected people along with their contacts. The authors' approach to identification and control of the novel coronavirus may serve as a blueprint for local and national policymakers wrestling with how to safely reopen the economy, according to a medical analyst.ON OUR RADARAll roads into Gallup, a city in northwestern New Mexico, have been closed to control the spread of coronavirus.The FDA has approved a high-pressure ventilator prototype developed by NASA engineers to help coronavirus patients.Arkansas abortion providers and the American Civil Liberties Union are suing state officials for restricting abortion.

        "body": "(CNN)You can catch it more than once.\n\nThe World Health Organization has warned against the idea that coronavirus immunity passports can provide a safe way out of lockdown.Many countries were hoping to start issuing risk-free certificates to people who have had the disease, allowing them to return to work, travel and go about their business. The plan was based on the assumption that Covid-19 survivors develop immunity.But yesterday the WHO said no evidence exists that people who have recovered from the disease and developed antibodies are protected from catching it again. The organization went further, warning that the use of immunity passports could lead to a spike in new infections. That's because people who assume they are immune are more likely to ignore public health advice.Read MoreIn the wake of the WHO's alert, it becomes apparent that global efforts must focus on the only other way to gain protection: a vaccine.YOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: What do ventilators do, and how do they help treat patients? A: A ventilator forces air into the lungs of a patient who cannot breathe on their own because of severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome. Such machines are often used by doctors treating the most severe cases of Covid-19, and requires them to place a tube down their patient's throat, a procedure known as intubation. It's often a deteriorating patient's last best hope to recover, but data so far shows the prognosis isn't good. A study of New York's largest health system showed that about a quarter of coronavirus patients who needed ventilators to help them breathe died within the first few weeks of treatment.Send your questions here.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYMore grim milestonesThe coronavirus has now killed more than 200,000 people globally, according to Johns Hopkins University. But official statistics are only capturing confirmed cases. With most countries struggling to test everyone who shows symptoms, the number of Covid-19-related deaths is likely much higher. These people might have died at home, in nursing homes, or in hospitals where testing was unavailable. The United Kingdom yesterday became the fifth country in the world to record more than 20,000 deaths, after Italy, the United States, Spain and France. Just weeks ago, the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, said that limiting deaths to around 20,000 would be a \"good outcome.\"The US, meanwhile, is nearing 1 million cases. More than 53,600 Americans have died so far, with New York state alone recording more than 22,000 coronavirus deaths.Trump calls time on briefingsPresident Donald Trump did not hold a daily coronavirus update yesterday, tweeting that briefings are \"not worth the time & effort.\" The media, he added, asks \"nothing but hostile questions\" and \"then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately.\" Trump's tweets came after he was widely criticized last week by health experts for his dangerous suggestion that research should be done into whether disinfectants can serve as a potential coronavirus treatment. On Friday, amid the outcry, Trump staged a short briefing and did not allow questions from the media.The decision to skip Saturday's briefing comes after CNN reported Friday that there has been a concerted effort among aides and allies to stop Trump conducting the daily coronavirus briefings.A senior administration official, meanwhile, said discussions are under way to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar following criticism of the early federal response to the epidemic. Coronavirus exposes deep divisions everywhereThe pandemic has had very different consequences for the rich and the less well-off.In France, billionaires have isolated themselves at luxurious hideaways on the Mediterranean, while residents in more disadvantaged and crowded areas of France are facing a surge in deaths, along with unrest on the streets. People living in Hong Kong's \"cage homes\" -- subdivided apartments that often have space for only a bed and some clothes -- find it impossible to self-isolate and stay safe. In the US, hundreds of thousands of people have joined the gig or underground economies after unexpectedly losing their jobs. People of color, women and teens have been particularly hard hit.Boris Johnson returnsThe British Prime Minister is due to return to work on Monday, his office said, exactly a month after announcing he tested positive for Covid-19. Johnson was hospitalized and spent several days in an intensive care unit before being released two weeks ago.After his prolonged absence, the Prime Minister is bound to face some uncomfortable questions. Did the UK react too slowly to the threat? When will British doctors get enough personal protective equipment? Why is testing still way below the government's targets? Why did he skip so many crucial coronavirus meetings? And why have Britain's minorities been hit so hard?African Americans urged to defy governors' efforts to reopen businessesA coalition of civil rights and black religious leaders is urging African American residents who live in states that are moving swiftly to reopen their economies to stay home in defiance of directives until there's evidence the coronavirus outbreak has eased.Georgia was among the first states to begin reopening nonessential businesses on Friday. A third of the state's residents are African American, a community that is disproportionately dying from Covid-19. Figures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show black patients make up nearly 20% of US coronavirus deaths, although African Americans represent only about 13% of the nation's population.ON OUR RADARChinese officials said today that all hospitalized coronavirus patients in Wuhan have been discharged. The city in Hubei province was the original epicenter of the pandemic, but it is slowly returning to normal.Hawaii has extended its stay-at-home and quarantine orders until the end of May. The state has seen a 98% decrease in visitors since a quarantine was put in place.Children in Spain are finally allowed to leave their homes for the first time in over six weeks after the government relaxed some of its strict lockdown measures. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez says he will present his plan for the country's \"de-escalation phase\" on Tuesday.Several Italian Mafia bosses have been released from prison over coronavirus fears. Matteo Salvini, the leader of Italy's right-wing opposition party, the Lega, blasted the move as \"crazy.\"Students in New York have filed class-action lawsuits against three universities, claiming that schools have failed to adequately refund fees amid the lockdown.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYWorrying inflammatory syndromeDoctors are raising alarm over a growing number of children falling ill with a new inflammatory illness that may be linked to Covid-19.Health officials describe it as \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\" Some children display persistent fever, toxic shock syndrome and features similar to Kawasaki disease, which causes inflammation in the walls of the arteries and can limit blood flow to the heart. Symptoms include a high temperature lasting over five days, rashes, swollen neck glands and swelling of the hands and feet.New York state officials said yesterday the condition has killed a teenager and two children under 8 years old. Similar cases have been identified in the UK, Italy and Spain.4 million global casesThe number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases around the world surpassed 4 million yesterday. More than quarter of them, 1.3 million, have been registered in the US.Russia and Brazil have emerged as the latest hotspots, both seeing large jumps in the number of new infections in recent days. In Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro continues to dismiss the threat coronavirus presents. In Russia, the focus has turned to the country's health system after three frontline health care workers mysteriously fell out of hospital windows.Migrants in limboMigrant laborers worldwide are suffering the brunt of the pandemic. Hundreds of thousands are struggling with stripped livelihoods, hazardous accommodation and no easy way home. Sam Kiley and Mostafa Salem report from the Persian Gulf, where overcrowded labor camps and densely populated neighborhoods have emerged as virus hot spots.In Singapore, the outbreak has left hundreds of thousands of workers trapped in dormitories, amid cramped conditions that make social distancing near impossible. In the US, immigrants have also found themselves on the frontlines of the pandemic.How masks define us Face masks have emerged as a coronavirus fault line. The decision to wear or avoid them signals where people stand on public health guidelines.Countries like the Czech Republic, Israel and Kenya require people to cover their noses and mouths when going out. Elsewhere, face covering remains optional or, as in Germany, restricted to specific places such as grocery stores and public transportation. In other parts of the world, they are turning into fashion statements.Global health experts agree masks can help limit the spread of the virus. But the prospect of a new society in which the public conceals their faces from one another has wide-ranging implications for crime and security, as well as social interaction, Luke McGee reports.

The public row comes as Dr. Rick Bright plans to testify to Congress today that the White House was underprepared for the pandemic. Bright filed a whistleblower complaint last week alleging he was removed from his post in retaliation for opposing the broad use of a drug frequently touted by Trump as a coronavirus treatment.\"Without clear planning and implementation of the steps that I and other experts have outlined, 2020 will be [the] darkest winter in modern history,\" he will warn, according to his prepared testimony obtained by CNN.Nearly every US state has now eased its lockdown, and Wisconsin's Supreme Court on Wednesday struck down a stay-at-home order.

WE ANSWEREDQ: How expensive will air travel be after the Covid-19 crisis?A: It will depend on a lot of changing factors -- demand as lockdowns are lifted, the price of oil, whether social distancing will be required on flights and the possibility of tourism promotions. Airlines are adjusting for demand. This agility is key to allowing them to continue offering airfares as affordable or as \"normal\" as the public were accustomed to paying prior to the Covid-19 crisis.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYWHO says coronavirus 'may never go away'The novel coronavirus may never go away and may just join the mix of viruses that kill people around the world every year, Dr. Mike Ryan from the World Health Organization said Wednesday.\"This virus just may become another endemic virus in our communities and this virus may never go away. HIV hasn't gone away,\" Ryan said. \"I'm not comparing the two diseases but I think it is important that we're realistic. I don't think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear,\" Ryan added.Germs spread fast. Here's how that looks.A viral video from Japan visualizes how easily germs and viruses spread in restaurants. The experiment, conducted by public broadcaster NHK in conjunction with health experts, simulates the atmosphere at a buffet restaurant or on a cruise ship, showing the impact of one infected person on 10 others. A separate study also shows how the coronavirus can linger in the air for more than eight minutes after talking.More cases of rare syndrome in kids expectedParents, hospitals and clinics should expect to see more cases of a mystifying condition that seems to be affecting children after a bout with Covid-19, doctors have said. The condition, called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, appears to be a post-viral syndrome, they say.Doctors are investigating cases in at least 150 children, most of them in New York. But a CNN survey finds hospitals and clinics in at least 17 states and Washington, DC are checking into suspected cases.A new peer-reviewed study, published in the medical journal The Lancet on Wednesday, also found a rise in the number of cases of the syndrome in the Bergamo province of Italy shortly after the coronavirus pandemic spread to the region. England gets back to work in a divided kingdomPhotos of busy commuter trains in London have raised concerns of a second wave of infections in the UK, just days after Boris Johnson called on millions in England to get back to work. The government's response and messaging to the public has been criticized as both unclear and reckless. The other nations of the UK -- Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland -- have kept more stringent lockdowns in place, a divergence that threatens the UK's unity, Luke McGee writes. Virus brings new lows to US-China relationsRelations between the United States and China have sunk to new lows in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, Ben Westcott writes. Trump blamed China for the global pandemic again yesterday, claiming Beijing could have stopped the outbreak, which he labeled as \"the worst attack we've ever had on our country.\" Earlier on Wednesday, China's Foreign Ministry said that the US should focus on fixing its problems at home and \"stop spreading disinformation.\"ON OUR RADARThe US unemployment rate will peak at 25%, rivaling the worst period of the Great Depression, Goldman Sachs has warned.

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)If the United States had begun enforcing social distancing measures just a week earlier in March, an estimated 36,000 lives would have been saved, according to new research from Columbia University.\n\nAnd if the country had locked down two weeks earlier than it did, the vast majority of deaths -- about 84% -- would have been avoided, the research team estimated.While the study has not yet been peer-reviewed, it is a sign of just how steep the cost of inaction was as Covid-19 raced across America. Even small shifts in timing -- a matter of days -- would have made a difference, preventing much of the virus' exponential growth in cities like New York, Los Angeles and New Orleans, the university found.As all 50 states lift lockdowns to varying degrees, the researchers had these words of caution: \"Now that Covid-19 is established as a global pandemic, rapid response remains essential to avoid large-scale resurgences of infections and deaths in locations with reopening plans.\" And the pandemic shows no signs of abating. Infection rates are on the rise across Latin America, as restrictions ease elsewhere. The World Health Organization warned yesterday that \"we still have a long way to go,\" after it recorded the highest total number of infections in a 24-hour period -- more than 106,000. Today marks a new milestone: Global coronavirus cases have passed 5 million.Read MoreGLOBAL TOWN HALLUS first lady Melania Trump will take part Thursday evening in CNN's weekly global town hall on coronavirus.

What's next?A: \"Two months ago, recovery wasn't on anyone's mind,\" said Dr. Reynold Panettieri, a pulmonary critical care physician in New Jersey. While most patients with coronavirus will fully recover, data from China suggest that some patients, especially those who had more severe infections, may face lasting -- even permanent -- damage to their bodies. To better understand these effects, Panettieri is leading a six-month study of recovered Covid-19 patients. Unlike most viral diseases, which may result in a nagging cough for weeks, Panettieri has observed that some patients have other serious symptoms that won't go away. He said this could be related to a number of factors, including how the virus affects the lungs, heart and muscles. So far, it seems overcoming the disease is only the first step in a much longer journey. Send your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19? Message us on WhatsApp about the challenges you're facing: +1 347-322-0415. WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYStates are combining test results, skewing the numbersVirginia, Texas, Georgia, and Vermont have said they've been adding two numbers to their daily totals -- viral test results and antibody test results -- possibly providing a misleading picture of when and where the coronavirus spread as the nation eases restrictions. Viral tests are taken by nose swab or saliva sample, and look for direct evidence someone currently has Covid-19. By contrast, antibody tests use blood samples to look for biological signals that a person has been exposed to the virus in the past.Combining the two types of tests overstates a state's testing ability, a crucial metric as nearly all states ease the coronavirus restrictions. Experts have consistently emphasized that for states to reopen, there has to be adequate testing and tracing. Disasters complicate coronavirusCatastrophic flooding in Michigan and a powerful cyclone that slammed India and Bangladesh have shown the challenges of responding to natural disasters amid the pandemic.When a rain-swollen river breached two dams in central Michigan it sent at least 10,000 people fleeing from their homes. Officials there are now juggling two public safety crises at once, with evacuees being screened for coronavirus before entering shelters. Cyclone Amphan, one of strongest storms recorded in the Indian Ocean in decades, hit India's eastern coast and neighboring Bangladesh yesterday, leaving thousands homeless and dozens dead as authorities raced to provide relief efforts in communities already stricken by the coronavirus. One Indian official said it was a bigger disaster than Covid-19. Families of Italy's nursing homes victims want answersItalian authorities are investigating a string of health violations at nursing homes across the country during the pandemic. Family members say the institutions didn't do enough to protect those in their care, and blame authorities for placing Covid-19 patients alongside the elderly. At least 15 facilities have been closed and their patients relocated after inspections by the Italian police's health unit found that many failed to follow coronavirus protocols, including providing enough protective equipment for staff and dedicated quarantine areas for suspected coronavirus patients. Children in Asia are going back to schoolThe coronavirus has set global school enrollment back four decades, as closures and recessions in many countries have hit education, according to a new report by a United Nations agency. For the first time in three months, South Korean high school students have returned to the classroom. But it doesn't signal a return to normal -- temperature checks, masks and socially distant seating are among the adjustments. The changes are not without challenges, or risk. School is also starting in other countries in the Asia Pacific region too. In New Zealand, which has been praised for its swift approach to controlling the virus, students around the country headed back to school on Monday after eight weeks at home. In parts of Australia, children are already back; Chinese students started returning to school in March.Why China and India shouldn't let coronavirus justify walking back climate actionBefore the pandemic hit, India and China were positioning themselves as global climate leaders. Virus lockdowns have provided temporary blue skies in cities from New Delhi to Beijing and beyond, but as India and China prepare to resuscitate their economies, experts warn doing so without environmental regard could wind back their previous good work on climate.ON OUR RADARAmerica's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has been conspicuously absent from national TV interviews lately. If you're missing his calm and clear guidance, you can catch him on Julia Roberts' Instagram. San Francisco's sanctioned tent encampments, providing housing for the homeless during the pandemic, have inflamed tensions between lawmakers and residents. Pennsylvania's governor is livid after Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger posted a video of himself getting a haircut during quarantine. This is what his barber had to say. \"Gosh, what a crazy time.

Every day brings signs that what first looked like temporary job cuts could turn into permanent layoffs. Families are already feeling the effects. Among mothers with young children, almost one-fifth say they're going hungry, according to a survey by the Brookings Institution -- a rate far worse than in 2008, during the global financial crisis. President Donald Trump has made clear that the economic cost of the national lockdown has grown too steep, despite projections that many more will die as the US reopens. \"We have to be warriors,\" Trump said yesterday. \"We can't keep our country closed down for years.\" And while he reversed a decision to phase out the coronavirus task force, it will now be pivoted to focus on reopening the nation.The bleak financial picture looks much the same across the pond. As Europe begins to open back up, Brussels warns the eurozone faces an existential threat if the economies of member states do not recover evenly. The UK is headed for the worst crash in more than 300 years, according to the Bank of England, which said the country's economy could contract by 14% this year.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYUS stockpile no match for pandemicAs complaints about dire shortages of protective gear for medical workers on the frontlines of the Covid-19 crisis began to stream in, President Donald Trump was quick to point the finger of blame at his predecessor, Barack Obama. To an extent, the President was right. The Obama administration used and then failed to replace items from the nation's Strategic National Stockpile to fight the 2009 H1N1 \"swine flu\" pandemic. But Trump hadn't replaced those items either, despite repeated warnings that the country was ill-prepared for a pandemic, stockpile experts said. The British government is facing similar criticisms that vital items of personal protective equipment (PPE) were missing from the UK's national stockpile. To shore up supplies, the government ordered around 400,000 surgical gowns from a Turkish company in mid-April. But the gowns were never distributed among health workers because they did not meet safety standards. First ICE detainee dies from coronavirusA 57-year-old man from El Salvador became the first person to die from coronavirus while in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, a senior US immigration official told CNN. Reports of the man's death drew swift condemnation from immigrant rights organizations, who've been pushing for weeks for ICE to release more detainees from its facilities and warning that the Trump administration is using the pandemic to push its aggressive immigration agenda. The US has continued to deport thousands of people during the outbreak -- including some who are sick. Sports return to USOn Saturday, the UFC is scheduled to become the first sport in the US to return to action, with the organization's president acutely aware of the increased scrutiny that's inevitably coming his way. All eyes are on Dana White and his Ultimate Fighting Championship, with three fight nights planned in the space of eight days in May. And the stakes simply could not be higher. \"Listen, we have families, too,\" White told CNN Sport. \"I don't want to die.\" Germany's success storyBehind Germany's success in bringing the virus to heel is Angela Merkel. The German Chancellor, who has a PhD in quantum chemistry, has made a remarkable turnaround since the start of the year -- when she was relegated to the sidelines as a lame duck leader. Now she is a beacon of global leadership, Ivana Kottasov\u00e1 writes. Yesterday, the Chancellor unveiled plans for the partial lifting of Germany's lockdown, allowing shops to reopen and people to meet in small groups. \"The first phase of the pandemic is behind us but we are still at the beginning and it will be with us for a long time,\" Merkel said.57,000 people are still stuck on cruise shipsMost cruise passengers have made their way back home, and the vast ships that once ferried them from port to port are moored up or back on the water, relocating for the next stage in their journeys. But what about the crews that kept these gigantic vessels going, and looked after guests as panic over the coronavirus swept across the oceans?

Greece says it'll re-open to tourists on July 1, but the summer season will likely look a lot different. Meanwhile, in Ibiza, Covid-19 has crashed that party. At least eight people in India have been killed by a toxic gas leak at a chemical plant which was reopening after the easing of coronavirus lockdown measures. This is supposed to be a busy time for Bollywood.

Trump said again yesterday that China could have stopped the outbreak before it swept the globe, and that the US was conducting \"serious investigations\" into what happened.Conspiracy theories spread faster than virusMaatje Benassi, a US Army reservist and mother of two, has become the target of conspiracy theorists who falsely place her at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, saying she brought the disease to China. The virulent conspiracy, which metastasized on YouTube and is now being promoted by Chinese Communist Party media, has turned her life upside down. But while technology giants have touted the steps they're taking to combat coronavirus misinformation, they've failed to help Benassi, Donie O'Sullivan writes. Has Sweden's anti-lockdown strategy succeeded?Sweden has been an outlier during the coronavirus outbreak. The country has not joined many of its European neighbors in imposing strict limits on citizens' lives, and images of people heading to work on busy streets, or chatting at cafes and bars have raised eyebrows. While the country claims its resistance to a full lockdown has worked, the numbers suggest a different story, Emma Reynolds writes. Pandemic is 'far from over'World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus says \"the pandemic is far from over,\" and that there are concerns about the trends in Africa, eastern Europe, Latin America and some Asian countries. Meanwhile, a group of leading scientists have warned that future pandemics are likely to be more frequent, deadly, and will spread more rapidly, unless we stop the widespread destruction of our environment.

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)President Donald Trump's own health experts are increasingly at odds with him.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, a key member of the White House's coronavirus task force, warned a Senate committee yesterday that reopening the economy too quickly could trigger an uncontrollable outbreak. He also said it was a \"bridge too far\" for schools to expect a vaccine for Covid-19 by the time students return to campuses in the fall, though he expressed optimism one would be developed in the next year or two. It was a very different message to the victorious one that Trump has been touting, as states across the country start to roll back business closures and stay-at-home orders put in place two months ago to slow the virus' spread.The testimony and senators' questions often illustrated the yawning divide between Republicans and Democrats over the best path forward amid warnings that positive cases could surge again. But one only needs to look to South Korea and China -- countries that eased restrictions, only to tighten them again after another spike in cases -- for a sense of what lies ahead.A key coronavirus model often cited by the White House has again raised its projected death toll, now predicting there could be 147,000 fatalities in the United States by August 4 -- more than double what was estimated only two weeks ago. Read More\"We may go from having this long, slow, steady decline (to exponential growth),\" said Dr. Chris Murray, the researcher behind the influential model. \"That's the real risk.\" YOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: What are the arguments for and against opening the economy? A: As countries and states try to balance saving lives with saving livelihoods, experts say some arguments for reopening the economy now are short-sighted or flawed. One of the primary schools of thought -- keep the elderly at home, while young or healthy people go back to work -- is considered to be too risky. Another popular theory is \"herd immunity\" -- when 70% to 80% of the population becomes immune because they've been infected -- but experts say that letting the virus run rampant is a \"dangerous calculation\" that risks overwhelming hospitals.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYAmericans are saving like it's the 1980sAmericans are slashing their spending, hoarding cash and shrinking their credit card debt as they fear their jobs could disappear during the pandemic. Although caution is a logical response to the current uncertainty, hunkering down also poses a risk to the recovery of an economy that depends on consumer spending. While people close their wallets, consumer prices are tumbling at an alarming rate -- recently hitting their lowest levels since the 2008 financial crisis. Falling prices might sound like a good thing, but economists agree that deflation would be very bad news. Latin America overwhelmed by pandemicBrazil and Mexico have seen their deadliest days yet as the pandemic looks set to overwhelm some parts of Latin America.Another 881 fatalities were reported yesterday in Brazil, which now has the sixth-most confirmed coronavirus-related deaths in the world. President Jair Bolsonaro has repeatedly dismissed Covid-19 as a \"little flu,\" even as some governors scramble to implement social isolation measures and slow the spread. In Mexico, authorities announced 353 additional deaths -- the highest since the outbreak began. Nearly 4,000 fatalities have been recorded so far in the country, but the true death toll is believed to be much higher due to the limited amount of testing being carried out.Europe talks 'travel bubbles' as tourism crisis growsWith nearly all travel halted across the 27-country bloc, the coronavirus pandemic has thrown Europe's tourism industry into chaos. Today, the European Commission will recommend travel between countries with similar coronavirus risk profiles, in an attempt to revive the sector -- which normally accounts for 10% of the EU's economic output. More than 100 million travel-related jobs, and some $2.7 trillion in GDP could be at risk as a result of the current crisis, the World Travel and Tourism Council, an industry group, said last month. Destinations like Malta and Croatia -- which rely most heavily on tourist dollars -- will be hardest hit, Hanna Ziady writes. Meanwhile in England, it's the first day of (relative) freedom. People are now allowed to drive to \"beauty spots\" or meet a friend -- but only one friend -- in the park, as lockdown restrictions begin to ease.Why Gen Z will be worst offWill Murrell had hoped to pass his further education exams this summer, at a college in London. He was hunting for a job to earn some extra money alongside his studies. Then Covid-19 struck. Now the 17-year-old is stuck at home with his parents. His exams have been canceled and all his plans are on hold. \"I've been looking for jobs and now we're in lockdown, so I can't,\" Murrell told CNN. \"It seems like an unnecessary risk.\"Murrell is part of Generation Z, those born after 1997. As a disease, coronavirus disproportionately preys on the elderly. But Gen Z, at least in the short term, is set to bear the brunt of the ensuing financial chaos. Zamira Rahim explains why. Covid-19 hits the whole bodyThe patient had been relatively fine for the first 10 days -- he had mild pulmonary symptoms and a little cough, but was resting at home. At 38, he didn't fit the description of people at high risk of complications, until one of Covid-19's surprising effects kicked in: a massive blood clot. \"He just woke up with both his legs numb and cold and so weak he couldn't walk,\" said a doctor who treated him.

        "body": "Washington (CNN)The Transportation Security Administration says it is making some changes to its security screening procedures, but did not include passenger temperature screening in its list, something a federal official has told CNN the agency is considering.\n\nThe changes include several ways to prevent officers from handling travelers' belongings and travelers from handling shared X-ray bins. The agency says passengers should hang onto their boarding passes, rather than handing them to TSA officers, to prevent cross contamination. Instead, officers will visually review the boarding pass. It also says that when a bag does not pass X-ray screening, passengers may be responsible for unpacking the bag and sending it through the X-ray machine again, rather than an officer searching through it by hand. The agency is encouraging travelers to pack food items in a clear plastic bag to make it easier for officers to check them. Food items sometimes require further inspection by TSA. Read MoreIt is also encouraging passengers to put small items like a wallet and phone into their carry-on bags before walking through the body scanner rather than placing those items in X-ray bins. That practice means fewer travelers handing the shared bins. The statement makes no mention of temperature checks. An official told CNN on Friday the agency is working on a plan to screen passengers for fevers, one symptom of coronavirus. Airlines have encouraged TSA to take on this role and generally have not implemented temperature checks for passengers themselves. Health experts have cautioned that temperature checks will not screen out all of the passengers who may be contagious.US airline executives and an industry trade group, Airlines for America, have pushed for the TSA to conduct temperature checks as part of regular airport screening.Frontier Airlines announced earlier this month that it plans to begin temperature screening all passengers and crew next month. Starting June 1, any individual with a temperature exceeding 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit \"will be denied boarding,\" the airline said.However, there's been debate over the usefulness of airport temperature checks.In mid-February, CNN reported that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had screened more than 30,000 passengers on flights from China, but not a single US coronavirus case had been caught by the airport temperature checks.TSA has already taken the precautionary measure of requiring its employees to wear facial protection while at screening checkpoints.The agency reported on April 29 that 600 of its employees, the majority of whom include officers who screen passengers, have tested positive for the coronavirus. At least six TSA employees have died due to Covid-19.The airline industry has been hit especially hard during the coronavirus crisis due to stay-at-home orders and travel restrictions.\n\nCNN's Nick Valencia, Veronica Straqualursi and Pete Muntean contributed to this report.",

    "When Denver backed off social distancing in the 1918 pandemic, the results were deadly": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nJohn Avlon is a senior political analyst at CNN. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN)Politicians were feeling pressure during the pandemic. Businesses were agitating to reopen and deaths were going down, especially far away from the coastal cities that it had hit worst, first. It seemed time to declare \"mission accomplished\" and get the economy humming again -- especially with an election looming.\n\nIt was 1918 and Denver Mayor William Fitz Randolph Mills bowed to business leaders and decided to back off social distancing. Armistice Day seemed like a perfect day to do it. The city had been all but locked down for five weeks and now there was something worth celebrating -- the end of the First World War. Grateful citizens streamed into the streets of the city on November 11, 1918, soon after Denver's Manager of Health William H. Sharpley declared the \"plague under control!\" His enthusiasm was premature but understandable: Denver officials could point to progress in containing the disease at that time, compared with other cities like Chicago. Their first recorded influenza-related death had been on September 27, when a student from Denver University named Blanche Kennedy died of pneumonia after visiting Chicago.Read More Denver moved quickly, shutting down indoor gatherings after church on October 6. Nonetheless, by October 15 there were 1,440 cases in a city of a quarter million but only 300 doctors. Even in those early days of public health, with limited scientific remedies, social distancing and masks were understood to help stem the tide of pandemic. In the town of Montrose, Colorado, as the Denver Post recounted, a health officer named Isaiah Knott warned his fellow citizens that \"if you are sick and do not stay away from social gatherings, you have the heart of a hun,\" using a derogatory term for the Germans the US was fighting at the time. But superstition often overwhelmed science, as officials recommended that people avoid wearing tight shoes and recommended people have a \"clean mouth, clean heart and clean clothes.\" Quack \"cures\" proliferated, peddling their wares to the gullible and the desperate, as we see today in all kinds of coronavirus scams and pseudo science. (Check out this Reality Check with all the sordid details). While some experts tried to calm fears by saying the Spanish influenza epidemic was \"ordinary influenza by another name,\" according to John Barry, the author of the book \"The Great Influenza,\" by the end of the pandemic, an estimated 675,000 Americans died, primarily in the fall of 1918, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But folks were bristling at being asked to stay indoors in the picturesque autumn and businesses -- especially movie theaters -- were irritated at losing so much money because of what seemed like a relatively isolated pandemic. They argued it was better to simply quarantine those who showed symptoms and let everyone else go about their business. There's an obvious echo to the pressures politicians are feeling today -- especially in states like Georgia, where Gov. Brian Kemp seems more intent on playing to the base than listening to scientists. He was late to the lockdown and now wants to open up early. But then again, he's the same governor -- of the CDC's home state -- who said it was news to him that asymptomatic people could spread the disease, two months after it was common knowledge. Another pattern in past pandemics is trying to scapegoat immigrants and vulnerable communities for spreading the disease. Immigrants, the poor and Native American tribes were being accused of spreading the disease across Colorado. Despite the name Spanish flu the disease is believed to have begun at US Army Camp Funston in Kansas earlier that year before spreading across the world, killing an estimated 50 million, including members of my family. Wealthy socialites flouted social distancing requirements with little recourse. It seemed better to back off the draconian measures and just focus on precautions while stigmatizing the sick, placing placards on the houses where there had been a case of influenza.This may have sounded reasonable at the time, but it did not have the intended result.Instead of being at the end of the influenza's toll on Denver, the city was only halfway through its ordeal. By backing off social distancing too early, they utterly failed to flatten the curve, and suffered a second bump, as this graph of cities by National Geographic shows. By November 22, deaths were spiking and Denver officials scrambled to reinstate bans on public and private gatherings and requiring masks for all commerce. But the damage had been done. Five days later, Denver Post headlines blared the bad news: \"All Flu Records Smashed in Denver in Last 24 Hours,\" claiming that more Denver residents had died of influenza than Coloradans killed in the First World War. That didn't stop business owners from marching on City Hall, protesting that they were losing tens of thousands of dollars a week, similar to the protests we've seen around the country over restrictions to help flatten the Covid-19 curve. In 1918, cases spread throughout the state of Colorado, as some schools reopened in mid-November, ultimately claiming more deaths per capita in Colorado than the national average. Then, as now, the rolling nature of pandemics affected cities first and more remote and rural areas later. In the end, 8,000 people in Colorado died, but the towns that socially isolated consistently, like Gunnison, did far better than Denver. Premature declarations of victory guarantee defeat. Buckling to protests increased the number of dead. But the protesters a century ago did not have the advantages of precedent or modern science to learn best practices. We do now, which makes the protesters who are projecting their partisan paranoid-style politics on the pandemic look like members of the flat earth society competing to win the Darwin Awards. It's worse, of course, that the President of the United States is encouraging them against the advice of his own scientific experts. As Harry Truman said, \"The only thing new in the world is the history you don't know.\" Public health is among the most difficult government actions -- when actions work they seem like overreactions. What's unforgivable is for leaders to remain willfully ignorant of history and therefore doomed to repeat it. Their weak-kneed decisions could result in the death of someone you love.",

    "When can a Covid-19 vaccine really be ready?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN)Control of the Covid-19 pandemic remains elusive. There are now more than 3.4 million cases around the world, with thousands of people dying every day. Given limited treatment options and the difficulties of sustaining social distancing, many people see a vaccine as the only viable path forward.\n\nBut when will a Covid-19 vaccine be available?I have no idea. And I promise, neither does anyone else. This is a heated moment with too much hope, too much fear, and too much on the line for anyone to have clear-eyed perspective. That said, for me, fall 2020 seems overly ambitious; even January 2021 is quite early for a safe and effective vaccine to be available for millions of people. Vaccines usually take years to develop; CanSinoBIO, a leading company in Beijing, recently received praise for moving an Ebola vaccine from concept to approval in just a little more than three years.Why it is so difficult? After all, the basic approach to vaccine development has remained more or less the same for the past 200 years: trick the immune system into developing protection against a specific infection, be it smallpox or rotavirus. Read MoreSure, the scientific sleight of hand has changed dramatically. We have moved from injecting live pathogens, to killed pathogens, to weakened but still alive pathogens to injecting genetic scraps from the pathogen using the latest techniques. But chicanery has remained the basic MO.Given all this know-how and our powerful computers, brilliant vaccine experts, lab space and plenty of money, many still wonder why we can't just muscle our way forward.Alas, it turns out that the modern age, though surely higher tech than the eras that came before, is still not up to the task of medical miracles on demand. Human biology remains far too complex for our minds (and our computers) to comprehend.That said, this is an exciting moment. On April 30, the World Health Organization posted an up-to-date inventory of Covid-19 vaccine initiatives. The list included eight trials -- half of which are in China -- currently enrolling human volunteers, and 94 trials still in pre-clinical development.In addition, health agencies, pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and researchers have pledged to collaborate closely across countries and scientific communities.Before digging into the vaccine list, a quick terminology review: The starting place for a clinical trial is \"Phase 1,\" which is designed only to assess product safety. If there is no evidence of danger, the product progresses to \"Phase 2\" to determine whether the disease responds to the new product. If things look good, the last is \"Phase 3,\" usually a large randomized trial involving thousands of people to determine safety and efficacy at long last.Of the eight trials currently enrolling volunteers, only three are in Phase 2. Of these, only the \"Oxford Trial\" (a Phase 1/Phase 2 hybrid) from the United Kingdom has prevention of Covid-19 infection, rather than a laboratory result, as the primary desired outcome.Why? The Oxford team has the odd advantage of conducting the trial in Britain, where rates of infection are still high. Germany and China, however, lack sufficient cases to accurately test vaccine efficacy. And since ethical constraints prevent scientists from infecting participants with a serious disease, a consortium of German, Chinese and American companies are developing a product currently being tested only in Germany, that instead uses surrogate markers -- antibody measurements -- against the virus. Teams will examine both the amount and duration of antibodies against the disease created in response to the vaccine.These groups have benefited from extensive experience in the field of vaccine development. They already have worked out certain techniques and theories, giving them a substantial head start -- a screaming endorsement for the long-term value of research that may not seem immediately pressing. As we now see, what may seem like an interesting but obscure pathogen today may be the cause of a pandemic tomorrow.Though many teams are working toward a vaccine, many roadblocks have been developed to intentionally slow the process in the name of safety. The history of vaccination has cast a long, dark shadow of side effects, both real and imagined. Injecting foreign material into people hoping that it will trigger a specific reaction without stirring up anything else is a medical high-wire act that has come to seem routine. It is anything but, as the history of vaccines -- and vaccine discontinuation -- attests.There is another potential pitfall as well: a worry that the vaccine might make the infection more severe.This is more than just theory. For decades, dengue fever, a viral infection common in tropical climates, has been known to cause a much more severe infection the second time certain people develop the disease.Many clinicians believe this phenomenon may occur after other respiratory infections -- including coronavirus -- though thorough investigation similar to the dengue work has not been done. Indeed, the increased severity of the \"second wave\" of the 1918 Spanish Flu, with the predominance of fatalities in younger people, may have been due to hyper-inflammation, perhaps due to previous influenza exposure.Thus some experts fear that if a Covid-19 vaccine does its job provoking the immune system, the body could go into a destructive overdrive when exposed to the actual virus.This is a doomsday scenario to be sure, but one that is giving the scientific community substantial pause as the world rushes headlong toward a vaccine. Veteran vaccinologists remain haunted by past missteps and are speaking up; indeed, placing the focus on caution, not speed, is the plea of many who have been through this before.The appropriate balance of urgent need against patient safety, they all agree, can be accomplished with thorough screening of volunteers and monitoring not only symptoms but markers of immune activity and over-activity. Regulatory involvement to aggregate any adverse events across a large study population also will be necessary to detect any early clusters of unexpected symptoms.In many ways the new \"hurry versus slow down\" tension over vaccine development exactly recapitulates the \"anti-lockdown versus shelter-in-place\" conflict: one side desperate to return to life before the pandemic at any cost and the other arguing that safety must always come first.And curiously, President Donald Trump's bromide that the cure must not be worse than the disease, while completely misguided for the issue of shelter-at-home, is on target for vaccine development. Because the only thing worse than no vaccine during a pandemic is a vaccine that makes matters worse.",

        "body": "(CNN)When Flavio Ramos was wheeled into the hospital room, he was gasping for air and slipping in and out of consciousness. So it was his son, Arturo, who first noticed the bodies.\n\nTwo corpses laid unattended on the tile floor. By the next morning, the body count in the room rose to three. Flavio Ramos was dead. More than a month later, his family still hasn't buried Flavio Ramos. They couldn't if they tried. Because soon after his death, Arturo Ramos says hospital authorities lost the body. \"We need a place to say, on Sunday let's go to put flowers on the tomb of my father,\" his heartbroken son said. \"There is nothing, there is nothing you can do.\" Flavio Ramos, 55, is yet another Covid-19 victim in Guayaquil, Ecuador, the site of one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks. Read MoreHis death and disappearance illustrate how the healthcare system in Ecuador's second-largest city, roughly the size of Chicago, collapsed within a matter of weeks after the outbreak exploded in March. Bodies in hospitalsGuayaquil was woefully unprepared to confront the coronavirus. Last month, the port city of nearly three million gained global notoriety when videos surfaced showing dead bodies left in the city's streets after morgues and funeral homes were overwhelmed. Many families made the choice to put loved ones outdoors for fear of infection and because the smells were unbearable. Three doctors in Guayaquil, each working at different hospitals, described similar scenarios during the months of March and April to CNN: Hospitals completely overwhelmed by a pandemic that descended rapidly on an unprepared healthcare system, leaving no chance to truly help people, let alone provide patients with basic levels of care. All spoke to CNN anonymously for fear of losing their jobs. \"People were terrified and scared,\" said one doctor about some of the worst days. \"Really sick people were coming to the hospital, dying. You tended to one, did what you could do, then that person dies, and you move to the next, and that person dies, and on and on like that.\" \"At one point there were dozens of bodies between the hospital rooms and morgue that were waiting to be taken away,\" said the doctor. \"There were no body bags left.\" The rate of death far outpaced the capacity of city morgues and funeral homes. A second doctor told CNN that he usually saw three or four dead bodies lying on the floor each day at the hospital. \"We had nowhere else to put them,\" he said. In a video obtained by CNN, a family is seen pulling the body of a loved one from their car and laying it in a hospital parking lot, unsure what to do next.No one would accept him In January, Flavio Ramos celebrated his birthday, surrounded by family and friends. During the last week of March, he started feeling sick. On the 31st, his breathing became so labored that 24-year-old Arturo Ramos had to take action. He drove his father to the nearest hospital, expecting the gravely ill engineer to be quickly admitted and get the help he desperately needed. But when he arrived, hospital staff told him the facility was already full. \"The doctors said, 'There are no beds for patients,' and that was it,\" Ramos told CNN by video call from his home in Guayaquil. \"If you stayed at the door they said they would call security to kick you out.\"Undeterred, he tried again at another hospital, and another, and another. After four hours of driving, Ramos says his father was admitted at General Guasmo Sur Hospital. It was the 11th facility he'd tried. Ramos recalled that his father spent his last hours in a room with two patients who had already died. \"Both bodies were on the floor,\" he said. \"One was wrapped in a black bag, a garbage bag to be exact, and the other was just dead on the floor. No one was taking care of them.\" Ramos stepped out of the hospital around 9:30 am on April 1 to grab some breakfast. He says he was gone for about 15 minutes. When he returned, his father was dead. \"No one was with him when he died,\" his son said. The hospital declined to comment on the case. \"If you keep her here, she will die.\" Arturo Ramos told CNN the hospital was like a warzone. 38 year-old Ana Maria, who declined to give her last name, said the same thing about her experience. She said she brought her 67-year-old mother to a local clinic because she was experiencing Covid-19 symptoms. A quick x-ray later and the attending physician said Ana Maria needed to get her mother to a hospital immediately -- she had severe pneumonia, the doctor said, likely due to Covid-19.By the time Ana Maria arrived at nearby Hospital Los Ceibos on March 26th looking for treatment, her mother's lips were turning shades of blue and she could barely walk. They waited inside for nearly 24 hours for a bed to open up.But as she watched patients in adjoining rooms and nearby hallways, and heard the anguished screams of their loved ones, she had second thoughts about keeping her mother in the hospital. She took decisive action after speaking to a nurse. \"She said, 'If you have the money to treat your mother at home, do it,'\" Ana Maria recalled. \"'If you keep her here, she will die.'\" She brought her mother home, hired a private nurse to treat her, and she survived. But the vast majority of people in Guayaquil don't have those financial means. Before Ana Maria left the hospital, the daughter of another patient spoke to her in their hospital room. \"She cried and said to me, 'Your mom will survive because you have the money. We don't have the money.'\" Top officials in President Len\u00edn Moreno's cabinet have publicly apologized for the government's poor response to the pandemic, saying health officials were not ready for an outbreak with such a staggering death toll. According to government data, 533 people died of Covid-19 in Guayaquil in March and April, combined. However, during that same time period, the government recorded at least 12,350 total deaths in the city -- far more than the 2,695 and 2,903 that died in the same period of 2018 and 2019, respectively. In Guayaquil, the Covid-19 related death toll might well be over 9,000 deaths, according to three Ecuador-based epidemiologists who spoke to CNN. Dr. Esteban Ortiz-Prado, an epidemiologist at the University of the Americas in Quito, Ecuador's capital city, said there was no way to know exactly how many of the excess deaths were directly or indirectly related to Covid-19, but that the pandemic was the only reasonable way to explain this year's sudden spike in the total death count. \"For me, those are Covid [deaths] until proven otherwise,\" he said. The government has admitted the actual death toll from the coronavirus is higher than the official count but said the true number will never be known due to its inability to test more people.\"We cannot say the government is lying,\" said Marco Coral, an infectious disease researcher also at the University of the Americas. \"But what we can say is that the government did not do enough tests on the people,\" an irreplaceable part of any attempt to identify the true number of coronavirus cases and deaths. Fortunately, the number of deaths in Guayaquil is dropping. Since the first week of April, when some of the highest daily death totals were recorded, the daily number of total deaths has fallen dramatically -- at least 69 total deaths were reported in the city on April 30, far below the peak seen earlier in the month. Social distancing measures, now slowly being eased off in the country, appear to have worked. But as the number of daily deaths goes down, attention turns to finding those who are already lost. Losing the right to say goodbye Amid the chaos of mounting bodies, disorganization has led to the misplacement and misidentification of those who have passed away. Many families have been unable to say goodbye to their loved ones. When Arturo Ramos returned to the hospital the day after his father died, authorities said they couldn't find his remains. The only way he could try to locate him, officials said, was to go to the morgue and search through unidentified remains himself. \"[Inside the morgue] there were bodies stacked one on top of each other,\" said Ramos. \"Going into that room, it's like hell.\" He said the bodies in the room were separated by those who had already been identified and those that hadn't. He went through body after body over the course of an hour looking for his father, accompanied by a hospital employee who, after they failed to find his dad, told him to come back the next day. For the next four straight days, Ramos estimates he looked at roughly 250 corpses, both inside the morgue and in shipping containers that had been set up outside to handle the overflow. Video of the containers on the grounds of General Guasmo Sur Hospital was given to CNN by the person who shot it. Bodies are seen in one container piled at least three high, decomposing inside different types of body bags.Ramos said only part of the morgue and one of the shipping containers was refrigerated. \"I wasn't lucky,\" said Ramos. \"I never found him.\" The problem of missing remains is so widespread that the attorney general launched an investigation last month into the mismanagement of remains at hospital morgues. CNN asked the government for exact figures on how many remains are missing, but as of publication, had not heard back. A website has been set up where anyone can search for a missing loved one's name. If the government has news to share on the location of a body, it will show up in a pop-up window on the screen.More than a month after Flavio Ramos' death, a search for his name launches a pop-up window that reads only: 'No Results Found.' Ramos grieves for his father alone these days. He's separated from his family for their own safety. Last week, he tested positive for the virus.

        "body": "Where did it go wrong for the UK on coronavirus?\n\nAnalysis by Luke McGee and Mick Krever, CNN\n\nUpdated 6:23 AM ET, Thu April 30, 2020\n\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nLondon (CNN)The British government is on the brink of missing a crucial target in its fight against coronavirus.\n\nA headline-grabbing aim of conducting 100,000 daily Covid-19 tests by the end of April is unlikely to be achieved, with the government saying that only 52,429 had been carried out on Tuesday, two days before the deadline. Capacity is available for about 73,000, Downing Street says. Government sources argue, with some justification, that the target -- up from about 10,000 a day at the beginning of the month -- was always incredibly ambitious, and the fact that capacity has been expanded so quickly is a huge achievement. But, critics say, that only serves to illustrate the inadequacies of Britain's testing regime in the first place.The missed testing target is not the only failing. The UK is on track to have one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in Europe, with more than 26,000 deaths recorded by Wednesday. Its patchwork of care homes for the elderly has been ravaged by the disease. There have been near-daily reports of insufficient personal protective equipment on the front line, meaning doctors, nurses and care home workers risk catching it every time they go to work.The country's leader himself contracted the disease, becoming so ill that his advisers were not completely sure that he would recover from it. At the time, daily briefings breezily proclaimed Prime Minister Boris Johnson was in \"good spirits\" when in fact -- by Johnson's own account later -- the situation was significantly more grave.Read MoreAnd, despite ministers' repeated insistence that they are being \"guided by the science\" in their coronavirus response, secrecy still shrouds the nature of that scientific advice. The current membership of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (SAGE), the government's main scientific advisory body, which changes depending on the crisis, has not been listed publicly. The group hasn't published the basis of any of its advice for more than a month. There is, as yet, no published framework for exiting the lockdown that has brought the fifth largest economy in the world to a grinding halt.So far, the government appears to have successfully batted away suggestions that its coronavirus strategy has been a failure by pointing to one, crucial measure of success: The country's beloved National Health Service (NHS) has so far ridden out the crisis without being overwhelmed. The desperate scenes witnessed in northern Italy, where a world-class health system was brought to its knees, have not been repeated in the UK.\"This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided by the best scientific advice,\" a government spokesperson told CNN, in response to a request to address the criticisms raised in this article. Ministers and officials have been \"working day and night to battle coronavirus, delivering a strategy designed to protect our NHS and save lives,\" the spokesperson said. \"We have provided the NHS with all the support it needs, [and] made sure everyone requiring treatment has received it.\"But could more have been done to prevent the scale of loss of life? Should ministers have acted sooner? And could there be more transparency in the overall strategy?A crucial dateHistorians might look back on March 12 as the most significant date in Britain's coronavirus response. This was the day the UK formally abandoned the \"contain\" phase -- an attempt to stop the virus in its tracks by tracking every outbreak and tracing its origins; and moved to the \"delay\" phase -- an effort to \"flatten the curve\" and prevent the health service from being overloaded.On that day Johnson stood before journalists, flanked by his scientific and medical advisers, and admitted that \"many more families are going to lose loved ones.\" But he didn't go as far as ordering a lockdown -- that would come over a week later. As he spoke, tens of thousands of people gathered at the Cheltenham racecourse for its annual festival, an early fixture in England's social calendar. Was that wise, he was asked? \"It is very important that we're guided by the science,\" Johnson said, using a phrase that was to become a favorite of government ministers. \"There is very little epidemiological or medical reason at the moment to ban such events.\"Johnson's chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, admitted that even people with \"really quite mild symptoms\" could be contagious. Despite this, the chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, agreed with Johnson that canceling large events was \"not a major way to tackle this epidemic.\"Indeed, the next day, Vallance told BBC Radio 4's flagship morning news program, in a now-infamous interview, that a \"key\" aim would be to \"build up some kind of herd immunity so more people are immune to this disease and we reduce the transmission.\" Government sources have told CNN that herd immunity was never official policy.On March 23, in a televised address to the nation, Johnson switched course, announcing the most sweeping set of social restrictions in the UK since the end of World War II. By that time, 335 people had died from Covid-19 in the UK. Given the weeks-long gap between initial infection and death, it's clear now that by the time Johnson spoke, coronavirus had taken hold in Britain.Three key questionsCritics are zeroing in on three key areas as they seek to find out what went wrong in the UK.First, there was the abandonment of mass testing.At the start of the outbreak in the UK, public health officials tracked and traced every known case. Ministers have never offered a clear reason for why that policy was abandoned. Was it because the testing capacity had been reached? Was it because the system could not cope with the expected upturn in demand? Was it structural, since the public health system in England has, over the years, gradually been centralized?\"Abandoning testing gave the virus the green light to spread uncontrollably,\" says the Royal Society of Medicine's Gabriel Scally. \"If you don't have access to testing, you won't know that you have an outbreak until a lot of people are ill.\"Some in the scientific community say an obsession with central control led officials to set up the testing regime initially in just a few labs, rather than allowing local hospitals to do it themselves.\"Sadly, it seems likely to me that once the government models showed how bad the crisis would be, our testing capacity wouldn't be anywhere near able to cope with the coming surge,\" a leading microbiologist told CNN on condition of anonymity to describe confidential discussions. \"God only knows what their thinking was not telling hospitals to get ready. It was a mistake.\" Downing Street declined to provide an on-the-record explanation to CNN on this issue.The second crucial question is whether the government failed to order a lockdown early enough. Even though the government did not know by that March 12 briefing just how many people were infected, Whitty said it was still too early to lock down because \"if people go too early, they become very fatigued.\" If tough restrictions came too early, the theory went, the British public would begin to tire of it just as they were starting to become effective, and demands for them to be lifted would become impossible to resist.Government sources defended that course of action to CNN, pointing out that some mitigation measures were put in place between March 12 and the full lockdown on March 23, like advising vulnerable groups to stay at home and requiring people with certain symptoms to self-quarantine.The third big question is the pursuit of so-called \"herd immunity.\"\"It's not possible to stop everybody getting it,\" said Vallance at the March 12 briefing. However, the experience of countries like South Korea and Germany, where testing and tracking systems have been significantly more rigorous, and in New Zealand, where lockdown measures were taken at a much earlier stage, suggest that it has been possible to stop quite a large number of people from getting it.Medical experts both inside and outside the government's circle of trusted advisers have admitted to CNN that they believe the government waited too long to enter lockdown. \"Many of the decisions the government has made ignore basic public health science,\" says Dr. Bharat Pankhania, senior clinical lecturer at University of Exeter. \"From abandoning track and trace, to the timing of the lockdown, to providing the correct protective equipment, ignoring basic public health science may have led to more deaths than necessary.\"Pankhania believes that despite government claims it has been guided by science at every step, the decision to delay lockdown was likely \"governed by economic consideration, rather than public health science.\"This conflict between the government's claim that it has followed the science from day one, and some in the scientific community's skepticism as to how good that evidence is, has become a key battlefield between those inside and outside the UK government.Following the scienceOne of the most controversial decisions during this crisis has been to keep private the membership of the SAGE, and not to publish minutes of its meetings, in a departure from standard operating procedure for almost all other UK advisory groups. \"I don't personally understand why,\" said Peter Openshaw, an immunologist who sits on the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (NERVTAG), a panel that advises SAGE. This secrecy has led to speculation from prominent members of the public health community about the quality and breadth of evidence that is reaching the top levels of government. \"The government's decisions show no characteristics of public health input. I wouldn't be surprised if the public health voice was marginalized both within SAGE and in government,\" says Scally, of the Royal Society of Medicine.It's \"driving the public health guys mad,\" said another scientist who has contributed to the UK's National Risk Register, an overview of the potential threats facing the UK.Another criticism of the process has been that the government has at times even sidestepped the normal groups of scientific advisers. \"Things are moving so fast that they're rather going direct to the modelers,\" said Openshaw. \"The epidemiological modelers have got a very direct line into government.\"However trivial it might seem, disagreements between public health experts and scientific modelers are a significant part of the story. \"We're seeing a struggle that has been going on for about 20 years between modelers and epidemiologists,\" a scientist who advises SAGE told CNN on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential government business.It's no secret that Dominic Cummings, Johnson's top adviser, has a personal interest in scientific modeling. So it's little surprise that public health experts were enraged when the government was forced to admit last week that Cummings had attended SAGE meetings, which are supposed to be independent advisory forums. The government said he attended in order to understand the scientific debate around the virus and its behavior.Multiple members of SAGE and groups that advise it defended their impartiality to CNN. \"The debate is robust, and everyone sets out their case clearly and articulately,\" said one member, requesting anonymity to discuss sensitive matters. \"There are lots of people criticizing from the sidelines, but I think it's possible those people are angry they have been left on the sidelines.\"A source who advises SAGE said: \"Frankly, I find it hard to see that the presence of Cummings makes much difference. We're not talking about shrinking violets.\"However, the source went on to express concern at how scientific evidence is being presented. \"Science is not homogenous... The best SAGE can do is present imperfect material. The government has been able to take advantage of the public view of science as a voice of certainty, and present some of its decisions as being taken with more concrete certainty than they have.\"This has prompted fears that at some time in the future, the government might try hiding behind the science for decisions they've taken -- or worse, throw members of SAGE under a convenient bus. \"It certainly does seem to be an anxiety of some of my colleagues, but I am less worried. Many politicians are not exceptional thinkers. Should a public inquiry come, I would be surprised if it's the scientists who do a bad job of making their case,\" said a member of SAGE.What next?That public inquiry seems inevitable, once the worst of the crisis is over.And when it comes, the government will stick to its line that the decision to prioritize the protection of the NHS was the right course of action, and that it succeeded. While it's true the NHS didn't fall over during what look like the worst weeks of the crisis, a cynic might claim that focusing on hospitals ignored what was happening in the wider community.\"People might well reply that it protected the NHS at the expense of shifting deaths elsewhere. Not to mention the physical and mental suffering experienced across the country,\" said one of the scientists advising SAGE.In the short term, the government is under pressure to tell the public how lockdown will end. It will not simply be a matter of easing social distancing measures.Pankhania says the government must not be too influenced by economic pressures to bring back normality. \"It is important to note that economics can be rebalanced, but lives lost cannot be bought back.\" He stresses that even if lockdown is lifted, the government must be prepared to \"shut it down again.\"Robert Dingwall, professor of social science at Nottingham Trent University and a member of NERVTAG, says: \"The biggest challenge for the government is levels of fear and anxiety in the general population, which may make people reluctant to go along with the release from lockdown.\"The UK's coronavirus story has been dramatic, even by international standards. While Johnson was off sick, legitimate questions concerning his government's handling of the pandemic were asked with few satisfactory answers from those stepping in to fill his shoes.Johnson's inner circle hope his return to work will bring about a refreshed sense of energy and urgency. But many irreversible key decisions have already been made. When, how and why will determine the next phase of this story -- and how successful Johnson's government was when facing the nation's worst crisis in decades.",

        "body": "(CNN)You're about to get a blood test to see if you have been exposed to Covid-19, the deadly disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\nYou're hoping it will tell you that you have, right? That your blood is full of beautiful antibodies, the body's soldiers called to fight when a known enemy invades our systems again.You may dare to hope the discovery of antibodies in your blood means you will be immune to the virus in the future -- you won't ever get it again or give it to anyone else. That's the holy grail, of course -- the ticket to freely visiting your parents, friends and loved ones again, to going back to work in the office again -- basically, to getting your life back.Not so fast. Read MoreIn today's reality, testing positive for antibodies to Covid-19 means nothing of the sort. In fact, it may not mean much at all -- at least right now. There are still too many unknowns, both about the accuracy of the antibody tests that are available and about the nature of the virus itself. \"It is clear that we're still not where we need to be. It's a brutal truth, but one that needs to be told,\" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in the May 5 episode of his podcast, called \"Coronavirus: Fact vs. Fiction.\"\"And this is exactly why I keep advising people to behave like you have the virus,\" Gupta said.What is an antibody test?An antibody test can only be administered by gathering blood, either through a finger prick or from a vein. It's designed to detect antibodies, the Y-shaped proteins called immunoglobulins that circulate in our blood to help fight off infections in our bodies.Produced by white blood cells, the two \"arms\" of the antibody are designed to recognize and fight bacteria and viruses that have been encountered in the past, thus hopefully stopping these germs from taking hold again. Even if you've never had any symptoms of Covid-19, the presence of antibodies in your blood would show your body has encountered the virus.To be clear, antibody tests are not the \"swab\" tests that are meant to find out if you are currently carrying the virus. Called rt-PCR tests, or molecular diagnostic tests, those typically gather mucus from way up the nose or back of the throat. They take a few days to report results.There are dozens of such tests being used or developed in the United States right now, but few are highly accurate. That means they can fail to detect an active virus, thus delivering a false sense of security. A recent yet unpublished study of five commonly used diagnostic tests by the Cleveland Clinic found 15% delivered false negatives. In China, one study found the number of false negatives was nearly 40%.Nor are antibody tests similar to the antigen test just approved for emergency use by the US Food and Drug Administration last week. That diagnostic test, also done via nasal swab, can report results more quickly than the rt-PCR tests but is not as sensitive, which means it will be even more likely to miss a case of Covid-19.In addition, both antigen and rt-PCR tests can only give a \"snapshot\" of your status at that specific point in time. If you were exposed to Covid-19 the next day, you could easily become sick and not know it.How accurate is the antibody test?First, let's look at timing. Antibodies just don't appear overnight. It can take weeks to build up enough of a level in the blood to be picked up by even the most sensitive test. So if you have the test before your body has fully responded, it may give you a false negative. That's if you develop antibodies at all.To understand that, consider the entire concept behind vaccines. Vaccinations are supposed to give just enough of a live or dead virus to get the body to mount an immune response -- but not enough to make you sick from the illness. But everyone is different. Some people don't react to the vaccine at all, or their immune response is not quick or adequate enough to protect them.Antibody tests are also plagued by error. Just like the diagnostic tests, \"antibody tests haven't been as accurate as they need to be,\" Gupta said. By their very nature, such tests can easily produce both false negatives and positives.\"With the antibody test, what you're really hoping to avoid is a false positive,\" Gupta said. \"Then, someone might feel that they have the antibodies, thus feel that they are protected, go out into the community, to a hospital, to a nursing home and spread the virus.\"The tests also need to be able to differentiate between past infections from SARS-CoV-2 and the other known set of six human coronaviruses, four of which cause the common cold and circulate widely. Then there's the lack of oversight. The need for testing has created a market free-for-all in which companies are creating tests without any scientific oversight.\"There are plenty of antibody tests floating around that haven't been reviewed or validated by the US Food and Drug Administration. It's been a big problem,\" Gupta said.According to the FDA, there are currently over 130 unvetted antibody tests in use, along with the dozens of diagnostic tests. The agency recently announced it was tightening its policy to keep unproven and even fraudulent tests from entering the market by requiring commercial testmakers to meet new standards of accuracy and submit information proving testing quality. If I have antibodies to Covid-19, will I be immune?Of course, the big question is: If your blood does show antibodies against Covid-19, are you immune to the virus if exposed in the future? Scientists hope that will be the case since it has historically been true for other viruses such as chicken pox and polio.But so far, there's no evidence of that with SARS-CoV-2.\"It's unclear if those antibodies can provide protection,\" the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says on its website. \"This means that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to the virus.\"The World Health Organization is more direct. In late April, the organization released a scientific brief that said, \"There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.\"While studies of blood samples taken from people who have recovered from Covid-19 do show an immune response to the virus, some have \"very low levels of neutralizing antibodies in their blood,\" WHO said.It's possible that immunity may need to occur on a cellular level as well as via antibodies circulating in the blood, the agency warned.\"The body also makes T-cells that recognize and eliminate other cells infected with the virus. This is called cellular immunity,\" WHO explained. Along with antibodies, the \"combined adaptive response may clear the virus from the body, and if the response is strong enough, may prevent progression to severe illness or reinfection by the same virus,\" WHO said.But consider this: Even if we are lucky enough to have that happen, we still don't know how long that immunity will last. No 'immunity passport' yetWhat's the takeaway from the results of your antibody test? Simply put, it really doesn't matter if you test positive or negative, because until testing improves and we understand more about the virus, you -- and everyone else -- is still at risk. \"At this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity to guarantee the accuracy of an 'immunity passport' or 'risk-free certificate,'\" WHO stated.",

        "body": "(CNN)Around 1.4 million more people could die of tuberculosis (TB) by 2025 due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the fight against the infection, predicts new research.\n\nWorldwide efforts to grapple with coronavirus are badly affecting diagnosis, treatment and prevention of TB, experts said, predicting an additional 6.3 million cases of the infection by 2025 as a result, according to a report published Wednesday.TB is a bacterial infection that affects the lungs and has been around for hundreds of years. It kills 1.5 million people per year -- more than any other infectious disease -- and has been subject to a major drive to eliminate it from human populations in recent decades.But those efforts have been derailed due to coronavirus, said Dr Lucica Ditiu, executive director of the Stop TB Partnership, a United Nations-hosted entity that aims to end the disease by 2030.Read More\"Today, governments face a torturous path, navigating between the imminent disaster of Covid-19 and the long-running plague of TB,\" said Ditiu in a press release. \"But choosing to ignore TB again would erase at least half a decade of hard-earned progress against the world's most deadly infection and make millions more people sick.\"The devastating numbers arise from modeling based on a three-month lockdown and a 10-month restoration of TB services. It was commissioned by Stop TB Partnership and carried out by Imperial College London, Johns Hopkins University and Avenir Health, with the support of USAID.The modeling looks at the impact of coronavirus measures in India, Kenya and Ukraine -- three \"high burden\" nations, meaning they have a large number of estimated cases.The number of cases and deaths have been declining in recent years due to coordinated efforts in high burden countries, according to the Stop TB Partnership.But restrictions implemented worldwide because of coronavirus mean TB cases detection has \"dramatically fallen,\" treatments have been delayed, and those with drug-resistant TB risk the interruption of treatment, added the organization.The fight against TB could be set back five to eight years, the study suggests.To limit the impact, the Stop TB Partnership is calling on governments to maintain diagnostic, treatment and prevention services during lockdown measures and implement \"a massive catch-up effort\" to trace and treat TB.TB is a complex disease and protecting people who are already infected is just as important because people are able to carry the bacteria, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for years -- possibly their entire lives -- without symptoms.",

    "Why is Russia's Covid-19 mortality rate so low? ": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Kent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN)For almost two weeks, three countries have led the rest of the world in the daily number of new Covid-19 infections: The United States, Russia and Brazil.\n\nThis makes some sense -- each is in the top 10 of most populous countries with well over 125 million people and each has a few very crowded cities. Furthermore, each country was disorganized and disbelieving as the disease settled in their region. But one important difference separates Russia from the other two nations. As of Monday, in the United States, which has been in the midst of the pandemic for almost two months, the mortality rate from Covid-19 was 6%, according to Johns Hopkins; in Brazil, hard-hit for a month, the mortality was nearly 7%. And in parts of Western Europe, including Italy, France, Spain, Belgium and the UK the mortality rate was over 10%.But in Russia, where the pandemic arrived about the same time as Brazil, the mortality rate sat at less than 1%. How can this be?Read MoreDr. Elena Malinnikova, the chief of infectious diseases in the Russian Ministry of Health, has a simple explanation: The low mortality is due to timely detection of infection as well as the fact that that Russians tend to see their doctor soon after symptoms appear.Russian journalists have reported that more than 60% of all cases diagnosed in the country have been in Moscow, which has a younger and healthier population than rural areas.No matter the reason, the extremely low mortality rate is quite unexpected. So, I compared various factors to try to understand what's going on.The testing difference between Russia and Brazil is enormous. Dr. Malinnikova and Russian leaders should be very proud. At the time of writing, they have tested 40,995 people per million population. In contrast, Brazil has a very low rate, at 3,459 tests per million citizens. (for comparison, the US has a rate of 30,937 per million).As we have seen in Switzerland, Germany and other countries with extensive testing, mortality rates start low because so many cases are identified and never progress to serious illness though as the German epidemic has matured, the fatality rate has increased from less than 0.5% to about 4.5%.The profound testing difference may indeed be the main reason, but other factors can contribute to risk of death from Covid-19 infection, including being a male, advanced age, heart disease, chronic lung disease, diabetes and obesity, for which comparative countrywide information is available. Of note, Russia has high rates of these comorbid conditions, especially among men. Unfortunately, neither Russia nor Brazil has released much information regarding the age and sex distribution of the cases or the deaths in their country, though in late April, Brazil reported that 59% of coronavirus deaths were in men. However, per the World Bank, 15% of Russia's population is 65 years old or older, compared to Brazil with 9% (the US sits at 16%). This difference would predict that Brazil would have a lower mortality rate than Russia.Cardiac disease also is much more prevalent in Russia than Brazil. A recent study suggests that by any measurement, Russia has at least twice the rate of complications from cardiovascular disease as Brazil -- another reason Covid-19 death rates would be lower, not higher, in Brazil than Russia.No statistics for rates of chronic lung disease by country are available. However, smoking, a major cause of lung disease, is more common in Russia (57% of men and 23% of women) than Brazil (17% of men and 10% of women). In contrast, death from lung disease is lower in Russia (14.5 per 100,000) than in Brazil (26.6 per 100,000). Diabetes is about half as common in Russia (6%) compared to Brazil (10%) while rates of obesity are about the same: As of 2016, Russia was 70th in the world with a 23% prevalence while Brazil sat at 22% for 82nd in the world. (By comparison, the United States had the 12th highest rate at 36%).Therefore, the known and measurable risk factors for severe disease point to Russia having at least a comparable, if not a higher, death rate than Brazil.So, is Dr. Malinnikova correct? Is the difference really due to testing and the apparently efficient Russian health care system?Perhaps, but there may be other ways to explain the differences. We do not know, for example, how Russia attributes death to Covid-19. If a person with heart disease dies with the infection, which condition is the \"cause?\" How quickly does information come to Moscow from the rural areas which may have higher death rates given the higher rate of comorbidities? And what about nursing home deaths -- are these being included as Covid-19 related, even if a test was not performed?As in the US and elsewhere, accurate classification of a Covid-19-related death remains very important to our understanding of the disease and the effectiveness of our attempts to control it. However, certainty about how, exactly, a person died remains a very difficult determination.Diseases are not independent of each other: someone with heart disease will predictably fare worse with pneumonia than someone without heart disease -- but should the person die, what is the true cause of death? Probably a collision of illnesses that collectively overwhelm a person rather than a single nameable cause. This means that the cause of death can be tilted one way or another while still remaining accurate. And with a disease such as Covid-19, where political tensions are evident in many countries, this latitude (and the temptation to exploit it) calls to mind the chilling statement popularly attributed to Josef Stalin, though it's far from clear that he said it: \"It is not who votes but who counts the votes that matters.\" In other words, the death rate from Covid-19 in Russia and worldwide is defined not by an internationally agreed upon definition, but by the authorities who are reporting. Once again, we may find our understanding of Covid-19 stymied by an altogether new uncertainty -- this one not medical at all, but entirely the product of political calculations.",

        "body": "(CNN)Michael Herbert, a 49-year-old father of two, was scared he would never see his family again. Herbert says he only had a 20% chance of survival, and needed to be placed in a medically induced coma. His doctors urged him to call his family for what could be his last goodbye.\n\nIt had all started innocuously enough -- a cough and fever. After that, however, his illness took off. Within a week, he was on a breathing machine in the ICU because of a life-threatening lung infection from Covid-19.His wife Heidi and two daughters painfully remember the next six days when Herbert was unconscious -- wondering if and how they could be at his bedside during a strict no-visitor hospital policy, just to hold his hand in what might be his last days. Herbert's rapid worsening was even jarring for his medical team caring for him. \"It was certainly unusual how quickly he went from a period of apparent stability to requiring ventilatory support,\" said Dr. Neal Greenfield, a critical care physician who helped care for Michael at Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital in Geneva, Illinois.But as quickly as Herbert got worse, he then recovered. His doctors reduced his sedation, and with his regained consciousness, Herbert video-called his family every day. Unable to speak with a breathing tube, he would sign, \"I love you.\"Read MoreHe was taken off of his ventilator on his mother's birthday -- a week earlier than expected -- and he gave his mom the best birthday gift a son could give. \"I was able to call her and just say, \"Hi,\" and then I was able to FaceTime my girls and wife, which was wonderful,\" he said. Herbert was released from the hospital a few days later. His cough and fever improved. On paper, he would be listed as recovered, but as we are learning, the aftermath of Covid-19 is not nearly as straightforward as once believed.Tracking for a disease with little information\"Two months ago, recovery wasn't on anyone's mind. We were dealing with the crisis,\" said Dr. Reynold Panettieri, vice chancellor of clinical and translational science and a pulmonary critical care physician at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center at Rutgers University in New Jersey. While most patients with Covid-19 will fully recover, data from China suggest that some patients, especially those who had more severe infections, may face lasting -- even permanent -- damage to their bodies.To better understand these effects, Panettieri is leading a six-month study of recovered Covid-19 patients. So far, his research group has enrolled more than 800 participants.\"Now, we'll start to see what the long-term consequences are,\" Panettieri said. \"And that is an issue that will really need to be addressed.\"Unlike most viral diseases, which may result in a nagging cough for weeks, Panettieri has observed that some patients recovering from Covid-19 have other serious symptoms that won't go away. \"They had an illness for about two weeks, and three months later, they're still not feeling 'quite right,'\" he said. \"They were aggressive athletes or were exercising and...they still haven't gotten back to that prowess that they were pre-illness.\"He said this could be related to a number of factors, including how the virus affects the lungs, heart and muscles.For Michael Herbert, his doctors believe his lingering cough and shortness of breath are likely remnants of his serious bout of pneumonia. Despite leaving the hospital a month ago, Herbert still struggles to recover back to how he felt before getting sick.Dangerous lung scarring reminiscent of SARS and MERSWhile a longer recovery course might be expected for someone such as Herbert who faced a more severe illness, there's also concern for more permanent lung damage, according to Dr. Ronald DePinho, professor and past president of MD Anderson Cancer Center and co-founder of Tvardi Therapeutics. DePinho is particularly worried that the immune response to Covid-19 may cause irreversible scarring known as pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrosis can be a \"relentlessly progressive\" disease of the lungs in which patients can become dependent on oxygen or even ultimately require lung transplants, he said. Again, this is after a patient is thought to have \"recovered.\"Though it's too early to know whether patients with the novel coronavirus will develop this sort of lung scarring, studies in other related coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS, suggests certain Covid-19 patients may have lasting fibrosis. One study following 36 MERS patients found a third still had lung fibrosis on chest x-rays after a median follow-up of 43 days.And up to two-thirds of patients with SARS who were sick enough to require hospitalization also developed pulmonary fibrosis, according to DePinho. If the same pattern holds true for Covid-19, that could mean many thousands of people will have long-term lung scarring, he said.The data from China thus far is still thin, but the early results follow the same pattern DePinho is describing. In a study of 63 Covid-19 patients from Wuhan, China, about 18% had \"fibrous stripes\" on CT scans. And in another study, it took more than 6 weeks for one patient's chest CT to return to normal, even though his symptoms had already improved.This might explain why some patients have significant drops in their lung function even after recovering from the novel coronavirus. Losses in lung function could be as high as 20 to 30 percent, the medical director of infectious diseases at Princess Margaret Hospital in Hong Kong told a media briefing in March.More on Covid-19 and the lungsThere is another factor that may be driving long-term issues with the lungs, unrelated to scarring or fibrosis. We are learning those with Covid-19 also can form blood clots at an abnormally high rate. In rare situations, a clot that has formed in the deep veins of the legs may travel to the lungs -- known as a pulmonary embolism. This is what happened to Warnell Vega, a healthy 33-year-old I interviewed with Covid-19 who survived a life-threatening pulmonary embolism and is now home in recovery.As is often the case, Vega developed a pulmonary embolism with little or no warning. He only had a mild cough when he passed out in his bathroom. He woke up in an ICU at Mount Sinai hospital. He was subsequently diagnosed with Covid-19, after which a scan revealed a pulmonary embolism. His doctors told me that Vega became critically ill and developed signs of pulmonary hypertension, which happens 2-4% of the time in patients with a PE (pulmonary embolism). So far Vega told me he feels close to normal, but recent clinical studies have shown that close to half of patients who suffered a pulmonary embolism will still experience exercise limitations at one year.Given his history of a blood clot and pulmonary embolism, Vega is at risk of developing a blood clot again, and may need to be on blood thinners for some time as he continues to recover. Blood thinners in general might improve outcomes for hospitalized patients with Covid-19, according to a report published Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The team at Mount Sinai conducting the study found 29% of patients on ventilators who were provided blood thinners died, compared to 63% of patients on ventilators who were not given blood thinners. The improvement in mortality rates with blood thinners might demonstrate how dangerous blood clots from Covid-19 are. The heartAnother significant risk factor for a successful recovery is the impact of this virus on the heart. The virus' impact on the lungs may eventually lead to less oxygenated blood reaching the heart. Ot the virus may attack the heart itself, leading to myocarditis -- inflammation of the heart muscle. Both can lead to chronic heart damage, even in the previously healthy.\"There have been a number of reported cardiac complications associated with the Covid virus and they're so varied,\" said Dr. Joseph Brennan, the director of the coronary intensive care unit at Yale University School of Medicine.He said there are a couple ways to look at how Covid-19 could cause long-term effects on the heart. One way is the direct impact of the virus on the heart, and the other is how clotting from Covid could lead to heart attacks. \"We are all aware that heart attacks may have long-term consequences because of a potential and permanent decline in heart function,\" he said. \"Those that have had...heart attacks associated with the Covid virus will more than likely have long-term consequences.\"A study published in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology found 19.7% of hospitalized Covid-19 patients suffered from some type of cardiac injury. Such patients might not be able to exercise as much, feel breathless or feel like their heart is beating faster than usual for an indefinite period of time. In general, a faster heart rate will likely be a common side effect in the long run for Covid-19 patients, especially if patients have underlying lung issues from Covid-19, he said.Though Michael Herbert did not have heart-related complications from Covid-19, he did suffer from diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity -- conditions that affect heart health and put him at risk for a more severe infection, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The brainAnother important organ at risk for damage from blood clots? The brain. Large clots would more likely cause obvious symptoms, but smaller ones may lead to a type of dementia known as vascular dementia. Both can cause permanent damage that might not present itself until years down the line.\"We know that if someone has a stroke, it approximately doubles their risk of getting dementia later in life,\" said Dr. Marion Buckwalter, associate professor of neurology and neurosurgery at Stanford University. \"[Our research group] discovered that people who had a more vigorous immune response by day two after stroke were more likely to have cognitive decline in the first year after stroke.\" Michael Herbert feels lucky that he hasn't experienced these types of symptoms during his recovery, especially given how severe his infection was. \"I'm feeling good,\" Michael said. \"My strength has come back. It's not perfect, but I feel better.\" Though his progress has been incremental, he remains encouraged that each day has been a step in the right direction. He remembers how weak he felt trying to move from his ICU bed to a wheelchair. Now, he is working towards walking two miles a day without stopping.The entire ordeal has been a huge wake up call for him -- he now takes his health much more seriously, and he is grateful that his doctors have provided him a second chance.\"I mean, I have bonus time here in life,\" he said. \"I was supposed to be dead, and I didn't die.

        "body": "(CNN)Several top Trump administration officials are continuing to predict Depression-era unemployment numbers for the month of May.\n\nOn Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the US economy lost a record 20.5 million jobs in April, with the unemployment rate reaching 14.7%. But that's based on claims filed by mid-month. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin gave an even steeper figure on Sunday in an interview with Fox News when asked where unemployment stands. Mnuchin, asked by Fox's Chris Wallace whether \"we (are) talking close to 25% at this point, which is Great Depression neighborhood,\" responded, \"We could be,\" adding that the administration expects the numbers to improve in the coming months. Larry Kudlow, the chairman of the President's National Economic Council, said Sunday that he expects May to see \"very difficult numbers,\" but also sought to call attention to what he called \"a glimmer of hope\" in the data for Americans to return to work.Yet Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic adviser and former CNN contributor, continued to paint a dark picture for future unemployment, telling CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union\" that the rate will \"probably\" be \"close to 20%\" in the May jobs report, which will be released in June.Read MoreHow reopening affects projected death rates We're now well into May and public health officials say there still isn't enough testing or contact tracing to reopen the country safely. But as unemployment rates soar, governors are under increasing pressure to reopen more businesses in a gamble that no one will know the health effects of for weeks. The early indications aren't good. See where your state stands on reopening here. An influential coronavirus model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington recently doubled its projections for US deaths. It's now forecasting that more than 134,000 people will die from Covid-19 by August.Here's how the model shifted in April, when the rapid spread of state-by-state shutdowns and widespread compliance with social distancing sent death estimates downward. CNN spoke Sunday to Dr. Theo Vos, an IHME professor of health metrics sciences who is working on the model, about what's changed since then. The conversation, conducted over email and lightly edited for flow, is below:CNN: Your model has shifted upwards to now forecast more than 134,000 US deaths from the coronavirus. I'm curious what the main driving forces behind that shift were?TV: With more data showing a longer lingering peak and a slower downward trajectory of deaths in quite a number of locations compared to what has happened in earlier epidemics (Wuhan, Italy, Spain) our model follows these new data points and extends the first wave curve of death in time and that makes the cumulative death count by early August go up. By creating a hybrid model between the statistical death model and a transmission model, we can better pick up changes in predictors of transmission. Change in mobility and testing per capita are the most important drivers in the transmission model. There also is a modest effect of temperature (warmer temp, a bit less transmission) and an effect of population density (which obviously does not change over time). Thus the uptick in mobility we see in some states and the predicted change in mobility from lifting of some of the social distancing measures tells the transmission model there will be an uptick in new infections and in time those will lead to more symptomatic cases, hospitalized patients and eventually an increase in deaths.CNN: The model added a tool to visualize mobility. Can you explain what exactly that refers to and what role it plays in your forecast as more states relax social distancing measures?TV: It is based on combining the information from four sources into a single indicator (Google, Facebook, Safegraph and Descartes). This gives us day-to-day measures of mobility and change in this variable affects the probability of transmission as explained above. For the effect of relaxation of some social distancing measures we look at the effects their implementation had in an opposite direction and data on change in mobility in places that have started relaxing measures to predict the effect into future weeks.CNN: The IHME model had previously projected that US coronavirus deaths would come to a halt this summer. Now with more available data, how has that timeline changed? TV: The previous model assumed all social distancing measures would remain in place. At the time our focus was on informing policy makers about the surge in cases in hospitals/ICUs and the timing of the peak of this first wave. With the policy focus shifting towards relaxation of some of the social distancing measures, we incorporated the transmission model into the death model, so that we can better reflect the effect of such changes on mobility and consequently on the risk of transmission in the community. CNN: As we head into the summer months, what could cause the model to shift upward again?TV: As mobility and testing are the main predictors, it will be a balancing act between increased mobility and increasing testing intensity that will determine what will happen next. It will be important to get the balance right between these to avoid another upsurge in cases and deaths if transmission increases above the level where a new case of infection transmits to more than one other individual. Of course, the testing per capita variable we use in our model as an important indicator (for which we have data) it is important that there are aspects of testing that determine how effective the strategy is beyond just the total numbers of tests: directing testing at everyone with mild symptoms or at higher risk of becoming infected; quick results and immediate contact tracing + testing of contacts and isolation of infected contacts (including those who are asymptomatic). CNN: Is there anything specific you want people to know about your model moving forward? TV: We will continue to regularly update the model, extend to other countries and incorporate new information that provides feedback on how good our predictions were.",

        "body": "(CNN)One is widespread but has key shortages across its supply chain.\n\nOne remains questionably reliable and is only helpful after the fact.And one is still early in development -- but could speed up and simplify results.Experts say ramping up the use of these three different types of coronavirus tests -- the PCR test, the antibody test and the antigen test, respectively -- is essential to reopening America's shuttered economy safely.Despite the need, the availability of testing remains in frustratingly short supply and is dependent on individual states and local health care providers rather than the federal government. And increasing that availability of testing is difficult because of significant scientific and logistical issues.Read MoreHere's a look at each of the three main tests, their strengths and weaknesses, and the holdups that have slowed their rapid mass production.PCR testsWhat are they?Polymerase chain reaction tests, known as PCR, are the most common and most accurate tests for determining whether someone is currently infected with the novel coronavirus. How do they work? Every virus has a unique genetic code. The novel coronavirus PCR test works by starting with a throat swab or sputum sample from a patient, amplifying that specimen in a machine, and then looking for unique coronavirus genetic material.First, a health care worker takes a swab or sputum sample from the back of the patient's throat or nose, generally using a long thin nasopharyngeal swab. That swab is stored in a sterile tube or vial and is then sent to a lab that has access to a test kit.There, trained lab technicians extract any genetic information from the specimen. The purified genetic material is then mixed with materials, including some derived from the coronavirus itself, that are known as reagents. The entire solution is then placed into a testing machine about the size of a toaster. If a patient's specimen contains coronavirus, then the virus's genetic material will be amplified, and the machine will return a positive result. And if the specimen has no coronavirus, there will be a negative result. The whole process generally can be measured in days, though the time to get a result is shorter if hospitals or clinics have test kits in-house.Why is this test important?The PCR test is the most widespread and most accurate diagnostic test for determining whether someone is currently infected with coronavirus. In the United States, nearly 1 million people have tested positive for coronavirus using this PCR test.Health officials have consistently said that testing is needed to understand where the virus is spreading -- and how to stop it.People who test positive for the virus can quarantine and isolate themselves and keep it from spreading to others. This is particularly important with Covid-19 because some infected people have no symptoms and, without a positive test, do not even know they are spreading the virus.What are the holdups?First, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's initial rollout of the PCR test was fraught with problems that delayed the US's early response. That issue has since been fixed but led to a delay in testing early on.Now, the primary holdup is simply one of supply and demand.The PCR test requires specialized supplies, expensive instruments, and the expertise of trained lab technicians. Because of the sudden mass demand for these tests and corresponding issues in the supply chain, there have been shortages at almost every step of the process, including of swabs and reagents.\"We all want all these things,\" said Dr. April Abbott, the director of microbiology for Deaconess Health System in Indiana. \"Just managing that has been an extreme struggle.\"Abbott said that as time has gone on, it has been easier for her hospital system to get swabs and reagents. Overall, though, the PCR test requires expertise and specialized supplies in a way that makes it difficult to ramp up production so immediately, especially as the federal government has pushed responsibility onto individual states.\"This comes down to a large logistical problem,\" said Dr. Donald Thea, professor of global health at Boston University. \"Large logistical problems are best dealt with by organizations used to dealing with large logistical problems,\" such as the federal government.Antibody testsWhat are they? Antibody tests, also known as serology tests, do not detect the virus itself. Instead, they detect whether someone has the antibodies in their immune system to fight off the novel coronavirus. People develop antibodies when their body fights off the virus.How do they work?Antibody tests are performed on a blood specimen. This can be from a finger prick or taken from a vein. The majority of antibody tests then require a trained expert to examine that blood specimen for antibodies specifically targeted to coronavirus.Our bloodstream has a library of antibodies against various viral, bacterial and fungal infections that we've had over our lifetimes, said CNN Medical Analyst Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease specialist. The goal of this test is to find the antibody that specifically applies to the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19.However, there are seven different coronaviruses that cause illness in humans, including several that cause mild symptoms like the common cold. Our antibodies for each coronavirus appear similar, so deciphering between the common cold antibody and the Covid-19 antibody is a real challenge scientifically, Sepkowitz said.Why is this test important?Antibody tests are generally not used for diagnosis but to give a sense of how widely the virus has spread in a population. Given that PCR testing was in short supply in the early weeks of the coronavirus outbreak, wider antibody testing would help us know how many people recovered from coronavirus, possibly without even knowing they were infected.In addition, most experts believe that people who have recovered from the virus will have some sort of protection against reinfection, so antibody testing could be used to decide who is immune to the virus and who may be able to return to work without fear of infection.However, because the virus is still so new, it's unclear how strong that immunity might be or how long it might last. \"We expect that most people who are infected with #COVID19 will develop an antibody response that will provide some level of protection,\" the World Health Organization wrote in a series of tweets Saturday.\"What we don't yet know is the level of protection or how long it will last. We are working with scientists around the world to better understand the body's response to #COVID19 infection. So far, no studies have answered these important questions.\"What are the holdups?The primary issue with antibody testing is the question of accuracy. It's not yet clear if these tests are consistently correct.In March, the Food and Drug Administration issued a policy to allow developers of antibody tests to go to market without prior FDA review if they met certain conditions. The FDA also has authorized eight antibody tests under an Emergency Use Authorization, which means the FDA has not validated the accuracy of the tests.This has led to a glut of unreliable tests and uncertainty among health officials tasked with getting them.\"That rigorous level of study just hasn't happened with the majority of antibody tests that are available,\" Abbott said.Inaccurate results could also have deadly consequences. A false positive on an antibody test could lead someone to think they are immune to the virus, which could be more dangerous than no result at all.\"We really don't want to purchase something that may give inaccurate information,\" Abbott said. \"It would be worse to give results that would be inaccurate. We want to make sure that we're very confident in the results we're giving.\"Antigen testsWhat are they?Antigen tests are a quick and easy way to look for a specific antigen -- a term for any foreign substance, like a virus or bacteria. Antigen tests for flu or strep throat, for example, can be done in a doctor's office without expensive equipment and give results in minutes.There is not yet a reliable antigen test for the novel coronavirus, but it is theoretically possible and companies are working to make one.How do they work? Think of an at-home pregnancy test. In a coronavirus antigen test, you put a bodily sample such as a throat swab onto a specially treated strip, which then uses a color or marker to say whether the novel coronavirus is present. The antigen test works by looking for a unique part of the novel coronavirus, such as a specific protein on one of its namesake \"corona\" spikes. If that specific protein is present in detectable quantities, then the test returns a positive result.Why is this test important?Antigen testing could provide immediate answers to whether someone is infected with coronavirus and could in theory be mass produced for home use.These likely would not replace PCR tests, which are the most reliable, but they would be a good first step. The WHO said these \"could potentially be used as triage tests to rapidly identify patients who are very likely to have COVID-19, reducing or eliminating the need for expensive molecular confirmatory testing.\"Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said the US will need a breakthrough in antigen tests to increase testing to sufficient levels.\"There will never be the ability on a nucleic acid test to do 300 million tests a day or to test everybody before they go to work or to school,\" Birx said earlier this month. \"But there might be with the antigen test.\"What are the holdups?So far, antigen tests for coronavirus don't work consistently. Based on similar antigen tests for respiratory diseases like the flu, their sensitivity -- the ability to correctly identify patients with Covid-19 -- ranges between 34% and 80%, according to WHO.\"Based on this information, half or more of COVID-19 infected patients might be missed by such tests, depending on the group of patients tested,\" the agency said.Designing the tests can be challenging, according to Gigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\"Sometimes viruses may have special folds, or protein modifications on their surface, which can interfere with the process,\" Gronvall said. In addition, while PCR tests amplify the virus's genetic material to detect even small amounts, antigen tests may need a larger amount of virus.\"And then, on top of the design part, you need to have enough of the virus in you to test positive,\" she added.Because of these ongoing scientific issues, the antigen test is promising but remains several steps away, according to Sepkowitz.\"Right now, it's pie in the sky,\" he said.\n\nCNN's Mallory Simon and Gina Yu contributed to this report.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN)Go for a walk, visit any open establishment or public space, and you will note a disconcerting phenomenon: People without masks.\n\nThere is a pandemic. Tens of thousands of Americans are dead because of Covid-19, a disease that spreads in droplets that are expelled by infected humans, including as they talk or cough, and whether they show symptoms or not. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone wear a cloth face covering in public, especially where there is a high degree of community-based transmission (that is, when the source of infection is unknown). I live in California, where nearly 60,000 people have been infected. Across the country 1.2 million Americans have tested positive for Covid-19, with more than 73,000 lives lost-- and projections for the future (another peak in the fall?) are really grim. Meanwhile, hospitals and their staff are pushed to the breaking point caring for the sick, with medical staff working weeks without days off to treat the afflicted, risking their own lives and those of their family. And yet, so many people refuse to take warnings seriously to protect themselves and others by wearing a mask in public. It's hard to pinpoint how many of us are clueless and careless -- maybe half of those who go outside? A third? Some other fraction? -- but it's certainly way too many. Read MoreThe lack of empathy is jarring. We need a shift. We need our leaders -- all of them -- to get the message out loud and clear. If you are away from the closed system of your home, the message should say, you must wear a mask. That means, too, employers mandating that workers of all kinds mask up. Do they want the disease spread to subside; do they want business and the economy to eventually come back -- or don't they?Masks of any kind are not perfect barriers for contagion. Wearing one doesn't offer full protection and shouldn't be thought of as a foolproof, safe way to interact. But experts report that wearing a mask does help protect against transmission by asymptomatic carriers. And note that data show -- according to, among others, Robert Redfield, President Donald Trump's CDC director -- that likely one in four people infected with Covid-19 are indeed asymptomatic and unaware of their contagion. Be prudent, be kind. One can think the government's response to the virus is an overreaction and still wear a mask, just in case you might make someone sick. That's reality.Wearing a mask is cumbersome. It's hot, and it's uncomfortable. But it can save lives and ease the burden on those doctors and nurses facing unspeakable pain and suffering on the front lines. Making personal sacrifices for the public good has not always been an American priority. We are an individualistic culture, and by nature we may find it more difficult to empathize with others when our own freedom and liberties feel like they are on the line. There is resistance to allowing the government or anyone else step in and require -- or even strongly urge -- Americans to cover their faces. But surely we can all understand that sometimes regulations are in place to protect people from themselves, or to avoid suffering of the community. We require drivers to wear seat belts to protect the passengers and minimize the potential for serious injury. (Those injuries not only affect the driver, but also the emergency room workers and even taxpayers through disability and unemployment.) Laws require children to have vaccines, not only for the child's sake but to maintain herd immunity for all of us. We don't have a vaccine for Covid-19. But we can all help until we do: we DO know about masks.Back in the early 1990s, I was a social work intern in the HIV/AIDS unit at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York City. AIDS was still a death sentence, and every worker and visitor took \"universal precautions\" to avoid transmission with all patients. The prevailing wisdom then and now is that when it's impossible to assess by looking if someone could be infected, wear gloves and masks. We protected ourselves. Yes, wearing gloves was uncomfortable. So was getting HIV.Where are our universal precautions for Covid-19?Wearing a mask in public is an act of respect for your fellow humans. This is the kind of empathy I try to teach my children. Our kids are watching the adults through this pandemic, and they are learning lots of lessons -- intended and unintended. I want my children to understand that being mildly inconvenienced for the greater good is not only right, it's a moral imperative. It's how we manage to live together in relative safety in our society.It's a no brainer. Wear the damn mask.",

Wednesday, the county reported 379 total cases.In a statement, Tyson told CNN the plant, which is the company's largest pork plant, had already \"been running at reduced levels of production due to worker absenteeism.\" \"Despite our continued efforts to keep our people safe while fulfilling our critical role of feeding American families, the combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns has resulted in our decision to stop production,\" said Tyson Fresh Meats Group President Steve Stouffer in the statement. He said protecting team members is the company's \"top priority.\" CNN spoke to three employees who work in the facility but did not want to be named for fear of losing their jobs. They describe conditions and priorities that are at odds with statements given by Tyson and the state's governor, Kim Reynolds, who said they were taking care of their employees. Read More\"You know what's heading this way,\" one plant employee, a cut floor worker, explained to CNN. \"Why wait? Why wait 'til it's too late?\" The cut floor worker said he's grateful to local officials for continuing to pressure the company to shutter the factory, but he took umbrage with the reasons Tyson offered for doing so. \"Complaining about worker absenteeism as workers have died is even more distasteful than their claim workers are their first priority,\" he told CNN on Wednesday. Local officials said they are relieved but still deeply concerned. \"This will relieve future issues with our outbreak and slow the spread now (hopefully),\" said Black Hawk County Sheriff Tony Thompson. However, Thompson -- who, as the chairman of the emergency management commission, oversees the county's coronavirus response -- also said the move is \"a little too late for our deaths and the hundreds already infected.\" \"The damage is done,\" Thomspon said Tuesday night, before the closure was announced. \"The cows are out of the barn, they're down the road, we can't get them back. We can't fix it. All we can do is react to the problems they've created for us. \" Tyson said that \"for the privacy of our team members we are not disclosing numbers of confirmed cases in our facilities.\"Waterloo Mayor Quentin Hart told CNN the plant should have been closed sooner. \"Implementing safety precautions at this particular point, we believe it's too late,\" he said Wednesday. \"At this point closing, cleaning, testing people is the best scenario moving forward. And I understand the impact that this has on our national food chain, but in order to be able to stop the spread, this was the best course of action to support the workers that prepare our food.\" Reynolds made no mention of the plant's closure in her daily news conference remarks Wednesday but broadly defended her actions. \"There's always more we could have done, but I think we've tried to be very proactive,\" Reynolds said.According to the statement from Tyson Foods, \"affected Waterloo team members will continue to be compensated while the plant is closed. The timing of resumption of operations will depend on a variety of factors, including the outcome of team member testing for COVID-19.\"'I'm not going to risk their lives to cut some damn hogs up'Plant employees, like the ones CNN spoke with, have been deemed essential employees as they help keep the nation's food supply chain intact. While they understand the importance of maintaining that supply chain, the pork processing plant employees expressed ongoing concerns that not enough was done to protect them from Covid-19. \"I hear the argument of, we've got to keep the food supply chain open,\" the cut floor worker said, but \"with all these tests coming back, if the numbers get up there, it warrants a shutdown.\"Several other meat processing plants across the country, including a Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and a JBS meat processing plant in Worthington, Minnesota, have closed temporarily after suspected outbreaks were reported. \"I want my job, but I want a safe job,\" another employee told CNN. \"I got family and grandkids that I love, and I'm not going to risk their lives to cut some damn hogs up.\"Donald, who requested CNN use only his first name, is a longtime Tyson employee. He said he tested positive for Covid-19 nearly two weeks ago and has been recuperating at home from the virus. Donald said he's frustrated that Tyson didn't shut down sooner. He said he knew several of the team members who have died as a result of complications of the virus.\"Tyson owes a lot of people an apology,\" Donald told CNN. \"I love working with Tyson, but as I see it, Tyson has no morals for me (or) for my life. If they did, they would have shut it down, and I wouldn't be infected with this virus right now.\" He tells CNN that practicing social distancing in the meat processing facility wasn't happening and was nearly impossible to put into practice. \"I work about two feet from my coworkers,\" Donald said. \"I'm about an arm's length away from my partner. It's close.\"CNN repeatedly asked Tyson for comment on the claims made by employees in this article. Tyson addressed some of the concerns over availability of personal protective equipment (PPE), social distancing at the plants and case notification.In a statement provided to CNN on Friday, the company said, \"plant production areas are sanitized daily to ensure food safety, and we have significantly stepped up deep cleaning and sanitizing of our facilities, especially in employee breakrooms, locker rooms and other areas to protect our team members.\"However, it is unclear when some of the sanitizing and cleaning measures were actually implemented. The cut floor worker told CNN he saw contractors taking measurements for partitions on the slaughter line Friday. Other partitions, such as those in the cafeteria, have been in place \"a little more than a week,\" they said.Tyson also implemented a system several weeks ago to check the temperatures of all employees entering the Waterloo facility, using infrared technology to scan their faces as they arrive to work. \"I don't think Tyson gives two sh*ts about their employees. I really don't,\" Thompson told CNN.\"All they talked about was production, production, production, production. That's all they talked about,\" Thompson said of his conversations with the company officials. He visited the plant with county health officials April 11, after he said some employees had already tested positive for the virus and painted a picture similar to what employees told CNN. There are \"2,700 employees, three shifts, and they only cleaned it once a day. This is after they knew that they already had positive tests coming out of that plant,\" Thompson told CNN. \"There was no enforcement of PPE, there was no requirement. In fact, some people we saw walking around actually had masks, but they were wearing them around their neck,\" he said. \"I was surprised by the lack of measures, but I was further surprised by what they thought they were doing right,\" he said. \"It was so bad that we all walked out of there saying, 'Oh my God, these people just blew up our defensive line. We are so in trouble,'\" he added.Tyson did not address Thompson's comments. Tyson said it installed plastic or plexiglass dividers along the cafeteria tables where employees eat lunch. Two employees said the cafeteria dividers probably helped to an extent, but they stressed that the cafeteria is always very crowded. Most of the time, employees were still sitting shoulder to shoulder with their colleagues as they ate.The employees said other crowded areas, such as the locker rooms and hallways, were not being modified in any way to promote social distancing. \"We're all extremely congested, especially at the shift exchange in the locker room,\" a third Tyson employee told CNN. She is a production line worker. Tyson said that it is \"selecting team members to serve as social distancing monitors at our facilities\" to make sure proper social distancing practices are in use.No tests, no masksAll three Tyson employees told CNN they're frustrated at a lack of transparency from the company about the number of infections in the plant. The cut floor worker said it's been hard to learn which coworkers have tested positive for the virus and multiple employees told CNN they've had to rely on word-of-mouth or social media posts to find out who has the virus. Tyson told CNN on Wednesday that \"we notify anyone who has been in close contact with\" a person confirmed to have Covid-19 as part of its protocol.The production line worker said she started calling out from work after hearing that colleagues who work near her in the plant tested positive for coronavirus. She said she's staying home to protect her children. The production line worker said she tried to get tested Monday but was denied a test by the local testing site where she was instructed to go.\"They told me if I don't have any symptoms, they won't test me,\" she said. Another member of her household was showing symptoms of the virus, she said, and he was able to get a test. Gov. Reynolds announced last week that 2,700 testing kits would be sent to the Waterloo Tyson plant to test workers.Tyson said Wednesday its workforce \"will be invited to come to the plant later this week for COVID-19 testing.\" Reynolds said Wednesday that the state of Iowa would be testing all Waterloo Tyson employees starting Friday. Tyson employees said they had to scramble to procure their own masks after the company started phasing in guidelines asking employees to wear them. Employees said Tyson began mandating the masks April 7, but the company did not supply them to employees on a regular basis.Donald said the plant's nurse's office put up a sign saying there were no masks available. He said he purchased one himself, which he would clean with bleach, dry and wear the next day. The production line worker said the company provided bandanas at one point, but she said her colleagues who utilized them complained they were cheaply made and started fraying right away. She said a family member sewed her a mask instead. When asked about these allegations, Tyson said it \"recently made the decision to provide and require the use of surgical-style face coverings in our facilities\" but noted that \"previously\" they simply required everyone to wear a face covering. \"I feel like she's favoring the animals more than us' Iowa's governor has regularly stressed the important role Iowa plays in the nation's food chain, citing statistics that say Iowa provides a third of the nation's pork products. She says if plants such as Waterloo are forced to shut down, it will disrupt that supply chain. \"If we aren't able to move (the hogs) through the process, at some point, we're going to have to be talking about euthanizing hogs, and we're not that far from it,\" Reynolds said Monday. \"It will be devastating.\"The third employee said she found this argument insulting. \"I feel like she's favoring the animals more than us,\" the employee said. \"I don't see why they wouldn't be able to keep them there (at Tyson) at least a week, so they could clean the plant.\" Reynolds has been hesitant to take action in Waterloo and made it clear she was not eager to take drastic measures. \"Our goal is to hope that we don't (shut down the Waterloo plant),\" she said last Friday. \"We haven't felt, as a state health department, that there is a need to issue a closure order,\" Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) Deputy Director Sarah Reisetter said the same day. Over the past few days, Reynolds regularly referenced positive conversations with company leadership as justification to keep the plant open. Reynolds noted she spoke with members of the Waterloo human resources team last Thursday and the Tyson CEO on Monday. \"We're going to continue to work with the plants and be proactive,\" Reynolds said Monday. Reynolds explained Monday that because Tyson has been \"complying\" with infection control measures, \"I don't believe it's going to take an executive order at this time.\" \"They are critical infrastructure and it's essential that we do everything we can to protect the workforce while keeping these processing plants up and going,\" Reynolds said last Friday. CNN reached out to Reynolds' office for comment but did not immediately hear back. The damage is doneDemands for the plant's closure came from officials in Black Hawk County and across the state for days before the shutdown. Eighteen local and state elected officials, including mayors, state representatives and state senators, wrote a letter to Tyson Foods on Thursday asking it to voluntarily close down the plant.The Black Hawk County Board of Health passed a proclamation Tuesday urging Reynolds and Tyson Foods to temporarily close the plant to allow for a deep cleaning and so that all of its employees could be tested. Mayor Hart noted Wednesday the plant employs a diverse workforce, and many don't have the luxury of working from home. He also suggests the damage is already done. \"So many people from different walks of life, and immigrants that provide the critical service to help prepare food for the entire country,\" Hart said.He said he felt as though his pleas for action had fallen on deaf ears. \"This is not a political issue. It's not a Republican. It's not a Democrat. This is a humanitarian issue and we needed proactive steps to be able to squash this threat.\"",

    "Wuhan was on lockdown for 76 days. Now life is returning  --  slowly": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "For more than two months, the city of Wuhan, China, was sealed off from the outside world.\n\nFlights in and out were canceled. Train and bus routes were suspended. Highway entrances were blocked. The streets were empty, and people were ordered to stay in their homes as part of an unprecedented effort to contain the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"People are visiting parks, markets, malls. On the roads there are many cars,\" said Hector Retamal, a photojournalist with Agence France-Presse. \"I have seen people who go swimming in the Yangtze River, other people dancing in a park. No big crowds yet, but step by step the life is returning to the city.\"\n\nThe tough measures that were put in place -- most people couldn't even go grocery shopping or bury their dead -- seem to have worked. New coronavirus cases, which used to number in the thousands each day, have slowed to a trickle.\n\nBut despite the enormous progress, many Wuhan residents remain hesitant.\n\nThere are more people out and about, but it's still a far cry from the scenes that Retamal remembers from last September, when he was in the city covering a tennis tournament and World Cup basketball games.\n\n\"I have visited some shopping malls,\" Retamal said, \"but very few people go there. ... For several nights I went to see the night scene, and no clubs are open. I only saw a few small bars waiting for the public. They were empty. People come home early, and I see few people on the street at night.\"\n\nPerhaps it shouldn't be surprising when you consider how much Wuhan has suffered over the past few months.\n\n\"I still see the fear in people who timidly return to the streets,\" said Retamal, who has been based in China for a year. \"Sometimes when I try to get closer to them, they take a step back. I understand them. They are afraid of contagion, especially now that contagions come from other countries.\n\n\"But when I see the people of this city returning to the streets, I see hope.\"\n\nWuhan is reopened, but there are still restrictions.\n\nTo get around to many places, residents are required to show a government-assigned QR code on their cell phone. A green QR code means they are healthy and safe to travel.\n\nThis system is being used in many cities across China, and the results are based on a questionnaire that people must fill out on their phone. If they've reported any possible symptoms of the coronavirus, or if they have been in close contact with someone who is sick, they could be given an amber or red code that restricts them from using the subway, going to a restaurant or going to work.\n\nWuhan residents are able to go back to work if they have a green QR code and a letter issued by their employer.\n\nMany businesses in the city have reopened, including the \"wet markets\" where the virus is thought to have originated. These markets are where wild animals are slaughtered and sold.\n\n\"These markets are the cheapest points of sale and are in the middle of the neighborhoods,\" Retamal said.\n\nRetamal traveled to Wuhan when the lockdown first started on January 23, and it was a surreal experience.\n\n\"The first thing I remember was my trip on the train,\" he said. \"Two people asked me if I was going to Wuhan, and when I answered yes, they asked me to return to Shanghai. They told me that it was very dangerous, that I shouldn't go. I tried to explain what my job is, but they kept insisting.\"\n\nWhen he got to the train station, almost no one got off with him. The station was empty, and those who were still there looked disoriented. There were no taxis.\n\n\"Wuhan looked like a ghost town and it was amazing to see this in a city that has 11 million inhabitants,\" he said.\n\nRetamal and his AFP colleagues spent eight days in Wuhan covering the lockdown in January.\n\nHe was struck by how open people were. Their fear was palpable.\n\n\"People took my arm to take me inside the hospital because they wanted to show me what was happening,\" he said. \"I never expected people to do that here, as they are always very reserved. But the situation was really different. People in hospitals were distressed and wanted to show me to the patients and the long lines at the Red Cross Hospital.\"\n\nRetamal and the rest of the AFP crew were eventually pulled out of Wuhan as part of French evacuations. They were quarantined at a resort in Marseille, France.\n\nRetamal returned to Wuhan this month. People seemed relieved that the lockdown was over, but there wasn't a great outpouring of emotion -- except for one notable scene at the airport.\n\n\"The local authorities organized a farewell ceremony to the medical teams that specially came to Wuhan to reinforce the hospitals. The local staff hugged the medical workers strongly to say bye, and they cried,\" he said. \"It was a very emotional moment that showed the positive side of this tragedy, which is the generosity and bravery of people to help others.\"",
