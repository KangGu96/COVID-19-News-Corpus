        "body": "Testing for the coronavirus in the United States has been widely disparaged by experts across fields as inconsistent, insufficient and wholly disastrous -- sentiments that Mr. Zeldin's comments don't reflect.\n\nTurnaround times for results continue to stretch past a week in many parts of the country; supply shortages have hamstrung laboratories trying to process thousands of patient samples each day. Many diagnostic tests for the coronavirus are now approved for emergency use by the Food and Drug Administration. But many of the companies that manufacture them are limited by production lines that were built for much more modest demand, and are struggling to ramp up.\n\nWhat's more, guidance from the government on testing priorities has fluctuated and even reversed. Just this week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its recommendations on testing for people without symptoms, even those who have recently been exposed to known coronavirus cases. Federal officials said pressure to make the change came from higher-ups in Washington at the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services.",

        "body": "A plan would set aside money at birth for children in most families, giving them a financial lift when they reach 18 and enter adulthood.\n\nMost children born in New Jersey would be entitled to a $1,000 state-financed nest egg under a proposal that Gov. Philip D. Murphy is set to announce on Tuesday in a bid to narrow a widening wealth gap.\n\nThe idea to give out the so-called baby bonds is a scaled-down version of legislation introduced by Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, to help address a disparity that, on average, has left white families in the United States seven times wealthier than their Black counterparts.\n\nThe New Jersey initiative, which Mr. Murphy's aides believe is the first state effort of its kind, would cost an estimated $80 million a year and would require legislative approval. The $1,000 allocation, payable with interest when a child turns 18, is included in the amended state budget that Mr. Murphy is scheduled to release on Tuesday.\n\nMr. Murphy, a Democrat, said the move would be a small but tangible step toward confronting inequities that have been brought into particularly stark relief by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected Black and Latino people, who have died and lost jobs at far higher rates.\n\n\"The inequities are too wide, too raw, to ignore,\" Mr. Murphy said in an interview.\n\nThe initiative would apply to children born into families earning less than about $131,000 a year, or 500 percent of the federal poverty level -- about 70 percent of all New Jersey residents, an aide to Mr. Murphy said.\n\nAt an average rate of growth equivalent to Monday's 30-year bond rate of 1.35 percent, the investment would be worth about $1,270 after 18 years.\n\nThe legislation introduced by Mr. Booker and Representative Ayanna Pressley, Democrat of Massachusetts, would add more money to a child's account each year, creating a fund of about $46,000 for children born into the poorest families.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T07:27:39.143Z A judge struck down a state order requiring most Florida schools to open for in-person instruction. The F.D.A. 'grossly misrepresented' plasma data, scientists say. At the Republican National Convention, Trump and his allies engage in revisionism on the virus. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe idea of creating such nest eggs has been discussed at least as far back as 2007, when Hillary Clinton, during her first presidential campaign, proposed setting aside $5,000 at birth to be used to pay for college or buy a house.\n\n\"The source of inequality generally is that some young adults have capital and others do not,\" said Darrick Hamilton, a professor of economics and urban policy who will begin teaching at The New School in New York City next month. \"The difference between a renter and a homeowner is a down payment.\"\n\n\"This is saying: Irrespective to the family you are born into, that you have a birthright to capital when you become an adult,\" Professor Hamilton added.\n\nThe gap in wealth between the richest Americans and the middle class has grown rapidly in the last 50 years.\n\nThe financial disparities between white and Black people are also glaring. The median wealth for white families is about $171,000, compared with just $17,600 for Black families. Much of that wealth is passed down from one generation to the next.\n\nMr. Booker applauded the governor's proposal, saying it could be an \"igniter of dreams.\"\n\n\"It immediately gives kids a stake in expanding their imagination about what's possible for them,\" the senator added.\n\nMr. Murphy said it was possible for more money to be added to each child's state account in the future.\n\n\"We happily reserve the right to top it off with more money,\" the governor said. \"This is the start.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome -- which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet -- and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don't show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms. More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe money could not be touched until a child turned 18, and then could be used only to pay for certain expenses, including college tuition or buying a home.\n\nThe expected announcement of the initiative comes just over a month after Mr. Murphy persuaded the State Legislature to approve nearly $10 billion in bond debt to cover the extraordinary costs created by the pandemic and a related drop in tax revenue.\n\nSome critics questioned New Jersey's ability to afford the program, while others noted that it would not yield benefits until long after many lawmakers had retired.\n\n\"I'm willing to discuss any proposal,\" said Assemblyman Jon M. Bramnick, the Republican minority leader. But, he added, \"I'm not sure the Democrats or Phil Murphy ever look at both sides of the balance sheet.\"\n\nMr. Murphy, who has repeatedly sought to introduce a so-called millionaire's tax, said the baby-bond initiative would be coupled with unspecified cuts to the $40.9 billion budget he originally proposed.\n\nNew Jersey's fiscal year typically runs from July 1 to June 30, but the pandemic caused officials to extend the current fiscal year until Sept. 30; in July, lawmakers passed a three-month stopgap spending plan that included about $4 billion in cuts. Mr. Murphy and the Legislature, which Democrats control, must finalize the budget before the new fiscal year starts on Oct. 1.\n\nThe governor said he believed the baby-bond effort was worth the cost, even at a time when the state is financially strapped.\n\n\"This is one of those moments,\" he said, \"where we've got to see beyond what's in front of us.\"",

        "body": "Kristina Mladenovic was so close to a dominant victory. After it fell apart, she said that the restrictions she faced because of another player's positive virus test had taken a toll.\n\nConfined to her hotel room at the United States Open except for practices and matches, French tennis star Kristina Mladenovic could find no refuge on the court on Wednesday.\n\nShe was seemingly in total command of her second-round match against Varvara Gracheva, a 20-year-old from Russia playing in her first Grand Slam singles tournament.\n\nMladenovic, the No. 30 seed, was tantalizingly close to a dominant victory. She led 6-1, 5-1 and 15-0 on her own serve before Gracheva came back to win the game. In the next, Gracheva fell behind 0-40 but saved four match points to hold serve.\n\nThe comeback was underway -- although it looked much more like a collapse -- as Gracheva went on to win 1-6, 7-6 (2), 6-0 with Mladenovic struggling to keep her composure and her shots in play during the final set.\n\nAfter winning 11 of the first 13 games in the match, she ended up losing 12 of the last 13, one of the most dramatic turnabouts in U.S. Open history.\n\n\"It's a nightmare what we are experiencing here,\" Mladenovic said in French, fighting back tears. \"I have only one desire, and that's to get my freedom back and even that we don't have yet.\"\n\nMladenovic is one of a group of players who have faced tighter restrictions and more frequent coronavirus testing after tournament health officials determined that they had close contact with Benoit Paire, a French men's player who tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday.\n\nMladenovic, who has repeatedly tested negative for the virus, said she had one practice session with Paire in New York, but what caught the attention of contact tracers was a game of cards she played with Paire and others in the lobby of the main hotel where players are staying on Long Island.\n\nMladenovic has said the game lasted less than an hour and that she was wearing a mask.\n\nPaire, who was withdrawn from the tournament and confined to his hotel room, said on social media on Wednesday that he has since tested negative for the virus.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T22:11:38.520Z The C.D.C. tells health officials to be ready to distribute a vaccine by November, raising concerns over politicized timing. The University of South Carolina reports that more than 1,000 students currently have the virus. There has been virus fallout from the Sturgis motorcycle rally: A death in Minnesota, cases in South Dakota and more. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"If I had known that playing cards for 40 minutes with a mask with a player who tested positive and ultimately negative would have these consequences, I would never have set foot in this tournament,\" Mladenovic said.\n\nChris Widmaier, a spokesman for the United States Tennis Association, said a negative test coming after a positive test does not change the requirement to isolate an individual.\n\n\"That's irrelevant,\" he said on Wednesday. \"In New York state, a positive test triggers isolation protocols.\"\n\nAs recently as last month, Mladenovic, who is also one of the world's best doubles players, was uncertain whether she would play in the U.S. Open. But she and many other Europeans decided to come, in part because of assurances that strict health measures were in place.\n\nBut since Sunday, Mladenovic has faced much stricter measures than the general population of players. She was required to sign a revised agreement with the U.S.T.A. in order to remain in the tournament.\n\nOthers who have had to sign the new agreement because of contact with Paire include the French men's players Adrian Mannarino, Gr\u00e9goire Barr\u00e8re, Richard Gasquet and \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin. Kirsten Flipkens and Ysaline Bonaventure, women's players from Belgium, also have reportedly been required to sign.\n\nThe new restrictions include daily tests for the coronavirus -- the Open uses widely utilized PCR tests -- and isolation from the rest of the players. Mladenovic and her group were required, for example, to take the hotel stairs with an escort instead of using the elevator.\n\nThe players were also prohibited access to all common areas at the hotel and the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, which is hosting the tournament.\n\n\"I have the impression we are prisoners or criminals,\" Mladenovic said. \"For even the slightest movement, we have to ask permission even though we are tested every day and had 37 negatives. It's abominable. The conditions are atrocious.\"\n\nMladenovic and partner Timea Babos, who reached the U.S. Open women's doubles final in 2018, are the No. 1 seeds this year and scheduled to play their opening match on Thursday.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nBut even if Mladenovic is eliminated from the doubles tournament, she and her group are, for now, required to remain in quarantine at the player hotel until Sept. 12, the final Saturday of the U.S. Open. There is the possibility that French and American authorities could permit the group of French players to depart for France by air under strictly controlled conditions before that date.\n\n\"We are fighting to have our freedom,\" Mladenovic said.\n\nMladenovic, unlike some others, at least got the opportunity to play. At last week's Western & Southern Open, a tournament played in the same controlled environment as the U.S. Open, Guido Pella of Argentina was withdrawn from the men's singles tournament and Hugo Dellien of Bolivia was withdrawn from the qualifying tournament after their fitness trainer, Juan Manuel Galv\u00e1n, tested positive for the virus in New York.\n\nNeither Pella nor Dellien tested positive, but both were required to quarantine after contact tracing determined that they had spent extensive time in Galv\u00e1n's company without wearing masks.\n\nBoth finished their quarantine period before the U.S. Open and were allowed to play singles; each player lost in the first round on Tuesday.\n\nAfter his defeat, Pella complained that there had been a double standard because the group of French and Belgian players had been allowed to play despite having had close contact with Paire.\n\n\"Imagine if you were in lockdown for two weeks, and the Benoit case was like that,\" Pella said, snapping his fingers. \"They were like, 'OK, you will have a bubble inside of the bubble, and you will be allowed to practice and play the U.S. Open.' Imagine how you would feel if that happened to you?\"\n\nWidmaier said that the same standards were applied in both instances.\n\nAs it turned out, getting the opportunity to play in the U.S. Open on Wednesday was a recipe for heartache for Mladenovic.\n\nFor nearly two sets, she was in command, her flat and powerful groundstrokes finding their marks. But her game gradually came undone as she made double faults and unforced errors in bunches and the understandably emboldened Gracheva began attacking the net and her shots with success.\n\n\"I completely fell apart,\" Mladenovic said. \"I was playing super well, but I didn't know how to finish it. I was on a tightrope.\"\n\nShe still had four match points, however.\n\n\"I would like so much to tell you all the many things that are happening here; it's abominable how they are treating us,\" she said. \"But I don't want it to be an excuse for my defeat. It's not the U.S.T.A.'s fault I didn't convert my four match points. We shouldn't get the subject and the headline wrong. I had it 6-1, 5-1.\"\n\nBut she said that during the third set, the weight of the last few days became much more of a mental burden.\n\n\"I was in distress,\" she said. \"The third set was a collapse, a total collapse.\"",

        "body": "LONDON -- Close to the rugged Atlantic coast, the Station House Hotel in the Irish town of Clifden offers well-heeled guests a stay that will \"live in your memories forever.\" But right now, that slogan seems more a threat than a promise for some of Ireland's political leaders.\n\nTwo have already resigned after an outcry over their attendance at a dinner hosted at the hotel last week and organized by the Golf Society of the country's legislature, the Oireachtas. The gathering took place a day after the government tightened coronavirus restrictions to combat a spike in infections, and has sparked a backlash that has also threatened the jobs of two other public figures.\n\nThe fallout from the private gala dinner reverberated well beyond Ireland on Monday as the future of the country's representative on the European Commission and the European Union's trade commissioner, Phil Hogan, hangs in the balance following his attendance.\n\nNow known as \"GolfGate,\" the uproar is being compared to the outcry in Britain over a breach of lockdown restrictions by Dominic Cummings, a close aide to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Though Mr. Cummings survived that episode, critics said it eroded public trust in the British government and risked undermining compliance with coronavirus rules.\n\nThe gathering of around 80 senior Irish officials in County Galway -- including some political adversaries -- also prompted criticism of the ties that bind the country's elite.\n\n\"It is the optics of a mainly male Golf Society meeting in a hotel. One law for them, and one law for the rest of us,\" said Gail McElroy, professor of political science at Trinity College Dublin. Ms. McElroy added that the scandal had stoked the anger of a population exhausted by restrictions imposed to tackle the pandemic.\n\n\"This was in the context of people having been very compliant here with the coronavirus regulations, rather more so than in many other countries, \" she said. \"Some people didn't even go to parents' or grandparents' funerals.\"\n\nThe dinner, first reported last week by The Irish Examiner, occurred the day after the Irish government imposed restrictions limiting most gatherings to six people, though there were some exemptions, and hotels were still trying to clarify how to apply the new rules.\n\nBut the dinner may have broken a more longstanding pandemic rule in Ireland that limited the size of gatherings to 50 people, though the Golf Society's defenders have argued weakly that the room was divided by a partition.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T09:45:09.221Z Flu-season testing delays could make it easier for the coronavirus to spread undetected.

He also gave up his post as deputy leader of Fianna Fail, one of Ireland's two biggest parties.\n\nThe deputy chair of the upper house of Ireland's parliament, Senator Jerry Buttimer, also quit his role.\n\nAmong the many critics of the dinner was the leader of Sinn Fein, Mary Lou McDonald. \"This isn't a country club. This is a Parliament, and we are accountable to the people,\" she told RTE, the Irish broadcaster.\n\nThe crisis was another setback for a new government that had already lost Mr. Calleary's predecessor as agriculture minister, Barry Cowen. He was forced to quit after just 12 days as a minister because of revelations over a driving incident that happened four years ago. His replacement, Mr. Calleary, lasted 37 days.\n\nA Supreme Court judge and former attorney general, Seamus Woulfe, also attended the dinner and is under pressure to resign.\n\nBut attention has focused on the future of Mr. Hogan, the trade commissioner. The prime minister, Micheal Martin, and the deputy prime minister, Leo Varadkar, have both criticized him, though so far he has resisted calls for his resignation.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome -- which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet -- and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don't show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms. More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nMr. Hogan occupies an important role in the European Commission and is engaged in sensitive trade talks with the United States, China and other nations. On Monday, his attendance at the Golf Society dinner was being considered in Brussels by Ursula von der Leyen, the Commission president.\n\nMr. Hogan issued a \"fulsome and profound apology\" on Sunday for attending the dinner. \"I acknowledge my actions have touched a nerve for the people of Ireland, something for which I am profoundly sorry,\" Mr. Hogan wrote on Twitter.\n\nHis fate will be decided by Ms. von der Leyen. It is rare, but not unknown, for a European commissioner to be forced out. In 2012, Malta's former representative, John Dalli, was forced to quit his job as a health commissioner after being accused of improper links to tobacco lobbyists.\n\nWhile there is strong political pressure in Ireland for Mr. Hogan to step down, some in Dublin think it would be in the country's best interest for him to stay.\n\nHe is well regarded in Brussels, and as trade commissioner holds an influential position that is important to Ireland, particularly after Brexit created tension with London over trade with Northern Ireland. Were he to quit, there is no guarantee of an Irish replacement.\n\n\"In the context of global scandals, it is all pretty minimal,\" Professor McElroy said of the golf club gathering. \"But it is having ramifications at the European Union level as well as domestically.\"",

        "body": "M\u00c1LAGA, Spain -- At midday on Sunday, there were 31 patients inside the main coronavirus treatment center in M\u00e1laga, the city with the fastest-rising infection rate in southern Spain. At 12:15 p.m., the 32nd arrived in an ambulance. Half an hour later came number 33.\n\nThe garbage can by the door overflowed with masks and blue surgical gloves. Relatives hovered in silence outside -- one of them in tears, another feeling a pang of d\u00e9j\u00e0-vu.\n\n\"My brother-in-law had the virus in the spring,\" said Julia Bautista, a 58-year-old retired office administrator waiting for news on Sunday of her 91-year-old father.\n\n\"Here we go again,\" she added.\n\nIf Italy was the harbinger of the first wave of Europe's coronavirus pandemic in February, Spain is the portent of its second.\n\nFrance is also surging, as are parts of Eastern Europe, and cases are ticking up in Germany, Greece, Italy and Belgium, too, but in the past week, Spain has recorded the most new cases on the continent by far -- more than 53,000. With 114 new infections per 100,000 people in that time, the virus is spreading faster in Spain than in the United States, more than twice as fast as in France, about eight times the rate in Italy and Britain, and 10 times the pace in Germany.\n\nSpain was already one of the hardest-hit countries in Europe, and now has about 440,000 cases and more than 29,000 deaths. But after one of the world's most stringent lockdowns, which did check the virus's spread, it then enjoyed one of the most rapid reopenings. The return of nightlife and group activities -- far faster than most of its European neighbors -- has contributed to the epidemic's resurgence.\n\nNow, as other Europeans mull how to restart their economies while still protecting human life, the Spanish have become an early bellwether for how a second wave might happen, how hard it might hit, and how it could be contained.\n\n\"Perhaps Spain is the canary in the coal mine,\" said Prof. Antoni Trilla, an epidemiologist at the Barcelona Institute for Global Health, a research group. \"Many countries may follow us -- but hopefully not at the same speed or with the same number of cases that we are facing.\"\n\nTo be sure, doctors and politicians are not as terrified by Spain's second wave as they were by its first. The mortality rate is roughly half the rate at the height of crisis -- falling to 6.6 percent from the 12 percent peak in May.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T09:44:08.091Z Trump's new coronavirus adviser has questioned masks and alarmed government scientists. Biden plans a speech faulting Trump over reopening schools. Australia falls into its first recession in almost 30 years. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe median age of sufferers has dropped to around 37 from 60. Asymptomatic cases account for more than 50 percent of positive results, which is partly due to a fourfold rise in testing. And the health institutions feel much better prepared.\n\n\"We have experience now,\" said Dr. Mar\u00eda del Mar V\u00e1zquez, the medical director of the hospital in M\u00e1laga where Ms. Bautista's father was being treated.\n\n\"We have a much bigger stock of equipment, we have protocols in place, we are more prepared,\" Dr. V\u00e1zquez said. \"The hospitals will be full -- but we are ready.\"\n\nYet part of the hospital is still a building site -- contractors have yet to finish a renovation of the wing of the hospital that deals with coronavirus patients. No one expected the second wave for at least another month.\n\nAnd epidemiologists aren't certain why it arrived so soon.\n\nExplanations include a rise in large family gatherings; the return of tourism in cities like M\u00e1laga; the decision to return responsibility for combating the virus to regional authorities at the end of the nationwide lockdown; and a lack of adequate housing and health care for migrants.\n\nThe surge has also been blamed on the revival of nightlife, which was reinstated earlier and with looser restrictions than in many other parts of Europe.\n\n\"We have this cultural factor related to our rich social life,\" said Ildefonso Hern\u00e1ndez-Aguado, a former director-general of public health for the Spanish government. \"People are close. They like to get to know each other.\"\n\nFor several weeks in places like M\u00e1laga, nightclubs and discos were allowed to open until as late as 5 a.m., as regional politicians attempted to revive an economy dependent on tourists and partygoers. Revelers were allowed only to dance around a table with friends, rather than mixing with strangers -- but the rules were not always observed.\n\nIn one notorious incident in early August, a performer was filmed spitting at dancers on a crowded dance floor at a beach club outside M\u00e1laga.\n\nThe venue was quickly closed, all nightclubs were ordered to shut two weeks later, and bars must now shut by 1 a.m. But critics fear the restrictions are still far too lax.\n\nAs beds continued to fill up in M\u00e1laga's hospitals this weekend, residents were still cramming into bars along certain beach fronts until well past midnight. In some bars, the tables were tightly packed together -- far closer than the current rules of two meters, or about six feet, allow.\n\nAt closing time, drinkers spilled out onto the beaches and pontoons, mostly without wearing masks. There they congregated in groups of more than 20 -- a normal sight during any other Spanish summer, but far larger than the gatherings of 10 or fewer now allowed by law.\n\nSome were teenagers who said they had recently recovered from a mild form of the virus, and who now therefore considered themselves immune. Others felt the pandemic restrictions were an overreaction.\n\n\"I don't think Covid is real,\" said Victor Berm\u00fadez, a 23-year-old shop assistant at an early morning gathering on a pontoon jutting into the Mediterranean. \"Well, yes, it's real -- but it's not as serious as they say. It's all a plan to kill the poor and boost the rich.\"\n\nDuring the lockdown, the central government set a clear agenda from Madrid. But with the lifting of the state of emergency at the end of June, certain powers were returned to each of Spain's 17 regional governments, leading to a disjointed and confused approach.\n\nWhen regions attempted to enforce restrictions on local life, some of their decisions were struck down by local judges, who argued that only the central Parliament had the power to introduce such measures.\n\n\"We don't have the legal tools that guarantee us the ability to take decisions,\" said Juan Manuel Moreno, the president of the regional government in Andalusia, the region in which M\u00e1laga lies.\n\nThe debate has also become the latest proxy for a bitter conflict over the Spanish Constitution that has been brewing for more than four decades. For federalists and Catalan separatists, for example, the debacle highlights how power was never properly devolved after the death in 1975 of the dictator Francisco Franco. For Spanish nationalists, it instead shows how the process of decentralization has already gone too far.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"There is a kind of war going on to show what kind of political system is better,\" said Nacho Calle, the editor of Maldita, a prominent fact-checking service. The decentralized approach has led to a piecemeal system of tracking and tracing potential coronavirus victims. Some regions employ several thousand trackers to trace people who might have come into contact with infected people, while other regions hired only a few dozen -- slowing the rate at which potential patients are told to enter quarantine.\n\nAnd even in regions with large numbers of trackers, like Andalusia, health workers on the ground report that the process is still too slow and understaffed in certain locations.\n\nFrancisca Morente, a nurse in a clinic west of M\u00e1laga, was one of hundreds of local nurses seconded this summer to work as a tracker because of staff shortages at her district's official tracing unit.\n\nBut even now, Ms. Morente is one of just five trackers working at her clinic -- not enough to make the hundreds of daily calls that a proper tracing service requires. And even once she manages to track down potential coronavirus patients, those patients still currently need to wait a week until their tests are processed, because of bottlenecks at local laboratories.\n\n\"We need more trackers and more resources,\" she said. \"We need a designated tracker unit in every clinic, instead of this temporary system that we have at the moment.\"\n\nA lack of institutional support for undocumented migrants has also contributed to the second wave, according to some experts. Some recent outbreaks began among foreign farmhands living in cramped communal accommodations.\n\nBarred from seeking unemployment benefits and lacking formal labor contracts, undocumented migrants cannot easily take time off work if they are sick. Nor can they afford the kinds of homes that would allow them to easily self-isolate.\n\n\"If I have to quarantine, then I cannot work,\" said Mar\u00eda Perea, a 50-year-old Colombian cleaner waiting on Monday for the results of a coronavirus test. \"And if I cannot work, then I have no money.\"\n\nBut in general, doctors say that Spain is in a far stronger position to fight the virus than it was in March.\n\nNational coordination is improving -- the central government last week agreed to a deal to deploy 2,000 soldiers as contact tracers. Testing speeds are accelerating -- in M\u00e1laga, the biggest hospital can process tests within a single morning, thanks to the recent purchase of a series of robots. Across the road, a makeshift hospital built in a rush in April stands empty, ready for a rise in cases.\n\n\"It's not like the first wave,\" said Carmen Cerezo, 38, a train attendant waiting outside the M\u00e1laga hospital while her father was tested for coronavirus inside.\n\n\"We're calmer now,\" she said.",

        "body": "Experts are revising their views on the best methods to detect infections, setting aside long-held standards so that the spread of the virus can be more quickly tracked and contained.\n\nFor months, the call for coronavirus testing has been led by one resounding refrain: To keep outbreaks under control, doctors and researchers need to deploy the most accurate tests available -- ones reliable enough to root out as many infections as possible, even in the absence of symptoms.\n\nThat's long been the dogma of infectious disease diagnostics, experts say, since it helps ensure that cases won't be missed. During this pandemic, that has meant relying heavily on PCR testing, an extremely accurate but time- and labor-intensive method that requires samples to be processed at laboratories.\n\nBut as the virus continues its rampage across the country and tests remain in short supply in many regions, researchers and public health experts have grown increasingly vocal about revising this long-held credo. The best chance to rein in the sprawling outbreaks in the United States now, experts say, requires widespread adoption of less accurate tests, as long as they're administered quickly and often enough.\n\n\"Even if you miss somebody on Day 1,\" said Omai Garner, director of clinical microbiology in the U.C.L.A. Health System. \"If you test them repeatedly, the argument is, you'll catch them the next time around.\"\n\nThis quantity-over-quality strategy has its downsides, and is contingent on an enormous supply of testing kits. But many experts believe more rapid, frequent testing would identify those who need immediate medical care -- and perhaps even pinpoint those at greatest risk of spreading the disease.\n\nSuch a considerable shift would likely be a welcome change for a country where the status quo of testing was just described as \"unacceptable, period\" by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in an interview Wednesday on CNN.\n\n\"If you had asked me this a couple months ago, I would have said we just need to be doing the PCR tests,\" said Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Southern California. \"But we are so far gone in this country. It is a catastrophe. It's kitchen sink time, even if the tests are imperfect.\"\n\nOf the dozens of coronavirus tests that have been granted emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration, most rely on complex laboratory procedures, like PCR, to detect the coronavirus's genetic material.\n\nOnly a handful are quick and simple enough to be run in what is called a point-of-care setting, like a doctor's office or urgent care clinic, without the need for lab equipment. And these tests are still relatively scarce nationwide. Government officials have pledged to astronomically scale up the number of point-of-care tests by fall, increasing by millions the weekly tally of tests conducted.\n\nBut many of the rapid tests at the center of this buzz still rely on specialized machines that are neither cheap nor easy to produce in bulk. And while some rapid tests, like the Abbott ID Now, were quickly adopted into the White House, most are unlikely to get much play in the larger community.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-06T09:13:13.908Z A dispute over Postal Service funding complicates the U.S. stimulus impasse as talks continue. After parents and teachers opposed a hybrid model, Chicago schools will reopen online only. Virginia releases the first U.S. virus-exposure app to employ software from Apple and Google. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"We can't have these in every household,\" said Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University's School of Public Health and a vocal proponent of speedy testing.\n\nA better option, Dr. Mina said, might be antigen testing, which identifies pieces of protein. Two such tests, made by BD and Quidel, have received emergency authorization from the F.D.A. Both require instruments to run, but even simpler versions of this technology could provide a fast answer in the same way as pregnancy tests, allowing users to swab their mouths or noses or spit into a tube, then read the results as colored bars on a strip of paper within minutes.\n\nThese tests could be done at a doctor's office, or even at home -- no fancy machines or specially trained personnel required -- and cost just a few dollars a pop, perhaps even less. And there would be no delays of a week or longer. Companies like the Massachusetts-based E25Bio are currently cooking up tests that might fit this need.\n\nSuch convenient setups could resolve some of the supply shortages that have plagued testing laboratories across the nation for months and caused a national embarrassment over inadequate, inaccessible testing. In many cities, people are still experiencing turnaround times of over a week, sometimes three or more -- as people did at the beginning of the U.S. epidemics -- for results from PCR-based tests, effectively rendering them useless for themselves and the people around them.\n\nHamstrung by a long delay, even an accurate test can morph into a useless one.\n\nNatalie Magnus, who got tested in Winnebago County, Ill., on July 14, still didn't have results 22 days later. Her brother and sister-in-law, who were each tested twice at separate facilities in Colorado on July 7 and July 8, have so far received only one set of results after a 17-day wait. One of them was positive for the coronavirus.\n\nMs. Magnus, who has already completed a two-week quarantine at home, no longer cares if she gets her results. \"By now, that doesn't tell me anything,\" she said.\n\nAntigen tests, on the other hand, can be low-tech and easy to manufacture en masse. Distributed weekly or even daily, they could painlessly screen people headed back into offices, schools and universities, delivering peace of mind to parents, teachers and employers. Everyone -- not just those feeling ill -- would have an easier way to assess their health status on a regular basis.\n\n\"The goal here is to detect as many infections as possible,\" said Daniel Larremore, an applied mathematician who models infectious diseases at the University of Colorado, Boulder. \"That means taking as many shots on goal as we can.\"\n\nBroad distribution of antigen tests might also ease the demand for PCR, which still has an important role in hospitals and vulnerable communities like nursing homes. As things stand, many doctors still can't get their patients' results within 24 hours.\n\nIn those settings, accuracy is crucial, said Melissa Miller, director of the Clinical Molecular Microbiology Laboratory for U.N.C. Hospitals. \"You don't want to miss that diagnosis.\"\n\nThere are drawbacks. Antigen tests will miss some people who would test positive by PCR, which amplifies coronavirus RNA and picks up even tiny amounts of it. With antigen tests, proteins can't be copied in the same way, making it easier to mistake some people who are carrying minute levels of the coronavirus in their bodies as pathogen-free. Some antigen tests used in the past miss up to half the infections they look for.\n\nEarly on, many experts balked because of these shortcomings. \"As laboratorians, we wanted the most sensitive test, the most specific test, the most accurate test,\" Dr. Miller said. \"End of story.\"\n\nBut Dr. Mina argues that false negatives might not be as bad as they seem.\n\nVirus levels vary from person to person, and can wax and wane in an individual over the course of an infection, typically peaking around the time symptoms first appear. People carrying -- and thus probably shedding -- gobs of germs will most likely turn up positive using every test on the market, Dr. Mina said. Those harboring less virus in their bodies might get more mixed results. Many of these individuals, however, probably aren't the cases of most concern.\n\nIt's another way to look at testing accuracy, Dr. Mina said: \"Detecting the most infectious people.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 4, 2020\n\nI have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.

Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nResearchers don't yet know how much virus a person needs to carry in their body to actually transmit it. But the range in which the accuracy of antigen tests starts to drop off is probably far below that level, Dr. Mina said.\n\nTesting frequency can also be a formidable foe to disease transmission. In a recent paper that has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, he and Dr. Larremore showed through mathematical models that a relatively insensitive test, rolled out twice a week, vastly outperformed a more accurate test, administered once every two weeks, in curbing the spread of disease. Other studies pitting speed against sensitivity have come to similar conclusions.\n\nThe upshot here is a practical one, Dr. Garner said. \"You're not trying to find every single person who has the virus,\" he said. \"You're trying to mitigate outbreaks.\"\n\nThat approach is a substantial departure from the way that many lab researchers have traditionally tackled infectious disease testing.\n\n\"We're in sort of a new era of testing,\" said Esther Babady, a clinical microbiologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. \"Usually we use tests to diagnose disease states in patients, not look for disease states. Now, with Covid, we are starting to look for this virus everywhere.\"\n\nA testing rethink this substantial will inevitably come with snags. The success of the speedy testing strategy hinges heavily on availability -- something the United States has utterly failed at since the virus first made landfall within its borders. Ramping up antigen testing may only add strain to an already sputtering supply chain, potentially hampering plans for widespread use.\n\n\"If you test people all the time, you can account for lack of sensitivity,\" Dr. Butler-Wu said. \"But are you really going to test people all the time? If the answer is no, then that lack of sensitivity becomes more of a big deal.\"\n\nAnd many experts are still hesitant to trust negative antigen results, which may need to be backed up with a more sensitive test. That might not be very burdensome in the midst of an outbreak, when positivity rates are likely to be high, Dr. Babady said. In spots where infection rates are especially low, however, \"that is not going to be the best approach to testing,\" she said.\n\nCheap tests also aren't the same thing as free tests. Even $1 tests can start to rack up quite a bill, especially for large families hoping to do daily checkups or nursing home aides required to get tested repeatedly. Left unregulated, the testing market could end up exacerbating the socioeconomic split that's already disproportionately burdened some sectors of the population with the worst effects of Covid-19.\n\nConcerns over accuracy bogged down the approval process for simple, speedy tests. F.D.A. guidelines stipulate that any new coronavirus test vying for emergency clearance from the agency must perform nearly as well as the gold standard of PCR.\n\nThe F.D.A.'s rules frustrate Dr. Mina, who noted that several companies on the verge of debuting antigen tests have found the regulatory hurdles daunting. \"Many of them are not even bothering,\" he said. \"'Our product might not be good enough. So what's the point?'\"\n\nThat's left the onus on the few companies who already have the F.D.A.'s green light. In hopes of encouraging a speedier, ramped up production, the governors of seven states announced this week a joint bid to purchase a total of 3.5 million antigen tests from BD and Quidel.\n\nThere probably isn't one way to grapple with all these issues -- and certainly not an obvious one, Dr. Butler-Wu said. What's clear to her and others, though, is that the current situation is untenable.\n\n\"Our backs are against the wall, and it's Hail Mary time,\" Dr. Butler-Wu said. \"We have to try something different.\"",

        "body": "RIO GRANDE CITY, Texas -- A tense rescue scene has been unfolding for weeks outside a small rural hospital on the Mexican border that has been the first line of defense against one of the most voracious coronavirus outbreaks in the country.\n\nNearly every day, a crew at Starr County Memorial Hospital prepares a patient whom its doctors are unable to help, loads the gurney into a helicopter and stands back as the aircraft roars into the country sky.\n\n\"Very, very unfortunately, of all of the patients we have transferred, none have come back alive,\" said Dr. Jose Vazquez, the health authority in Starr County, a remote section of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas that before the coronavirus outbreak did not have a single I.C.U. bed.\n\nThere was a time not long ago when the pace was a lot less frantic at Starr County Memorial, whose 45 beds were once sufficient for the roughly 65,000 people spread out along the border near Tamaulipas, Mexico. The county is dotted with tiny villages, long stretches of open road, cattle ranches and the occasional small town.\n\nOn an average day before the outbreak, a handful of doctors and nurses treated patients at the hospital for \"infections, pneumonia, heart conditions, and roughly, that's it,\" said Joseph Panlilio, one of the hospital's head nurses.\n\nBut the new wave of coronavirus infections has been as swift as it has been merciless, with more than 2,110 cases in the county and nearly 70 deaths that are suspected of being linked to Covid-19, local officials said.\n\nNearby counties in the Valley are also battling surges in infections, but Starr County lacks the medical staffing and facilities of its more populated neighbors. On a good day, about 12 full-time doctors serve the entire county.\n\n\"To say we are overwhelmed, it's an understatement,\" said Dr. Cruz Alberto Bernal, who until recently was the only doctor on duty during his shifts at the hospital.\n\nFacing an overwhelming number of cases, the hospital said in July that it would convene an ethics committee to help make difficult decisions about which patients to treat, which to medevac to better-equipped hospitals, and which to send home to die.\n\n\"The time of rationing medical care is a time that we all have feared from the beginning, but it looks like we are getting to that point now,\" Dr. Vazquez said last month.\n\nUltimately, Dr. Vazquez said in an interview later, the final decision rests with the next of kin, in a region where close-knit families may prefer to take a terminally ill patient home, rather than leave a loved one to die alone in a hospital room. \"We are not deciding who lives or dies,\" he said. \"We are not creating death panels.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-04T17:11:16.758Z N.Y.C.'s health commissioner resigns after clashing with the mayor over the virus. 'Long days, long nights': Washington prepares for a prolonged fight over virus relief. Israel's rocky reopening of its schools may be a lesson for the U.S. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nHospital officials said the community needed to understand that so small a facility could not treat everyone on its own.\n\n\"We were not built for a situation like this,\" Mr. Vera said.\n\nStarr County, one of the poorest in the nation, is not alone. A study published this week in the journal Health Affairs, warning of a stark disparity in the availability of critical care facilities in the midst of the pandemic, found that nearly half of the nation's communities with a median income of $35,000 or less had no intensive care beds at all, compared with 3 percent of the highest-income communities.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there will be a lot of unnecessary suffering and deaths from Covid-19 because of the lack of I.C.U. capacity in these low-income areas,\" said Genevieve Kanter, an assistant professor at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and one of the study's authors.\n\nAs cases climbed in Starr County and the hospital struggled, it began transporting a handful of its most severe cases by helicopter and ambulance to bigger hospitals in Lubbock, Dallas, Houston San Antonio, and even across the state line in Oklahoma.\n\nThe crush shows no signs of abating. On a recent afternoon, doctors and nurses rushed in and out of the clinic's improvised Covid-19 unit, roughly the size of one and a half tractor-trailers.\n\nIt was put together behind a makeshift wall of plywood, heavy plastic and duct tape, to separate coronavirus patients from those in the rest of the hospital.\n\nDoctors and nurses, most of them wearing several layers of protective gear, fanned themselves desperately during their rounds. Any hint of cool air sputtering from the hospital's overburdened air conditioning system was quickly overcome by the unforgiving Texas heat seeping through the walls.\n\n\"The A.C. is working,\" Dr. Bernal said. \"It's overworked, just like us.\"\n\nMost of the patients in the Covid-19 unit were older, and were grappling with pre-existing conditions including obesity, hypertension and heart conditions.\n\nRoger Garcia, 38, said his mother, Martha Ramos de Garcia, 65, had contracted the virus in late July while she was undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer.\n\nFor a while, the family held off sending her to Starr County Memorial, he said: \"We knew it was a small hospital. They don't have enough of everything.\"\n\nBut one blistering day, she was unable to breathe on her own, and a responding paramedic only needed a quick look. \"Se ve malita\" -- she looks a bit sick, he told Mr. Garcia, his words minimizing what they all knew was a grave situation. His mother died a few days later in the makeshift Covid-19 unit.\n\n\"They tried, but couldn't save her,\" Mr. Garcia said. \"It feels like a horror movie. People are dying everywhere.\"\n\nResidents are still trying to understand how the situation became so serious as suddenly as it did.\n\nThe surge was slow to arrive. After neighboring counties began reporting an explosion of infections in the spring, 21 days passed before a single case was detected in Starr County, Dr. Vazquez said.\n\nBut when the state reopened its economy in May, the virus began spreading rapidly through nearby Hidalgo and Cameron counties, fueled by poverty and chronic disease. Large family outbreaks occurred as soon as people were allowed to leave their homes freely, health officials said.\n\nFear spread through the communities along the border. \"We're in a crisis,\" said Roel Ruiz, 57, a construction worker who was strolling along the river last week wearing an N-95 face mask in the sweltering heat.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 3, 2020\n\nI'm a small-business owner.

There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Is the coronavirus airborne?The coronavirus can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. It's unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization.\n\nThe coronavirus, he said, was everywhere.\n\n\"I'm not sick. Neither is my family. But I'm afraid it's a matter of time.\"\n\nAid from the state and from the Navy has staved off some of the casualties that might otherwise have occurred, hospital officials said. Medical specialists and much-needed medical supplies and equipment -- including ventilators, oxygen support and IV pumps -- were welcomed with a huge sense of relief by the small hospital staff.\n\n\"We can use any help we can get,\" Mr. Vera said.\n\nAs is the case at most hospitals during a pandemic, visitors are not allowed. But that did not stop dozens of local residents from flocking to the hospital grounds last week, peering in at patients through the windows. They resembled Victorian suitors defying orders to stay away from a forbidden love, throwing air kisses and heart hand signs their way.\n\nInside, the doctors made their way among the roughly 30 patients in the ward -- it was filled to capacity -- walking in and out of quaint rooms adorned with country flowered curtains.\n\nDr. Bernal, who graduated from medical school three years ago, said that when he took the job at the rural hospital, he never thought he would be facing the pace of a big-city facility.\n\n\"Before the pandemic, I was signing three to four death certificates a year,\" he said. \"These days I have been signing at least six a week. And that's just me.\"\n\nA nurse wearing a face shield delivered news that the doctor had dreaded but expected -- a 72-year-old woman, already suffering from severe obesity, had succumbed to the virus moments earlier.\n\nNot far away, his colleagues were trying to save the lives of several other patients who were fading fast.\n\nMr. Panlilio, the nurse in charge, watched closely as three other nurses wrapped bandages around the knees of a woman in her 60s who was connected to a ventilator. Her treatment at the hospital, he said, had run its course.\n\n\"She needs a higher level of care than we can provide,\" he said. \"We need to open her throat and clear her airways. We simply don't have the necessary tools to do that here.\"\n\nHe ordered an air transfer to a bigger hospital in another city -- anywhere that would take her, he said.\n\nWasting no time, another nurse stabbed a phone's keypad with her finger. \"We are trying to make it happen as soon as possible,\" Mr. Panlilio said.\n\nBut there was no answer.\n\nMr. Panlilio stood and watched as his colleague tried another phone number, and another, and another.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- For Amtrak, the coronavirus pandemic has not only slashed ridership and any chances of breaking even, it has also forced its leaders to face an existential choice: act like a for-profit airline or a government-subsidized entity.\n\nSince March, ridership on the national rail agency has fallen by 95 percent and projected revenue for 2021 has declined by 50 percent. In response, Congress has bailed out the rail network with $1 billion in emergency funds.\n\nBut Amtrak's leadership says it needs more money. Otherwise, it will have to cut costs by decreasing its work force by 20 percent and curtailing service on long-distance routes that serve areas where Amtrak is often the only mode of public transportation. The rail agency receives federal funds but is independently run.\n\n\"Operating trains with very few passengers on them at all, during a time of constraint -- capital constraint, cash constraint and uncertainty around funding -- doesn't make a lot of sense,\" William J. Flynn, Amtrak's chief executive, said in an interview.\n\nRail advocates have pushed back, noting that as of July ridership on long-distance routes across the country is faring better than it is on those that were more popular before the virus hit -- including shorter routes like those in the Northeast Corridor.\n\nLong-distance ridership is down 62 percent compared with the same period last year, while ridership on those relatively shorter routes through more urban areas is down more than 80 percent, according to an analysis by industry experts.\n\nAdvocates also argue that if Amtrak drastically cuts service to long-distance routes, it will become a less reliable mode of transportation and cause the rail network to lose passengers permanently. Rail experts are urging agency leaders to focus less on profitability and more on the network's mission.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-01T19:23:08.952Z Children of color are infected and hospitalized at higher rates than white children, new research shows. Florida severs ties with Quest for taking too long to report 75,000 test results, DeSantis says. Across the globe, students are returning to the classroom. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"Not unlike the Postal Service, Amtrak is a service,\" said Jim Mathews, the president and chief executive of the Rail Passengers Association, an advocacy group. \"The objective is not profit; the objective is to serve all the communities.\"\n\nAmtrak leaders have pushed back on the notion that they plan to permanently cut service on long-distance routes in the name of profitability. They say reductions would be temporary and only in response to drastic drops in ridership because of the pandemic.\n\n\"There isn't a focus on profitability. There's a focus on proper stewardship of resources,\" said Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of Amtrak's board of directors. \"There's no realistic way that we can lose 85 percent of our passengers and just continue doing everything the same way we were doing it.\"\n\nSince Congress created Amtrak in 1970, the idea of profitability has loomed large among lawmakers who have gone back and forth with the question through legislation.\n\nIn Amtrak's founding law, Congress designated the network as a \"for profit\" organization. In 1978, lawmakers watered down the requirement, according to rail advocates, and directed the agency to operate as if it was expected to turn a profit but would not be penalized if it lost money. By 2008, lawmakers refined the requirement further and encouraged the agency to adopt a plan that \"minimizes the need for federal operating subsidies.\"\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill have continued to weigh in on the question. The House passed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure reform package in July that included language that would allow Amtrak to focus less on profits and more on providing rail service across the country. The package sits stalled in the Republican-led Senate.\n\n\"I know that you feel you have a mandate to break even,\" said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the lead sponsor of the infrastructure package. \"I intend to change that.\"\n\nIn recent years, Amtrak's board has leaned on leaders from the airline industry to help prioritize profitability on the rail network.\n\nIn 2017, Amtrak's board hired Richard Anderson, a former chief executive of Delta Air Lines, to take the reins of the agency and make it profitable and more reliable. His three-year contract expired in April. He was replaced by Mr. Flynn, a former chief executive of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, a cargo and passenger aircraft leasing company.\n\nMr. Anderson took his task from the board seriously. He embarked on a mission to trim the work force and improve shorter-haul, more trafficked routes in corridors like the Northeast, while scaling back support for longer-haul and less popular routes that run across parts of America's Southern, mountain and Western regions.\n\n\"We should be looking at breaking up some of those long-distance trains,\" Mr. Anderson said last year at a Senate hearing, \"and figuring out how we serve the American consumer to provide high-quality service in short-haul markets.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIn 2018, he decided to close an Amtrak reservation call center in California and told 500 employees they could keep their jobs if they relocated to Philadelphia in 60 days. Around 100 took the offer, according to union officials.\n\nThe same year, Mr. Anderson tried to significantly cut long-distance service along a 2,200-mile route that stretches from Chicago to Los Angeles and replace the portion from Kansas to New Mexico with bus service. Amtrak abandoned its plans after receiving fierce blowback from members of Congress.\n\nMr. Flynn has yet to testify before Congress about his vision for the rail agency, but he is prepared to cut Amtrak's operating costs by $500 million in its 2021 fiscal year, which starts in October, if Congress does not provide additional emergency funding.\n\nHis plans were met with intense skepticism from lawmakers on Capitol Hill, with 16 senators writing letters to the agency sounding the alarm at Mr. Flynn's proposed cuts to the work force and long-distance service.\n\n\"These cuts would not only dramatically reduce the utility of the nation's passenger rail network, but would also ignore congressional intent to expedite economic recovery following the pandemic,\" a bipartisan coalition of seven senators, led by Steve Daines, Republican of Montana, said in one letter.\n\nMr. Flynn has noted that service reductions to Amtrak's long-distance routes would remain in effect for the winter. Recently, his leadership released a white paper outlining the three requirements needed to restart daily service on long-distance networks, including a provision that requires every region served by a long-distance train route to see virus hospitalization rates stabilize by February.\n\nRail experts have noted concern about that measurement, saying it could significantly delay the return of regular service. They say Amtrak is a safe option for travel during the pandemic, noting its efforts to increase the frequency at which air is replaced in rail cars to once every five minutes, along with its efforts to enforce social distancing and mask wearing in ways that are more strict than airlines.\n\nBut the tension between rail advocates and the agency's leaders around the central issue of Amtrak's desire for profitability is likely to remain beyond the pandemic.\n\nMr. Flynn and his top officers have reinforced that they want to focus on expanding the rail network in areas where there are highly dense clusters of population and passengers looking for an alternative to airplanes for trips under 400 miles. Their goal is to replicate the success of the highly trafficked Northeast Corridor route that serve riders between Boston and Washington.\n\nAmtrak's chief operating officer, Stephen Gardner, notes that long-distance service accounts for only 4.5 million riders out of the network's 33 million total, and cannot be the prime focus for the agency.\n\n\"It's a small part of our business,\" he said. \"We need to be where the people are.\"",

        "body": "Vaccines are among the safest medical products in the world -- but only because of the intense rigor of the clinical trials that test their safety and effectiveness.\n\nWhen Vladimir Putin announced Tuesday that Russia had approved a coronavirus vaccine -- with no evidence from large-scale clinical trials -- vaccine experts were worried.\n\n\"I think it's really scary. It's really risky,\" said Daniel Salmon, the director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nDr. Salmon and other experts said that Russia is taking a dangerous step by jumping ahead of so-called Phase 3 trials, which can determine that the vaccine works better than a placebo and doesn't cause harm to some people who get it.\n\nUnlike experimental drugs given to the sick, vaccines are intended to be given to masses of healthy people. So they must clear a high bar of safety standards. If hundreds of millions of people get a vaccine, even a rare side effect could crop up in thousands of people.\n\nOver the course of the past century, researchers have developed increasingly powerful ways to test vaccines for safety and effectiveness. Some of those lessons were learned the hard way, when a new vaccine caused some harm. But vaccines are now among the safest medical products in the world thanks to the intense rigor of the clinical trials tracking their safety and effectiveness.\n\nThis testing typically begins before a single person has received a new vaccine, when researchers inject it into mice or monkeys to see how they respond.\n\nIf those animal studies turn out well, researchers then enlist a few dozen volunteers for a Phase 1 trial, in which all volunteers get the experimental vaccine.\n\nDoctors typically keep these volunteers under observation to make sure they don't have any immediate negative reactions, and to see whether they make antibodies against a pathogen. It's not uncommon for people to feel achiness in their muscles or even a mild fever, but these mild symptoms typically don't last long.\n\nIf Phase 1 trials do not turn up serious safety problems, then researchers usually move to a Phase 2 trial, in which they inject hundreds of people and make more detailed observations.\n\nThe first clinical trials on coronavirus vaccines started in March, and now there are 29 underway, with more to launch soon. Companies such as AstraZeneca, Moderna, Novavax and Pfizer are beginning to share optimistic early results: So far, they have only detected mild or moderate symptoms and no severe side effects. Volunteers have also produced antibodies to the coronavirus, in some cases more than are produced by people who have recovered from an infection.\n\nBut no matter how promising these early results, Phase 3 trials can fail.\n\nThe timing of Russia's announcement makes it \"very unlikely that they have sufficient data about the efficacy of the product,\" said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician and infectious disease expert at the University of Florida who has warned against rushing the vaccine-approval process. Dr. Dean noted that even vaccines that have produced promising data from early trials in humans have flopped at later stages.\n\nIn a large, randomized control trial, researchers give the vaccine or a placebo to tens of thousands of people, and wait for them to encounter the virus in the real world. \"Then you wait to see, do they get sick or not. Do they die or not?\" said Dr. Steven Black, a vaccine expert with the Task Force for Global Health.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-11T19:29:54.648Z Emerging clusters at schools and on high school teams raise concerns about wider community spread. 'It's really risky.' Russia's approval of a vaccine before it completed Phase 3 tests prompts alarm from experts. Virus cases have surpassed 20 million worldwide. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe Russian researchers have not yet begun that crucial test.\n\nIn June, the Gamaleya Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology at the Health Ministry of the Russian Federation registered a combined Phase 1 and 2 trial on a vaccine called Gam-COVID-Vac Lyo. The researchers planned to test it on 38 volunteers.\n\nThey said that the vaccine was made from an adenovirus -- a harmless cold virus -- carrying a coronavirus gene, similar to what AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson are using in their vaccines. The technology is still relatively new: The first adenovirus vaccine for any disease was approved for Ebola in June.\n\nSince then, Russian officials have claimed that they would be moving the vaccine quickly into manufacturing. Mr. Putin's announcement on Tuesday made it official. Yet the institute has never published its Phase 1 and 2 trial data.\n\nAt Mr. Putin's announcement, Russia's Minister of Health, Mikhail Murashko, declared that \"all the volunteers developed high titers of antibodies to COVID-19. At the same time, none of them had serious complications of immunization.\"\n\nThat is the sort of result you'd expect from a Phase 1 trial. It doesn't tell you if the vaccine actually works.\n\n\"This is all beyond stupid,\" said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City. \"Putin doesn't have a vaccine, he's just making a political statement.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, the Russian institute put up a website claiming that a Phase 3 trial would begin the next day involving more than 2,000 people in Russia as well as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nAll other Phase 3 trials of coronavirus vaccines currently underway are more than ten times larger than that, with 30,000 volunteers apiece.\n\nDr. Nicole Lurie, a former assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and currently an adviser at the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said the lesson that the U.S. government should draw from Mr. Putin's announcement is clear.\n\n\"This is exactly the situation that Americans expect our government to avoid,\" she said.\n\nA faster process\n\nAlong with determining whether the vaccine protects people, Phase 3 trials can reveal uncommon side effects that may not have shown up in the comparatively small number of volunteers who enrolled in the earlier phases.\n\nJust because someone gets sick or dies after getting a vaccine, however, doesn't necessarily show that the vaccine was the culprit. By comparing large groups of people who received the vaccine versus the placebo, researchers can identify unusual clusters of cases in the vaccinated participants.\n\nAlong the way, vaccine developers share these results in reports to government regulators and in peer-reviewed papers for scientific journals. Outside experts then evaluate the data from Phase 3 trials and give their recommendation to the F.D.A., which then decides whether to approve a vaccine for widespread use.\n\n\"It's not enough for me to say I have a great product,\" said Dr. Salmon. \"Before you use it, you need other people to really look at the data and be convinced that the benefits outweigh the risks.\"\n\nAnd even after a vaccine is licensed, researchers still keep an eye on it to make sure it's safe. As millions of people get a vaccine, even rarer side effects may emerge over time. It's also possible that certain groups of people, such as children or the elderly, turn out to face risks from a vaccine that weren't immediately clear from the Phase 3 trials.\n\nRegulators can then make adjustments to the vaccine -- changing the dose, for example -- to make it safer.\n\nIn July, a team of researchers at Tel Aviv University reviewed licensed vaccines in the United States over the past 20 years and concluded they were \"safe, with no important post-approval safety issues.\"\n\nPutting in safeguards slows the development of vaccines. In recent years, new outbreaks such as Ebola, SARS and pandemic flu strains have spurred vaccine makers to look for ways to speed the process without sacrificing safety.\n\nNow, in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, they're putting those ideas into practice.\n\nOne way to safely accelerate vaccine trials is for regulators to prepare in advance to analyze each batch of data, so that they can cut down the time between trials. Vaccine manufacturers have already been demonstrating to regulators that they can make coronavirus vaccines safely on an industrial scale, long before the vaccines themselves have made it through clinical trials.\n\nBut researchers are still figuring out how SARS-CoV-2, the name of the virus that causes Covid-19, makes us sick and evades the immune system.\n\nAdding to the complexity, vaccine makers are testing out just about every technology they can for a Covid-19 vaccine. Some of the experimental vaccines are based on old designs, but others have never been approved for use in humans for any disease.\n\nDr. Black and his colleagues have been working with CEPI, a nonprofit organization that is accelerating the development of vaccines, on a new set of safety procedures for some Covid-19 vaccines, including those developed by AstraZeneca, CureVac and Novavax.\n\nThe researchers have come up with a set of potential medical complications that vaccine trials should pay particular attention to. They have addressed the possibility that the vaccine could actually make people prone to worse cases of Covid-19, for example. Fortunately, the research so far shows no sign that this is happening.\n\nCEPI is coordinating the sharing of data among vaccine developers. By pooling the safety data from different vaccine developers, Dr. Black said, CEPI will be able to detect rare side effects that they might not have even considered as possible risks.\n\nAndrew Kramer and Katherine J. Wu contributed reporting.\n\nCoronavirus Vaccine Tracker\n\nA look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans.",

        "body": "For months, public health experts and federal officials have said that significantly expanding the number of coronavirus tests administered in the United States is essential to reining in the pandemic. By some estimates, several million people might need to be tested each day, including many people who don't feel sick.\n\nBut the country remains far short of that benchmark and, for the first time, the number of known tests conducted each day has fallen.\n\nReported daily tests trended downward for much of the last two weeks, essentially stalling the nation's testing response. Some 733,000 people have been tested each day this month on average, down from nearly 750,000 in July, according to the COVID Tracking Project. The seven-day test average dropped to 709,000 on Monday, the lowest in nearly a month, before ticking upward again at week's end.\n\nThe troubling trend comes after months of steady increases in testing, and may in part reflect that fewer people are seeking out tests as known cases have leveled off at more than 50,000 per day, after surging even higher this summer. But the plateau in testing may also reflect people's frustration at the prospect of long lines and delays in getting results -- as well as another fundamental problem: The nation has yet to build a robust system to test vast portions of the population, not just those seeking tests.\n\nSix months into the pandemic, testing remains a major obstacle in America's efforts to stop the coronavirus. Some of the supply shortages that caused problems earlier have eased, but even after improvements, test results in some cases are still not being returned within a day or two, hindering efforts to quickly isolate patients and trace their contacts. Now, the number of tests being given has slowed just as the nation braces for the possibility of another surge as schools reopen and cooler weather drives people indoors.\n\n\"We're clearly not doing enough,\" said Dr. Mark McClellan, the director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under former President George W. Bush.\n\nThe downward trend may turn out to be only a short-term setback: The nation reported more than 800,000 tests on Thursday and Friday. There are also limitations to the data, which is largely drawn from state health departments, some of which have recently struggled with backlogs and other issues. It may not include tests done in labs not certified by the federal government.\n\nBut according to the figures available, tests were declining in 20 states this week, and data collected by the Department of Health and Human Services showed a similar overall trend nationally.\n\nWithout a vaccine or a highly successful treatment, widespread testing is seen as a cornerstone for fighting a pandemic in which as many as 40 percent of infected people do not show symptoms and may unknowingly spread the virus. Testing a lot of people is crucial to seeing where the virus is going and identifying hot spots before they get out of hand. Experts see extensive testing as a key part of safely reopening schools, businesses and sports.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-15T07:07:04.205Z The manager of the Trump administration's new virus database refuses Senate questioning, citing a nondisclosure agreement. U.S. Postal Service warns several states of mail-in ballot delays. If you recover from the virus, you may be protected for at least three months, the C.D.C. says. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe nation's testing capacity has expanded from where it was only a few months ago, but public health experts believe it must grow far more to bring the virus under control.\n\nThe Harvard Global Health Institute has suggested the country needs at least 1 million tests per day to slow the spread of the virus, and as many as 4 million per day to get ahead of the virus and stop new cases. Some experts view that goal as too ambitious, and others say the benchmark should focus not on a particular number of tests but on the percent of people testing positive.\n\nYet there is broad consensus that the current level of testing is inadequate and that any decrease in testing is a worrisome move in the wrong direction.\n\n\"There is a reasonable disagreement about what that number ought to be, but all of them are way ahead of where we are right now,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \"There is no expert that I know of that thinks that our testing infrastructure right now meets the needs of the American people.\"\n\nAdm. Brett P. Giroir, the assistant secretary for health and the Trump administration's virus testing czar, said that conducting millions of tests per day was not realistic and defended the current testing levels as adequate. The administration has asked states to test at least 2 percent of their populations each month, or the equivalent of about 220,000 people per day nationally, which Admiral Giroir said would be enough to identify rising hot spots.\n\n\"We are doing the appropriate amount of testing now to reduce the spread, flatten the curve, save lives,\" he said this week.\n\nHe said the government was already testing large numbers of asymptomatic people, and he described an effort to strategically deploy tests, including to those who are hospitalized and in nursing homes. \"You do not beat the virus by shotgun testing everyone all the time,\" Admiral Giroir said, adding: \"Don't get hung up on a number.\"\n\nFor much of the spring and summer, the number of daily tests steadily increased. The United States averaged about 172,000 tests per day in April, before ramping up to an average of 510,000 in June and nearly 750,000 in July.\n\nThe recent dip in testing is likely a result of several factors, epidemiologists said.\n\nIt may, in part, reflect an improved outlook from earlier this summer, when parts of the Sunbelt were seeing alarming outbreaks. The number of people hospitalized with the virus each day across the country has decreased to around 45,000, down from earlier peaks of around 59,000 in April and July. And the percent of people testing positive over all is hovering at about 7 percent, down from 8.5 percent in July.\n\n\"It's an indication to me there are not as many people getting sick,\" said Nelson Wolff, the county judge in Bexar County, Texas, where a site that provides free tests for people reporting symptoms had seen a decline in demand.\n\nBut experts fear the slowing of tests may also reveal a sense of \"pandemic fatigue\" -- people who want or need to be tested but may choose not to, discouraged by stories of others waiting hours in line and waiting as long as two weeks for a result.\n\nEven if fewer people are volunteering to be tested, most experts believe testing should still be going up over all, particularly in regions where the portion of people testing positive is high. A community may be considered to have controlled virus spread if it is testing widely and the percent of people testing positive over a two-week period is less than 5 percent, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nYet testing has been dropping in a number of states with positivity rates in double digits, including Mississippi, Nevada and South Carolina.\n\nThe situation has been particularly acute in Texas, where the number of reported daily tests fell to as low as 35,000, down from a high of 67,000 in late July. The drop came as the state's percent of positive tests rose to as high as 24 percent earlier this week.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott said the state deployed a team to investigate why the positivity rate had risen so sharply. He said on Thursday that the state had more testing capacity than was being used and that he was sending thousands more tests to Houston.\n\nIn Travis County, which includes Austin, the health authority, Dr. Mark Escott, told local officials of a drop in demand. \"This is not because tests are not available,\" he said. \"It is because less individuals are signing up.\"\n\nThat dilemma reveals perhaps the biggest challenge going forward.\n\nThe country has so far relied heavily on laboratory tests, which are accurate but can take hours or days for results and are best suited for people who believe they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 12, 2020\n\nCan I travel within the United States?Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine for 14 days. Here's an ever-updating list of statewide restrictions. In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own \"pod.\" \"Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,\" the C.D.C. says. If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nTo scale up testing to a level that could keep the virus in check, experts say, the United States will need to expand other types of testing, like antigen tests, which are less accurate but can provide results in as little as 15 minutes, and other new technologies, like tests that could be done at home.\n\nSuch an approach would reduce the strain on laboratories, reserving those tests for people who need them most, while allowing the country to simultaneously screen large numbers of asymptomatic people at schools, nursing homes, offices and neighborhoods.\n\nBy some estimates, as much as $75 billion in additional federal funding may be needed. The Trump administration agreed to allocate an additional $16 billion for states to conduct testing and contact tracing, as part of a proposal Republicans unveiled late last month. But negotiations over a new coronavirus relief bill have resulted in a standoff between the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress, and only Congress can approve new aid. Lawmakers have left Washington until early September, all but guaranteeing they will not approve more funds for testing until next month.\n\nThe country is also still waiting on a larger market of tests.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has approved just two companies to sell antigen tests. One of the companies, the Quidel Corporation, says it is making 1 million tests per week. The other, Becton, Dickinson & Company, said it is ramping up testing, with the aim of manufacturing 10 million tests by the end of September.\n\nOther tests are still in development. For example, a saliva test, which has been tested on N.B.A. players and staff, is awaiting emergency approval by the F.D.A.\n\n\"We are at an inflection point,\" said Dr. Jonathan Quick, who is managing the pandemic response at the Rockefeller Foundation, which has said the nation needs to carry out about 4 million tests a day by the fall. \"That is a paradigm shift.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has at times provided inconsistent messages on testing. President Trump said in June that testing leads to more cases, which \"makes us looks bad\" but is \"good to have.\" He repeated the idea in an interview with Axios in late July, saying, \"There are those that say you can test too much.\"\n\nMembers of his administration have repeatedly stressed the importance of testing. The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, has said more testing of asymptomatic people is needed. \"We're going to be doing more testing, not less,\" he told Congress in June.\n\nOther top officials have also talked about expanding testing. Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the Trump administration's coronavirus coordinator, has said that pooling tests together to assess multiple samples at once could expand capacity to as many as 5 million tests per day.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said in a report to Congress that its aim was for the country to have the capacity to perform 40 million to 50 million tests each month by September, an average of about 1.3 million to 1.6 million tests a day.\n\nAdmiral Giroir, the testing chief, said the country was on pace to surpass that number by the fall, with the majority being new tests to screen people. But he said the figure was only a goal for capacity, and that fewer tests might ultimately be carried out.\n\nMitch Smith and Emily Cochrane contributed reporting.",

        "body": "KILLEEN, Texas -- The five metropolitan areas in the United States that now have the highest rate of new coronavirus cases relative to their population are all in South Texas, according to data compiled by The New York Times.\n\nThe communities all lie along the border with Mexico or on the Gulf Coast: Brownsville-Harlingen, Eagle Pass, Rio Grande City, Corpus Christi and Laredo.\n\nTheir numbers underscore the virulence of the virus in Texas, where officials have struggled to both keep the state open and curb infection. More than 300 deaths were announced on Wednesday in the state, which is approaching a total death toll of 10,000.\n\nRepresentative Filemon B. Vela Jr., a Democrat whose district includes Brownsville and Harlingen, said that in late June he did not know anyone who had the virus. Now, he said, he knows hundreds. \"In one day, I had four people who I knew die,\" Mr. Vela said. \"It's just a really bad situation.\"\n\nFour of the five metro areas with the worst death rates in the country over the last two weeks were also in the South Texas border region -- Rio Grande City, Brownsville-Harlingen, McAllen and Eagle Pass. The fifth was Payson, Ariz. In Rio Grande City in rural Starr County, which has only one overwhelmed hospital, the death rate was the highest, at 0.68 per 1,000 people.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-14T00:03:55.697Z Even as the picture improves in California, the state becomes the first to report 600,000 virus cases. Five communities in South Texas have escalating rates of new cases. The latest numbers on jobless claims and the deficit could further the standoff on the next stimulus bill. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nIn Laredo, health officials called it a crisis. Hospitals have been at or near capacity every day. The state turned a local Red Roof Inn into a 106-bed temporary hospital for coronavirus patients with mild cases, but local leaders have been urging officials to allow patients with more serious cases in.\n\nThe city's five nursing homes have had 40 virus-related deaths. Officials were stunned by the citywide death toll of 102 in July, but with the number of deaths for August already at 57, they expect to surpass that this month.\n\n\"We see an unprecedented amount of death in the history of Laredo,\" said Dr. Victor Trevi\u00f1o, the top health official in the city. \"When the state opened, that's when we saw the infection rate increase dramatically.\"\n\nMr. Vela and other congressional Democrats in Texas have criticized Gov. Greg Abbott's handling of the state's reopening. When Mr. Abbott, a Republican, reopened the state in phases beginning May 1, he lifted the state's stay-at-home order and prohibited local officials from adopting their own. After cases increased, Mr. Abbott paused the reopening, ordered bars to close and issued a statewide mask mandate for most Texans.\n\n\"Shutting down the bars isn't enough,\" said Mr. Vela, who called on the governor on Thursday to issue stay-at-home orders in hard-hit counties or allow local officials to put them in place.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Abbott met with officials in the West Texas city of Lubbock and warned the public about what he called \"Covid fatigue.\" In remarks to reporters, he urged Texans to continue to wear masks and practice social distancing. He was without a mask as he spoke, sitting near several local officials at an indoor news conference.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 12, 2020\n\nCan I travel within the United States?Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine for 14 days. Here's an ever-updating list of statewide restrictions. In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own \"pod.\" \"Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,\" the C.D.C. says. If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\n\"If people do not continue to, in a very disciplined way, maintain the highest level of standards, what you will see is an acceleration of the expansion of Covid-19,\" the governor said.\n\nThe virus has had a scattershot effect in Texas, with some regions seeing rising numbers and others reporting a decrease in cases.\n\nThe Brownsville and Harlingen area of South Texas had the most new cases over the past two weeks, at 8,292, and an infection rate of 19.56 per 1,000 people. That is more than double the rate in other hard-hit metro areas in the country, including Bakersfield, Calif., which has an infection rate of 7.81 per 1,000 people.\n\nOf the state's 254 counties, only three have reported zero cases -- Loving, King and Borden -- all of which are small, rural areas in West Texas.\n\nFarther north in the Texas Panhandle, one of the most prominent political figures in the region announced on Wednesday evening that he had tested positive for the virus. State Senator Kel Seliger, a Republican who is a former four-term mayor of Amarillo, wrote on Twitter that he had begun to exhibit symptoms on Tuesday night and was complying with social isolation and contact tracing guidelines.",

        "body": "As passengers cautiously return to air travel, there are a few issues worth considering -- from middle-seat policies to questions about virus transmission on airlines.\n\nAfter passenger numbers plummeted earlier this year, air travel has taken a significant step forward. On Aug. 16, nearly 863,000 fliers passed through Transportation Security Administration checkpoints around the country, the highest figure since March 17. Though just one third of last year's 2.5 million passengers, the traffic is sharply higher than the 87,534 who traveled on April 14 in the depths of the pandemic.\n\nCommercial flights are down 43 percent in the United States, according to FlightAware.com, a service that tracks flights, but that is the best figure since the pandemic began, and up from a roughly 77 percent drop in April.\n\nWhile the future of aviation remains uncertain -- the industry is lobbying for more government funding to ward off future layoffs and route cuts expected when the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act funding expires Sept. 30 -- here are five things we know about flying now.\n\nThe middle seat saga continues\n\nAfter the pandemic hit, three of the four biggest airlines in the country -- American, Delta and Southwest -- vowed to block the sale of middle seats to provide more social distancing in the air. United Airlines was the sole holdout.\n\nNow, American has joined United in selling all available seats on its planes as demand allows, while Southwest has extended its commitment to less density through Oct. 31. Alaska Airlines is also blocking middle seats through Oct. 31, though it says it may make exceptions for unforeseen circumstances, such as accommodating fliers from a previously canceled flight. JetBlue has extended its open-middle-seat policy through Oct. 15, and Delta is leaving adjacent seats open through Jan. 6.\n\nIf you're looking for an uncrowded flight, the odds might be in your favor. Airlines for America, the trade group that represents the major airlines in the United States, says that as of Aug. 9, flights are running about 47 percent full, versus 88 percent a year ago. Still, complaints about full flights have continued on social media.\n\nLee Abbamonte, a travel blogger who lives in New York City, has flown for pleasure and for work during the pandemic, upgrading to business class with points, or sticking to carriers that block middle seats in economy.\n\n\"I feel that a little research and legwork can make a big difference in terms of load size,\" he wrote in an email. He uses online seat maps to gauge how busy a flight is and recommends flying at off-peak times and midweek for the lightest loads.\n\nLow fares may not be enough to lure many travelers\n\nTraditionally, fall is a good time to look for cheap airfares and this year is no different.\n\n\"After Aug. 15, fares go down because college kids and younger children are going back to school,\" said George Hobica, the founder of Airfarewatchdog.com, a website that finds flight deals. \"They would stay down to Thanksgiving, and then after Thanksgiving to Dec. 14. You could set your almanac by it.\"\n\nThis year, fares have been low all summer. According to the airfare prediction app Hopper, the current average price for a round-trip domestic ticket is $176, down 38 percent compared to the same time last year when it was $282.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T20:05:29.182Z 'No second chances': Colleges are coming down hard on students who violate virus restrictions. Many U.S. parents divide along political lines when it comes to sending their children back to school in person. A February conference in Boston led to the infection of tens of thousands around the world, a study shows. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nWhat consumers have gained in savings, they may give up in convenience, as airlines have cut back the number of flights to consolidate traffic. Mr. Hobica cited Delta's schedule from New York to Miami, which showed just two nonstop flights on a Friday in August. Delta, which is running half of its normal domestic schedule compared to last year, had nine flights on this route last August.\n\n\"People will not have the choices that they had as far as schedules, at least nonstop,\" he said.\n\nIn the current sales season, passengers can fly from as little as $67 round trip from Newark to Tampa, Fla., on United. Many destinations on American and Southwest are selling for about $100 round trip.\n\nMost sales seem aligned with where travelers say they want to go, which is, generally speaking, away from other people.\n\nDestination Analysts, a travel marketing research firm, has been doing a weekly survey of traveler sentiment for the past 22 weeks and found most recently that perennial destinations like Las Vegas and Orlando, Fla., remain high on the list of where people want to go, both before and during the pandemic. New to the top 10 list since the virus are places like Colorado and Alaska.\n\n\"People still want to go to Seattle and New Orleans, but because of the pandemic we're seeing Colorado and wilderness destinations edge out those urban experiences,\" said Erin Francis-Cummings, the chief executive of Destination Analysts.\n\nStill, most of the 1,200 adult American travelers surveyed told the firm they won't travel no matter how low the fares go. In the last survey, completed Aug. 9, 70 percent said no price cut would be large enough to get them to travel.\n\n\"They are staying firm,\" Ms. Francis-Cummings said, comparing the sentiment to the airline industry's recovery from the 2008 recession. \"Then, discounts were motivational. In the pandemic, a sizable percent are not budging.\"\n\nHoliday travel may be cheaper than normal\n\nTypically, airlines hike fares beginning the weekend before Thanksgiving in anticipation of the rush to the skies for the holiday. Currently, an American flight from Chicago to Miami that sells from $75 in October, goes to $356 the week of the holiday.\n\nThis year, of course, is like no other, and the number of college students studying from home or families fearful of gatherings may depress holiday travel. Hopper found prices are 30 percent lower presently than they were in 2019 for Thanksgiving travel, with an average round-trip domestic ticket at $216.\n\nAt this point, only Delta has committed to blocking middle seats past October. Additionally, flexible policies that waive fees for flight cancellations or changes will expire well before the holiday (except at Southwest, which is the only carrier that does not charge a fee for ticket changes). United is waiving change fees on new bookings through Aug. 31, though travel may take place later. Alaska's waiver runs through Sept. 8. American and Delta have extended their waivers to Sept. 30, and JetBlue to Oct. 15.\n\n\"Right now, the priority for airlines is to make prices accessible and terms flexible,\" said Hayley Berg, the economist at Hopper. \"Customers are increasingly prioritizing flexibility in fares and their travel experience over anything else.\"\n\nAs a result, she advised booking holiday travel now while restrictions are relaxed, if the price is right.\n\n\"On the whole, you will pay less than last year, but how much less and when still remains to be seen,\" Ms. Berg said.\n\nFirst class doesn't necessarily guarantee space\n\nFlying back recently from his second home in Tucson, Ariz., to Chicago, George Fink, who works in finance, upgraded to first class on American, using 55,000 miles for the one-way ticket in hopes of having more space. Instead, he found himself with a seatmate wearing a mask that did not cover his nose. He implored his fellow flier, who ignored him, to cover up. He next tried the flight attendant, who would not help. The back of the plane was full, too, making it impossible to move. Then the attendants served a meal.\n\n\"That meant everyone in first class took off their masks and ate for half an hour so all the masking and spacing was for naught,\" he said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nOnly Delta and Alaska have committed to reducing density in the forward cabin to 50 percent. (Southwest doesn't have a first or business class; JetBlue is blocking six of 16 seats in its forward-class Mint cabins.) Fliers opting for the upgrade on other carriers -- sometimes at very attractive prices -- may very well find their wider, more spacious seats just inches from the passengers next to them.\n\nExperts advise looking for airplane configurations that include single seat configurations. For example, on the Dreamliner that Mr. Hobica, the Airfarewatchdog.com founder, booked from Los Angeles to Newark, the seat configuration in business class was 1-2-1. (Bear in mind that carriers have the right to change aircraft per their contracts of carriage.)\n\n\"It's a good way to fly if you don't want someone next to you,\" Mr. Hobica said.\n\nMegan Solis, a teacher in Chicago, bought three $450 round-trip tickets in business class on United in early September so that she and her husband could take her oldest child to college in Boston, using credits from a previously canceled trip. Currently, the last seat in the family's four-seat row is empty and they're hoping it stays that way.\n\nThe relatively low fare was secondary in her decision. \"I was more comfortable with the space up there, even before I saw the price,\" she said.\n\nCalculating in-flight transmission risks\n\nWhile the airlines tout their HEPA filters, which scrub more than 99 percent of germs in the air, there has been very little data on the risks of catching coronavirus in-flight, even as evidence emerges that respiratory droplets containing live virus may linger in the air in indoor spaces. To date, no super-spreading events have been traced to a flight.\n\nGerman researchers recently published a study in the JAMA Network on a group of 24 tourists in March who were unwittingly exposed to Covid-19 in Israel a week before flying to Frankfurt on a four-hour-and-40-minute flight carrying 102 passengers. They found two likely cases of virus transmission on the flight, both seated within two rows of an infected passenger. Notably, no one was wearing masks on this flight, which took place before that public health mandate was adopted by airlines beginning in May in the United States.\n\nOn June 8, when The New York Times surveyed 511 epidemiologists about when they would travel again by airplane, the largest contingent, 44 percent, said in three to 12 months. They deemed other activities, including attending a sporting event, concert, funeral or wedding, as riskier.\n\nThe question of whether a middle seat left open would improve a passenger's odds of not getting sick compelled Arnold Barnett, a statistician and professor of management science at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to look into it.\n\n\"United said it was a P.R. strategy and not about safety, whereas Delta went to the other extreme,\" he said.\n\nHis mathematical model multiplied the number of Covid-19 cases by 10, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's estimate that the number of undetected cases could be 10 times the known infection rate. He factored in the barrier created by seat backs, the in-flight air purification systems and the effectiveness of masks in stopping contagion, which he said was about a four-in-five chance.\n\nHe found that on a fully loaded flight, the chance of contracting Covid-19 was one in 4,300. If the middle seat is empty, the risk falls to one in 7,700. Taking into account the possibility of spreading the virus to others not on the plane, he estimated the death risk to be one per 400,000 passengers on full flights and one in 600,000 with open middle seats.\n\nThese risks are considerably higher, he said, than the risk of a plane crash, but comparable to risks associated with two hours of everyday activities -- for instance, grocery shopping -- during the pandemic.\n\n\"United said there's no such thing as social distancing on airplanes,\" Mr. Barnett said, granting that an open seat doesn't give you the recommended six feet of social distancing.\n\n\"I do think there's a difference, and I would rather fly the airlines that are being more cautious in this regard,\" he added.\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

He sat in the road, rambling and incoherent, praising Jesus before demanding that the officers give him a gun, according to video footage of the March 23 encounter.\n\nThen he began spitting on the ground. An officer unfurled a mesh hood -- a safety device to prevent being spit on by prisoners -- and pulled it over Mr. Prude's head.\n\nWhen he tried to rise, officers forced Mr. Prude facedown on the ground, one of them holding his head to the pavement, according to video from the officer's body camera. Mr. Prude's demands that the hood be removed turned into gurgling noises as an ambulance arrived. Moments later, Mr. Prude stopped breathing. He was revived in the ambulance and hospitalized, but he never regained consciousness. Seven days later, he died.\n\nThose two fatal minutes, brought to national attention on Wednesday with the release of the raw police videos by Mr. Prude's family, are the latest to roil yet another American city outraged by the death of a Black man in custody. Protesters took to the streets of Rochester, with Mr. Prude's relatives raising questions familiar from prior fatal encounters with the police, such as why the officers have not been suspended.\n\nOn Thursday, the mayor of Rochester, Lovely Warren, suspended seven officers involved in the confrontation.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-03T20:36:11.287Z A C.D.C. study shows how prescriptions for an anti-malaria drug skyrocketed in March and April.

Cuomo -- both Democrats who have been outspoken on the issue of police brutality -- was jarring.\n\nOn Wednesday evening, as outrage over the circumstances of Mr. Prude's death spread, Mr. Cuomo said he had not seen the body camera footage. By Thursday, however, the governor was calling \"for answers,\" saying the video was \"deeply disturbing,\" and urging a quickening of the investigation.\n\n\"For the sake of Mr. Prude's family and the greater Rochester community, I am calling for this case to be concluded \u200eas expeditiously as possible,\" the governor said in a statement. \"For that to occur, we need the full and timely cooperation of the Rochester Police Department and I trust it will fully comply\u200e.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe Monroe County medical examiner ruled Mr. Prude's death a homicide caused by \"complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint,\" according to an autopsy report.\n\n\"Excited delirium\" and acute intoxication by phencyclidine, or the drug PCP, were contributing factors, the report said.\n\nNonetheless, the stark scene -- a Black man, handcuffed and sitting in a street, wearing nothing but a white hood -- seemed a shocking combination of physical helplessness and racist imagery from another era.",

        "body": "More drivers, passengers and motorcyclists have been killed so far this year than all of last year. Reckless driving is a major factor, officials say.\n\nWhen the pandemic emptied New York of its usual traffic, the city's streets transformed into an open speedway where drivers drag raced down major roads, racked up thousands of tickets and in some cases left fatal wreckage in their wake.\n\nAt the time, city officials saw the rash of reckless driving as an aberration that would vanish when the city's usual traffic reappeared.\n\nBut as restrictions lifted this summer and traffic crept back toward pre-pandemic levels, the spate of speeding -- and fatal collisions -- did not end.\n\nNow, alarmed by the sustained rise in fatalities and bracing for the possibility of a second lockdown that could worsen the current speeding crisis, city officials are reducing speed limits by five miles per hour on nine of the most dangerous streets across the five boroughs.\n\nOn Tuesday, officials will announce the speed limit will be lowered to 25 miles per hour -- the standard limit on most the city's roadways -- on eight of those streets, including parts of Riverside Drive in Manhattan, Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn, Northern Boulevard in Queens and Bruckner Boulevard in the Bronx.\n\nThe limit will also drop to 25 miles per hour on Shore Parkway Service Road and Dahlgren Place in Brooklyn, Webster Avenue in the Bronx and Targee Street in Staten Island.\n\nOn the ninth, Rockaway Boulevard in Queens, the limit will drop from 40 miles per hour to 35.\n\n\"People got in the habit of driving too fast and too recklessly when roads were more open, and unfortunately, we're still seeing that behavior,\" Polly Trottenberg, the city's transportation commissioner, said in an interview. \"We're starting to get almost back to normal, but there are still times and places in the city where traffic levels are lower and drivers are able to get up to higher speeds.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-01T08:25:36.896Z As U.S. cases decline elsewhere, the Midwest sees a worrying spike. The virus is spreading much faster in Spain than anywhere else in Europe. Health care workers with Covid-19 may be going undiagnosed, according to a C.D.C. report. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nAlready this year, more passengers, drivers and motorcyclists have been killed in car crashes than all of last year: 28 drivers, 16 passengers and 26 motorcyclists have died, according to city data.\n\nIn June, when traffic in New York City returned to around 80 percent of pre-pandemic levels, the number of passengers and drivers killed in collisions jumped 22 percent compared with the same month last year, according to data from the city and INRIX, a data collection firm. In July, things got much worse: Those deaths spiked 300 percent compared with last year.\n\nSince Mayor Bill de Blasio vowed to eliminate all traffic deaths six years ago, his administration has lowered speed limits and enforced them with automated speed cameras, bringing traffic deaths to their lowest level in a century in 2018.\n\nCity officials have tried to crack down on reckless driving by installing 60 new automated speed cameras every month since the beginning of the year, bringing the total to nearly 1,000. The police department also increased speed-radar enforcement along some highways and deployed hundreds of officers to locations with many speeding drivers at the height of the lockdown.\n\nBut with the city's sprawling subway system facing looming cuts and New Yorkers buying bicycles, scooters and cars in record numbers, many transit experts say that Mr. de Blasio needs to take more drastic action -- like accelerating the creation of new busways and protected bike lanes, and restricting traffic into Manhattan during rush hours -- to ensure streets are safe and functional.\n\n\"New York City is facing four existential challenges: the death spiral of public transit, ballooning car ownership, an increase in traffic deaths and serious injuries and the lack of a plan for addressing these from the mayor,\" said Danny Harris, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group.\n\n\"The decisions we're making now about street infrastructure will affect us for decades,\" Mr. Harris added. \"We should be taking decisive action now.\"\n\nAcross the country, after the pandemic hit and traffic levels dropped more than 90 percent in some large cities, speeding -- and the death rate from car crashes -- surged.\n\nIn March, the rate of fatalities nationwide from crashes rose 12 percent, in May it jumped 34 percent and in June -- the latest month when statistics are available -- it rose 23 percent compared with the same months last year, according to the National Safety Council, an advocacy group.\n\n\"I think folks started to feel like the roads are emptier and it's an open speedway for them,\" said Lorraine M. Martin, president of the council. The empty roads may have also lured some drivers into a false sense of security, she added, leading them to ignore laws that mandate wearing a seatbelt and not driving impaired.\n\nBut in New York, the sustained rise in fatalities suggests that drivers who picked up reckless behavior during the lockdown have maintained it since -- and may continue to imperil street safety.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all.

It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIn March, when the city entered lockdown, the number of automated speed camera violations nearly doubled compared to the previous month, from 12,672 tickets issued one day at the end of February to 24,765 tickets issued daily at the end of March.\n\nWhen the city emerged from lockdown in June, the violations continued: There were 23,951 issued on the final Friday in July.\n\nMany of the fatal crashes have happened on highways, where drivers can speed more easily when there is little traffic, city officials said. The motorcycles involved in some crashes were often unregistered or had expired registration, and many drivers did not have a motorcycle-specific license.\n\nAt the same time, fewer pedestrians and cyclists have been killed in collisions this year compared with the same period last year. So far, there have been 19 fewer pedestrian fatalities and 10 fewer cyclists killed compared with last year, which was particularly deadly for cyclists.\n\nStill, many transit advocates say that the city needs to take more aggressive steps to prevent future gridlock and restore recent gains to street safety as the city braces for uncertain travel patterns in the wake of the pandemic.\n\n\"Without putting in more street-level infrastructure for buses, bikes and micromobility, we are looking at a confluence of more people using scooters and bikes and a lot more people driving on streets,\" said Nick Sifuentes, the executive director of Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an advocacy group. \"That's a recipe for even more crashes and even more fatalities than we are seeing right now.\"\n\nIn June, Mr. de Blasio convened a panel of transportation experts to make recommendations for avoiding gridlock and maintaining street safety.\n\nBut those experts say that the mayor has yet to review or act on those recommendations, stoking concerns that without a comprehensive plan to accommodate shifting commuting patterns, New York's recovery could be hamstrung by traffic deaths and gridlock.\n\n\"Recovering from Covid-19 requires us to reimagine our city, especially our streets, for the better,\" half of the experts on the panel wrote in a letter to Mr. de Blasio last week. \"Without your decisive and immediate action, we may lose New York City's future to growing congestion, pollution, inequality, and traffic violence.\"\n\nCity officials say that, despite budget cuts, they have made strides to address these issues: This summer, the city broke ground on 20 miles of new busways, rolled out tens of miles of open streets and opened roads to several thousands of restaurants.\n\n\"The city has had a lot on its plate,\" said Ms. Trottenberg, the transportation commissioner. \"I hear frustrations from people who say we could be doing more, but I think we've done a lot to respond to this urgency.\"",

        "body": "Nearly 400 State University of New York, Oneonta, students tested positive for the coronavirus less than two weeks after classes began.\n\nIn late August, less than a week after classes started, the State University of New York at Oneonta suspended five students who, officials said, had organized parties in the upstate town that might have led to a coronavirus outbreak on campus.\n\nBut it was already too late.\n\nFive days later, the outbreak was out of control, with nearly 400 virus cases among a campus student population that is usually around 6,000.\n\nAs a result, officials announced on Thursday that they were canceling in-person classes for the fall semester and sending students home, making Oneonta the first SUNY campus to shut down because of the virus after trying to reopen for classes.\n\n\"Despite the diligence of the vast majority of our SUNY Oneonta students, faculty and staff, the actions of a few individuals who didn't comply resulted in the spread of Covid-19 over the past week,\" Jim Malatras, SUNY's chancellor, said in a statement.\n\nWith New York City public schools set to reopen at the end of the month, the closing of the campus was a troubling reminder of how quickly virus clusters can spiral in an academic setting, even in a state where the infection rate has hovered around 1 percent for weeks.\n\nThe college, in Otsego County, about 80 miles west of Albany, said that classes would be canceled on Friday to allow students to prepare to go home. More than 50 students who were suspected of having the virus were in quarantine on campus and 100 who had tested positive were in isolation, according to daily data the college has posted online.\n\nThe outbreak started small. On Aug. 25, the second day of classes, university officials said two students had tested positive for the virus. By Aug. 28, the number had ballooned to 29.\n\nTwo days later, after 105 students -- or about 3 percent of the people who were on campus or using campus facilities by then -- had tested positive, Mr. Malatras directed the school to cancel all in-student activities for two weeks. He also said that in addition to suspending the five students, officials had also suspended three campus organizations.\n\nOn Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, said the state was sending a virus-control team consisting of 71 contact tracers and eight case investigators to try to quell the outbreak before it spread to the town. The state also opened three free, rapid testing sites in the city of Oneonta.\n\nBut the efforts did not apparently stem the campus outbreak. By Wednesday, officials said that 289 cases had been confirmed after more than 2,500 students and more than 200 employees had been tested. Another 100 people tested positive by Thursday.\n\n\"This is a sad day for SUNY Oneonta,\" said Dr. Barbara Jean Morris, the college's president. \"However, the actions we are taking will allow us to put our focus back on learning.\"\n\nBefore classes began, the college had not required students to show that they had tested negative for the virus before being allowed on campus, as many colleges around the United States have done. Students also were not tested upon arriving for the semester.\n\nShortly after classes started, students began posting videos on social media chronicling the rising number of infections and criticizing what they said was a lack of communication about the outbreak from the college.\n\nAfter the college began testing students, faculty members and other employees en masse, some students who tested positive filmed themselves being woken up in the early hours of the morning and rushed into vans by men in white hazmat suits who took them to campus locations where they were to quarantine.\n\nHaley Dimonda, a first-year student, said she had gotten a call shortly before 1 a.m. Monday informing her that she had tested positive for the virus and would have to pack her things to quarantine in a different dormitory.\n\nAbout five minutes later, Ms. Dimonda said, a resident assistant knocked on her door and told her that a man was waiting for her. Ms. Dimonda, 18, filmed herself, teary-eyed, following a man in a hazmat suit. She was still in her pajamas when she was escorted out of her dorm room carrying some of her belongings.\n\n\"I was really scared actually, because I hadn't gotten any information,\" she said. \"I was just told I was going get picked up and go to a hall.\"\n\nSchool Reopenings \"Back to School\n\nUpdated Sept. 2, 2020\n\nThe latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.\n\nIn N.Y.C., being able to test students and teachers regularly for coronavirus may be the biggest challenge to reopening classrooms in the nation's largest district this month.As outbreaks disrupt life on campus, more colleges are taking a zero-tolerance stand against parties.In Opinion, columnist Nicholas Kristof writes that \"remote learning\" is often an oxymoron.Joe Biden is trying to spotlight President Trump's handling of education during the pandemic.\n\nMs. Dimonda, who does not have symptoms of the virus, was tested shortly after the college made it mandatory for students living on campus to be tested after the outbreak began.\n\nWhile she said she had heard of parties being held near campus after students arrived, she also believed the college should have required students to be tested beforehand. The large number of cases, she said, was \"inevitable.\"\n\n\"With the parties or without the parties, this would've happened anyway, but people partying spread it quicker,\" Ms. Dimonda said.\n\nAlthough SUNY Oneonta's recent policy does not allow students to leave for home without the approval of the county health department, Ms. Dimonda said that her parents were able to pick her up on Monday, the day she was put in quarantine. She said she was now \"stuck in my room\" on Long Island.\n\nOtsego County has had some of the lowest positive test rates in the state. By Thursday, the overall positive rate of those who had tested in the county was .01 (209 positives out of 20,221 tested), according to state data. On Thursday, the state reported 20 new cases in the county.\n\nLizabeth Rose, who manages Peter Clark Student Rentals, a local off-campus housing company that rents to around 400 students, said that only the occupants of one of her houses had to quarantine, easing some of her own concerns about those who will be remaining in town. (Students can apply for permission to stay on campus.)\n\n\"I think most of the students are doing the right thing,\" Ms. Rose said.\n\nSUNY Oneonta is not the only university struggling to control cases and quarantine students while trying to conduct in-person classes.\n\nOn Thursday, officials at Syracuse University, about 85 miles northwest of Oneonta, said they had detected traces of the virus in wastewater coming from one dorm. Officials ordered students in the dorm to return to their rooms and said all residents there would be tested.\n\nSeveral colleges and universities, including Notre Dame and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill had previously canceled in-person classes after hundreds of students were found to have the virus, often following reports of large parties.\n\nMore than 40 students at SUNY, Plattsburgh, which is about 160 miles north of Albany, were placed on interim suspension after an outdoor gathering. Small liberal arts colleges like Marist College and larger universities like the Ohio State University have ordered students off campus because of parties. More than 1,000 cases have been detected at the both the University of South Carolina and the University of Alabama",

        "body": "Parents are wrestling with difficult choices over sending their children to school. Here's how one science reporter made the call.\n\nAll summer, as information about how the coronavirus affects children has trickled in, I've been updating a balance sheet in my head. Every study I read, every expert I talked to, was filling in columns on this sheet: reasons for and against sending my children back to school come September.\n\nInto the con column went a study from Chicago that found children carry large amounts of virus in their noses and throats, maybe even more than adults do. Also in the con column: two South Korean studies, flawed as they were, which suggested children can spread the virus to others -- and made me wonder whether my sixth-grader, at least, should stay home.\n\nReports from Europe hinting that it was possible to reopen schools safely dribbled onto the pro side of my ledger. But could we match those countries' careful precautions, or their low community levels of virus?\n\nI live in Brooklyn, where schools open after Labor Day (if they open this year at all), so my husband and I have had more time than most parents in the nation to make up our minds. We're also privileged enough to have computers and reliable Wi-Fi for my children to learn remotely.\n\nBut as other parents called and texted to ask what I was planning to do, I turned to the real experts: What do we know about the coronavirus and children? And what should parents like me do?\n\nThe virus is so new that there are no definitive answers as yet, the experts told me. Dozens of coronavirus studies emerge every day, \"but it is not all good literature, and sorting out the wheat from the chaff is challenging,\" said Dr. Megan Ranney, an expert in adolescent health at Brown University.\n\nBut she and other experts were clear on one thing: Schools should only reopen if the level of virus circulating in the community is low -- that is, if less than 5 percent of people tested have a positive result. By that measure, most school districts in the nation cannot reopen without problems.\n\n\"The No. 1 factor is what your local transmission is like,\" said Helen Jenkins, an expert in infectious diseases and statistics at Boston University. \"If you're in a really hard-hit part of the country, it's highly likely that somebody coming into the school will be infected at some point.\"\n\nOn the questions of how often children become infected, how sick they get and how much they contribute to community spread, the answers were far more nuanced.\n\nFewer children than adults become infected. But childhood infection is not uncommon.\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, there were so few reports of sick children that it was unclear whether they could be infected at all. Researchers guessed even then that younger children could probably catch the coronavirus, but were mostly spared severe symptoms.\n\nThat conjecture has proved correct. \"There is very clear evidence at this point that kids can get infected,\" Dr. Ranney said.\n\nAs the pandemic unfolded, it also appeared that younger children were less likely -- perhaps only half as likely -- to become infected, compared with adults, whereas older children had about the same risk as adults.\n\nBut it's impossible to be sure. In most countries hit hard by the coronavirus, lockdowns and school shutdowns kept young children cloistered at home and away from sources of infection. And when most of those countries opened up, they did so with careful adherence to masks and physical distancing.\n\nChildren may turn out to be less at risk of becoming infected, \"but not meaningfully different enough that I would take solace in it or use it for decision making,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nIn the United States, children under age 19 still represent just over 9 percent of all coronavirus cases. But the number of children infected rose sharply this summer to nearly half a million, and the incidence among children has risen much faster than it had been earlier this year.\n\n\"And those are just the kids that have been tested,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former health commissioner of Baltimore. \"It's quite possible that we're missing many cases of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children.\"\n\nIn the two-week period between Aug. 6 and Aug. 20, for example, the number of children diagnosed in the United States jumped by 74,160, a 21 percent increase.\n\n\"Now that we're doing more community testing, we're seeing higher proportions of children who are infected,\" Dr. Ranney said. \"I think that our scientific knowledge on this is going to continue to shift.\"\n\nChildren do become sick with the virus, but deaths are very rare.\n\nEven with the rising number of infections, the possibility that panics parents the most -- that their children could become seriously ill or even die from the virus -- is still reassuringly slim.\n\nChildren and adolescents up to age 20 (definitions and statistics vary by state) represent less than 0.3 percent of deaths related to the coronavirus, and 21 states have reported no deaths at all among children.\n\n\"That remains the silver lining of this pandemic,\" Dr. Jha said.\n\nBut reports in adults increasingly suggest that death is not the only severe outcome. Many adults seem to have debilitating symptoms for weeks or months after they first fall ill.\n\n\"What percentage of kids who are infected have those long-term consequences that we're increasingly worried about with adults?\" Dr. Ranney wondered.\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome, a mysterious condition that has been linked to the coronavirus, has also been reported in about 700 children and has caused 11 deaths as of Aug. 20. \"That's a very small percentage of children,\" Dr. Ranney said. \"But growing numbers of kids are getting hospitalized, period.\"\n\nChildren can spread the virus to others. How often is still unknown.\n\nTransmission has been the most challenging aspect of the coronavirus to discern in children, made even more difficult by the lockdowns that kept them at home.\n\nBecause most children are asymptomatic, for example, household surveys and studies that test people with symptoms often miss children who might have seeded infections. And when schools are closed, young children don't venture out; they tend to catch the virus from adults, rather than the other way around.\n\nTo confirm the direction of spread, scientists ideally would genetically sequence viral samples obtained from children to understand where and when they were infected, and whether they passed it on.\n\nSchools Reopening \"Back to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 31, 2020\n\nThe latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.\n\nCases, hospitalizations and deaths from the coronavirus have increased at a faster rate in children and teenagers than among the general public, data compiled by the American Academy of Pediatrics from the summer show.Universities that are trying to reopen with in-person classes are pioneering Covid tests and tracking apps that could help society combat the pandemic.Privately owned bus companies, which carry nearly 10 million children to school a year, are facing an unparalleled threat to their survival.Resident advisers in college dorms have been drafted to enforce mask wearing and social distancing rules, and to report on fellow students who violate those rules.\n\n\"I keep saying to people, 'It's so hard to study transmission -- it's just really, really hard,'\" Dr. Jenkins said.\n\nStill, based on studies so far, \"I think it still appears that the younger children might be less likely to transmit than older ones, and older ones are probably more similar to adults in that regard,\" she said.\n\nSadly, the high numbers of infected children in the United States may actually provide some real data on this question as schools reopen.\n\nSo what's a parent to do?\n\nThat's a tough one to answer, as parents everywhere now know. So much depends on the particular circumstances of your school district, your immediate community, your family and your child.\n\n\"I think it's a really complex decision, and we need to do everything we can as a society to enable parents to make this type of decision,\" Dr. Wen said.\n\nThere are some precautions everyone can take -- beginning with doing as much outdoors as possible, maintaining physical distance and wearing masks.\n\n\"I will not send my children to school or to an indoor activity where the children are not all masked,\" Dr. Ranney said.\n\nEven if there is uncertainty about how often children become infected or spread the virus, \"when you consider the risk versus benefit, the balance lies in assuming that kids can both get infected and can spread it,\" Dr. Ranney said.\n\nFor schools, the decision will also come down to having good ventilation -- even if that's just windows that open -- small pods that can limit how widely the virus might spread from an infected child, and frequent testing to cut transmission chains.\n\nTeachers and school nurses will also need protective equipment, Dr. Jenkins said: \"Good P.P.E. makes all the difference, and school districts must provide that for the teachers at an absolute minimum.\"\n\nAs long as these right precautions are in place, \"it's better for kids to be in school than outside of school,\" Dr. Jha said. \"Teachers are reasonably safe in those environments, as well.\"\n\nBut community transmission is the most important factor in deciding whether children should go back to school, researchers agreed. \"We just can't keep a school free from the coronavirus if the community is a hotbed of infection,\" Dr. Wen said.\n\nIn New York, the numbers are low enough that my husband and I have a real choice to make. And our children's school, with a focus on social equity, has said children of frontline workers and those with disabilities will get the first spots for in-person learning.\n\nWe qualified for two days a week of schooling in person. My mother-in-law lives downstairs in a separate unit and may be more vulnerable to the virus. But my children, who are 11 and 8, need to learn in person and are desperate to see their friends. We've decided to send our children back to school.",

        "body": "Standard tests in New York City can take days or weeks. Wealthier people are turning to concierge services and small laboratories to get results in as little as 24 hours.\n\nAs major laboratories struggle to meet surging demand for coronavirus tests, wealthier people and others in privileged professions are avoiding long waits for results -- anywhere from four days to more than two weeks in New York City -- by skipping the lines.\n\nSome are signing up for concierge medical practices that charge several thousand dollars a year for membership and provide quick turnaround testing. Others have turned to smaller laboratories or doctors' offices that have their own equipment and can give results in a few hours or less.\n\n\"So far, we have tested 12 billionaires,\" said Dr. Andrew Brooks, chief executive of Infinity BiologiX, a New Jersey-based company that developed a saliva test used by professional athletes, universities and financial institutions. \"This concern is universal.\"\n\nExecutives at smaller labs in the New York region described a sharp increase in calls from those looking for faster results -- not just doctors with wealthy patients but also businesses that need swift, reliable testing. Movie production companies, banks and even trucking companies have turned to small labs.\n\nHorace Mann, a Bronx private school where tuition runs more than $50,000 a year, hired a screening company, Sterling, to offer on-demand saliva tests for staff, students and parents.\n\nSome physician's offices are offering results in less than 24 hours for people who can pay $150 or $200 out of pocket for a test.\n\nFrom the start, the pandemic has exacerbated existing inequalities, including access to quality health care. In the early weeks of the outbreak, those with money and connections found ways to get tests when few were available. Now, they get faster results.\n\nAs reliably fast results become available for those who can afford them, frustration mounts in the New York region over delays for standard tests that come at no cost to people but often do not yield results for several days. Public health experts say such a lag can render test results far less useful, given that people who have the virus can infect others in the meantime.\n\nThe F.D.A. has also recently approved several affordable rapid tests, which can deliver results in hours, but they are not yet widely available.\n\nOfficials in New York see robust diagnostic testing and swift contact tracing as key to maintaining the state's low levels of infection. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have blamed large national laboratories for a backlog in processing test results. While smaller labs can often produce results faster, there are not enough of them to handle tests on a citywide scale.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-31T13:06:59.687Z The U.S. has more than 6 million cases as President Trump retweets fringe theories on the virus. With testing disrupted, storm-hit Louisiana watches other measures of the virus and sees trouble. India now has the third-highest death toll from the virus. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nSince last month, the median wait time for coronavirus test results had gone up in New York City, from two days to three, a change that the city's Health Department has attributed primarily to slow processing by Quest Diagnostics laboratories. The city this month opened several \"express\" testing sites, promising results in 24 hours.\n\nSome of the fastest turnaround times have been seen in hospital-based testing, especially samples from patients who are having surgery. For patients in the emergency room or admitted to the hospital, most results come back within a day, city officials said.\n\nBut for many others, the timeline is much less predictable.\n\nDuring one week in early August, a quarter of all test results in New York City came back in more than 13 days, according to the Health Department. About a third of the tests were handled by Quest, the department said.\n\nQuest, which can process some 150,000 coronavirus tests a day, has said recently that its turnaround times have improved. The company said in a statement on Tuesday that its average testing turnaround had been reduced to two days.\n\nFor those with an exacting clientele, there has been competition to establish relationships with smaller labs.\n\n\"When we started, we had a regular lab, Quest, and we were getting results back in seven days, which is worthless,\" said Dr. Matthew Priddy, who runs a concierge medical practice in Indianapolis.\n\nDr. Priddy said he found a small local lab to work with and now his patients -- who pay between $150 and $600 a month in membership fees -- get coronavirus test results in around two days. He declined to name the lab, so that others did not flock there.\n\n\"I'm just being selfish for my patients,\" he said.\n\nUnder the elevated train tracks of the D train in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, Lenco Diagnostic Laboratories processes results for hospitals and doctors' offices, as well as for boutique medical practices like one called Sollis.\n\nAt Sollis, for an annual individual membership fee of up to $5,000, patients can be seen in the equivalent of a private emergency room, or get chest X-rays at home.\n\nDemand for testing at Sollis has been driven in part by members traveling back from at-risk places or to countries that require testing, particularly in the Caribbean, said Andrew Olanow, a co-founder of Sollis. The company has about 4,000 members in the New York area and in recent weeks opened an office on the West Coast.\n\n\"Twenty-four to 48 hours, that's our turnaround time,\" he said.\n\nSamira Shamoon said she received quick results through Sollis, which she joined at the height of the outbreak in New York in March as she rushed to move from her Upper East Side co-op to a family home in Bridgehampton.\n\n\"I needed the results by 2 p.m. the next day,\" said Ms. Shamoon, who runs a health and beauty communications firm, recalling her panic one evening when her temperature hit 99.5 the day before an important client dinner. She got her negative result at 11:55 a.m.\n\nShe said other people she knew in the Hamptons had done the same, including a woman who told her she had been tested for coronavirus eight times.\n\nMs. Shamoon paid $12,000 for a membership for herself, her husband and her two aging parents. Each home visit cost $1,000.\n\n\"That fee is for the immediate turnaround care,\" she said, adding that the cost of the test itself, performed by Lenco, would be put through her health insurance, as it is for everyone with insurance who gets a coronavirus test.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"We are fortunate,\" Ms. Shamoon said. \"At the end of the day, I have to remember that.\"\n\nLenco, which in a recent week handled about 5 percent of laboratory tests in New York City, has managed to provide fast results by limiting the number of tests it runs, said Dr. Robert Boorstein, the medical director.\n\n\"A lot of others commit to stuff that they're not able to do,\" said Dr. Boorstein. \"We're doing about 2,000 tests a day. We get calls to do another 1,000 tests, or another 2,000 tests. We won't take that business until we can get commitments from suppliers.\"\n\nSome doctors guarantee fast results because they have diagnostic machines to process tests inside of their offices, said Scott Pope of Roamd, a company that works with concierge doctors around the country charging as much as $40,000 a year in membership fees.\n\nOthers have been trying to get rapid point-of-care testing machines, the types of devices used in the White House. The devices, which are increasingly appearing outside of exclusive parties and social gatherings, deliver results in 30 minutes.\n\nMr. Pope said he knew of several doctors who had ordered such machines, only to have them redirected to the federal government.\n\nThe machines remain in short supply. They use a different method -- an antigen test -- that has been considered less accurate than the more standard testing procedure used by most laboratories. And for travel to a place where a negative test is required, antigen tests are often not accepted.\n\nFor now, wealthy people and many businesses are relying on the same sorts of tests used by everyone else in the country -- they're just finding ways of getting the results back faster.\n\nJohn Catsimatidis, the billionaire New York grocery magnate, said he had hired a concierge service, Studio Med, to test himself and the approximately 100 people at his offices. The turnaround time for each test was 24 hours.\n\nHow did he ensure that the results came back in a day? \"You pay them a lot of money,\" he said.\n\n\"We made it conditional: we'd give them the business if they'd get it done,\" Mr. Catsimatidis added. \"I think a lot of companies are doing the same thing.\"\n\nFor fast results, and tests that do not require an uncomfortable nasal swab, some companies, sports leagues and universities have looked to saliva testing.\n\nInfinity BiologiX, a company affiliated with Rutgers University, developed the first such approved test, which yields results in one or two days and has been used on the university's athletes as well as the PGA Tour and Major League Soccer.\n\nIncreasingly, companies are looking for tailor-made testing regimens, hoping to bypass the uncertainty in the larger marketplace, Dr. Brooks said. The chief executives of those companies often take the tests themselves too.\n\n\"One, they want to make sure it works,\" he said. \"Two, they want to be able to say, if it's good enough for me, it's good enough for everyone. And three, they absolutely want to know for themselves.\"",

        "body": "Guards have tested positive. After-work parties are frowned upon. The pandemic has upended lifeguarding.\n\nThe Avalon Beach Patrol, on the New Jersey shore, is an elite lifeguard corps that holds tryouts each year, dominates in lifesaving competitions and prides itself on protecting swimmers from treacherous ocean conditions.\n\nBut this summer, it, like so many other groups, has faced a daunting challenge: the coronavirus crisis.\n\nLast month, roughly two dozen lifeguards in Avalon tested positive for the virus. That led to the quarantining of some 45 guards, depleting the ranks and forcing some guards to work shifts with no breaks.\n\n\"We were stretched so thin that we had to hire more lifeguards,\" said Matt Wolf, the patrol's administrative lieutenant.\n\nAs it has with so many other aspects of life, the pandemic has upended nearly every element of lifeguarding. Ocean rescues are contactless and require guards to shower and sanitize equipment afterward. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation is now done with a face mask equipped with a manual pump. Morning strategy huddles are out, as are group workouts and sitting in pairs. Lifeguarding competitions have been canceled.\n\nMany lifeguards now carry hand sanitizer and disposable masks and gloves both to give out and to protect themselves from the groups of people, often maskless, who are packing the shore, desperate for a sense of summertime normalcy.\n\nThe precautions on the beach are important, but outbreaks among lifeguards have largely seemed to emanate from group housing and post-work gatherings, which for many young workers are selling points of this quintessential seasonal job.\n\nNorth of Avalon, at least 35 lifeguards on Long Beach Island in New Jersey tested positive for the virus last month after attending parties.\n\nIn New York, 13 lifeguards from two Suffolk County beaches tested positive in July after attending a barbecue. There have also been numerous smaller outbreaks among guards in the region and elsewhere in the country, including in Cape Cod, Delaware and Newport Beach, Calif.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-15T07:07:04.205Z The manager of the Trump administration's new virus database refuses Senate questioning, citing a nondisclosure agreement. U.S. Postal Service warns several states of mail-in ballot delays. If you recover from the virus, you may be protected for at least three months, the C.D.C. says. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nMr. Wolf said that after the outbreaks, he had reminded his lifeguards to use the same caution after work that they exercise on the beach. \"I think they've gotten the message,\" he said.\n\nIn New York and New Jersey, there seem to be no indications that beaches have driven an increase in infections. In New York City, new coronavirus hospital admissions have remained below 50 per day for weeks; in March and April, the city routinely saw well over a thousand each day.\n\nStill, the pandemic's effects have been keenly felt on New York City's public beaches, which are some of the nation's most crowded. The city, citing the threat of the virus, had delayed opening its 14 miles of beaches until July 1 -- they typically open on Memorial Day weekend.\n\nNew York, which trains and tests most of its lifeguards in the spring, also suspended its hiring process as the crisis escalated. That left officials scrambling in June to turn out enough guards to open the beaches, and left the guards looking at a month's less pay.\n\nThe city ended up hiring 740 lifeguards: 520 at the beaches, and 220 at the 15 public swimming pools that city officials opened late last month and early this month.\n\n\"It's a been a crazy, surreal summer,\" said Janet Fash, a lifeguard chief at Rockaway Beach in Queens.\n\nEach morning, Ms. Fash lines up her crew members at least six feet apart and takes their temperatures. To keep social distance from beachgoers, they rope off an area around their lifeguard stands.\n\nSo far, there have been no reported virus cases among New York City lifeguards, city officials said.\n\nMs. Fash said her lifeguards had been making more rescues than usual, in part because there are so many beachgoers. To limit guards' contact with swimmers, she has told her crew to be more cautious in directing people away from dangerous rip currents and deep water. She also now keeps a lifeguard posted on a surfboard just beyond the swimmers.\n\nOfficials with several lifeguarding corps and the United States Lifesaving Association say that their members are generally not tasked with enforcing social distancing, but that beachgoers sometimes ask them to.\n\n\"I tell my lifeguards, 'Your job is to watch the water, not enforce social distancing,\" Ms. Fash said. \"I've had to tell people, 'Sorry, there are a lot of people in the water. I can't help you right now.'\"\n\nLifeguards are expected to social distance and wear masks. But they cannot wear face coverings while swimming, so a rescue risks exposure to the virus.\n\n\"If a lifeguard is just wearing a Speedo, that's not much protection,\" said Cary Epstein, a 23-year veteran lifeguard at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, which has some 225 lifeguards.\n\nThe challenge is to maintain distance from struggling swimmers -- an odd notion to most lifeguards, who are largely trained to never lose contact with them.\n\n\"They call it distance rescuing, and in the lifeguard DNA, it feels almost impossible to do,\" said Bruce Meirowitz, 69, a guard at Robert Moses State Park, also on Long Island, where about 150 lifeguards work.\n\nGenerally, lifeguards pass swimmers a rescue buoy, then clasp them across the chest. Now, to avoid making contact, many guards approach people from behind rather than the front, pass them the buoy and tow them in using the buoy line.\n\n\"We're front-line workers now,\" Mr. Epstein said. \"We have to protect ourselves from patrons and from each other.\"\n\nIt is difficult to avoid contact entirely, lifeguards say. \"If we have to grab them to save them, we grab them,\" Ms. Fash said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 12, 2020\n\nCan I travel within the United States?Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine for 14 days. Here's an ever-updating list of statewide restrictions. In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own \"pod.\" \"Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,\" the C.D.C. says. If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nAt Robert Moses and other state-run beaches in New York, lifeguards fill out \"exposure forms\" after rescuing swimmers who are exhibiting possible virus symptoms, said Ryan Clark, president of the New York State Lifeguard Corps.\n\nGuards can also temporarily close areas to swimming if too many rescues threaten the workers' safety, said Mr. Clark, who is also a lifeguard at Jones Beach.\n\nOn rare occasions, the entire beach is closed to swimming. That happened on a recent afternoon, Mr. Epstein said, when lifeguards ran more than 50 rescues in one section of Jones Beach.\n\nThat many rescues are not unheard-of on a day with rough waves, and \"normally, we'd just keep pulling people out all day long -- we live for that,\" Mr. Epstein said.\n\n\"But this year, there's no way to fully protect yourself in the water unless you're in full scuba gear,\" he added. \"If you tumble in the surf with a victim, now everyone is breathing on each other.\"\n\nThe virus has also disrupted mundane routines. No longer do lifeguards stop each morning at a central office to grab coffee and trade barhopping stories. Now, they are more likely to have their temperatures taken and attest that they have no known exposure to the coronavirus, or symptoms like coughing or shortness of breath. At some beaches, guards sign in virtually.\n\nIn Long Beach, N.Y. -- where local officials have cited crowding concerns in restricting Friday and weekend beach admission to residents -- lifeguards take part in a careful choreography to maintain social distancing within their ranks, with separate groups setting up lifesaving equipment and sanitizing the beach's 24 lifeguard stands, said Paul Gillespie, the chief of Long Beach's 143 guards.\n\nMr. Gillespie, 70, also said that each morning, lifeguards get their temperature taken and fill out health questionnaires.\n\nAnother change, he said, is that lifeguards are told to sit in their cars during heavy rains, rather than to take shelter in beach shacks.\n\nOn the Jersey Shore, social-distancing measures meant that the South Jersey Lifeguard Championships, which dates to 1924, was called off over worries of crowds, said Sandy Bosacco, president of the South Jersey Lifeguard Chiefs Association.\n\nMr. Bosacco, who is also the captain of the Stone Harbor Beach Patrol, said that so far there had been perhaps three positive cases among his guards.\n\n\"We constantly remind them about their behavior at night,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter how safe we are during the day. It's more about when they're on their own.\"\n\nAt Rockaway Beach, workers remind one another to wear masks inside the lifeguard shack, Ms. Fash said. She also said that she had advised younger guards to avoid parties where the virus might spread.\n\n\"Some of them are going to gather no matter what,\" she said. \"If I hear they are going out at night, I remind them that this is about protecting everybody.\"",

        "body": "Want to get The Morning by email? Here's the sign-up.\n\nGood morning. New York's attorney general is suing to dissolve the N.R.A. And President Trump announced restrictions on TikTok and WeChat. Let's start with the ways climate change is already making life harder around the world.\n\nIn the past 60 years, every decade has been hotter than the last, and 2020 is on track to be among the hottest years yet. But the burden of extreme heat is not shared equally -- it's significantly worse for people at the bottom of the socioeconomic ladder.\n\nExtreme heat can exacerbate poor health, ravage crops and make it dangerous to work outside. And in many parts of the world, simple ways to alleviate those effects -- like water, or electricity for fans and air-conditioners -- are a luxury.\n\nSomini Sengupta, The Times's international climate reporter, and a team of photographers have a new story that documents how rising temperatures are affecting people across multiple continents.\n\nIn Athens, heat waves have increased fivefold over the last century. Diminished rains and longer dry seasons are destroying Guatemala's farmlands, where Indigenous farmers could see crop yields fall sharply. In Nigeria, hotter nights make it easier for mosquitoes to breed, increasing the risk of mosquito-borne diseases. And in the United States, heat kills older people more than any other extreme weather event, including hurricanes.\n\nWe spoke with Somini about what she described as \"one of the most profound inequities of the modern age.\"\n\n\"I have seen over the last couple of years the impact of what is truly a global problem,\" she said. \"We know that high heat and humidity is a dangerous combination for health, agriculture and economies of whole regions -- nearly everywhere around the world, heat waves are more frequent and longer lasting than they were 70 years ago.\"\n\nWhat do experts recommend to combat rising temperatures?\n\n\"Draw down the combustion of fossil fuels,\" Somini said. \"The world is capable of getting off coal in many instances, capable of vastly reducing the burning of oil and gas.\"\n\nBut the world also has to adjust to the extreme heat we're seeing already, she said. That includes making water, air-conditioners and fans more accessible, and planting trees to bring down temperatures in cities.\n\n\"It could also mean adjusting things you might not immediately think of, like labor laws so people don't have to work for hours under the blistering sun, agricultural changes in farming methods or what is grown in what place to adapt to higher temperatures,\" she said.\n\n\"In short, it requires doing everything pretty differently.\"\n\nIn other climate news:\n\nGovernment scientists updated their forecast for the remainder of the Atlantic hurricane season, predicting \"one of the most active seasons on record.\" Climate change appears to be making hurricanes more intense and destructive.\n\nFOUR MORE BIG STORIES1. How the virus endangers at-risk children\n\nDespite their life-or-death duties, most of California's child welfare workers are now working from home because of the coronavirus. There have been consequences: Many abused children whom the child welfare agency for Los Angeles County deemed to be living under \"high\" or \"very high\" risk of renewed abuse were not visited for months, The Times has found.\n\nCaseworkers, meanwhile, say they have not been provided with the protective gear that would allow them to safely visit homes. \"We are in completely uncharted territory, and it concerns me greatly,\" said Bobby Cagle, the agency's director.\n\nIn other virus developments:\n\nThe State Department lifted its blanket advisory warning U.S. citizens against traveling abroad, but many countries continue to bar American visitors.\n\nThe number of migrants arrested along the U.S.-Mexico border more than doubled between April and July, after economic hardship made worse by the pandemic drove thousands northward.\n\n2. The challenges of rural police shootings\n\nPeople in rural parts of the U.S. are killed in police shootings at about the same rate as in cities. But in many small towns, where residents and officials have abiding support for law enforcement, victims' families and activists say they have struggled to get justice.\n\nThe Times's Jack Healy reported on a case in Sedalia, Mo., where an unarmed woman, Hannah Fizer, was shot and killed by a sheriff's deputy during a traffic stop in June. The deputy has not been charged or disciplined, and Fizer's parents say they have not received any updates about the investigation -- the sheriff even declined to tell them the deputy's name.\n\n3. New York sues the N.R.A.\n\nThe New York attorney general, Letitia James, filed a lawsuit Thursday seeking to dissolve the National Rifle Association. She said that years of corruption and misspending had irreparably undermined its ability to operate as a nonprofit, and accused its chief executive, Wayne LaPierre, of raiding N.R.A. funds to bankroll an extravagant lifestyle that included frequent trips to the Bahamas.\n\nThe attorney general of Washington, D.C., filed suit against the N.R.A. shortly after, alleging that the gun rights lobby had misused its charitable foundation's funds. In response, the N.R.A. filed its own suit against James's office and called the inquiry \"a power grab by a political opportunist.\"\n\n4. A century after suffrage\n\nOne hundred years ago this month, women in America won the right to vote, using tactics of protest and persuasion that would look familiar to activists today. The Times spoke to descendants of Ida B. Wells-Barnett, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other suffragists about the movement's legacy among Americans of all races, faiths and genders.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nPresident Trump signed executive orders barring transactions with TikTok and WeChat, two popular Chinese social media networks. The orders, which cited national security concerns, take effect in 45 days.\n\nThe U.S. government sent text messages to cellphones in Russia and Iran yesterday offering up to $10 million for information about people trying to attack American voting systems.\n\nThe authorities charged 24 pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong with taking part in a June vigil for victims of the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests.\n\nA former top Saudi official now living in exile claimed that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman sent operatives to Canada to kill him in 2018, shortly after Saudi agents murdered the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.\n\nBill Hagerty, Trump's former ambassador to Japan, won a bitterly divisive Republican Senate primary in Tennessee. The race pitted Trump, who endorsed Hagerty, against prominent conservatives like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul, who endorsed his chief opponent.\n\nLives Lived: Diana Russell, a leading feminist activist and scholar, was one of the earliest researchers to focus on sexual violence against women. She popularized the term \"femicide\" to highlight the killing of women \"because they are women.\" Gloria Steinem said Dr. Russell had \"a giant influence\" on the women's movement worldwide. She died at 81.\n\nIDEA OF THE DAY: Get ready for Election Week\n\nA surge of mail-in voting during the pandemic has turned elections into multiday -- and sometimes multiweek -- events. On Tuesday, New York certified the winners of two congressional primary races six weeks after the last votes were cast.\n\nThe delays aren't surprising; many states lack the infrastructure to quickly process large numbers of mail ballots. But the likelihood that it will take longer than usual to know the outcome of November's presidential election has some political observers worried.\n\nTrump has tweeted that the country \"must\" know the results on election night -- likely an impossible bar if the vote is close. Delays could give him an opening to undermine public faith in the outcome, writes The Washington Post's Amber Phillips.\n\nThe media isn't sufficiently girding the public for delays -- or for the misinformation that might flower over days or weeks of counting, our colleague Ben Smith argues.\n\nIf you're worried about delays, plan to obtain a mail ballot and return it early, writes Business Insider's Grace Panetta. Fortune's Nicole Goodkind has a guide to each state's deadlines around absentee voting.\n\nPLAY, WATCH, EAT, FARMNot your usual sourdough\n\nYou've likely seen them all over your social feeds: crusty, rustic-looking sourdough loaves many people have grown fond of baking with all that extra time at home. But sourdough starters can lend themselves to so much more, as evidenced in this recipe for Honduran pan de coco by the baker Bryan Ford.\n\nTraditionally made with coconut milk and whole-wheat flour, these buns incorporate a sourdough starter to add a delicious depth to the bread's flavors. Tear off a piece and dip it into your coffee for an afternoon treat.\n\nFarming influencers are here\n\nFor years, many small farmers have tried to find new ways to make a living beyond selling crops alone. \"The sleigh rides, the alpacas, the therapy ponies, the pick-your-own hemp,\" writes Ellen Barry, The Times's New England bureau chief. \"It is a new thing, though, to make farm life into reality TV.\"\n\nEnter the \"farmer-influencer.\" Whether it's uploading drone footage of sun-dappled farmland (\"land porn for wistful cubicle dwellers\") or slow-motion videos of geese, some farmers have found they can earn more by streaming snippets of rural life to a growing online audience.\n\nWatch something ... timely\n\nOur weekly suggestion from Gilbert Cruz, The Times's Culture editor:\n\nNormally I'm not inclined to recommend a movie or TV show if it requires doing some homework beforehand. But HBO's \"Watchmen\" requires just a little bit of essential pre-reading. (Try this piece to start.) And it's worth it. \"Watchmen\" was one of my favorite shows of 2019 and, last week, received more Emmy nominations than any other show.\n\nSet in Tulsa, Okla., where the police fight against white supremacists, the series exists in a world in which superheroes (well, one superhero) exist but are largely absent. \"Watchmen\" has many of the things I like in great TV -- superb performances, striking visuals and a comfort with not explaining everything all at once. Our chief TV critic wrote that it was \"arguably the show of the season well before the George Floyd protests underlined its relevance.\"\n\nDiversions\n\nIn this week's Modern Love, a woman questions what's so special about being married.\n\nWith no live crowd noise as a buffer at Major League Baseball, on-field sounds are easy to hear on broadcasts -- and it's not all rated PG.\n\nThe late-night comedy hosts weighed in on the lawsuit to dissolve the N.R.A.\n\nGames\n\nHere's today's Mini Crossword, and a clue: Francis is the first one from the Americas (four letters).\n\nOr try this week's news quiz.\n\nYou can find all of our puzzles here.\n\nSubscribers help make Times journalism possible.

The word \"hypercoagulable\" appeared for the first time in The Times, in an article on the symptoms of Covid-19, as noted by the Twitter bot @NYT_first_said.\n\nDavid Leonhardt, this newsletter's usual writer, is on break until Monday, Aug. 24.\n\nYou can see today's print front page here.\n\nToday's episode of \"The Daily\" includes an interview with the chief executive of Twitter, Jack Dorsey.\n\nLalena Fisher contributed to The Morning.

        "body": "JOHANNESBURG -- Africa's confirmed coronavirus cases have surpassed 1 million, but global health experts say the true toll is likely several times higher, reflecting the gaping lack of testing for the continent's 1.3 billion people.\n\nWhile experts say infection tolls in richer nations can be significant undercounts, large numbers of undetected cases are a greater danger for Africa, with many of the world's weakest health systems. More than 22,000 people have died of COVID-19.\n\nThe World Health Organization calls the milestone a \"pivotal point\" for Africa as infections in several countries are surging. The virus has spread beyond major cities \"into distant hinterlands\" where few health resources exist and reaching care could take days.\n\nImmediately knowing they were at a disadvantage, African nations banded together early in the pandemic to pursue badly needed testing and medical supplies and advocate for equitable access to any successful vaccine. Swift border closures delayed the virus' spread.\n\nBut Africa's most developed country, South Africa, has strained to cope as hospital beds fill up and confirmed cases are over a half-million, ranking fifth in the world. The country has Africa's most extensive testing and data collection, and yet a South African Medical Research Council report last week showed many COVID-19 deaths were going uncounted. Other deaths were attributed to other diseases as people avoid health centers and resources are diverted to the pandemic.\n\nIt's all a warning for Africa's other 53 countries of what might lie ahead. While dire early predictions for the pandemic have not played out, \"we think it's going to be here at a slow burn,\" the WHO's Africa chief, Matshidiso Moeti, said Thursday.\n\nJust two African countries at the start of the pandemic were equipped to test for the virus. Now virtually all have basic capacity, but supplies are often scarce. Some countries have a single testing machine. Some conduct fewer than 500 tests per million people, while richer countries overseas conduct hundreds of thousands. Samples can take days to reach labs. Even in South Africa, turnaround times for many test results have been a week or longer.\n\n\"We are fighting this disease in the dark,\" International Rescue Committee expert Stacey Mearns said. In addition, Africa has just 1,500 epidemiologists, a deficit of about 4,500.\n\nAfrican nations overall have conducted just 8.8 million tests since the pandemic began, well below the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's goal of 13 million per month. Countries would love to increase testing if only supplies weren't being snapped up by richer ones elsewhere.\n\nAfrica CDC director John Nkengasong said estimating the true number of cases on the continent is \"very tricky.\" Some 70% of infections are asymptomatic, he has said. Africa's young population also might be a factor. Without a dramatic increase in testing, \"there's much we don't know.\"\n\nBut some experts are making their best guesses.\n\nAfrica likely has at least 5 million infections, said Ridhwaan Suliman, a senior researcher at South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He believes the true number in South Africa alone is at least 3 million. The country has conducted far more tests than any other in Africa -- more than 3 million -- but in recent days about 25% have come back positive. Because of shortages, South Africa largely limits testing to health workers and those showing symptoms.\n\nExperts see South Africa as an indication of what's to come elsewhere.\n\nSema Sgaier, an assistant professor of global health at Harvard and director of the Surgo Foundation, thinks the number of infections across Africa could be more than 9 million. The U.S.-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation puts the number at more than 8 million. And Resolve to Save Lives, led by Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimates it could be 14 million.\n\nFor Resolve to Save Lives senior vice president Amanda McClelland, the more worrying number is not the overall cases but the health workers infected across Africa -- now about 35,000. That affects care for everyone on a continent whose shortage of workers has been called catastrophic.\n\nReflecting the pandemic's diverse nature across Africa, just five countries account for 75% of confirmed cases: South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana and Algeria. Nigeria alone could have had close to 1 million cases by now if Africa's most populous country hadn't acted quickly, the Africa CDC's Nkengasong said.\n\nStill, with insufficient testing, people live with the fear that loved ones may have had the virus without knowing for sure.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, Yaya Ouedraogo lost his uncle and cousin in April. Both were in their 70s with a history of high blood pressure and diabetes, and both had complained of shortness of breath, fever and body pain, he said.\n\n\"They had all the symptoms of coronavirus, but in certain areas no one was investigating it and they didn't get tested,\" he said.\n\nThe WHO Africa chief has said officials don't think the continent is seeing a \"silent huge epidemic,\" with thousands dying undetected, but she acknowledged under-reporting of cases.\n\n\"What we'd like to see -- to be able to be really confident -- is higher testing rates,\" Moeti told reporters last week, and she criticized the \"very distorted global market\" in which richer countries have the bulk of testing materials while poorer ones scrape by on just hundreds of tests a day.\n\nMoeti also worries about a related danger for which even less data exists: the number of deaths from diseases such as malaria, HIV and tuberculosis as resources are diverted to COVID-19.\n\nWhatever Africa's real coronavirus toll, one South African church has quietly been marking the country's \"known\" number of deaths by tying white ribbons to its fence. The project's founders say each ribbon really stands for multiple people.\n\nAlready, the Rev. Gavin Lock wonders about what to do when the length of fence runs out. Maybe they'll change the ribbons' color to represent 10 people, or 50.\n\n\"It's a work in progress,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sam Mednick in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "DAKAR, Senegal -- Africa is set to announce that it has stamped out wild poliovirus after a three-decade quest against a disease that once paralyzed 75,000 children on the continent every year.\n\nThe achievement is a major step toward ridding the globe of the virus that causes the disabling -- and sometimes deadly -- disease of polio: Only Afghanistan and Pakistan are still reporting cases.\n\n\"Future generations of African children can live free of wild poliovirus,\" Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's director for Africa, said in a briefing on Monday, adding that 1.8 million cases of polio-related paralysis had been prevented over the past 24 years.\n\nBut the victory has a hollow note: Every year, hundreds of people across Africa are still being infected with circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, which can infect people in areas where there is only partial vaccination. African cases of the vaccine-derived strain, which results in the same symptoms as the wild kind, increased to 320 last year from 68 in 2018, and could rise again in 2020 after many vaccination campaigns were paused during coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nThe polio-free certification applies to what the World Health Organization calls the Africa region -- one of its six global zones of operation -- which excludes North Africa. But no North African country has recorded a case of wild poliovirus since 2004, so the whole continent will now be free of it.\n\nThe 46 presidents of the region (there would have been 47, but the president of Mali was recently deposed in a coup) will celebrate along with supporters of polio eradication efforts, like the Microsoft founder Bill Gates and the Nigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote, on a video conference call on Tuesday.\n\nThe United States got free of wild polio in 1979. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative started in 1988, with the aim of eradicating polio worldwide by the year 2000.\n\nNigeria has been a major sticking point on the African continent. After northern Nigeria boycotted the vaccine in 2003 because of rumors about its safety, an outbreak there spread to 20 countries in five years.\n\nA huge effort was initiated to change minds about the vaccine, and by 2015, it seemed that the situation was under control and rumors sufficiently squashed. But then, in 2016, four new cases of wild poliovirus were reported.\n\nThe state they came from, Borno, northeastern Nigeria, was the site of a vicious insurgency by the extremist group Boko Haram, and getting to the people living there was extremely difficult, both because of the danger and because the Nigerian authorities frequently denied access for aid workers.\n\nBut after the four cases surfaced, the global health infrastructure swung into action. Nigeria's president instructed the military to work with the vaccination teams. A mammoth effort began, using satellite imagery, data analysis and daring methods of getting to seemingly impossible-to-reach children.\n\nDr. Pascal Mkanda, the World Health Organization's polio eradication coordinator for the Africa region, said, \"There's no program like the global eradication program. There's no program which uses so much data, so much innovation.\"\n\nVaccinators in Borno adopted a \"hit and run\" strategy. When the military told them an area was safe, they would start a campaign there within 48 hours. More than 800,000 children were vaccinated this way in 2016. Others were vaccinated at markets on the edge of Boko Haram-occupied territory, when they came to buy provisions. When they went back to their communities, Dr. Mkanda said, the vaccine went through their digestive systems and out into the environment, and other children, who had not been inoculated, could then pick it up and also become immune.\n\nCirculating vaccine-derived poliovirus spreads in the same way, except that the virus mutates over time and causes polio.\n\nFor example, say vaccinators go to a village to inoculate children. The children line up by the church or market and get some drops squeezed into their mouths. The drops include a live but weakened version of the virus, which attaches to receptors in the intestines and is absorbed. The weakened virus cannot cause paralysis but teaches the child's immune system to create antibodies that will fight the real thing if it were to come along.\n\nBut say some children did not get the message that day, or their parents distrusted the vaccine and kept them home, or the vaccinators had to leave early. If any stool from vaccinated children contaminates local drinking water -- or even a puddle that a child might splash in and then ingest -- the virus can immunize other children, too.\n\nVery rarely, however, the vaccine virus can mutate back into something resembling the wild kind. If that \"vaccine-derived\" mutant form keeps spreading because nearby villages are not fully vaccinated, it can, in a few cases -- about one infection in 200 -- paralyze a victim.\n\nThe name of that strain, circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus, gives the impression that it is contracted by being vaccinated. But that is not true.\n\n\"It's not very well named, because it sounds like you get it from the vaccine,\" said Heidi Larson, director of the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She added that there had been talk of altering the name to something less misleading, but that any change would probably take too long.\n\nWhile there has been success in Africa, there has been an increase in cases of wild poliovirus since 2018 in Afghanistan and Pakistan, where vaccinators are threatened with violence, and often killed.\n\n\"We need to look immediately at the most difficult circumstances, the most disadvantaged people, the most vulnerable people, the hardest to reach people -- because that's where we end up with the struggles at the end,\" said Dr. Moeti, the W.H.O. director for Africa.\n\nThere is a parallel to be drawn with the coronavirus pandemic, she said.\n\n\"Those people who have the hardest life circumstances for one reason or another are the worst affected in terms of the mortality due to Covid-19,\" she said, \"and we are learning this lesson repeatedly.\"",

        "body": "With 60 million households still uncounted, the bureau said it would wrap up the survey a month early. Critics called it a bald move to politicize the count in favor of Republicans.\n\nThe Census Bureau confirmed late Monday that it plans to cut four weeks from the schedule for finishing its count of the nation's 330 million residents, a turnabout that census experts said would deeply imperil an accurate tally of the population.\n\nIn a statement posted on its website, the bureau said the updated schedule \"reflects our continued commitment to conduct a complete count, provide accurate apportionment data, and protect the health and safety of the public and our work force.\"\n\nBut the change is a retreat from the bureau's statement only months ago that the pandemic had made it necessary to ask for more time to complete the count on schedule. And census experts have said that shortening the calendar for the count would wreak havoc with efforts to reach the very hardest-to-count households -- immigrants, minorities, young people and others -- that have long been flagged as most likely to be missed in this year's tally.\n\nCritics called it an unvarnished attempt by the Trump administration to twist the nation's population count to exclude groups that, by and large, tended to support Democrats.\n\nRepresentative Carolyn Maloney of New York, the Democratic chairwoman of the House Oversight committee that has jurisdiction over the census, said the new schedule would \"rush and politicize the 2020 Census\" in a letter sent Tuesday to Steven Dillingham, the Census Bureau director.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-04T16:15:16.376Z N.Y.C.'s health commissioner resigns after clashing with the mayor over the virus. 'Long days, long nights': Washington prepares for a prolonged fight over virus relief. Israel's rocky reopening of its schools may be a lesson for the U.S. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nMs. Maloney noted that Mr. Dillingham did not mention the schedule change in testimony to the committee last week, and said she would summon career Census Bureau experts to testify about the impact of the change.\n\n\"This is a whole systemic attack on the census for political gain,\" Julie Menin, the census director for New York City, said in an interview. \"There's an intentional attempt here to basically steal the census -- to politicize this census to gain Republican seats across the country.\"\n\nThe bureau has offered no explanation for the change. But outside experts said the explanation was clearly rooted in politics -- in particular, in a demand by Mr. Trump last month to exclude undocumented immigrants from the population totals that are used every 10 years to reallocate House seats among the states.\n\nSlammed by the pandemic, the Census Bureau had said earlier that it wanted to delay its final delivery of population totals to the White House until April 2021, rather than the statutory deadline of December 31. The speedup announced late Monday effectively rescinds that request and assumes that the totals will be delivered by year's end -- before any new president or Congress might take office.\n\nThat gives the White House its best opportunity to act on Mr. Trump's effort to remove undocumented immigrants from the reapportionment totals, assuming that a lawsuit challenging his directive fails. Many legal experts said the president's demand for altered population totals would violate the constitution, which calls for a count of all the nation's residents.\n\nThe Census Bureau already has collected information from roughly 63 percent of the nation's households, all of which completed the 2020 survey online, by mail or by telephone. The schedule change announced Monday primarily affects the count of some 60 million households that have failed to fill out census forms, but it also compresses the time left for tallying a number of other groups, including the homeless and residents of group quarters like nursing homes and dormitories.\n\nAll of those counts normally would be completed this month, and some of them well before that. In mid-April, however, the Census Bureau said that delays caused by the pandemic had forced it to extend the deadline to October 31.\n\nThe latest schedule change will move that deadline up by one month, to September 30. The effect is to shorten to six weeks what had been a 10-week period reserved for completing the count, so that the data can be compiled and processed in time to deliver population totals by year's end.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 3, 2020\n\nI'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Is the coronavirus airborne?The coronavirus can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. It's unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization.\n\nBeyond reversing the bureau's request for a delay in April, the decision to compress the schedule also effectively overrides recent public statements by senior career employees at the Census Bureau that delivering accurate population totals by December 31 would be impossible.\n\n\"We can't do that anymore,\" the census official leading field operations for the count, Tim Olson, told a Native American organization during a webinar in May. The associate director of the census, Albert E. Fontenot Jr., echoed that last month, saying \"we are past the window of being able to get those counts\" by year's end.\n\nThe Census Bureau said in its announcement that it plans to mount \"a robust field data collection operation\" to meet the new deadline, and that it would be able to complete the 2020 census in a short time \"without sacrificing completeness.\" But beyond saying it would hire more people and give its army of door-knockers awards for extra work, it has offered few details of how it plans to meet the new goal.\n\nOutside experts, including directors of past censuses, have said a shortened count would inevitably fail to reach many of the hard-to-count households in both inner cities and rural areas, and that the bureau would be forced to use statistical techniques to make educated guesses about who lived in them.\n\nSerious inaccuracies would not only affect numbers used to reapportion and redraw political districts, but also would skew the baseline that will be used to allot trillions of dollars in federal grants and other aid to the states until the next census in 2030.",

        "body": "These athletes did not test positive for the coronavirus themselves, but they had close contact with an infected athlete who has been withdrawn from the tournament.\n\nYou might think Kristina Mladenovic would have been nothing but delighted on Monday after winning her first match in the first Grand Slam tennis tournament since the coronavirus pandemic disrupted tennis.\n\nBut her mood was much more mixed.\n\n\"We got some bad news two days ago, and since then I've been living in a nightmare,\" Mladenovic, who is seeded 30th, said after defeating Hailey Baptiste, an 18-year-old American, at the United States Open.\n\nAfter Mladenovic's French compatriot Beno\u00eet Paire tested positive for the virus and was withdrawn from the tournament and isolated in the official hotel, several other players in the field, including Mladenovic, Adrian Mannarino and the French doubles specialist \u00c9douard Roger-Vasselin, were determined by tournament health officials to have had close contact with Paire.\n\nBut instead of being forced to withdraw, those players were asked to sign a revised agreement to remain in the U.S. Open. Mannarino, a Frenchman who also won his first-round match on Monday, said he had only signed on Sunday evening. \"I didn't sleep much,\" he said. \"I am drained mentally.\"\n\nThe agreement, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times, requires players to submit to daily coronavirus testing instead of being tested every four days, like the rest of the players. It also strictly limits their movements and behavior inside the controlled environment that has been established at the tournament site and player hotel -- with even greater restrictions than those already imposed on all players.\n\nPlayers who sign the new document are required to stay in their hotel rooms unless traveling to the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, and they no longer have access to common areas.\n\nNo visitors are permitted in their rooms. At the tennis center, access to locker rooms and dining areas is prohibited, and the players who sign the agreement must use separate fitness, training and warm-up areas -- and only by appointment.\n\nThey will still have access to their designated practice court or match court.\n\n\"It's literally a bubble in a bubble,\" Mladenovic said.\n\nThe players who sign the revised protocol are also required to \"strictly adhere\" to the requirement to wear masks at all times \"both indoors and outdoors, which also includes isolation areas.\"\n\nThough the names of the players who have signed the agreement have not been released publicly, the majority are French, according to a tennis official familiar with the list. L'Equipe, a French newspaper, reported that other players determined to have close contact with Paire include the French men's players Richard Gasquet and Gr\u00e9goire Barr\u00e8re.\n\nSports and the Virus\n\nUpdated Aug. 31, 2020\n\nHere's what's happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to life:\n\nNew York City is used to holding so many big events, but what is possible with the coronavirus? As the United States Open begins on Monday under a microscope, the answer could be at hand.Limitations imposed by the coronavirus have helped, not hurt, the performances of some world-class athletes.The coronavirus has forced the Tour de France, a race celebrated for its accessibility, to embrace social distancing.\n\nMladenovic said she practiced once with Paire for an hour in New York. \"Obviously we were on opposite sides of the court,\" she said. She said she also spent \"30 to 45 minutes\" in the hotel lobby playing cards with a group of people that included Paire.\n\n\"I didn't spend much time with him, to be honest,\" she said. \"I think all in all, it was like an hour and a half, so I kind of feel very unlucky there. Apparently the practice doesn't count, and it's just the fact I spent 30 minutes with him being part of that big table of people and of course we had masks on.\"\n\nMladenovic said she had tested negative twice since Paire's positive test.\n\n\"It's tough for me to accept the thing because it's not like I'm any close entourage with him, but I feel very sorry and bad for him,\" she said.\n\nStacey Allaster, the U.S. Open tournament director, confirmed that the group of players had been allowed to play on.\n\n\"As soon as a positive test happens, the infected person is immediately isolated,\" she told ESPN on Monday. \"And then the discussion is around who have they been with, what setting, for how long, wearing a mask or not a mask, what distance? And our doctors gathered that information quickly.\"\n\nAllaster said the decision for the new protocols was made in concert with New York City health officials.\n\nIn an Instagram post on Monday evening, Paire said: \"I am doing well for now and I don't have symptoms. I hesitate to tell you what is really happening in this FAKE BUBBLE.\"\n\nAllaster said there was no way to determine how and when Paire might have caught the virus. \"We will never know,\" she said. \"It's definitely in his system. He's been isolated. Everyone else is isolated from him, and he's asymptomatic and is being taken care of.\"\n\nThe decision to offer players the option to sign the revised agreement raises the question of why Guido Pella and Hugo Dellien were not offered the same option when their fitness trainer, Juan Manuel Galv\u00e1n, tested positive for the virus before the Western & Southern Open, a tournament that preceded the U.S. Open at the same site.\n\nPella, an Argentine, was withdrawn from the main draw; Dellien, a Bolivian, from the qualifying tournament. Both were required to quarantine for 14 days at the player hotel. Neither tested positive for the virus before or during that period. They were gradually allowed more freedom of movement, including the ability to practice on court. Both are expected to play in the U.S. Open starting Tuesday.\n\n\"It seems if they let the French play, they should have done the same for Guido and Hugo,\" Juan Ignacio Londero, an Argentine, said after his first-round victory on Monday. \"It's not that I don't want the French to play, but it seems a bit unfair, that's all.\"",

        "body": "Berlin - Russia's most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny, arrived in Berlin for treatment Saturday after falling into a coma in Siberia in what his family and supporters suspect was a deliberate poisoning weeks before nationwide local elections.\n\nNavalny was admitted to Charit\u00e9, one of Germany's leading medical research facilities, where he was undergoing extensive diagnostic tests, the hospital said after a plane transporting him from Russia touched down. He arrived more than 48 hours after he first lost consciousness, a delay his supporters bitterly criticized Russian officials for having caused.\n\n\"Patient stable, mission accomplished,\" said Jaka Bizilj, who runs the Cinema for Peace, the foundation that organized the air transport at the urging of Navalny's friends and family.\n\nNavalny became violently ill Thursday shortly after a Moscow-bound flight he had boarded took off, forcing an emergency landing in the Siberian city of Omsk.\n\nThe sudden illness struck Navalny, who is the most persistent critic of President Vladimir Putin of Russia, just as popular uprisings have sprung up in Russia's Far East and in neighboring Belarus -- and only weeks before Russians vote in municipal elections Sept. 13.\n\nHow it will affect the political scene, analysts in Russia said, will hinge in part on Navalny's longer-term condition and whether he will be able to return home.\n\n\"Sometimes, instances that are publicly perceived as political terror do demoralize the opposition,\" Ekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political analyst, said in an interview, \"and at other times they motivate people to protest or, at the least, to vote in protest.\"\n\nIf Navalny remains in Germany for a lengthy recovery, or indefinitely as a political exile, the Kremlin stands to benefit politically, she said.\n\n\"It is very useful to have an opposition figure in exile,\" Schulmann said. \"He can be cast in the state media as a person who fled Russia. They can present it as unpatriotic behavior.\"\n\nIn the days before he fell ill, Navalny had been meeting with opposition candidates in Novosibirsk, Siberia's largest city, promoting a strategy he called \"smart voting\" that encourages multiple, small opposition movements to back a single candidate on a local ballot.\n\nThe strategy seeks to chip away at the dominance of the pro-government party, United Russia, in city councils and regional parliaments.\n\nPutin's popularity has been in decline for the past two years as nationalist fervor over the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine has faded and as the economy has slumped under sanctions and then coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nUpon landing in Berlin, Navalny's plane was met by an ambulance that took him, under police escort, to the hospital where doctors began extensive testing to determine what may have caused the illness and how to treat it. Several police officers were stationed outside the hospital throughout the day.\n\nThe examinations, said Manuela Zingl, a spokeswoman for Charit\u00e9, \"will take some time.\"\n\nNavalny is being treated at the same hospital where Pyotr Verzilov, a member of the Russian protest group Pussy Riot, was admitted in 2018. Doctors said at the time that he likely had been poisoned.\n\nSpeaking to reporters via video link Friday, Verzilov said his own symptoms had mirrored those of Navalny, including a loss of consciousness and his slipping into a coma several hours after the suspected poisoning.\n\n\"The similarities are striking, not only in the medical condition but in the behavior of the Russian government and doctors,\" Verzilov said, pointing out that his own transfer from Russia was delayed more than two days.\n\nSuch delays by Russian officials, critics say, are intended to make it harder to determine what substance has been ingested.\n\nNavalny collapsed in agonizing pain Thursday shortly after takeoff on what was to have been a 2,000-mile flight to Moscow. His family suspects that poison may have been added to a cup of tea he drank in the airport before boarding that flight.\n\nHis evacuation came only after long hours of wrangling with Russian doctors and officials, who had insisted that a transfer to Germany would endanger Navalny's health. But German doctors, who had arrived in Omsk on the air ambulance, were granted access to Navalny on Friday afternoon, and they stated unequivocally that it was safe for him to travel.\n\nNavalny's wife, Yulia, who had sent Putin a letter Friday requesting permission to evacuate her husband, was allowed to accompany him to Germany.\n\nThe Russian authorities said tests for toxins in Navalny's blood were all negative, indicating they found no evidence he was poisoned. At a news conference Friday, Dr. Alexander Murakhovsky said Navalny had suffered an \"imbalance in carbohydrates, that is, metabolic disorder,\" possibly caused by low blood sugar.\n\nNavalny's wife and personal doctor quickly dismissed this account, saying the idea that an otherwise healthy 44-year-old would collapse and fall into a dayslong coma from low blood sugar was ridiculous.\n\nIf Navalny is found to have ingested dangerous toxins, he would become the latest prominent Kremlin critic to have been the victim of a poisoning.\n\nA fatal dose of the radioactive substance polonium 210 was used against Alexander Litvinenko, and a nerve agent called Novichok against Sergei Skripal, both former Russian intelligence officers attacked in England. Former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko fell ill from a dioxin, and Vladimir Kara-Murza, a Russian journalist who lobbied in the West for sanctions against Kremlin operatives, said unknown toxins were used against him.\n\nThe people who ordered the attacks have never been identified, despite efforts to take cases to higher courts, including the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nOfficials in Berlin did not immediately comment on Navalny's arrival. But in offering this past week to allow the opposition leader into Germany for medical treatment, Chancellor Angela Merkel called for a thorough investigation.\n\n\"What is particularly important is that the circumstances behind this are cleared up very quickly,\" Merkel said. \"We insist on this, because what we have heard so far is very unfavorable.\"\n\nNavalny has been treated abroad previously, after an attack in 2017 in which a caustic liquid was thrown in his face, partially blinding him in one eye. He resumed his political activities almost without interruption. Dozens of arrests and short spells in jail have also failed to deter him.\n\nStill, violence by pro-Kremlin activists and arrests for administrative offenses have kept him out of sight for important events like protests and elections. Navalny will now be absent from campaigning before the September local elections.",

        "body": "Mr. Breitfeld was determined to attend this year's antiquarian book fair in New York City. He began to sicken as he flew home, and died of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThis obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here.\n\nFor the past two decades, Alfredo Breitfeld, a rare bookseller from Buenos Aires, had attended the New York International Antiquarian Book Fair, an annual bonanza for those who love the printed word.\n\nAll year, every year, the gregarious and courtly Mr. Breitfeld, whose specialty was Spanish material, looked forward to the fair, held each March at the New York Armory. This year was no different, though health issues, including a bad knee, had impeded his mobility, and though, as he prepared for the trip in mid-February, the novel coronavirus was beginning to be a concern in the United States.\n\nHe went anyway, along with 200 or so other dealers to attend the fair -- which attracted 10,000 attendees -- from March 5 to 9. Mr. Breitfeld was seen zipping around on a scooter through the armory's vast Drill Hall because of his bad knee.\n\nHe was one of a half dozen dealers who came down with Covid- 19, becoming sick even as he flew home. He died of the virus on July 11 after 120 days on a ventilator. He was 82. His son Gustavo confirmed his death.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T20:34:05.109Z 'No second chances': Colleges are coming down hard on students who violate virus restrictions. Send children to school? Democrats are more reluctant than Republicans, a survey finds. A February conference in Boston led to the infection of tens of thousands around the world, a study shows. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nMr. Breitfeld was born on Dec. 11, 1937, in Montevideo, Uruguay. His father, Isidro, was a distributor of mint candies; his mother, Gisela Grunhut, a homemaker. Alfredo began to study medicine, but dropped out to start a business selling photocopied medical texts in front of a medical school.\n\n\"He was a brilliant man but a terrible student,\" Gustavo Breitfeld said.\n\nThe business was so successful, he opened a small publishing house for medical texts, Delta Editoriale. \"And then someone put a rare book in his hand,\" his son said. As Mr. Breitfeld put it in a 2008 interview with the Bookdealer, a journal for the antiquarian book trade, \"It was a case of 'amor a prima vista.'\"\n\nIn 1973, he opened Librer\u00eda De Anta\u00f1o -- which translates roughly to \"a bookstore of old times\" -- in Buenos Aires. (His wife, Susana, is from Argentina.) It was a large, beautiful and not exactly organized space, 10 rooms of floor-to-ceiling books, \"a nice mess with no system,\" Gustavo said, although his father had no trouble remembering where each of the 30,000 books was located.\n\nGustavo Breitfeld, who joined his father in the business, organized the stock; in 2010, they moved to a third-floor space in an Art Deco building in the Recoleta neighborhood of Buenos Aires.\n\nThe shop sells works related to the Spanish-speaking world, from the 16th to the 20th centuries. Mr. Breitfeld had a particular fondness for early editions from Mexico, where the history of printing in the Americas began. North America's first printing press was in Mexico City in 1539.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIn addition to his wife and son Gustavo, Mr. Breitfeld is survived by another son, Marcelo, and a sister, Fela Breitfeld.\n\n\"There are several universes in this business,\" Mr. Breitfeld told The Bookdealer, \"and it is a constant challenge as one discovery leads on to the next. First you encounter the universe of 'small' books for general reading purposes, and then you move out into the rarefied world of good, very good and impossibly scarce books until you are thoroughly poisoned by the urge to explore ever further afield.\"\n\n\"I'm not pessimistic about the future of the rare book trade,\" Mr. Breitfeld continued. \"I cannot imagine a time when one of my clients will start to tremble and perspire holding in his hands a first electronic version of 'Don Quijote de La Mancha.'\"",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Amtrak, the passenger railroad agency, will furlough over 2,000 workers in the coming weeks because of a steep decline in ridership and revenue caused by the coronavirus pandemic, according to company officials.\n\nThe job cuts represent nearly 10 percent of Amtrak's roughly 20,000-member work force and will take effect as the agency begins its new fiscal year, which starts in October. The rail agency will cut 1,950 workers from its unionized work force and 100 employees from its management ranks. Cuts among union jobs could increase or decrease by 2 percent, officials noted in an internal email.\n\nThe reductions come as Amtrak's response to historic fiscal challenges receives scrutiny from rail advocates and federal lawmakers.\n\nCritics say the agency should focus less on cuts to its work force and declines in service and instead ensure the rail network operates close to normal at a time when it is seen as an attractive alternative to air travel. In some areas of the United States, Amtrak provides the lone mode of public transportation, rail advocates say.\n\n\"Amtrak's announcement that they will furlough over 2,000 employees is disappointing and unacceptable,\" said Representative Daniel Lipinski, Democrat of Illinois and a member of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. \"Amtrak workers provide an essential service to travelers and communities. These workers deserve better from Amtrak leadership.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T21:26:53.851Z The C.D.C. tells health officials to be ready to distribute a vaccine by November, raising concerns over politicized timing. There has been virus fallout from the Sturgis rally: A death in Minnesota, cases in South Dakota and more. New studies show inexpensive steroid drugs can help critically sick people survive Covid-19. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nIn a statement, an Amtrak spokeswoman said the job cuts were necessary because the rail agency was experiencing \"slow recovery of ridership and revenue\" from the pandemic. Amtrak receives federal funds but is independently run.\n\nSince March, ridership on Amtrak has fallen by 95 percent, and projected revenue for 2021 has declined by 50 percent. In response, Congress has bailed out the rail network with nearly $1 billion in emergency funds. But William J. Flynn, Amtrak's chief executive, has asked lawmakers for an additional $1.4 billion in emergency funds, predicting revenue and ridership will continue to remain low into 2021.\n\nMr. Flynn has told congressional leadership that Amtrak is prepared to cut $500 million in operating costs if it does not receive more emergency funding. In June, he outlined a plan that would cut up to 20 percent of the company's work force and reduce service on long-distance routes that serve the middle of the country.\n\nFederal lawmakers responded with intense skepticism, asking why Amtrak needed to enact such steep cuts when it had already received nearly $1 billion in emergency aid. The agency's request for an additional $1.4 billion is on top of its standard $2 billion budget request for 2021.\n\n\"We are deeply concerned by the downsizing plan,\" a bipartisan coalition of seven senators wrote in a letter to Amtrak. \"These cuts would not only dramatically reduce the utility of the nation's passenger rail network, but would also ignore congressional intent to expedite economic recovery following the pandemic.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nCritics are particularly concerned about Amtrak's plan to reduce daily service on its long-distance train network to three times per week. They say any cuts to long-distance routes, which run across parts of the Southern, mountain and Western regions, would make the company a less reliable and less attractive option to travelers who depend on the network.\n\nAdvocates note that long-distance routes across the country are faring better than on those that were more popular before the pandemic began, including shorter routes like those in the Northeast Corridor.\n\nLong-distance ridership is down 62 percent compared with the same period last year, while ridership on those relatively shorter routes through more urban areas is down more than 80 percent, according to an analysis by industry experts.\n\nOthers point to Amtrak's statements from as far back as 2000, in which its leadership said attempts to reduce long-distance service \"ended up costing the company more in lost revenue than we were able to take out in the way of expenses\" because some fixed costs could not be cut even after reducing service to three days a week.\n\nHouse lawmakers will hold a hearing next week to discuss Amtrak's response to the pandemic.",

        "body": "POZZALLO, Italy -- As the summer vacation season draws to a close in Italy, a flare-up of Covid-19 cases is fueling a surge in anti-immigrant sentiment, even though the government says that migrants are just a small part of the problem.\n\nSicily's president, Nello Musumeci, ordered the closure of all migrant centers on the island last weekend, saying it was impossible to prevent the spread of the illness at the facilities. And although a court blocked him, saying that he did not have the authority to close them, his order underlined the challenges Italy faces as right-wing politicians seek to rekindle a polarizing debate about immigration in a country hit hard by the pandemic.\n\nIn Pozzallo, a town in southern Sicily that has the highest rate of infection among newly arrived migrants, Roberto Ammatuna, the center-left mayor, has found himself trying to balance fears of a coronavirus influx with an obligation to rescue migrants in distress at sea.\n\n\"Our citizens need to feel safe and protected, because we are here in the front lines of Europe,\" he said in an interview in his office overlooking the turquoise waters of the Mediterranean. \"No one wants migrants who are sick with Covid,\" but, he said, \"we can't stop rescuing people at sea.\"\n\nIn one week in August, 73 migrants tested positive out of about 200 quarantined in Pozzallo. About 11,700 migrants have reached Sicily since June, and 3 percent either tested positive upon arrival or during the quarantine period that the Italian authorities imposed inside shelters.\n\nBut Franco Locatelli, the president of Italy's Superior Health Council, a government advisory body, said migrants' role in bringing Covid-19 back to Italy was \"minimal.\"\n\nIn the first two weeks of August, around 25 percent of new infections registered in the country were imported from abroad, according to Italy's National Health Institute. Over half of those were Italians who had traveled abroad, and many others were foreigners who already lived in Italy and were returning to the country.\n\nLess than 5 percent of the total were new immigrants, according to Italy's Health Ministry.\n\nItaly was one of the worst-hit countries when the coronavirus struck Europe this year, with over 35,000 deaths recorded, before a strict lockdown helped reduce the outbreak's spread. Controls were gradually lifted as summer approached, and a surge of new cases arose, often linked to young people gathering in crowded nightclubs.\n\nAlthough there have been outbreaks in migrant centers, the seasonal summer flow of migrants heading for Italy across the Mediterranean and from Eastern Europe has intensified fears of a more general resurgence of the virus.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T14:39:24.040Z 'We are incredibly concerned': A group of local health departments urges the C.D.C. to pull its new guidance on testing. For many schools in the U.S., returning to the classroom means a stop in the courtroom. Trump promises a vaccine by the end of the year, and boasts of his pandemic response. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nLast weekend, a ship carrying hundreds of migrants from Africa and the Middle East, about 20 of whom had tested positive for Covid-19, circled the waters around Sicily. They were turned away by mayor after mayor, before eventually docking in Augusta, in the southeast.\n\n\"Outlaw state,\" Matteo Salvini, the leader of the anti-immigrant League party and a former interior minister, said of Sicily on Twitter this week. \"An invasion of illegal migrants, a boom of infections, Sicily is collapsing. \"\n\nThe message being pushed by Mr. Salvini, whose political rise was forged by stoking fears of immigration and criminality before he and his party were ousted from the government last year, has been taken up by other right-wing politicians, even as the League has declined in popularity.\n\n\"We can't afford that this land, after all its efforts and the success in the fight against the pandemic, finds itself in a difficult situation because of the lack of controls,\" said Massimiliano Fedriga, a League member and president of the Friuli Venezia Giulia region.\n\nMr. Fedriga was speaking at a rally outside a facility in the northeastern city Udine from which nine had escaped. The center, designed for 320 people but hosting 460 asylum seekers, had been put under quarantine after several coronavirus cases were discovered there.\n\nMany Italians say the real issue regarding migrants is the need to limit the spread of the virus at existing centers, which are not designed to quarantine and isolate people.\n\n\"There is no explosion of arrivals,\" Gianfranco Schiavone, the vice president of the Association of Juridical Studies on Immigration, said in a telephone interview. \"The big difference, however, is the complexity of managing arrivals, with isolation and quarantine.\"\n\nShowers and bathrooms for six people are generally adequate in such centers, said Carmelo Lauretta, a doctor in charge of disease control in the Pozzallo area. \"But not for Covid.\"\n\nThis month, Italy's government banned dancing in nightclubs and dancing halls, recognizing that people were letting down their guard. Many regions introduced testing at ports, airports and train stations. But controlling the spread of virus among the roughly 60,700 migrants who live in large shelters scattered throughout the country has been a bigger challenge.\n\n\"Foreigners in Italy are more in danger of getting sick, because they are more segregated, live in poorer hygienic conditions and in large groups,\" Matteo Villa, an immigration researcher with Italy's Institute for International Political Studies, said in a telephone interview. \"But that has to do with segregation, not with their ethnicity or origin.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear.

In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIn early August, the virus spread through a migrant center in Treviso, in northern Italy, infecting 256 of the 293 people housed there, making it one of the country's biggest recent coronavirus clusters.\n\n\"Everybody got it,\" Baxso Sanyang, a 28-year-old Gambian migrant who shared a room with two young men who had tested positive before catching the virus himself, said in a telephone interview. \"There was no choice.\"\n\nMario Conte, the mayor of Treviso, from Mr. Salvini's party, said that given the conditions in the center, the spread was inevitable. \"This shows a failure by the state,\" he said.\n\nKeeping nearly 300 people in one place is \"already complicated when things are normal,\" he said. But with Covid, \"it is completely unmanageable.\"\n\nMany of the migrants coming to Italy are passing through the Western Balkans as the easing of anti-Covid measures allows them to travel from Greece, through Italy and then to northern Europe. Right-wing regional governments in Italy have asked Rome to close down small crossings with neighboring Slovenia and are increasingly sending people back across the border.\n\nAmong those trying to cross into Italy was Shahid Mehmood, 23, from Pakistan, who was sent back to Slovenia in June.\n\n\"When I told my parents Italy pushed me back, they didn't believe me, because they said Italy doesn't push back,\" he said by telephone from the camp in Bosnia where he later ended up. \"But that changed with coronavirus.\"\n\nEven as some politicians stir up anti-immigrant sentiments, many Italians say they are far more concerned about people throughout the country letting down their guards after travel links reopened, despite required testing for those coming from many destinations.\n\nIn Pozzallo, a 800-passenger boat now offers fast daily connections with Malta, which Italy considers risky after a recent coronavirus outbreak there.\n\n\"I am more worried about that and the young going to parties and discos with no face masks to find out two days later that they have Covid,\" said Isabel Gugliotta, 17, sitting at a Pozzallo beach bar.\n\n\"Why should I worry about migrants?\" she said. \"Any person can transmit it. We all simply need to act responsibly.\"",

        "body": "TARIJA, Bolivia -- So many people were dying that the government's numbers couldn't be accurate.\n\nCalls to pick up bodies were inundating Bolivia's forensic office. By July, agents were gathering up to 150 bodies per day, 15 times the normal amount in previous years, said the country's chief forensic official, Andr\u00e9s Flores.\n\nThe demand on his office suggested that the official tally of Covid-19 deaths -- now just over 4,300 -- was a vast undercount, Mr. Flores said. But with limited testing, scarce resources, and a political crisis tearing the country apart, the extra lives lost were going largely unrecognized.\n\nNew mortality figures reviewed by The Times suggest that the real death toll during the outbreak is nearly five times the official tally, indicating Bolivia has suffered one of the world's worst epidemics. The extraordinary rise in death, adjusted for its population, is more than twice as high as that of the United States, and far higher than the levels in Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\nAbout 20,000 more people have died since June than in past years, according to a Times analysis of registration data from Bolivia's Civil Registry, a vast number in a country of only about 11 million people.\n\nTracking deaths from all causes gives a more accurate picture of the pandemic's true toll, demographers say, because it does not depend on testing, which has been very limited in Bolivia. The mortality figures include people who may have died from Covid-19 and from other causes because they couldn't get health care.\n\n\"This is a very cruel situation that we're living through,\" said Mr. Flores, who heads the Institute of Forensic Investigations. \"We've been left completely exposed.\"\n\nWith a bare-bones health system, a decentralized government and poor infrastructure, Bolivia struggled to contain infectious diseases such as dengue even before the coronavirus arrived, said Virgilio Prieto, an epidemiologist at Bolivia's Health Ministry.\n\nBut its ability to respond was undermined by a contested election that led to the ouster in November of the then-president, Evo Morales, a socialist. An interim president, Jeanine A\u00f1ez, a conservative, stepped in with a promise to govern until elections could be held.\n\nSince then, Ms. A\u00f1ez has announced that she is running for the office -- and asked the electoral board to postpone the new vote, saying the pandemic made it unsafe for the population to go to the polls. The rescheduling of the vote from May to October has enraged opposition groups, who see it as an attempt by the caretaker president to cling to power.\n\n\"She is not recognized as a legitimate leader, which makes it extremely difficult to coordinate a complex response that the pandemic requires,\" said Santiago Anria, a Bolivia expert at the Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.\n\nMs. A\u00f1ez's decision to run for president herself antagonized the opposition lawmakers and regional officials on whom she depended to mobilize health care resources, said Mr. Anria, leading to a disorganized, ineffective effort.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-22T07:18:21.478Z A new C.D.C. report suggests that child-care centers may reopen safely in areas where the virus is contained. U.S. universities have been trying to prepare for months, but outbreaks are forcing last-minute changes. Trump administration says some coronavirus tests can bypass F.D.A. scrutiny. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nHer response was also bogged down by corruption scandals, including the arrest of her health minister in May after investigators accused him of using money from international donors to buy hospital ventilators at twice the real cost.\n\nMs. A\u00f1ez defended her approach to the outbreak, saying that her decision to enact a swift lockdown avoided an even greater loss of life. She also blamed Mr. Morales's party for mismanaging the health care system during its 14 years in office and stifling her plans to boost public spending in the pandemic.\n\n\"We did more in three months than what was done in the history of health care of this country,\" she wrote in a Twitter post this month.\n\nMore than a hundred road blocks by labor unions and Mr. Morales's supporters have paralyzed an already weakened economy, leaving the government with fewer resources to import urgently needed medical supplies. The shortages of oxygen and other equipment caused by the road blocks resulted in the deaths of at least 30 patients, the government said in a report to the Organization of American States.\n\nAs hospitals ran out of medicines and coronavirus tests, Mr. Morales's allies in congress passed a law to allow the medical use of a bleaching agent, chlorine dioxide -- an unproven and potentially dangerous coronavirus treatment popular among Bolivians.\n\n\"The pandemic has found us in a very precarious situation, with an inexperienced government and elevated political tensions,\" said Franklin Pareja, a political scientist at the San Andr\u00e9s Major University in La Paz. \"This political standoff has a cost in lives.\"\n\nIn Bolivia's political center, the La Paz region, five times as many people died in July than in past years, according to the data, a rate comparable with Madrid's during its worst month. In the tropical plains region of Beni, more than seven times as many people died as normal, a number surpassing Bergamo, Italy, during its peak.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 17, 2020\n\nWhy does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nAlthough Bolivia's official statistics show a severe spike in mortality starting in July, the closure of government offices during a lockdown in April meant that almost no deaths were registered that month. Officials at Bolivia's Civil Registry, which issues death certificates, warned that at least some of the deaths that occurred in April could have been registered in later months, potentially skewing the mortality rate.\n\nThe scale of the mortality spike, however, is confirmed by Bolivia's overwhelmed crematories, cemeteries and body-collection agencies.\n\nThe spike in deaths had collapsed Bolivian hospitals and forced local authorities to expand their crematories and open new cemeteries. In La Paz's municipal cemetery, residents and hearses had to line up outside the entry last week for a chance to bury their loved ones.\n\nIn Bolivia's capital, Sucre, local health authorities said they had to stack up dozens of bodies in morgues, hospitals and even the local university, until they were able to install a new crematory oven to meet the demand. And in the central city of Cochabamba, families had to keep bodies of their loved ones at home for days because local funeral parlors and crematories could not handle the increase.\n\n\"The health system is saturated,\" said the Health Ministry's chief epidemiologist, Mr. Prieto. \"We don't have enough capacity, equipment or the intensive care units required.\"\n\nDespite the crisis, some regional governments, under pressure to restart the economy before the elections, are reopening gyms and restaurants, feeding fears that mortality rates will continue to rise. The Health Ministry estimates that the country will only reach the peak of the pandemic in September.\n\nAnd in the meantime, the population will continue to bear the burden of Bolivia's ineffective response.\n\nWhen Josu\u00e9 Jallaza, a 24-year-old taxi driver in Cochabamba, fell sick with coronavirus symptoms, his family called three times for a doctor, but no one ever came. After he fainted, his family took him to a hospital, \"but they didn't want to admit us,\" said his brother, Marcelo Jallaza.\n\n\"They threw us out like a dog,\" Mr. Jallaza said.\n\nThey then took him to a private clinic, where \"a doctor came out, looked into his eyes, and said, 'He's already dead, we can't do anything,'\" said Mr. Jallaza.\n\nThe family took the body home, and spent four days trying to bury it. After pleading in tears with cemetery officials, they were finally granted a grave.",

        "body": "The coronavirus has retreated in New York, but the rituals of September are disrupted, and a sense of foreboding remains about a possible second wave.\n\nIn March and April, as ambulances raced through neighborhoods and refrigerated trucks sat humming behind hospitals overwhelmed by the pandemic's dead, summer seemed a distant fantasy. Then it arrived as promised: The city unveiled in a series of phases that brought its streets back to something closer to life.\n\nThe coronavirus infections dropped, the curve flattened, dinner and drinks were served beneath the stars, and friends reunited in parks and on beaches as if home from a war.\n\nBut throughout the city, between the elbow bumps and happy hours, lurked a deep and intense anxiety over what might lie ahead, as summer gave way to autumn and a new rash of frightening unknowns.\n\nSeptember, always both an ending and a beginning, seems this year almost impossibly fraught, its usual rhythms -- back to school, back to work -- upended.\n\nIn interviews, New Yorkers, even as they leaned into summer activities and visited parks and cafes, shared a common foreboding that looked beyond the virus itself. Schools, the economy, crime, food, shelter, travel and access to family, planning a vacation -- nothing feels like a given in these waning days of August.\n\n\"I don't think it's going to get better,\" said Angel Vasquez, 39, a data processor, visiting Bush Terminal Piers Park in Brooklyn with his three young daughters. \"I think it's going to get worse.\"\n\nOn most days, New York's rate of infection hovers below 1 percent of the roughly 25,000 tests performed each day in the city. Similarly, the number of positive tests statewide was 0.66 percent as of Monday. The numbers are far lower than most other states, where new cases are setting records and still rising.\n\nBut New York's success has not dampened fears of a second wave arriving after cooler temperatures force people back indoors or when schools that have been empty since March finally reopen.\n\nAt a playground at Hunter's Point South Park in Long Island City in mid-August, Kyie Wallace pointed out a phenomenon that other parents have noticed in their own homes: Neither of his two children, away from classmates for months, has fallen ill since March -- not a sniffle. \"Unprecedented in my house,\" he said.\n\nNow, he views September as a threat. \"My kids are going to come back and get something,\" he said. \"The numbers will go back.\"\n\nBut the alternative, returning to remote learning and its kitchen-table stalemates and compromises, brings its own dread.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-26T06:50:46.024Z The C.D.C. changes testing guidelines to exclude those exposed to virus who don't exhibit symptoms. The Trump administration ordered hospitals to report data to H.H.S. or risk losing funding. At the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump acknowledges the pandemic's human toll. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nStephen Banci, 55, who owns a construction business, hopes the upcoming schedule at his 5-year-old daughter's school -- five days in the classroom every three weeks -- will at least give her some interaction with other children. But he said he was frustrated by the uncertainty from officials and all the questions without answers this late in the summer.\n\n\"I'm not sleeping as well as I'd like to,\" Mr. Banci said. \"I think at the end of the day, I realized how stressed I am, so it erupts at night when you take a deep breath and realize how much it is.\"\n\nVisitors and newcomers to the city quickly pick up on the anxiety.\n\n\"Honestly, everything worries me,\" said Martha Vazquez, 38, sitting with her 18-year-old daughter, Lizbeth Perez, at Washington Square Park on what should have been a joyous day. Ms. Vazquez, who cleans construction sites, and her husband, who works in landscaping and construction, had saved enough to see Lizbeth enrolled at N.Y.U. Ms. Vazquez and her husband, who live in Washington State, were dropping her off at the school but felt overwhelmed.\n\n\"Everything is not OK,\" she said. \"I worry about what I'll do if something happens to her, if she were to get sick.\"\n\nThe coming fall has called into question some New Yorkers' decisions in the early days of the pandemic to stick it out at home. Now, even as the threat of illness has diminished, the lure of the suburbs grows. Seeing others depart brings unsettling questions: Are we doing the right thing by staying? This will all pass, right?\n\n\"It is so difficult to have your own space in this city,\" said Ashley Shoulders, 30, as her 4-year-old daughter played nearby in Central Park. \"You can be as responsible as you can possibly be, but once you step foot outside of your door there are a lot of people stacked on top of each other in New York City.\"\n\nShe'd been considering moving for a while, but now it seems more urgent. \"Maybe Westchester, maybe New Jersey,\" she said.\n\nGreg Kushnick, a psychologist in Manhattan, said he has seen a mounting gloom among his patients. \"New Yorkers who weren't panicking or depressed in the first months are now experiencing more depression and disbelief in terms of how long this is going to go,\" he said. \"There is an impending-doom feeling.\"\n\nNew Yorkers, while less anxious about contracting the virus, have at the same time shown a reluctance to return to activities as mundane as a regular visit to the doctor, according to ongoing surveys by the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy.\n\n\"The level of anxiety is increasing, not decreasing,\" said Dr. Ayman El-Mohandes, the dean of the school. \"People are squeamish.\"\n\nThe surveys found consistent unease about losing a job or, for those who already have, finding a new one or returning to work after being furloughed.\n\n\"People who live in New York are enchanted by the city and are attached to a way of living,\" he said. \"Many of them are drawn to New York because of opportunity, and if they don't see that to be a fact, then it's a problem.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIt's a problem that Darren Liddell, 33, a financial coach, sees around his neighborhood in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, where recently the mayor announced an uptick of cases had occurred. \"In some ways it's more stressful than ever, thinking about what life will look like,\" he said. \"A friend asked me yesterday, 'What's the future of work?' I have no idea.\"\n\nThat question was not a theoretical one for Manuela Flores, 28, and her husband, Oscar Flores, 28, as they sat with their 8-month-old son, Lucas, in Sunset Park. Both had lost their jobs as servers in the same Manhattan restaurant.\n\n\"I've seen a bunch of businesses fail,\" Mr. Flores said. \"I'm concerned when I'm going to go back to work, especially if they're not going to give me assistance.\"\n\nHe said he wished there was a finish line, no matter how far-off. \"There's no set time. If there was a set date, you could say, 'OK,' and prepare for that. But there isn't.\"\n\nNonetheless, experts said it was vital that people take steps to restore a feeling of control -- however minimal -- over their daily lives and, to some extent, their future.\n\n\"We kind of know the lay of the land,\" Mr. Kushnick, the psychologist, said. \"It's a matter of whether you're going to adjust, or not adjust and suffer.\"\n\nThe CUNY surveys, last conducted in late June, will resume during the first week in September with an eye toward the future.\n\n\"We are going to try to look for action items, like 'What am I doing about it?'\" Dr. El-Mohandes, the CUNY dean, said. \"In the first 16 weeks this was like a natural disaster, like an earthquake or tsunami. It didn't seem fair to ask, 'Well, what are you doing about this?' But by September, people are starting to make decisions for themselves or their families. 'Am I going to move out? Am I going to stay? What am I going to do about this?'\"\n\nMany of those answers, great and small, are already visible.\n\nIn Long Island City, where 18-year-old Ferdinand Stirling greeted the closing of his high school with approval -- \"It was lit,\" he said -- the pause allowed him to make music and \"grow so much as a musician in the past few months,\" he said. Likewise, in nearby Sunnyside, Gero Eaton, 30, has made some money selling his kaleidoscopic splatter paintings, which he displayed on the streets outside his studio.\n\n\"I look at it as a way to keep me sane,\" he said.\n\nIn Sunset Park, a group of friends beat back the worries of the day by stringing a volleyball net across 51st Street and grabbing a ball.\n\n\"It's a way to get out the stress,\" said Wilson Idrouo, 40.\n\nThey have one firm rule: Unless you're talking about one of the cold bottles of beer in the case nearby, there will be no mention of the word \"corona.\"\n\nIn Greenwich Village, Willa Kiritz, 72, and her husband, Anthony Blanche, 88, bring their lifetimes of experience to the city's current troubles.\n\n\"Just wear the bloody masks and let's get on with this,\" Ms. Kiritz said. The empty streets and shuttered businesses alarm her, calling to mind tough times in the 1980s. But she and her husband ventured outside to a restaurant \"the minute\" they reopened, she said.\n\nMr. Blanche deployed the New Yorker's sturdy what-are-you-gonna-do shrug. \"I don't think I'm too worried,\" he said. \"I know I'm not going to get out of here alive.\"\n\nJo Corona, Nate Schweber and Matthew Sedacca contributed reporting.",

        "body": "HIALEAH, Fla. -- Of all the places in the country that are most vulnerable to the coronavirus, Hialeah is easy prey: a Hispanic blue-collar enclave outside Miami where households are packed, incomes are tight and work is essential.\n\nThe virus lurks in the South Florida city's nursing homes, nestles in its densely crowded apartment buildings and multiplies among families whose breadwinners must go out each day to toil at construction sites, hospitals and factories.\n\nMiami-Dade County has endured one of the nation's worst coronavirus outbreaks, and on many days, no other ZIP code in the county has more new cases than downtown Hialeah. Only three cities in the state -- Miami, Orlando and Jacksonville -- have had more.\n\nThe Miami area has slowly begun to tame its rate of infection. But it is sometimes hard to be optimistic in Hialeah, Florida's sixth-largest city, where prevalence has remained stubbornly high.\n\nParamedics have gotten sick. A father and son, both doctors who tended to local residents for decades, died. A funeral home brought in an extra cooler to store bodies, prompting worried neighbors to protest. Some hospitals in the city told ambulances at the peak of the summer surge to bypass their emergency rooms because they were too full of Covid-19 patients.\n\n\"The calls were back-to-back-to-back -- at night, during the day, whenever,\" said Eric Johnson, a firefighter paramedic in the city and president of the local firefighters' union. He contracted the virus himself in March, probably at work, and then his wife got it.\n\n\"You would see a house with 11 or 12 people inside,\" he said. \"Many, many, many, many times you'd return to the same place for multiple patients out of the same house.\"\n\nHialeah -- pronounced hi-ah-LEE-ah -- is prone to stereotypes, with its shabby motels, industrial roots and colorful history of corruption. (The sitting mayor has admitted to loan sharking and once tried to pay a $4,000 ethics fine in pennies.)\n\nHialeah Park, a casino and racetrack, appears as a backdrop in \"The Godfather: Part II,\" and the park's flamingos were filmed for the opening credits of the TV show \"Miami Vice.\" A local Kentucky Fried Chicken is the only one in the country that sells flan for dessert. (It's delicious.) The writer Jennine Cap\u00f3 Crucet, a city native, has said that readers outside of Florida often think that her first book, titled \"How to Leave Hialeah,\" is about a woman, not a place.\n\nWhat Hialeah is at its core, however, is a city of families and workers, two demographics ravaged by the coronavirus.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-03T17:05:11.878Z Backed by U.S. federal funds, new virus tests are hitting the market. Iowa's former health spokeswoman sues the state for wrongful termination. As the C.D.C. prepares for two vaccines, here are some answers to a few of the most common questions. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nBack in April, the city received national attention for the crush of people waiting at the public library to get applications for unemployment benefits. Now people line up in their cars -- for three miles past pastel duplexes, auto repair shops and warehouses on a recent morning -- to get weekly food aid at Amelia Earhart Park or San L\u00e1zaro Roman Catholic Church and Shrine.\n\nMelissa Espinar, 26, works with her partner as a slot attendant at a Miami Gardens casino; both were temporarily laid off in March and then permanently in July. They have no health insurance.\n\nMs. Espinar is living off her savings and the $240 a week that she and her partner are each getting in unemployment compensation. They live in an apartment with his mother, who is self-employed cleaning houses.\n\n\"We keep telling her, 'Don't go,'\" she said. \"She's cleaning other people's houses, houses where we don't know who's sick or not. It hasn't spared anybody.\"\n\nThe swift spread of the virus through crowded apartments got so bad that elected officials began advising families to social distance among themselves and wear masks at home if any one of them had to regularly go out.\n\nBut enforcing even outdoor rules has proved difficult. When the city set up a hotline for people to report businesses violating mask and social distancing orders, some residents complained that neighbors were being asked to snitch on each other as people had been required to do years before in Communist Cuba. Hialeah, a reliably Republican city of more than 233,000, is 96 percent Hispanic and home to more Cubans and Cuban-Americans than anywhere else in the country.\n\n\"There's been a lot of pandemic fatigue in this area,\" said Dr. Jack Michel, president and chairman of Larkin Community Hospital in Hialeah. \"A lot of people don't understand that we're going to live with this for another year -- maybe longer.\"\n\nAfter the state shut down an assisted living facility in the city over its virus spread and a big outbreak happened at a local nursing home, with 136 cases and 52 deaths, the city put together a task force and sent the Fire Department to visit each of the nearly 100 facilities in the city catering to older people, said Jes\u00fas Tundidor, a member of the City Council who leads the effort. About a fifth needed help securing protective equipment like masks and gloves.\n\nMr. Tundidor's own family has been affected by the virus. His stepfather, who lives with Mr. Tundidor's mother and 90-year-old grandmother, had to continue going to his maintenance job and tested positive for the virus, prompting a nerve-racking family conversation.\n\n\"'What do we do with my grandmother?'\" Mr. Tundidor recalled. \"'Do we bring her to my house?' But I'm always out on the street as well, and my wife has to work as a physician assistant. And she's pregnant.\" (The grandmother stayed put but isolated in her bedroom until her son-in-law tested negative.)\n\nNow that the prevalence of the virus has gone down, hospital administrators and public health experts worry that reopening too quickly could eventually lead to another spike.\n\nIn Miami-Dade County, the virus positivity rate is hovering at about 8 percent, less than half of what it used to be at its peak but higher than what it was in early June, when the county reopened the first time. There is concern about Labor Day because gatherings over past holidays, including Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, have led to measurable case hikes.\n\nBut the county mayor has said he will not close the beaches for the holiday. Restaurants let customers into their dining rooms again on Monday. Casinos opened, too. Soon there will be some fans at football games.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"It just feels like nothing has changed around here,\" said Ms. Espinar, the unemployed slot worker. \"When things were shut down at the beginning, it was like people were actually staying home, not going out every day. But since June, I've been seeing parties -- even my friends, on social media, going out. And I'm like, 'I don't feel safe! Why is everybody going out?'\"\n\nThe virus has slowed, but it has left devastation in its wake across Hialeah. The list of victims now includes Dr. Carlos F. Vallejo, an internist who saw patients at Palmetto General Hospital's rehab center in Hialeah, which is where his family thinks he got infected with the virus.\n\n\"We would tell him, 'Be careful, Dad, try to keep your distance,'\" said his son, Charles Vallejo. \"'Try not to walk into the rooms.' But that's just the type of man he was. He said, 'No, no, I have to go in there, listen to their lungs. These patients are like family to me.'\"\n\nDr. Vallejo, 57, was hospitalized on Father's Day within three hours of his own father, Dr. Jorge A. Vallejo, an 89-year-old retired obstetrician and gynecologist who practiced medicine in Hialeah for 25 years. Jorge Vallejo died on June 27. Carlos Vallejo held on until Aug. 1.\n\n\"We always joked that Miami was a big city but a small community in Hialeah,\" Charles Vallejo, who is a third-year medical student, said. \"A lot of the people knew them.\"\n\nAmong them was Ariel Cribeiro, 32, a high school football coach in neighboring Miami Lakes who inherited Dr. Carlos Vallejo as his internist because he had also been his parents' doctor.\n\n\"Miami Lakes and Hialeah are just one big area, and it's just an environment that is just different than anything else you see in Miami: You could go out to the street and you're going to see people that you know,\" Mr. Cribeiro said. \"Everyone knows somebody that has been affected.\"\n\nA friend's father died of Covid-19 in April. A member of his coaching staff got sick and recovered. Mr. Cribeiro's fianc\u00e9e got laid off from her banking job.\n\n\"A lot of people who live here just don't have the means to say, 'Hey, I'm not going to go to work to not get sick,'\" he said. \"It's not like people are just running around freely coughing on people. There's good people here. There's good people struggling. Hopefully we can get through this.\"",

        "body": "The rebound of the longtime vendor could be a bellwether for small business owners in the city who rely on tourists and workers for sales.\n\nWhen the Metropolitan Museum of Art closed in March, as the coronavirus ravaged New York, the cluster of pushcarts out front -- one of the most coveted food-vending locations in the city -- was left with no business.\n\n\"No museum, no customers,\" said Dan Rossi, 70, a vendor who over 13 years has become known as the museum's \"hot dog king\" by holding the top sidewalk-selling spot, directly in front of the Met's main steps.\n\nMr. Rossi was not about to pack up. For more than five months, he kept his carts dormant at their location, along Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street in Manhattan, and visited constantly from his suburban home to make sure they were not moved.\n\nNow, with the museum reopening to the public on Saturday, he has fired up his propane grills and resumed selling his $3 dogs and $1 bottles of water. He will again work to lure customers away from the seven vendors who typically flank him offering pretzels, halal food, ice cream and more hot dogs.\n\nThe competition can be so intense that the police have been called in over the years to settle turf wars and other disputes. And now, the return of these vending wars that define the street economy in many parts of New York City could be a bellwether for the small business owners who, like Mr. Rossi, rely on tourists and workers for much of their sales.\n\nIn normal times, the Met's steps are typically swarmed with people, allowing him to take in up to $2,000 on a good day.\n\n\"It's a volume business, and there's no volume now,\" he said, gazing at the steps, which for months have been practically deserted.\n\nWhile the pandemic devastated Mr. Rossi's business, there was a slight upside: The pause gave him the chance to sleep in his own bed. To prevent his hot dog carts from being pushed aside or seized, he has slept most nights of the past seven years outside the Met, often on a lawn chair inside a cramped cart between the grill and the condiments shelf, his feet sticking out of the cart's open door.\n\nThe city's parks department once charged heavily for the exclusive right to sell food directly outside the Met, including a contract with a vendor to pay $650,000 a year, at one point. In 2007, Mr. Rossi, a disabled Marine and a Bronx native, simply set up two hot dog carts and began undercutting the prices of the nearby vendor. He said the city's attempts to oust him -- from arrests to court battles to more than 100 tickets -- were futile. He refused to move his carts, day or night.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T09:04:43.454Z The White House announces a major virus test-kit deal, just days after the C.D.C. moved to discourage testing. Trump promises a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, and boasts of his pandemic response. Hurricane Laura and the virus collide in Louisiana and Texas. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe city eventually stopped charging vendors to sell there.\n\nThe health department has long issued 3,100 mobile food-vending permits, which are renewable every two years and include 100 permits for veterans, disabled veterans and people with disabilities. It also issues an additional 1,000 seasonal permits and 1,000 permits for fruit and vegetable stands.\n\nDuring the height of the virus outbreak in the spring, the city declared the vendors essential workers, and many of them remained in business. In some hard-hit neighborhoods -- like Jackson Heights and Corona, both in Queens -- food carts were crucial in providing meals, said Carina Kaufman-Gutierrez, deputy director of the nonprofit Street Vendor Project, which represents thousands of such sellers in New York.\n\nMore recently, vendors have taken another hit by losing business to the nearly 10,000 restaurants that have set up outdoor seating, she said, adding that the sellers were already reeling because they could not obtain virus-related government relief for their businesses.\n\nMr. Rossi said he survived the past five months on Social Security and military pension payments.\n\nHe entered the industry by building hot dog carts in the 1980s and gradually bought some 500 cart permits, which he leased to individual vendors. He bought a house in Greenwich, Conn., and enjoyed an empire worth millions. Then the city cracked down on multiple permit holders in the 1990s to make licenses available for individuals and revoked all but one of his permits, the mobile food-vending license he still holds.\n\nHe jokes that he has gone \"from rags to riches to below rags.\" After being told by the authorities several years ago that he could no longer sleep in his cart, he began spending most nights stretched out across the front seats of his white van parked nearby.\n\nMr. Rossi's carts stand side by side. He operates one, and his daughter Elizabeth, also a disabled Marine, holds a permit for the other. Mr. Rossi watches the spot as a helper rushes one cart at a time for a quick cleaning.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all.

It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe only time he moves them both, he said, is for the annual celebrity-stocked Met Gala, and even then, the carts are back in position not long after the last limousine departs.\n\nThrough sheer tenacity, Mr. Rossi claimed his curbside location. He spent nights in jail, he said, and prepared his own legal briefs to defend his claim: that his right to vend there, without paying the city, stemmed from an arcane state law dating to the Civil War that allowed veterans free vending permits.\n\nMr. Rossi said that he argued in court that the state law overruled city regulations and allowed him to vend in areas that would otherwise be off limits.\n\nThe city did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nNew York City food vending battles can be intense, and some of the most severe ones have played out in front of the Met.\n\nAfter Mr. Rossi challenged the city's enforcement, other veteran-operated carts also began vending outside the museum. At the height of the vending wars in 2014, the area was swamped with nearly 30 vending carts, creating a smoky maze in front of the museum.\n\nEventually, the city thinned the herd to fewer than 10, citing limits on available curb space.\n\nAmong the few people sitting on the museum's steps early this week were John Noble Barrack, 27, and Brooke Shapiro, 29. Both are out-of-work actors.\n\n\"The food carts are part of the street culture of New York, and it's exciting to see that coming back,\" said Mr. Noble Barrack, who has found temporary work organizing a crew that takes temperatures of visitors before they enter the Met.\n\nMs. Shapiro, who has found work in a medical office, said, \"I know what they're going through because our own industry is also so dependent on New York coming back.\"\n\nThe hot dog king is also hoping for a comeback.\n\n\"We'll see what happens this week,\" Mr. Rossi said. \"But I tell you, I think it's going to be one tough winter, boy.\"",

        "body": "LONDON -- It had all the ingredients for a juicy skirmish in Britain's simmering culture war, so when the BBC announced last week that it would strip the lyrics from two popular patriotic songs in its telecast of a beloved annual concert, Conservative leaders predictably lined up to express their outrage.\n\n\"It's time we stopped our cringing embarrassment about our history, about our traditions, and about our culture, and we stopped this general bout of self-recrimination and wetness,\" said Prime Minister Boris Johnson to reporters, adding with an indignant flourish, \"I wanted to get that off my chest.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the BBC reversed itself, announcing it had decided to have a small choir sing the words to \"Rule, Britannia!\" and \"Land of Hope and Glory\" after all. Critics say the lyrics evoke a British colonial, imperialist past that is at odds with the values of the Black Lives Matter movement that has spread across the Atlantic.\n\nThe BBC insisted its original decision had been driven less by politics than by its inability, because of the coronavirus pandemic, to gather an audience to sing along. But after a backlash fueled by the government and pro-government newspapers, it said in a contrite statement, \"We hope everyone will welcome this solution.\"\n\nScore another point for the government in its feud with Britain's revered, but embattled public broadcaster. And though the BBC's viewer numbers have been as strong as ever, the decision was only the most visible setback for the broadcaster, which faces commercial as well as cultural headwinds.\n\nIn Parliament on Wednesday, Mr. Johnson hinted that the government would soon roll out a plan to overhaul the BBC that would address the compulsory license fee that finances much of its operations. Critics would like to see the fee abolished, which would throw the BBC's future into question.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T19:06:53.121Z C.D.C. tells health officials to be ready to distribute a vaccine by November, raising concerns over politicized timing. The first death tied to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally is reported in Minnesota. New studies show inexpensive steroid drugs can help critically sick people survive Covid-19. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nMeanwhile, two billionaire media moguls are hatching plans for 24-hour news channels that would be politically opinionated, bringing the model of Fox News to a market dominated by the BBC's studied impartiality.\n\n\"The BBC is uniquely vulnerable at this moment,\" said Alan Rusbridger, a former editor in chief of the Guardian newspaper. \"There is a convergence of interests between the government and media owners in damaging the BBC. For them, this story is almost too good to be true.\"\n\nThe Proms, as the series of BBC-sponsored classical music concerts is known, ends on Sept. 12 with an evening that has become famous for its rousing rendition of \"Land of Hope and Glory,\" sung as part of a performance of Elgar's \"Pomp and Circumstance March,\" as well as the anthem \"Rule, Britannia!\"\n\nThousands of spectators in Royal Albert Hall, as well as in Hyde Park outside, wave Union Jacks as they belt the chorus, \"Rule, Britannia! Britannia, rule the waves! Britons never, never, never shall be slaves.\"\n\nSuch jingoistic appeals give some people pause at a time when crowds have marched in Britain's streets to protest the killing of George Floyd by the police in Minneapolis. Demonstrators in Bristol tore down the statue of a 17th-century slave trader, Edward Colston; others vandalized a memorial to Winston Churchill. The British Museum moved a bust of one of its founders, Hans Sloane, from a plinth in a main gallery to a display case because he was a slave trader.\n\nMr. Johnson and other critics have struck back at those who defaced Churchill and banished Sloane, saying they are erasing British history and surrendering to the pressure of a \"woke\" mob. The BBC is high on the list of those they accuse of political correctness -- or, in British parlance, of being \"wet.\"\n\nIn such a febrile atmosphere, analysts said the BBC should have anticipated how its decision would reverberate. \"Was it na\u00efve not to think it wouldn't play out as part of the culture wars?\" said Meera Selva, director of the Reuters Journalism Fellowship Program at Oxford University.\n\nBut Ms. Selva said the real threat to the BBC would come if the government follows through on a proposal to stop prosecuting people for failing to pay the license fee. Officials argue that nonpayment of other such fees is handled in civil, not criminal, proceedings. They say the fee, which is currently \u00a3157.50 ($209) a year, falls disproportionately on older people, who can least afford to pay it.\n\nDespite its hostility toward the BBC, the Johnson government has yet to move on this proposal -- a delay that may reflect its preoccupation with dealing with the coronavirus rather than any softening of its views. Some analysts said the government's botched handling of the pandemic had weakened its ability to go after an institution that, for all its detractors, remains enduringly popular.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"You have to have a lot of vim for this,\" said Claire Enders, a London-based media analyst. \"The government is on its back foot. Boris Johnson and Dominic Cummings were sustaining a lot of this, but they have lost a lot of steam,\" she added, referring to Mr. Johnson's powerful chief adviser.\n\nThe pandemic also served to remind Britons of the value of a credible public broadcaster. Viewership of BBC's news programs spiked at the height of the outbreak in March, though its ratings have returned to more normal levels since. The BBC remains far more trusted than the rest of the British media, drawing high marks across the political spectrum and with viewers of all ages and income levels.\n\nThat ubiquity and credibility makes it a daunting target for rivals. Rupert Murdoch, who started Sky News in 1989 to compete with the BBC, is backing one such 24-hour channel, while the other, GB News, is backed by executives with ties to the American cable television tycoon, John C. Malone. It has recruited Robbie Gibb, a BBC alumnus who was head of communications for Prime Minister Theresa May.\n\nMr. Gibb, writing recently in the Telegraph, said the BBC had been \"culturally captured by the woke-dominated group think of some of its own staff.\"\n\nDisplacing it, however, is another matter. Ms. Enders pointed to a landscape littered with well-funded interlopers like Al Jazeera, and said it was unlikely that either channel, whatever their politics, would draw more than a fraction of the BBC's audience. To some extent, talk of Fox-like competitors is just another way to torment the service affectionately known to many Britons by the nickname \"Auntie.\"\n\nThe BBC recently changed its leadership, elevating a marketing executive, Tim Davie, to be its director general. Mr. Davie, who was active in Conservative Party politics in the 1990s, has told colleagues he wants to overhaul the BBC's lineup of comedy programs to right what he views as a bias against Brexit and the government. By making cosmetic changes in programming, some analysts said, Mr. Davie could actually shield the BBC from more dangerous attacks on its financing.\n\nStill, as the reflexive outrage over \"Rule, Britannia!\" and the Proms shows, picking a fight with the BBC will always be tempting to the Johnson government. And in the end, it is an unfair battle.\n\n\"The BBC can't really fight back because of its commitment to impartiality,\" said Rasmus Kleis Nielsen, director of the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism at Oxford. \"That makes it quite a useful punching bag for old, mainly white, men who want to make a point by punching it.\"",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The coronavirus pandemic remained a distant threat to many Americans on Jan. 24 when Douglas C. Bryant, the president and chief executive officer of Quidel Corporation, got a call from an official at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nIf the government helped, the official asked, would Quidel make tests to detect coronavirus infections?\n\nMr. Bryant decided to go for it, even though some experts at the time were predicting the United States would quickly tame any outbreak.\n\nThe gamble has paid off. Quidel, a San Diego-based maker of diagnostic tests, developed a swab-based coronavirus test that produced results from an analyzer in 15 minutes. It sold 1.2 million of them for less than $20 apiece to the federal government for use at nursing homes. A grant from the National Institutes of Health is enabling Quidel to expand its production by about 140 million tests a year, company officials said.\n\nWith the pandemic still raging as fall approaches, the government's efforts to support development and deployment of a variety of testing methods are a rare if belated bright spot amid widespread failures to contain the virus.\n\nIn the latest round of government backing, the N.I.H. said on Wednesday that it was providing nine more companies with $123.3 million from a $2.5 billion pot of money allocated last spring by the stimulus bill to support testing. That will bring the total amount disbursed so far by the N.I.H. to $372 million across 16 companies.\n\nThe goal is to support production of a broad spectrum of tests, making them more widely available and perhaps ultimately as easy to use as a home pregnancy test. Tests must show that they meet the Food and Drug Administration's standards for safety and accuracy before they can be sold.\n\n\"It's going to be a wonderful competition,\" Dr. Francis S. Collins, the N.I.H. director, said in an interview on Tuesday evening.\n\nYet even as the government helps rush new tests to market, the administration continues to issue conflicting -- and sometimes flatly contradictory -- messages about how many and what types of tests are needed, when they should be administered and to whom.\n\nPresident Trump has long derided testing, complaining that it drives up the number of confirmed cases. The lack of a clear national strategy has confused the public, deeply frustrated public health officials and befuddled pharmaceutical executives.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T19:31:25.677Z The C.D.C. tells health officials to be ready to distribute a vaccine by November, raising concerns over politicized timing. Virus fallout from the Sturgis Rally: A death in Minnesota, cases in South Dakota and beyond. New studies show inexpensive steroid drugs can help critically sick people survive Covid-19. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nBut as testing options have multiplied, easing some of the shortages and laboratory bottlenecks that hampered the early response to the pandemic, universities, employers, state and local governments and other institutions have been increasingly filling in some of the vacuum left by the administration with their own testing plans.\n\nA growing number of businesses -- ranging from Soupergirl, a small company in Washington, D.C., with 30 employees that makes vegan soups, to Amazon, the world's biggest retailer -- are testing their workers.\n\nThe National Basketball Association allowed Yale University scientists access to its players for its research identifying the coronavirus in saliva samples. The Food and Drug Administration last month granted emergency use authorization for Yale's testing method, which aimed to keep the cost to less than $10 per test. Anne Wyllie, an associate research scientist working on the project, said more than 200 laboratories had contacted Yale about it.\n\nAmong those interested is Indiana University, which is putting in place a testing program for its 120,000 students, faculty and staff. Arriving students were greeted last month with rapid-result, nasal swab tests before they could move into their dorms. Those who tested positive were either sent home or housed in an isolation dorm.\n\nStudents living off campus submitted their own saliva samples, which were then shipped to laboratories. The university is continuing to test on a targeted basis, aiming for broader screening soon, using its own laboratories. The cost is $10 million and counting.\n\n\"We figured this out ourselves,\" said Dr. Aaron E. Carroll, an associate dean at the university's medical school, who helped devise the program. Federal guidelines were of little use, he said.\n\nTrump administration officials like Adm. Brett P. Giroir, the testing czar and an assistant secretary of health, say they want states and localities to create their own testing plans that fit their specific needs rather than to be forced to follow federal dictates. But many experts complain that the lack of federal decision-making -- including how many tests a day the United States should aim for -- is an impediment in the nation's battle against the virus, which so far has killed more than 184,000 people and infected more than six million.\n\n\"Let's not just say we are ramping up and hope we get there. Let's have a goal in mind,\" said Dr. Mark McClellan, the director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration under former President George W. Bush. \"It's not just a matter of getting the tests to market.\"\n\nIn a recent interview, Dr. Bruce J. Tromberg, who directs the N.I.H.'s test development program, estimated that the United States needed to test about six million people a day, citing reports by experts at the Rockefeller Foundation and other organizations. Without federal assistance, he said, companies would at best produce only half that number by the end of the year.\n\nThe government's purchases of hundreds of millions of tests for nursing homes and other hot spots has helped spur development and manufacturing. The N.I.H. is trying to encourage even more production, Dr. Tromberg said, with grants that have allowed companies to build laboratories and open new manufacturing lines.\n\nSix million daily tests \"is what we are on the trajectory for,\" he said.\n\nBut in a briefing last month with reporters, Admiral Giroir appeared to contradict that. \"I am really tired of hearing from people who are not involved in the system that we need millions of tests every day,\" he said. \"We are doing the appropriate amount of testing now.\"\n\nThen, in an interview on Friday, Admiral Giroir suggested that he had misspoken. \"Since Day 1, we've been trying to increase the number of tests,\" he said.\n\nAdmiral Giroir has laid out broad principles for a national strategy: People with symptoms should be tested, and some level of surveillance -- testing of large swaths of the population, regardless of symptoms -- should be conducted to pinpoint outbreaks. Those can then be controlled by surges of tests, he has said.\n\nBut beyond that broad outline lies much uncertainty. To the dismay of many public health officials, for example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has publicly wavered about whether people who have been in close contact with an infected person but who have no symptoms should be tested.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe government's $2.5 billion pot of money to develop new tests is split between the N.I.H.'s program, called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics, or RADx, and an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOne of the new tests, made by the Maryland-based company Maxim Biomedical, is what Dr. Tromberg calls a \"dipstick\" antigen test that relies on a nasal swab and can deliver results in 15 minutes without any additional instruments. The test has yet to receive an F.D.A. greenlight, Dr. Tromberg said, but \"we're excited.\"\n\nSo far, the new tests fall short of what some experts argue is most needed: a method that is cheap and simple enough to be widely used at home, twice a week or more, regardless of symptoms. Dr. Collins said the technology for such tests, which might resemble a pregnancy test, is close at hand, but regulatory obstacles remain. No test has been authorized that can be bought over the counter and conducted entirely at home.\n\nSome of the most attention-grabbing developments have taken place without federal grants, although the government remains a large purchaser. Abbott, a major pharmaceutical company, last month won emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration for an antigen test that is the size of a credit card, costs about $5, delivers results in 15 minutes and is intended to be given in health care settings to patients who are within a week of the onset of symptoms.\n\nUnlike standard lab-based tests, antigen tests hunt for coronavirus proteins and can run from start to finish in settings such as a doctor's office, urgent care clinic or pharmacy. So far, the Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency approval to about 180 lab-based tests, but fewer than 10 that can be done outside the lab.\n\nAbbott has said it will produce 50 million tests a month by October. The federal government has agreed to buy 150 million of them, at a cost of $750 million, and will ship them to assisted living centers, nursing homes and other locations.\n\nTogether with such advances, federal officials say the government's effort is helping to create a kind of testing smorgasbord for consumers.\n\nOne recipient of a grant from the N.I.H., a company called Fluidigm, is developing a test that collects saliva samples to be processed in laboratories. Fluidigm's test received emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration last week; with the government's funding, the company plans to expand its manufacturing capacity to more than one million tests a day by the end of March.\n\nA Massachusetts-based firm called Ginkgo Bioworks is pioneering the use of genome sequencing to detect the coronavirus. Ginkgo used the more than $40 million it received from the N.I.H. to help construct a new laboratory that will run about 250,000 coronavirus tests a day, according to Barry Canton, a co-founder of the company. Customers will be able to purchase the test for about $25, ship their samples to Ginkgo and receive results within about 48 hours.\n\nSome experts question whether the government's umbrella is wide enough. Ten of the 16 N.I.H. grant recipients require test samples to be processed in a lab. Five others, while simpler and faster, still rely on expensive or cumbersome machines to yield results, making them poor candidates for widespread use.\n\nWhat the N.I.H. is doing, said Dr. Syra Madad, an infectious disease epidemiologist in New York, \"is a subset of what we're looking for.\"\n\nSharon LaFraniere reported from Washington and Katherine J.

        "body": "Many recent graduates can't practice their professions without passing a licensing exam, but those tests have been disrupted for months by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJohn Molera thought the anxiety of taking the bar exam was over after he finished his test in late July. Then, a few hours later, he got an email from a classmate: One of the roughly 30 people sitting in the room with him for the past two days -- where Mr. Molera recalled many people lifting masks for snacks and water breaks -- had the coronavirus.\n\nMr. Molera, 25, is among roughly 70,000 recent law school graduates who take the bar each year, along with thousands of others who sit for licensing exams in social work, engineering, surgery and other fields, typically alongside hundreds of other students squeezed into crowded rooms at universities or testing centers.\n\nMany of those exams were postponed and testing sites shut down in the spring as the coronavirus spread across the country, forcing recent graduates to delay the start of their careers.\n\nSome tests moved online -- often with scheduling problems and even computer glitches. Other states continued to offer them in person, raising concern about the possible spread of the virus at testing centers like the one where Mr. Molera took his exam at the University of Denver.\n\nThe chaos and confusion are helping fuel efforts in some states to eliminate the bar and other licensing exams, which are seen by some critics as unnecessary and antiquated, while administrators defend them as a needed protection for the public.\n\nThe test to get a law license is administered by each state's bar association under the authority of its highest court, typically in February and July. This year, 23 states went ahead with in-person exams in July, while at least 20 postponed them until the fall -- with some offering a new remote option in October.\n\nJena Speiser, 26, graduated from New York University's law school in the spring, when the city was still the center of the virus in the United States. She said the New York State Bar Association encouraged her classmates and her to apply to take the exam in another state because an in-person test in July seemed unlikely.\n\nShe planned to apply in Massachusetts but then tested positive for the coronavirus and was bedridden for weeks. She was hospitalized in June and missed the deadline to apply for the online bar exam New York will hold in October. Her next opportunity is not until February, and she cannot practice law until then.\n\n\"I have $300,000 in loans, and I have no idea how I'll start paying them off,\" Ms. Speiser said. \"I can't work, so I can't get health insurance. The whole time I was sick I was like, 'What if I have to go to the hospital again?'\"\n\nHer anxieties are shared by many recent graduates.\n\n\"I need to squeeze the bar exam between feeding my kids and worrying about their mental and physical health,\" said Leslie Caraballo, 42, who graduated in the spring and had planned to study for the bar while her young children were at school and summer camp. \"Everyone's like, 'Ruth Bader Ginsburg did it, she had her ailing husband and children.' But it's virtually impossible.\"\n\nThe New York State Bar Association said the move to an online exam in October was the best way to balance the needs of recent graduates with the \"integrity of the profession.\"\n\n\"We understand the pain faced by this year's graduating law school students,\" Scott Karson, the president of the bar association, wrote in an email. \"With thousands of graduates hoping to practice in New York and the unprecedented challenges wrought by Covid-19, there is no easy solution.\"\n\nMedical students have confronted similar uncertainty because of delays in their licensing exams, which are needed before they can become residents at hospitals. The United States Medical Licensing Examination temporarily suspended its exams in late March after the private company administering them, Prometric, shut down in-person testing sites.\n\nSome medical students said they learned of the postponements from Prometric less than 48 hours before their tests. The licensing organization later said it was \"disappointed\" with Prometric's failure to communicate with students.\n\n\"I was trying to study for the most important exam of my life not knowing if or when it was going to happen,\" said Sirpi Nackeeran, 26, a third-year medical student at the University of Miami. \"There's only so many study materials, and you want to time it perfectly.\"\n\nPrometric testing sites have begun reopening and administered some board exams in May and June. While some students have called for an online version of the test, the Federation of State Medical Boards has resisted.\n\n\"You're relying on people's internet connection,\" said David Johnson, the organization's chief assessment officer. \"If you're talking about sitting in front of a computer taking a high-stakes test for six hours, that's something to be worried about.\"\n\nSchool Reopenings \"Back to School\n\nUpdated Sept. 2, 2020\n\nThe latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.\n\nIn N.Y.C., being able to test students and teachers regularly for coronavirus may be the biggest challenge to reopening classrooms in the nation's largest district this month.As outbreaks disrupt life on campus, more colleges are taking a zero-tolerance stand against parties.In Opinion, columnist Nicholas Kristof writes that \"remote learning\" is often an oxymoron.Joe Biden is trying to spotlight President Trump's handling of education during the pandemic.\n\nThe American Board of Surgery tried to make the switch online, administering its annual licensing exam virtually in July. The exam crashed for many test takers, forcing the board to cancel all results.\n\nAfter months of study, Ayesha Lovick, 33, had prepared for the eight-hour test, which costs $1,850, by borrowing a laptop from a friend and arranging to stay at a neighbor's empty apartment. The morning after the test, she woke to an email from the board informing her that her results had been nullified. She was recently informed by the board that the test will next be offered in April, though she is contracted to start a new job in October.\n\n\"I've spent my entire life working toward becoming a surgeon, and this was the last test,\" Dr. Lovick said. \"My employer expects that I'll have taken board exams before I start work. Now my job will have to make accommodations for the new test date.\"\n\nOnline testing brings an extra set of challenges for people with disabilities. All jurisdictions offering the bar exam online are using artificial-intelligence-driven software that captures audio and video recordings of test takers in order to prevent cheating. But these systems sometimes flag excessive motion, including fidgeting, since movement can suggest the test taker is communicating with somebody else in the room. The monitoring systems have raised concerns among test-takers who are disabled.\n\nTara Roslin, director of research for the National Disabled Law Students Association, plans to take the bar online in October but worries about the proctoring software because she has Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which forces her to self-massage to manage her symptoms.\n\nThe disruptions and delays have further fueled a movement in some states to disband licensing tests, particularly the bar exam, and allow people to practice their professions with diplomas from accredited institutions.\n\nMany law students, lawmakers and even law school deans question the time and expense devoted to the bar exam. They say its focus on rote memorization is not a useful standard for admission to the profession. Five states -- Louisiana, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wisconsin -- have announced they will permit students who graduated from accredited law schools to practice as lawyers without taking the exam.\n\nBut the National Conference of Bar Examiners, a nonprofit group that produces material for the exam and scores it, says licensing exams maintain an important role.\n\n\"A bar exam and C.P.A. exam and physician licensing exam are there for public protection,\" Judith Gundersen, the group's president, said. \"It tells the public that these lawyers can competently represent people.\"\n\nMs. Speiser, the N.Y.U. graduate, continues to wait for February and her next opportunity to take the bar. To start paying back her student loans, she has been earning money by babysitting.\n\n\"People plan their lives around this exam,\" she said. \"Now, on top of the stress of the pandemic, we're unable to make money. Every single day I'm panicking.\"",

        "body": "When she is old enough, Philadelphia Eagles receiver Marquise Goodwin will teach his daughter, Marae, to put family first. He will say that she should prioritize the people she loves most when making decisions. He will share his own choice, made five months after she was born: He will sit out the 2020 N.F.L. season.\n\nPicking family over football during the coronavirus pandemic, Goodwin was one of 68 players who the N.F.L. has listed as having opted out by Thursday's deadline even as the league, despite surging transmission rates around the country, contends that the season will begin, as scheduled, on Sept. 10.\n\nThe players who opted out represent a microcosm of N.F.L. rosters: rookies and veterans, practice-squadders and starters, all of whom determined after careful consideration to lessen one risk while absorbing another. In order to keep themselves and their families safer, they will sacrifice the chance to compete for a Super Bowl, forgo showcasing themselves for more lucrative contracts and, in some cases, cede starting jobs and roster spots that may or may not be there next season.\n\nAs part of an agreement between the N.F.L. and the Players Association, players with one of the 15 medical conditions that the league regards as high risk for contracting the virus could earn $350,000 this year, while players who decided not to play will receive a $150,000 advance toward next year's salary.\n\nHalf of the players who opted out are offensive and defensive linemen, who are in closest contact with other players during practices and games. Leo Koloamatangi, an offensive lineman on the Jets who opted out, said he was resigned to contracting the virus had he chosen to play.\n\n\"Where I play, I'm literally bear-hugging another creature on the other side of the ball every single play,\" Koloamatangi, 26, said in an interview. \"If that guy has any symptoms, I'm going to get them.\" He added, \"For myself, I couldn't take those chances.\"\n\nNeither could Goodwin, 29, whose family bore a string of personal tragedies. He would not permit himself to perhaps cause another. His wife, Morgan, twice endured pregnancy complications, losing a prematurely born son in November 2017, and then, in November 2018, twin boys.\n\nThe first time, Goodwin elected to play the same day, Nov. 12, for the San Francisco 49ers, and after catching an 83-yard touchdown pass he blew a kiss to the heavens. He was with the team for a game in Tampa, Fla., the next year when Morgan woke up with contractions. She suggested he come home but never explicitly said she needed him to, knowing how seriously he took his career. He flew home, skipping the game, to be with her.\n\n\"I told myself at some point that I've got to hold it down for my family,\" Goodwin said in an interview. \"I can't let work and the check and the money dictate decisions that I truly want to make.\"\n\nGoodwin had been expecting training camp to be pushed back and when it wasn't he grew stressed about leaving his family, outside Dallas. His mother, Tamina, takes care of his younger sister, Deja, who has cerebral palsy, and Morgan's mother looks after a niece and a nephew. If either Morgan or Marae fell ill there wouldn't be a family member who could care for them. Then he heard that Kansas City Chiefs guard Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, the only medical doctor playing in the N.F.L., was opting out. Other players followed, and Goodwin felt more at peace with joining them.\n\n\"I'm always hesitant to make any serious moves because you never know how the N.F.L. will treat you, you know?\" Goodwin said. \"I was super excited because it was the first time in my life that I made a decision I'm comfortable living with the result of, as far as work is concerned.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakSports and the Virus\n\nUpdated Aug. 7, 2020\n\nHere's what's happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to life:\n\nBaseball tightened its virus protocols again: Players and staff members must wear masks in more places and cannot visit \"bars, lounges or malls\" when they are home.With no live crowd noise as a buffer at baseball games, on-field sounds are easy to hear on broadcasts -- and it's not all rated PG.The University of Connecticut canceled its football season, and Divisions II and III scrapped all of their fall championships.\n\nFor Koloamatangi, choosing to opt out was easy in one sense: He wanted to protect his 9-month-old daughter, Aurora, and his stepfather, Sele, who has heart problems, from the virus that killed two close relatives and infected another.\n\nBut other, more complex components factored into what he called \"the hardest decision of my life.\" Koloamatangi has spent his three N.F.L. seasons bouncing between the practice squad and active rosters of the Detroit Lions and Jets but has yet to appear in a regular season game. He and his agent assessed the professional impact and Koloamatangi deliberated with his wife, Athena, over the financial burden the family would assume if he didn't play. By taking the opt out, he would, in effect, be making about a fraction of his $750,000 salary -- \"an uncomfortable difference.\"\n\n\"I had to take my losses and look my wife in the eyes,\" Koloamatangi said. \"I did it to ensure the safety in my home.\"\n\nKoloamatangi and his family have been sheltering in place in California since March. The rising infection rates in New Jersey, where the Jets train and play, prompted the team to announce that it would play regular season home games without fans in MetLife Stadium or at training camp.\n\nKoloamatangi said he had spoken with a union rep every day since mid-March, lobbing questions that he wanted answered. He knew it was unfeasible for the N.F.L. to enter a so-called \"bubble,\" as the N.B.A. and N.H.L. have. But as he and Athena debated their options, he wondered why the N.F.L. refused to push back camp and the season, or introduce additional safety measures -- such as gloves or helmets with masks -- that would further mitigate his risk of infection. As it stands, the N.F.L.'s testing protocol calls for players to be tested every day for the first two weeks of training camp, and then every other day after that.\n\nUltimately, Koloamatangi said, he didn't feel confident enough to risk the travel and contact that come with playing the game he loves.\n\n\"I'm happy my workplace will be safe, but what about when I have to go out and perform my job?\" he said. \"What are you doing to ensure that when I make full contact with the guy next to me, I'm not going to contract the virus? Imagine going through an entire summer understanding that you're going to have to go to work at some point, but your job doesn't say anything about your work conditions until two weeks ago.\"\n\nKyle Peko, a defensive tackle on the Denver Broncos, reached a similar conclusion. Peko, 27, has moderate to severe asthma, among the medical conditions the league regards as high risk. He has two young children and a wife, Giuliana, who he said has been cancer-free for seven months.\n\nTheir every discussion on opting out focused on the same question: How could he play football without putting himself at risk?\n\nUndrafted out of Oregon State in 2016, Peko has lived on the margins the last four seasons, playing in 13 games. Normally he treasures this time -- rejoining teammates, preparing for camp, battling for a spot. On July 26, two days before he was to report to camp, Peko had his bags packed and his truck gassed up for the 15-hour drive from their home in La Habra, Calif.\n\nThat day, he said, he received an email from the union detailing his options, and when he realized he could keep his family safe without losing his job, he did not hesitate. He spoke to Broncos officials and coaches, all of whom, he said, respected his choice.\n\n\"Trying to go back and play football during this pandemic,\" Peko said in an interview, \"it was just hard to wrap my head around putting my family at risk when I could do my part in trying to put this pandemic to rest.\"\n\nInstead, Peko will be taking the 12 credits he needs to complete his college degree. Koloamatangi said he can concentrate on his two ventures in Hawaii -- a nonprofit that provides resources for people and business affected by the pandemic, and a grocery delivery platform for older adults. Goodwin, meantime, can't wait to bond more with Marae.\n\nSometimes, safe at home, when she sneezes or coughs, he startles. Then he remembers what he did, and he thinks to himself, \"Dang, I'm glad I didn't put her in that situation.\"",

        "body": "PARIS -- As the two women sat in deck chairs enjoying the last rays of sunshine near the Canal de l'Ourcq in Paris on Sunday evening, nearby loudspeakers jolted them with a reminder that they were in a new mask-mandatory zone.\n\n\"You've got your mask?\" Safiya Zenag, unmasked, asked her friend, who replied: \"No, I didn't bring it. I hate wearing it.\"\n\nFaced with a recent resurgence of coronavirus cases, officials have made mask wearing mandatory in widening areas of Paris and other cities across the country, pleading with the French not to let down their guard and jeopardize the hard-won gains made against the virus during a two-month lockdown this spring.\n\nThe signs of a new wave of infection emerged over the summer as people began resuming much of their pre-coronavirus lives, traveling across France and socializing in cafes, restaurants and parks. Many, especially the young, have visibly relaxed their vigilance and have not followed rules on mask wearing or social distancing.\n\nIn recent days, France has recorded about 3,000 new infections every day, roughly double the figure at the beginning of the month, and the authorities are investigating an increasing number of clusters.\n\nBut 30 percent of the new infections are in young adults, ages 15 to 44, according to a recent report. Since they are less likely to develop serious forms of the illness, deaths and the number of patients in intensive care remain at a fraction of what they were at the height of the pandemic. Still, officials are not taking any chances.\n\n\"The indicators are bad, the signals are worrying and the situation is deteriorating,\" J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, the French health ministry director, told the radio station France Inter last week. \"The fate of the epidemic is in our hands.\"\n\nMr. Salomon warned that the virus would continue to circulate and that people would have to adjust their behavior. \"We have to live with it,'' he said.\n\nFrance suffered 30,400 deaths from the virus -- one of the world's worst tolls -- and experienced an economically devastating lockdown from mid-March to mid-May. Thanks to the lockdown, however, France succeeded in stopping the spread of the virus and lifted most restrictions at the start of summer.\n\nPhilippe Juvin, the head of the emergency department at the Georges Pompidou European Hospital in Paris, said he was not surprised by the rise in cases.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-17T20:54:48.668Z Around the world, education officials move on with plans despite fears and outbreaks. Some doctors say people they treat are more inclined to believe social media posts than medical professionals. The U.S. postmaster general will testify before a House panel next week. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"You lock down people during two months, putting a stop to infections,\" he said. \"Once people are again allowed to go outside, it is not surprising that infection quickly resumes.\"\n\nThe course of the pandemic in Europe has followed a somewhat similar trend, with Spain also reporting new local clusters. But important disparities exist among countries. In the past week, as France reported 20,000 new cases, Italy reported 7,000, and Britain, 3,000, according to data collected by The New York Times.\n\nMircea Sofonea, an epidemiologist at the French University of Montpellier, said today's situation had \"nothing to do in terms of imminent health risk\" with the situation that preceded the European lockdowns because the number of hospitalized coronavirus patients and deaths remains very low.\n\nIn France, the daily number of deaths has hovered around 15 in the past week. By contrast, at the height of the epidemic in March and April, hundreds died every day in France, with the toll sometimes rising into four digits.\n\nIn April, intensive care units were at 140 percent capacity; only 7 percent were occupied about 10 days ago.\n\nMr. Sofonea said all European countries were expecting a rebound of the epidemic in the fall, when people who have been away on vacation come back to work and when social interaction resumes.\n\nThe French authorities fear that the rising number of infections in young people, many of whom are asymptomatic, may contribute to the spread of the virus to older, more vulnerable people.\n\n\"Young people felt a little more invincible,\" said Olivier George, a 36-year-old baker. \"That's probably what made them the most affected group.\"\n\nAcross the continent, crowds of young people are flocking to illegal parties organized in outdoor areas, regardless of the risk of infection.\n\nWhile the number of new cases in France has been rising steadily, it is difficult to draw comparisons with earlier stages in the epidemic.\n\nThe number of tests being carried out across France has increased to about 600,000 a week -- or about six times the numbers performed during the height of the epidemic. At that time, France suffered from severe shortages of test kits, making it impossible for many suspected of having Covid-19 to get tested.\n\nRapha\u00eblle Escande, 23, a business school student, said she fell ill in March with symptoms of the disease, including the loss of smell, a sore throat and fever. \"That lasted three weeks,'' she said. \"I stayed home because you couldn't get tested.''\n\nFrance's scientific council, a government body that advises President Emmanuel Macron on the coronavirus crisis, said in a report in late July that \"the balance is fragile, and we can change course at any time to a less-controlled scenario.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 17, 2020\n\nWhy does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nThe council warned that a second wave was \"highly possible\" in the fall, given the current trend.\n\nThe sharp rise in cases has led the government to declare Paris and the region of Marseille as high-risk zones, effectively granting the local authorities power to impose new measures aimed at containing the spread of the disease.\n\nIn Paris, mask wearing had been limited to public transportation and indoor establishments, as it was in the rest of the country. But the requirement was extended to crowded outdoor areas about a week ago, and further expanded across many more swathes of the city over the weekend.\n\nPrime Minister Jean Castex warned last week that the country had been going \"the wrong way\" for the past few weeks, and said he wanted \"to extend as far as possible the obligation to wear masks in public spaces.\"\n\nThe government's reliance on face masks as a main weapon in its fight against the virus amounts to an about-face in its strategy. Early in the epidemic, faced with severe shortages of masks, the government said they were useless against the virus -- contradicting its own longstanding public health policies.\n\n\"I didn't find them coherent at all,'' said Laura Castel, 31, a high school teacher. \"In the beginning, it was, 'Don't wear masks, they're not necessary.' But that's because we just didn't have masks, in my opinion.''\n\nNow that France has more than sufficient supplies of masks, Ms. Castel said, the government was \"singing a new tune.''\n\nPerhaps because of the government's contradictory messages on masks, people were slow to start wearing them in newly mask-mandatory zones in Paris. Along stretches of the Seine over the weekend, only about half of pedestrians had their faces covered.\n\nThe police will be enforcing the measures -- which will be in place for at least a month -- with a fine of 135 euros, or $159.\n\nIn addition to masks and tests, France now has other tools that were unavailable at the start of the epidemic, including contact-tracing teams and a contact-tracing smartphone application -- though neither have been fully tested yet.\n\nAs the French learn how to live with the virus, health officials have adapted by quickly moving to extinguish local outbreaks and tightening restrictions as needed. The goal is to prevent local clusters from spiraling out of control and pushing France again into a national lockdown.\n\nAnthony Rasoloarimanana, 40, a travel agent who was walking under the elevated metro tracks of Boulevard de la Chapelle in northern Paris, a new mask-mandatory zone, said he was worried that the recent period of resurgence was similar to the one just before the lockdown in March.\n\n\"Have the sacrifices we've made over several months been for nothing?\" he said of the lockdown. \"That would be terrible.\"\n\nTh\u00e9ophile Larcher contributed reporting from Paris.

        "body": "The revision prompted confusion and alarm from experts, who called the move \"potentially dangerous.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly modified its coronavirus testing guidelines this week to exclude people who do not have symptoms of Covid-19 -- even if they have been recently exposed to the virus.\n\nExperts questioned the revision, pointing to the importance of identifying infections in the small window immediately before the onset of symptoms, when many individuals appear to be most contagious.\n\nModels suggest that about half of transmission events can be traced back to individuals still in this so-called pre-symptomatic stage, before they start to feel ill -- if they ever feel sick at all.\n\n\"This is potentially dangerous,\" said Dr. Krutika Kuppalli, an infectious disease physician in Palo Alto, Calif. Restricting testing to only people with obvious symptoms of Covid-19 means \"you're not looking for a lot of people who are potential spreaders of disease,\" she added. \"I feel like this is going to make things worse.\"\n\nAt a moment when experts have almost universally come forward to encourage more frequent and widespread testing, especially to reach vulnerable and marginalized sectors of the population, the C.D.C.'s update appears counterintuitive and \"very strange,\" said Susan Butler-Wu, a clinical microbiologist at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of California.\n\nJust weeks ago, the National Institutes of Health announced the first round of grant recipients for its Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics program, or RADx, to scale up coronavirus testing in the coming weeks and months. On the agency's RADx website, officials underscore the importance of prioritizing tests that can \"detect people who are asymptomatic.\"\n\nA more lax approach to testing, experts said, could delay crucial treatments, as well as obscure, or even hasten, the coronavirus's spread in the community.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T22:26:40.645Z C.D.C. changes testing guidelines to exclude those exposed to virus who don't exhibit symptoms. The Trump administration ordered hospitals to report data to H.H.S. or risk losing funding. 'No second chances': Colleges are coming down hard on students who violate virus restrictions. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"I think it's bizarre,\" said Daniel Larremore, a mathematician and infectious diseases modeler at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"Any move right now to reduce levels of testing by changing guidelines is a step in the wrong direction.\"\n\nPrior iterations of the C.D.C.'s testing guidelines struck a markedly different tone, explicitly stating that \"testing is recommended for all close contacts\" of people infected with the coronavirus, regardless of symptoms. The agency also specifically emphasized \"the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission\" as an important factor in the spread of the virus.\n\nThe newest version, which was posted on Monday, amended the agency's guidance to say that people who have been in close contact with an infected individual -- typically defined as being within six feet of a person with the coronavirus and for at least 15 minutes -- \"do not necessarily need a test\" if they do not have symptoms. Exceptions, the agency noted, might be made for \"vulnerable\" individuals, or if health care providers or state or local public health officials recommend testing.\n\n\"Wow, that is a walk-back,\" Dr. Butler-Wu said. \"We're in the middle of a pandemic, and that's a really big change.\"\n\nDr. Butler-Wu said she was concerned that the guidelines would be misinterpreted as implying that people without symptoms were unable to pass the coronavirus on to others -- a falsehood that experts had been trying for months to dispel. \"If people are getting exposed, and they're not getting tested, and they're not isolating, that's a huge problem,\" Dr. Kuppalli said.\n\nBy the C.D.C.'s own estimates, roughly 40 percent of people infected with the coronavirus may never go on to develop symptoms, remaining asymptomatic for the duration of their tenure with the virus. These numbers are tentative -- and ironically can't be confirmed without more testing of people who appear entirely healthy.\n\nAlthough researchers remain unsure how often asymptomatic people unwittingly transmit the coronavirus, studies have shown that the silently infected can carry the virus in high amounts. The evidence is more clear-cut for pre-symptomatic people, in whom virus levels tend to peak just before illness sets in -- a period when these individuals might be mingling with their peers, seeding superspreader events. Notably, experts can't distinguish asymptomatic people from those who are pre-symptomatic until symptoms do or don't appear.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"It seems backward to just ignore pre-symptomatic patients,\" Dr. Butler-Wu said.\n\nDavid Piegaro, who lives in Trenton, N.J., had sought out several tests for the coronavirus in recent months, after events like funerals and those that require travel because of his post in the national guard. He never experienced symptoms, and his tests have all been negative, bringing him peace of mind, especially because he lives with his parents and grandfather. \"I viewed testing as a good thing to do,\" he said. \"Asymptomatic people could be spreading the virus, so widespread testing seems valuable.\"\n\nTracking asymptomatic cases is also important from the perspective of the infected, Dr. Kuppalli said. Less than a year into this pandemic, experts still don't know the full extent of the long-term consequences of contracting the coronavirus, even if the initial encounter seems benign.\n\nThe reasons behind the surprise shift in testing recommendations are unclear. In response to an inquiry from The New York Times, a representative for the C.D.C. directed the questions to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. An H.H.S. spokesperson said that asymptomatic testing could still be warranted \"when directed by public health leaders or health care providers,\" and noted that testing decisions should be \"based on individual circumstances and the status of community spread.\"\n\nOn Twitter, some people speculated that the Trump administration made the change to try to address continuing supply shortages, which have stymied testing efforts in many parts of the country, stretching turnaround times for results to weeks or more. Many institutions and companies performing testing have prioritized people with symptoms in their lineup as a way to expedite the return of results for those most at risk for falling severely ill.\n\nWhen asked about this, the H.H.S. spokesperson said that the modification was not a response to sputtering supply chains. \"Testing capacity has massively expanded, and we are not utilizing the full capacity that we have developed,\" the spokesperson said. \"We revised the guidance to reflect current evidence and the best public health interventions.\"\n\nPoorly timed testing, if conducted infrequently, could lead to false positives or false negatives, mistaking healthy people as infected or vice versa. That's a potential risk if someone gets tested too soon after being exposed to the coronavirus, Dr. Butler-Wu pointed out.\n\nEven so, anyone with a known exposure should quarantine and consider seeking a test, Dr. Kuppalli said, adding, \"We still need to be careful.\"",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, seeking to clarify recommendations on coronavirus testing that incited an uproar, said that \"testing may be considered for all close contacts of confirmed or probable Covid-19 patients.\"\n\nBut his clarification may have further confused the issue.\n\nThe statement by the director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield, was issued to some news outlets late Wednesday, and more broadly Thursday morning, after a storm of criticism over new C.D.C. guidelines. Those guidelines asserted that people who had been in close contact with an infected individual -- typically defined as being within six feet of a person with the coronavirus for at least 15 minutes -- \"do not necessarily need a test\" if they do not have symptoms.\n\nAdministration officials said that \"not necessarily\" needing a test was consistent with \"may be considered\" for one. But experts said the shift in language was leaving patients, doctors and state and local public health officials -- who rely on the C.D.C. for guidance -- perplexed.\n\n\"'May be?'\" asked Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease expert at Emory University. \"I want a little more than that in a recommendation. 'May be' doesn't help.\"\n\nDemocrats including the governors of California and New York as well as Speaker Nancy Pelosi have accused the C.D.C. of bowing to political pressure from President Trump, who wants to minimize the number of cases of infection. Administration officials say the guidelines were the product of a vigorous debate in the White House coronavirus task force.\n\nIn his statement, Dr. Redfield sought to explain: \"Testing is meant to drive actions and achieve specific public health objectives. Everyone who needs a Covid-19 test can get a test. Everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test; the key is to engage the needed public health community in the decision with the appropriate follow-up action.\"\n\nThe clarification does not change the new guidelines, which remain on the C.D.C.'s website. But it is unusual. Public health experts say clear, consistent communications are essential to fighting an infectious disease outbreak, and in interviews several said that statements from the C.D.C. and Dr. Redfield had fallen far short of that goal.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-27T23:31:41.247Z Redfield issues a statement after a storm of criticism over the new C.D.C. guidelines involving potentially asymptomatic people. Hurricane Laura and the virus collide in Louisiana and Texas. Researchers are working on a second wave of vaccines that they say could be cheaper and more potent than the first. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"What we need from the C.D.C. is clear, specific, directive guidance,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, a former health commissioner of Baltimore. \"It shouldn't be a Rorschach blot that we're looking at, and everybody's getting a different response by looking at the same guidance.\"\n\nDr. Wen said she was concerned about the effect of the rule on insurance coverage for testing. Insurers have been chafing against the mandate to pay for all tests without requiring a co-payment from patients. Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Medicine, said the new guidance suggested the administration was \"not going to support asymptomatic testing with new money or allow Medicaid to pay for it.\"\n\n\"I don't think the C.D.C.'.s decision forbids states from covering tests beyond the C.D.C.'s authorization, but it might give states cover to save money by making cutbacks,\" said Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at Families USA, a nonpartisan health consumer advocacy group.\n\nOne person close to the C.D.C. and the White House said the new guidelines were put in place in part to make them comport with testing for other infectious diseases, like Zika, and in part because of a sense among administration scientists -- as well as doctors and insurers -- that \"too many people were getting tested out of fear and emotion.\"\n\nThe flap came as the Trump administration announced the purchase and production of 150 million rapid tests to be distributed across the country. White House officials said the administration had teamed with Abbott Laboratories to produce inexpensive and easy-to-use BinaxNOW tests.\n\nIn the new testing guidelines, posted on Monday, the C.D.C. said close contacts of Covid-19 patients \"do not necessarily need a test\" unless they are vulnerable or their doctor or a state or local public heath official recommended it.\n\nOn a conference call with reporters Wednesday, Admiral Brett P. Giroir, the administration's coronavirus testing czar, said that the policy mirrored the existing recommendation for health care and other frontline workers, and that the task force had simply decided to extend it to the general population.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nBut the guidance was met with protest from public health experts, who said that the nation needed more testing, not less, and that it made no sense to advise anyone who had been exposed not to get a test, particularly because the virus is transmitted by asymptomatic people.\n\n\"I'm very confused by it,\" Dr. del Rio said, adding, \"I really do not understand what C.D.C. is thinking, and it doesn't make sense from an infectious disease standpoint.\"\n\nThe chief scientific officer of the Association of American Medical Colleges, Dr. Ross McKinney Jr., slammed the move as \"irresponsible,\" saying the guidelines released on Monday \"go against the best interests of the American people and are a step backward in fighting the pandemic.\"\n\nMr. Trump has suggested that the nation should do less testing, arguing that administering more tests was driving up case numbers and making the United States look bad. But experts say the true measure of the pandemic is not case numbers but test positivity rates -- the percentage of tests coming back positive.\n\nIn an interview on Wednesday, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a member of the task force and the government's top infectious disease expert, said he was concerned that the guidelines could be misinterpreted. Dr. Fauci had signed off on an early version of the rule but was undergoing surgery for removal of a polyp on his vocal cord when it was completed last Thursday.\n\nIn the statement, Dr. Redfield said the agency was \"placing an emphasis on testing individuals with symptomatic illness, individuals with a significant exposure, vulnerable populations including nursing homes or long-term care facilities, critical infrastructure workers, health care workers and first responders, or those individuals who may be asymptomatic when prioritized by medical and public health officials.\"\n\nDr. Redfield also said that anyone -- even people who tested negative -- exposed to someone who is or may be infected should \"strictly adhere\" to public health guidelines, like social distancing, wearing a mask, avoiding crowded indoor spaces and frequently washing their hands.",

        "body": "JOHANNESBURG -- Winter is ending in the Southern Hemisphere and country after country -- South Africa, Australia, Argentina -- had a surprise: Their steps against COVID-19 also apparently blocked the flu.\n\nBut there's no guarantee the Northern Hemisphere will avoid twin epidemics as its own flu season looms while the coronavirus still rages.\n\n\"This could be one of the worst seasons we've had from a public health perspective with COVID and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we've had,\" Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press.\n\nU.S. health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu in record numbers this fall, so hospitals aren't overwhelmed with a dueling \"twindemic.\"\n\nIt's also becoming clear that wearing masks, avoiding crowds and keeping your distance are protections that are \"not specific for COVID. They're going to work for any respiratory virus,\" Redfield said.\n\nThe evidence: Ordinarily, South Africa sees widespread influenza during the Southern Hemisphere's winter months of May through August. This year, testing tracked by the country's National Institute of Communicable Diseases is finding almost none -- something unprecedented.\n\nSchool closures, limited public gatherings and calls to wear masks and wash hands have \"knocked down the flu,\" said Dr. Cheryl Cohen, head of the institute's respiratory program.\n\nThat not only meant lives saved from flu's annual toll, but it \"freed up our hospitals' capacity to treat COVID-19 patients,\" Cohen added.\n\nIn Australia, the national health department reported just 36 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths from January to mid-August, compared to more than 480 during the same period last year.\n\n\"The most likely and the biggest contributor is social distancing,\" said Dr. Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney.\n\nThe coronavirus is blamed for about 24 million infections and more than 810,000 deaths globally in just the first eight months of this year. A normal flu year could have the world's hospitals dealing with several million more severe illnesses on top of the COVID-19 crush.\n\nBack in February and March, as the worldwide spread of the new virus was just being recognized, many countries throughout the Southern Hemisphere girded for a double whammy. Even as they locked down to fight the coronavirus, they made a huge push for more last-minute flu vaccinations.\n\n\"We gave many more flu vaccinations, like four times more,\" said Jaco Havenga, a pharmacist who works at Mays Chemist, a pharmacy in a Johannesburg suburb.\n\nSome countries' lockdowns were more effective than others at stemming spread of the coronavirus. So why would flu have dropped even if COVID-19 still was on the rise?\n\n\"Clearly the vigilance required to be successful against COVID is really high,\" said CDC's Redfield. \"This virus is one of the most infectious viruses that we've seen.\"\n\nThat's in part because 40% of people with COVID-19 show no symptoms yet can spread infection, he said.\n\nFlu hasn't disappeared, cautions a World Health Organization report earlier this month. While \"globally, influenza activity was reported at lower levels than expected for this time of year,\" it found sporadic cases are being reported.\n\nPlus, some people who had the flu in Southern countries might just have hunkered down at home and not seen a doctor as the coronavirus was widespread, WHO added.\n\nBut international influenza experts say keeping schools closed -- children typically drive flu's spread -- and strict mask and distancing rules clearly helped.\n\n\"We don't have definitive proof, but the logical explanation is what they're doing to try to control the spread of (the coronavirus) is actually doing a really, really good job against the flu as well,\" said Richard Webby of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, who is part of a WHO committee that tracks flu evolution.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. and Europe didn't impose coronavirus rules nearly as restrictive as some of their Southern neighbors -- and in many cases are reopening schools and relaxing distancing rules even as COVID-19 still is spreading and the cooler months that favor influenza's spread are fast approaching.\n\nSo the U.S. CDC is urging record flu vaccinations, preferably by October. Redfield's goal is for at least 65% of adults to be vaccinated; usually only about half are.\n\nThe U.S. expects more than 190 million doses of flu vaccine, about 20 million more than last year. States are being encouraged to try drive-thru flu shots and other creative ideas to get people vaccinated while avoiding crowds.\n\nIn an unusual move, Massachusetts has mandated flu vaccination for all students -- from elementary to college -- this year. Typically only some health care workers face employment mandates for flu vaccine.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson likewise is urging widespread flu vaccination.\n\nTo be clear, the flu vaccine only protects against influenza -- it won't lessen the chances of getting the coronavirus. Vaccines against COVID-19 still are experimental and several candidates are entering final testing to see if they really work.\n\nBut for coronavirus protection, Redfield continues to stress vigilance about wearing masks, keeping your distance, avoiding crowds and washing your hands.\n\n\"Once one stops those mitigation steps, it only takes a couple weeks for these viral pathogens to get back on the path that they were on,\" he said.\n\nWhile the U.S. has been mask-resistant, most states now have some type of mask requirement, either through statewide orders issued by governors or from city and county rules.\n\nMeanwhile, countries where flu season is ending are watching to see if the Northern Hemisphere heeds their lessons learned.\n\n\"It could be very scary -- we honestly don't know. But if you're going to get the two infections at the same time, you could be in big trouble,\" said Booy, the Sydney infectious diseases expert.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

A Russian opposition leader was hospitalized in a suspected poisoning. And Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic nomination for vice president.\n\nIn September, California approved a bill with the power to reshape the state's gig economy. Under the new law, companies are required to treat contract workers as employees if they contribute to the company's core business, among other factors. That means providing them benefits like paid overtime and health insurance.\n\nThe new law threatened app-based companies that rely on independent labor, and the state sued Uber and Lyft in May for violating it.\n\n\"The perspective of the state is that gig work has become wildly popular, even though it does not have legal recognition in California,\" said Kate Conger, who covers technology at The Times, \"and the right thing to do is pull those jobs back into a traditional employment model.\"\n\nThis month, a judge gave the ride-hailing companies until Thursday to comply; the companies appealed the ruling and said they may suspend their services in the state. Before the coronavirus pandemic, California accounted for 16 percent of Lyft's total rides and 9 percent of Uber's, The Wall Street Journal reports. The shutdown would be another hit to the businesses, which have seen a nosedive in rides since the virus hit.\n\nThe pandemic has also heightened the burden on independent contractors. \"Drivers can't take paid time off, don't have health insurance, rides have plummeted, but they still have vehicle expenses, so they were left out on a ledge in this scenario,\" Kate said.\n\nWhile many drivers want to become employees, others who don't drive full-time oppose the legislation, preferring the flexibility that comes with staying independent.\n\nThe companies have poured tens of millions of dollars into a November ballot measure that would exempt them from the law and provide minimum-wage standards and limited health benefits for drivers. They've also been exploring a franchise-like model, in which they would license their brands to operators of vehicle fleets in California.\n\nThe legal fight in California could influence the gig economy nationwide. Similar battles are taking place in Massachusetts and other states are monitoring the outcome closely, Kate said.\n\n\"Long term, I think we will see significant changes to gig work,\" she said, \"but it's not clear to me who is going to win the tug-of-war.\"\n\nFIVE MORE BIG STORIES1. Harris accepts V.P. nomination\n\nSenator Kamala Harris of California accepted the nomination to be the Democratic Party's nominee for vice president last night, embracing the historic nature of her candidacy and name-checking a lineage of trailblazing Black women. She said the night was one that her mother, an immigrant from India, \"could have never imagined.\"\n\nIn the night's other big speech, former President Barack Obama ripped into President Trump with a ferocity that he had long resisted. Watch the highlights here.\n\nFrom Opinion: Our writers ranked the night's best and worst moments.\n\nToday's lineup: The last night of the convention will feature Joe Biden's keynote address. We'll have live coverage beginning at 9 p.m. Eastern.\n\n2. New evidence on immunity\n\nResearchers discovered the strongest evidence yet that overcoming the coronavirus grants immunity from reinfection. According to a new study, a fishing vessel carrying 122 crew members returned to Seattle after an outbreak onboard. More than 100 sailors tested positive, but the three who had antibodies at the start of the trip remained virus-free.\n\n\"A lot of people, when they see this are like, 'Oh come on, it could be due to random chance,'\" one virologist told The Times. But in fact, the likelihood that those three sailors were randomly unaffected was incredibly small.\n\nIn other virus news:\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded that local officials in Wuhan, China, tried to hide the dangers of the coronavirus from the central government in Beijing in the outbreak's earliest days.\n\nThe Venezuelan government, unable to contain the virus, has instead started detaining thousands of residents in makeshift containment centers and labeling those who may have come into contact with the virus \"bioterrorists.\"\n\n3. Wildfires add to triple threat in California\n\nHundreds of wildfires fueled by strong winds, dry conditions and lightning strikes have burned more than 300,000 acres across California. Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency this week as the blazes destroyed dozens of homes and forced thousands of residents to evacuate.\n\nThe wildfires are part of a triple threat in the state, along with high numbers of new coronavirus infections and a nearly weeklong heat wave that has prompted power outages. Smoke from the fires has also lowered air quality for millions, threatening respiratory damage and making those exposed to the virus more vulnerable.\n\n4. Trump courts QAnon\n\nTrump on Wednesday praised adherents of the false conspiracy theory QAnon, which alleges that the president is waging a covert war against a \"deep state\" cabal of Satan-worshiping Democrats involved in pedophilia and child sex trafficking.\n\n\"I've heard these are people that love our country,\" Trump said in response to a reporter's question during a White House briefing. \"So I don't know really anything about it other than they do supposedly like me.\"\n\nOn Facebook: The social network took its most sweeping actions yet, removing nearly 800 QAnon-affiliated groups from its site and restricting others.\n\nNeed a primer? Our colleague Kevin Roose breaks down everything you need to know about QAnon.\n\n5. No mass outcry over police abuses in India\n\nPolice brutality is widespread in India. More than 1,700 people were killed in police custody last year, according to one human rights group -- a majority of them Muslims and lower-caste Hindus.\n\nPolice abuses rarely result in punishment. And while some Indians have protested against police violence, no significant grass-roots movement has arisen to oppose it.\n\n\"Many Indians are so fed up with crime and corruption, they don't mind giving the police a free hand to do whatever they want to those who are seen as criminals, whether the suspects have been given due process or not,\" Jeffrey Gettleman, The Times's South Asia bureau chief, told us.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nAleksei Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition leader, was in intensive care at a Siberian hospital today after suffering symptoms of what his spokeswoman called poisoning.\n\nThe Trump administration is quietly planning to sell F-35 fighter jets and advanced drones to the United Arab Emirates. Israel and Congress may object to the sales.\n\nMichigan is expected to pay about $600 million to victims of the Flint water crisis in a major settlement set to be announced this week.\n\nApple became the first U.S. company to hit a $2 trillion valuation, part of a growth bonanza for tech giants during the pandemic.\n\nAaron Coleman, a 19-year-old who admitted to circulating a nude photo of a girl as revenge while in middle school, narrowly won a Democratic primary for a seat in the Kansas House of Representatives.\n\nPretty much everything about office life and workplace culture has changed. Here's a new project diving into how we work now.\n\nLives Lived: The Senate is an exclusive club in its own right, but Slade Gorton of Washington State belonged to an even more rarefied one: senators who were returned to the chamber after a re-election loss. He died at 92.\n\nIDEA OF THE DAY: How to manage risk\n\nIt can be hard to know how worried to be about your chances of contracting the coronavirus. Here are some ways to think about and cope with the risks.\n\nPractice harm reduction. Keeping in mind basic factors about your likelihood of getting sick can help you assess risk amid changing information about the virus, explains Dana Smith of Elemental. Those basics include knowing the scale of the outbreak where you live, wearing a mask and avoiding others if you're immunocompromised or elderly.\n\nDevelop a tolerance. The virus isn't going away anytime soon. Learning to live with it means accepting the small levels of risk that remain even after you've taken steps to stay safe, argues Elisabeth Rosenthal in a Times Op-Ed.\n\nKeep perspective. Many activities -- like exercising outside -- are low risk. Others, like grocery shopping and even riding on an airplane while masked, seem to be less risky than you might think. Vox, Business Insider and The Times's Tara Parker-Pope have written guides to help you weigh the risks of everyday activities.\n\nPLAY, WATCH, EAT, CHEERMake something comforting\n\nSabudana khichdi, which loosely translates to \"tapioca mixture,\" is a chewy pilaf studded with toasted peanuts, creamy potato and cumin seeds. It's a simple dish that is a party of textures and flavors -- here's how to make it.\n\nStay curious\n\nHave you ever considered the complex history of human excrement? Or how the power of surveillance can be viewed through the lens of migratory birds? Or maybe how information about the weather could help predict the spread of disease?\n\nThey seem random and unrelated, but these are all questions Latif Nasser, a science journalist known for his work on the popular program \"Radiolab,\" explores in his new Netflix series, \"Connected.\" Nasser, who has a Ph.D. in the history of science, serves as a unique guide to the world's deepest curiosities. Read our enlightening interview with him here.\n\nThe love of the game\n\nWhile live sports are back, in most cases, spectators are not. The Times asked sports fans to share what they missed most about going to games. From the simple pleasure of a minor-league baseball game with the family to the singular joy of seeing a hometown team make the playoffs, the responses were wistful, sad and full of hope. Read them here.\n\nDiversions\n\nWant flowers that are as functional as they are pretty? Plant some asters and goldenrods, which are butterfly-friendly and ecologically beneficial.\n\nThe late-night comedy hosts wondered how Trump was reacting to the speeches at the Democratic convention.\n\nGames\n\nHere's today's Mini Crossword, and a clue: Shape of a hockey rink (four letters).\n\nYou can find all of our puzzles here.\n\nThanks for spending part of your morning with The Times.

        "body": "Monday: Catch up on news of the wildfires burning across California.\n\nGood morning.\n\nAfter a taxing weekend, we're in for a tough week.\n\nAs of Sunday, more than 14,000 firefighters were scrambling to protect communities from two dozen major blazes, which have left at least six people dead and dozens injured, and have forced more than 100,000 people from their homes under evacuation orders.\n\nRoughly 1.1 million acres have burned -- an area larger than Rhode Island -- since Aug. 15, according to Cal Fire. More than 600,000 acres of that has been in the groups of fires known as the L.N.U. Lightning Complex and the S.C.U. Lightning Complex, which have become the second- and third-largest fires in state history\n\nAnd the weather is only making matters worse: Dry thunderstorms were expected to bring more lightning without rain, with a red flag warning in place for much of Northern California and down to the Central Coast.\n\nBut while the fires have burned near communities where residents are learning to live with a predictable annual threat and terrible air quality, Californians have been faced with dueling, interlocked catastrophes: the wildfires, worsened by climate change, and the pandemic.\n\nYear after year, the state has relied on prisoners to do some of the most dangerous work on the fire lines. But in 2020, with some of the nation's biggest outbreaks of Covid-19 happening behind bars, many of these inmate firefighters have been released to protect them from the virus.\n\n[Read more about the prisoners fighting California's wildfires.]\n\nAnd doctors at the University of California, San Francisco, said last week that even if they didn't see an immediate increase in Covid-19 patients stemming from the smoke -- which could worsen symptoms and speed transmission -- more people are likely to get sick as the fire season drags along in coming months, exacerbating all respiratory ailments.\n\n\"It's really become the new normal that we have these mega-fires that foul our air,\" said Dr. John Balmes, a U.C.S.F. professor of medicine specializing in environmental medicine and pulmonary and critical care. \"I'm worried about the future, as well as the current situation, because this is going to happen again, and again and again.\"\n\n[Read more about how evacuation shelters work in the pandemic.]\n\nFor many parents, evacuation orders came as students were set to begin virtual learning, throwing those plans into chaos.\n\nAnd for families who might ordinarily flee to the homes of relatives or close friends, worries about the virus have complicated those decisions.\n\n[Track California's coronavirus cases.]\n\nChelsea Sterrett wrote in an email on Thursday that her family was ordered to evacuate as the River Fire, south of Salinas, approached.\n\nShe and her husband are both high school teachers who were in the midst of their first week of virtual learning; their children were set to start school online the day the mandatory evacuation order came.\n\nSo the parents packed up their three children (ages 7, 5 and 1) and a dog, and left to stay with family friends they hadn't seen in months because of the pandemic.\n\n\"The immediate crisis of the fire was bigger than our concerns about Covid,\" she wrote.\n\nKevin Susco wrote in an email late last week that his daughter-in-law asked on Tuesday if she and her son, who were under an evacuation warning in Boulder Creek, could stay with him and his wife in Palo Alto.\n\nTheir son, he said, is an Army Reservist currently in Kuwait.\n\n\"We've been together only briefly since the pandemic, because my wife and I are both in our sixties, and we take the threat from the virus seriously,\" he said. \"But we didn't think about it too much before we said, sure, come over if you need to evacuate.\"\n\n[See the latest updates on the fires here.]\n\nSome who are at particularly high risk of getting seriously ill or dying of Covid-19 are confronting difficult choices, however.\n\nDeborah Meltzer, 67, said in an email that she's one of a growing number of baby boomers who are live-in caregivers to aging parents -- in her case, her 100-year-old father.\n\nShe lives in Elk Grove, where smoke has filled the air and the dangers, both from the fires and the poor air, are constantly on her mind.\n\n\"Quite frankly, I am not sure what I would do or where I would take my dad in the event of an evacuation,\" she said.\n\n(This article is part of the California Today newsletter.

        "body": "Friday: People with respiratory illnesses may be more vulnerable right now. Also: Are N95 masks recommended for wildfires?\n\nGood morning. So far this August, California has been hit hard by wildfires, record high temperatures and power blackouts, all in the midst of a pandemic. One reader asked how residents with respiratory illnesses are faring.\n\nEvan Underwood, who suffers from asthma, migraines and heat sensitivity, has been quarantined inside his home in San Ramon for months. And now, with wildfires raging across Northern California, if the air quality index -- which measures pollution levels -- goes above 100, going outside for even a few minutes would trigger an asthma attack and migraine that would last an entire day. His plan is to hunker down at home until fire season is over, as long as he doesn't lose power or is forced to evacuate.\n\nFor our series answering readers' questions about life during the pandemic, Mr. Underwood asked us about how smoke inhalation is affecting people who are high risk for severe Covid-19, like himself, and if they are more vulnerable to significant illness. \"If our whole region is bathed in smoke, when so many people still have damaged lungs, the virus is still endemic and people are going back to work, that can't be good, can it?\" he wrote.\n\nAs my colleagues have reported, Covid-19 and smoke is a dangerous combination, as both affect the respiratory system, making those exposed to the virus more vulnerable.\n\nPolluted air can also weaken the immune systems of healthy people, making them more susceptible to illnesses like Covid-19, according to experts from the Washington State Department of Health.\n\nAnd studies have shown that in areas with poor air quality, people are more likely to die if they contract the virus.\n\n[Read the latest updates on the wildfires burning across California.]\n\n\"We know that people with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at higher risk for both acquiring Covid-19 and having more severe symptoms if they do become infected,\" said Dr. Jeanne A. Noble, an emergency medicine doctor and the director of the Covid-19 response at U.C.S.F. Medical Center's emergency department. \"Adding smoke inhalation into the mix will further increase the vulnerability of everyone to Covid-19, but particularly for those with respiratory problems.\"\n\nDr. Noble said she could see smoke rising above the city as she drove over the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge to work on Wednesday evening. Since March, the emergency department at U.C.S.F. Hospital has been using outdoor tents to properly space patients as they wait to be seen. The fumes will probably make them unusable.\n\n\"We've been strongly encouraging everyone to take things outdoors. It's just so much safer. And now we can't,\" she said. \"It's essentially like winter coming early.\"\n\nIn addition, Dr. Noble said her department would most likely be busier, as there is always an uptick in respiratory cases during power outages from people who rely on electrically powered CPAP machines for breathing or nebulizers for administering medicine. Heat is also a trigger for asthma and emphysema, she said.\n\nFor people who have been infected with Covid-19 and have lingering effects, Dr. Michael Daignault, an emergency room doctor at Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center in Burbank, said that since Covid-19 is a multi-systemic inflammatory disease, significant smoke exposure and inhalation, along with an underlying respiratory system disease, could possibly exacerbate symptoms.\n\n\"I think this depends on the primary symptoms a patient with Covid-19 had and their underlying medical problems,\" he said.\n\nIn previous years, people have used N95 masks or respirators to protect themselves against inhaling dangerous particles caused by wildfire smoke.\n\nBut Allison Thomas, a reader in Butte County, asked us: \"There are no N95 masks available for the general public to use. What are we going to use when the wildfires begin?\"\n\nLike everything these days, the pandemic has complicated things. Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state public health officials are telling people to save N95 masks for workers on the frontline of the pandemic.\n\nThe California Department of Public Health states on their website: \"Don't buy N95 respirator masks for personal use. They are part of PPE needed by medical professionals.\"\n\nDr. Noble cautions against the use of N95 masks with exhalation valves. Although they are effective in filtering out particles from smoke, the valves let the wearer's breath escape the mask, thus posing a risk for spreading Covid-19. If the mask contains an exhalation valve, she said you should wear a surgical mask over it.\n\nIf you are feeling the effects of smoke, you should try other means of exposure reduction first.\n\nIn its guide for wildfire smoke, the Environmental Protection Agency advised, \"Respirators should only be used after first implementing other, more effective methods of exposure reduction, including staying indoors, reducing activity, and using HEPA air cleaners indoors to reduce overall smoke exposure.\"\n\n[What to know about buying an air purifier to clear wildfire smoke.]\n\nIf you cannot reduce your exposure in other ways, experts say N95 or N100 masks will work to filter out fine particles. But keep in mind that respirators are not approved for infants and small children and may not work on people with beards.\n\nFor people with respiratory illnesses, Dr. Daignault said to make sure you have enough medicine in stock and use breathing aids, like albuterol, when needed and seek medical attention if things worsen.\n\nDr. Noble said, \"I think people are going to have to be really vigilant about watching the air quality.\" She recommends checking the E.P.A.'s interactive map for updates. \"Just as a lot of people have gotten in the habit of tracking Covid-19 numbers to see when their kid's school might reopen or when their county gets off the watch list, I think people now need to get in the habit of checking the air quality index.\"\n\nHave a question about how the pandemic is changing daily life in California?

        "body": "You could help prevent a \"twindemic\" of influenza and Covid-19, they say. Doctors have specific advice for people over 65, pregnant women and those with egg allergies. Here's what you need to know.\n\nPeople usually don't think about flu shots until the fall, so you might be surprised to learn that many places are already offering them. Public health officials, fearing that the confluence of Covid-19 and influenza cases could result in a \"twindemic\" that will further overburden hospitals and testing locations, are urging vaccination for nearly everyone.\n\n\"We don't have many arrows in our quiver in terms of combating Covid,\" said Dr. Kevin Ban, the chief medical officer for Walgreens, which began administering the vaccine across its stores on Aug. 17. That's why medical professionals are focusing instead on minimizing flu cases, so \"resources go where they need to,\" he added.\n\nHere is everything doctors want you to know about the influenza vaccine this year.\n\nWho should get vaccinated?\n\n\"Everyone above the age of 6 months should be getting the flu vaccine,\" said Dr. Uchenna Ikediobi, an assistant professor of general internal medicine and infectious diseases at Yale University.\n\nIn particular, those who are at a higher risk should get it, she said. This includes adults over 65 years old, those with underlying illnesses like asthma or heart disease, pregnant women, caretakers who are exposed to vulnerable groups, and essential workers, among others. For specific guidance about when these groups should get the vaccine, see below.\n\nGrowing concern over the combined impact of the two viruses has even led some to mandate the vaccine. The University of California system announced this month that it would require all its employees and students to get a flu shot by Nov. 1. And Massachusetts is requiring all students between 6 months and 30 years old to get the flu shot by the end of the year.\n\nWhen should I get my flu shot?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone get the flu shot in September or October, before the start of the flu season. Experts suggest that adults over 65 and those with compromised immune systems wait until at least mid-September, so that the vaccine's protection lasts the entire season.\n\nBut if you are young and healthy, \"if the flu shot is available in your area, I would suggest to get it\" now, said Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, the medical director for the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, said it was better to go early than not at all. And if you miss the recommended time frame, you should still go, since influenza cases typically reach their peak in February.\n\nAre influenza vaccines safe?\n\nAbsolutely. Despite unfounded fears, there is no evidence of adverse effects in most people. Some people do experience mild symptoms like a sore arm, itchy eyes or fatigue after getting the flu shot, but these usually go away on their own within a few days.\n\nEven if you are pregnant, you can and should get vaccinated. Pregnant women are one of the groups the C.D.C. says are at high risk for influenza complications.\n\nVaccines undergo several clinical trials, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the F.D.A. before the medicine is released to the public. The vaccines continue to be monitored for safety and effectiveness, and every year the C.D.C. releases new flu vaccination guidelines.\n\nWhat if I am allergic to eggs?\n\nSome vaccines are grown using chicken eggs, so some people with egg allergies have avoided getting the shot. Those with mild or moderate egg allergies should still get the shot, Dr. Marcelin said. If you have a severe allergy, however, you should consult your doctor, who should supervise the vaccination. There is also an egg-free vaccine available.\n\nIf you are pregnant and allergic to eggs you should consult your doctor about the best vaccine for you.\n\nWhat if I don't like needles?\n\nThere's a nasal version of the flu vaccine. While past studies found that method to be most effective for children, that guidance has changed in recent years. The nasal vaccine is now approved for people ages 2 to 49, unless they are pregnant or have certain medical conditions. And you should not get this type of treatment with a runny or congested nose, Dr. Marcelin said, because that can interfere with the delivery of the vaccine. The nasal spray is not as widely available -- Walgreens, for instance, does not carry it -- but you can request it from your doctor.\n\nWhere should I get the vaccine?\n\nRite Aid, CVS and Walgreens (and its Duane Reade stores in New York) all have the vaccine in stock, as do other pharmacies. To find a location near you, try the Healthmap Vaccine Finder tool. In an effort to expand access, the U.S. Department of Health is also allowing pharmacists to administer the vaccine to young children. Walgreens reduced its age requirement from 7 to 4 years old in eligible states, while CVS pharmacists are administering the shot to kids as young as 3. You may also contact your doctor.\n\nHow is the vaccine different this year?\n\nAs always, this year's shot was updated to include the influenza variants that are predicted to circulate in the United States. But there is a special vaccine for adults 65 years old and older with a higher dosage that has been updated to protect against four strains of influenza, rather than three as in previous years. A version of that high-dosage shot containing adjuvant, which boosts immune response, was also licensed.\n\nHow much does it cost?\n\nFor those with private insurance, Medicare or Medicaid, the shot is typically free or comes with a low co-payment. Contact your insurer for more information.\n\nIf you don't have coverage, it may be worth shopping around. At Walgreens, the uninsured cost is $40.99 for the quadrivalent shot, which is the most common variety, and $72.99 for the shot geared toward those 65 and older. At CVS and Rite Aid, it is a little cheaper: $39.99 for the seasonal vaccine, and $69.99 for the high-dose vaccine.\n\nCould we see a repeat of past shortages?\n\nIt's too early to know for sure but that's highly unlikely, Dr. Ikediobi said. This year, manufacturers project that they will deliver as many as 198 million flu shots, which is at least 15 percent more than the record amount produced last year.\n\nStill, it's best not to procrastinate. \"What I'm telling my patients every opportunity that I get is that we do not know what this season is going to look like,\" Dr. Ikediobi said. \"Find out now where you can get it without hesitation so that when the season starts in the next few weeks, you are in line and you've gotten yours.\"\n\nWhat about coronavirus precautions?\n\nThe CDC has released safety guidelines for all health care providers. So as long as your provider is following these guidelines, it is safe to get your shot there. For example, Dr. Ban said Walgreens has implemented rigorous cleaning protocols and are checking patients for symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. Pharmacists who administer the shots wear both a face mask and a face shield, and patients are required to wear a mask.\n\nHow serious is the threat of a 'twindemic'?\n\nMedical experts don't know. Some hope that the measures taken against coronavirus could also slow the spread of influenza.\n\nThose precautions should be familiar by now: avoiding large groups, maintaining at least six feet of distance from others in public, washing your hands frequently, and wearing masks and other face coverings, especially indoors.\n\nDr. Schaffner said there have been some papers suggesting that \"very rigorous use of masks, social distancing and indeed the lockdown did indeed reduce the transmission of influenza\" in other countries.\n\nBut that may not be the case in the U.S., he warned. \"There are the real careful people who are being very attentive,\" he said, \"and then there are lots of people unfortunately in this country who are being rather careless and carefree.\"\n\nThis inconsistent behavior makes it hard to predict anything about the flu season.\n\nBut Dr. Ikediobi said that places with a good track record of following coronavirus precautions could have fewer cases of influenza. \"This is just a prediction.\".",

        "body": "He doesn't think so: \"It's not a full season; it'll be an asterisk.\" Even still, his .500 average so far is extraordinary on its own.\n\nThe plaque for Hugh Duffy at the Baseball Hall of Fame all but certifies his status as the premier single-season hitter in major league history. \"He compiled a batting average in 1894 which was not to be challenged in his lifetime,\" it states -- and Duffy lived for six decades after his achievement.\n\nDuffy, an outfielder for the Boston Beaneaters, forefathers of the Atlanta Braves, hit .440 in that 1894 season. Indeed, nobody has come close to his record, not even Ted Williams, who batted .406 in 1941. No one has come within 12 points of Williams since.\n\nWhich brings us to Charlie Blackmon and the curious case of 2020. Blackmon, the Colorado Rockies' right fielder, is so hot that he could not only hit .400 this season, he might just challenge Duffy's ancient record.\n\nAfter going 3 for 4 on Tuesday against the Arizona Diamondbacks, Blackmon was batting .500 (34 for 68), making him just the fifth player in the last 50 years with a .500 average through his team's first 17 games. The others include three Hall of Famers -- Tony Perez in 1970, Rod Carew in 1983, Larry Walker in 1997 -- and Barry Bonds, in 2004.\n\nTheir seasons all lasted 162 games, of course. This season -- with opening day delayed until last month because of the coronavirus pandemic -- will cover only 60. Baseball has declared that all records would count nonetheless, but Blackmon, a career .304 hitter before this season, doubts he will set one.\n\n\"No, I don't really think .400 is a realistic mark for today's game,\" he said before Tuesday's game. \"The pitching is too good. The stuff is too good, there's more specialization. I don't think it's something that will happen. There's maybe some scares, but I think .400 is just too far away from the average. I don't think it's something that will be done. I'm not like, expecting to hit .400 for a season. I don't really think that's a realistic goal.\"\n\nBefore Wednesday's games, major leaguers were batting just .235, worse than their lowest collective mark for a season: .237 in 1968. For an individual, though, .400 seems plausible -- Donovan Solano of the San Francisco Giants was also on pace to beat Duffy's mark, with a .458 average through Tuesday. In 2017, when Blackmon won the National League batting title with a career-high .331 average, he hit .374 across 60 games from July 1 through Sept. 9.\n\nHe could conceivably hit .400, right?\n\n\"Yeah, but then again it's not a full season; it'll be an asterisk,\" Blackmon said. \"Even so, I don't think I'm going to hit .400 for 60 games. Statistically speaking, it's not very likely.\"\n\nLast season's leading hitter, Tim Anderson of the Chicago White Sox, was batting .424 after the team's first 17 games. By Game No. 60, his average had dropped to .323, much closer to its season-ending .335. That seems to be a more likely path for Blackmon.\n\nThen again, breaking records is never likely. Blackmon, who mostly hit leadoff in the past, has thrived in the No. 3 spot this season and helped lead Colorado (12-5) to the top of the N.L. West. An extended pursuit of .400 would be a talking point this season and would surely elevate his stature. Blackmon, 34, is a four-time All-Star but has never finished higher than fifth in voting for most valuable player.\n\n\"Charlie deserves recognition as an elite hitter, and if he gets over .400, it's a great milestone for his career and for a season that needs great stories,\" said Ryan Spilborghs, a Rockies television analyst who played for their 2007 World Series team. \"But I don't think it would be recognized the same way that we look at Ted Williams.\"\n\nSpilborghs said Blackmon separates himself from peers by never giving away an at-bat, a natural product, he believes, of the persistence and drive he needed to forge a career at the plate. Blackmon started college as a pitcher, but turned to hitting in a summer league with encouragement from his coach, the former major leaguer Rusty Greer. The Rockies drafted him in the second round from Georgia Tech in 2008.\n\n\"Physically and mentally, he's as strong and tough as anybody I've ever been around,\" said Rockies Manager Bud Black, who has spent more than 40 years in baseball. \"And what he's doing this year is a result of not only his overall talent, but what he does to get ready for a game and what he does post-game.\"\n\nBlackmon has done all this despite contracting Covid-19 before the season. Blackmon had been working out before summer training camp in Denver and then contracted the virus on a trip home to Georgia. Though his symptoms were mild, Blackmon curtailed his training for a while and has had to adapt.\n\n\"It's been difficult to ramp up to the capacity that I need to be able to play Major League Baseball,\" he said. \"It wouldn't be so hard if I just had to play for three hours a day, but there's a lot more that goes into what it takes to be on the field for three hours. You've got to keep all your baseball skills sharp, you've got to work out, you've got to recover, and then you've got to do that day after day after day -- at altitude, at sea level, back to altitude. That's the only lingering effects that I'm seeing from the virus.\"\n\nWhile the spacious outfield and thin air help hitters in Denver, the constant adjustments for road games are taxing on bodies and batting averages. Blackmon has a .352 career average at home and .264 on the road, figures that underscore the importance of context, which is more essential in 2020 than ever.\n\nThe shortened schedule makes this season a historic outlier, but so much else has changed since the days of the .400 hitter. The majors have been integrated. Pitchers have perfected an array of options beyond the fastball and curve. Hitters are less familiar with the arms they see -- Williams faced only 73 pitchers in the entire 1941 season; Blackmon has already faced 41 in 2020.\n\n\"The season's the season, and I think there's enough integrity to 60 games -- 200-plus at-bats, more than likely,\" Black said. \"I think there is some legitimacy to this, I really do. There is competition from Game 1 until Game 60.\"\n\nTo Blackmon, though, the conversation is moot. He said he had been \"pretty lucky\" so far, with ground balls slipping through the infield and floaters dropping safely in the outfield. He is more concerned with the Rockies' success than his own.\n\nIn any case, Blackmon will not spend much time contemplating his season or what it could mean in history -- especially not on Thursday, the Rockies' only open date of the month. What will he do all day?\n\n\"I don't really know,\" Blackmon said, \"but there's going to have to be a lot of rest involved.\"",

        "body": "Want to get The Morning by email? Here's the sign-up.\n\nGood morning. Russia approves a possible coronavirus vaccine before clinical trials are finished. More than 100 people were arrested after unrest in Chicago. And there are troubling developments around young people and the virus.\n\nIn the last two weeks of July, nearly 100,000 children in the United States tested positive for the coronavirus, according to data from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association.\n\nThe speed and the scale of the infections -- dozens of countries have not yet recorded 100,000 cases in total -- further complicate the already daunting issue of reopening schools. In Georgia, Indiana and other states, some schools that reopened have already closed down again after new outbreaks emerged.\n\nRecent research suggests that children can carry at least as much of the virus in their noses and throats as adults do, even if they have only mild or moderate symptoms. That has prompted fears that students who become ill at school may spread the virus to their older relatives.\n\nBut it's not just older people who are at risk -- in some rare cases, a child's health can be severely affected. Nearly 600 young people in the U.S., from infants to 20 year olds, have developed an inflammatory syndrome linked to Covid-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports. Most of the children required intensive care.\n\n\"I fear that there has been this sense that kids just won't get infected or don't get infected in the same way as adults and that, therefore, they're almost like a bubbled population,\" Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota, told The Times in July.\n\n\"There will be transmission,\" he said. \"What we have to do is accept that now and include that in our plans.\"\n\nIn other virus developments:\n\nA Russian health care regulator has become the first in the world to approve a possible vaccine against the coronavirus, President Vladimir Putin announced today, although the vaccine has yet to complete clinical trials. The Russian dash for a vaccine has already raised international concerns that the country is rushing approval for political purposes.\n\nPresident Trump is considering a rule that would let border officials temporarily block U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents from entering the country if they are believed to have the virus.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that fully opening Britain's schools next month was a \"moral duty.\" Medical experts have said that the government may have to sacrifice pubs and restaurants to control the spread of the virus if in-person teaching resumes.\n\nTHREE MORE BIG STORIES1. Lebanon's government resigns\n\nThe prime minister of Lebanon, Hassan Diab, and his cabinet stepped down yesterday, amid widespread fury over the enormous explosion last week in Beirut and a continuing economic crisis.\n\nIn a televised address, Diab, who has been in office since January, blamed a system of corruption \"bigger than the state\" for the country's problems. He will take on a caretaker role until a new prime minister is chosen -- a process that could take months.\n\n\"It's symbolically a big deal,\" Herbert Buchsbaum, The Times's Middle East editor, told us. \"It's the government recognizing that it has seriously failed its people. But the way it's also not a big deal is that it's not enough to fundamentally change anything.\"\n\nFor protesters, who saw the explosion as the latest example of decades of government mismanagement, Diab's resignation fell far short of their demands for the ouster of the country's political elite. \"I have nothing to lose,\" said one demonstrator. \"I just graduated. I'm an architect. I'm unemployed and I don't have hope. Either we do this or we leave this country.\"\n\nOn the ground: Across three disparate neighborhoods in Beirut, the catastrophe has \"united everyone in rage against a government seen as corrupt, dysfunctional and ineffectual,\" writes our Beirut bureau chief, Ben Hubbard.\n\n2. Unrest in Chicago\n\nMore than 100 people were arrested in Chicago on charges of disorderly conduct, looting and battery against the police yesterday, after crowds smashed through store windows and clashed with the police along the Magnificent Mile shopping district.\n\nThe cause of the unrest was still murky by Monday evening, though it seemed to have been set off after police officers shot a 20-year-old man who they said had fired at them first.\n\nMayor Lori Lightfoot expressed outrage over the unrest, and ordered limited access to downtown starting Monday evening. But she made it clear that she did not want federal troops sent to the city and drew a distinction between the turmoil and the \"righteous uprising\" of demonstrations that followed the killing of George Floyd.\n\nIn Seattle: The city's police chief, Carmen Best, said last night that she would resign, hours after the City Council approved cuts to the police budget.\n\nA deadly summer: Months spent in lockdown and the pandemic's effects on the economy appear to have contributed to an abnormally large increase in homicides across 20 major U.S. cities.\n\n3. Puerto Rico's election meltdown\n\nPuerto Rico's primary election descended into chaos after ballots failed to reach precincts over the weekend, preventing many residents from voting, spurring protests and prompting multiple candidates to file lawsuits.\n\nThe debacle has destroyed Puerto Ricans' confidence in the electoral system, one of the last remaining institutions that residents still had faith in on an island racked by economic crises and natural disasters. After a partial suspension, the election is set to resume on Sunday.\n\nElsewhere in the U.S., voters will go to the polls in six states today. Here are some races to watch:\n\nRepresentative Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, a member of the so-called squad of progressive freshmen Democrats, hopes to beat back a well-funded primary challenger.\n\nA primary runoff in Georgia is likely to determine whether a full-throated believer in the \"deep-state\" conspiracy theory known as QAnon will go to Congress.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nA gas explosion destroyed three rowhouses in northwest Baltimore yesterday, killing one woman and injuring at least seven other people.\n\nJoe Biden told allies that he had finished interviewing finalists in his vice-presidential search. His advisers are planning an announcement for the middle of the week.\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency will lift controls limiting the release of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, in the Trump administration's latest effort to weaken Obama-era climate standards.\n\nPresident Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus vowed to crush protests after violent clashes erupted in the wake of his re-election victory, which was widely dismissed as fraudulent.\n\nMcDonald's sued its former chief executive, Steve Easterbrook, accusing him of lying and fraud. Easterbrook was fired in the fall for sexting with a subordinate.\n\nLives Lived: Fay Chew Matsuda, a social worker turned preservationist, directed the Museum of Chinese in America. \"Sometimes it was literally dumpster-diving,\" she said of rescuing artifacts. \"We were trying to recover history that was quickly being lost.\" She died at 71.\n\nIDEA OF THE DAY: College football in flux\n\nWill there be college football this year? University presidents, coaches and conference officials have been struggling to find a solution before the season begins. Even Trump became involved yesterday, tweeting, \"Play College Football!\"\n\nBut it is the players who would bear the most risk, all while playing a sport for which they are not paid. Here's a look at what they have said about this season.\n\nTrevor Lawrence, the star quarterback of Clemson, on Monday called for the season to continue. \"People are at just as much, if not more risk, if we don't play,\" he wrote on Twitter, arguing that, for many players, medical care would probably be more affordable through their teams.\n\n#WeAreUnited, a budding players' rights movement, embraced Lawrence's call to play but added a list of demands, including universal safety procedures, guaranteed medical care and the freedom for players to opt out without losing their spot on the team.\n\nThe University of Connecticut canceled its season last week. In a statement, its players said they had \"many health concerns and not enough is known about the potential long-term effects of contracting Covid-19.\"\n\nPLAY, WATCH, EAT, ARTMake seared scallops\n\nThis recipe for seared scallops and cherry tomatoes makes the best of in-season produce. The tomatoes are cooked in white wine and butter until they turn jammy, and the dish gets a bright flavor from fresh herbs and lemon zest. Serve it straight from the skillet with a salad and some crusty bread.\n\nExplaining 'mansplaining' with art\n\nAn 18th-century painting depicts a man and a woman seated at a park, the man gesticulating at the woman while she stares dead-eyed at the viewer. Above the art reads the caption, \"You would be so much prettier if you smiled.\"\n\nA little over a year ago, the writer Nicole Tersigni began playfully pairing historical art on social media with captions that evoke the casual sexism many women face. The memes struck a chord -- each chapter of her new coffee table book, \"Men to Avoid in Art and Life,\" uses that concept to illustrate the different \"types\" of men that Tersigni and many women encounter on a regular basis.

        "body": "The Mets returned to work on Monday, practicing at Citi Field and preparing for a busy stretch of games after four postponements in a row. A player and a staff member tested positive last week for the coronavirus, but the team said Monday that no other staff members or players had tested positive since then.\n\nGeneral Manager Brodie Van Wagenen said the two people who tested positive had remained in Miami, where the team played the Marlins last week.\n\n\"Both ultimately did become symptomatic, but their symptoms have for the most part resolved, and the peak of their challenges existed more in a 36-hour period of time,\" Van Wagenen said on Monday. \"We're feeling much more comfortable about their safety.\"\n\nThe Mets have not identified the player and the staff member who tested positive. Four others who stayed behind, because they had been in close contact with the infected people, have been cleared to return to New York.\n\nThe positive tests forced a postponement in Miami on Thursday, and that game will be made up as part of a doubleheader at Citi Field on Tuesday. The Mets had been scheduled to host the Yankees for three games last weekend, and those games will be made up as parts of doubleheaders in the Bronx on Friday and Sunday, and as a single game in Flushing on Sept. 3.\n\nVan Wagenen said the team had been unable to trace the source of the positive tests, but he seemed confident that the Mets had contained the spread of the virus. The Miami Marlins (20 positive tests) and the St. Louis Cardinals (18) had wider outbreaks and missed more games.\n\n\"I think what we're all learning is that this virus continues to have a lot more questions for us than answers,\" Van Wagenen said. \"We do feel comfortable that the spread has not come from player to player or coach to coach. At this point, our best guess is that it came from some outside spot, but that is simply that -- it's a guess. We just don't know, and we may never know.\"\n\nHe added: \"I know that our players take it seriously, and we have a high degree of confidence that this exposure that we received is not as a result of anyone misbehaving or failing to be responsible with their own safety.\"\n\nHowever the positive tests came about, the Mets (12-14) must now play 34 games in the season's final 34 days to reach the full 60. Tuesday's twin bill will be the Mets' first under the 2020 rule in which doubleheader games last only seven innings. With nine games to play in the next six days, the Mets are glad to have fewer innings to fill.\n\n\"It seemed to make sense,\" Van Wagenen said. \"Now, as we look at it from a personal standpoint, I think it's a necessity, trying to cover so many games in so few days.\"\n\nThe Mets' rotation has been unsteady, with two former All-Stars who will not pitch this season (Noah Syndergaard, who had Tommy John surgery, and Marcus Stroman, who opted out) and two others, David Peterson and Michael Wacha, out with shoulder injuries. Another starter, Steven Matz, is 0-4 with a 9.00 earned run average and a .313 opponents' average.\n\nReliever Robert Gsellman has joined the rotation, and closer Seth Lugo was scheduled to do so last week. Van Wagenen would not commit to using Matz as a starter but said the Mets would still count on him and others in various roles.\n\n\"We have to be creative at this point,\" he said. \"Call it openers, call it bulk-inning pitchers -- I have a feeling that we're probably going to be going through a number of different scenarios, not only this week with the number of games that we have, but also as we head toward the rest of the regular season, because we have to treat each game as much of a must-win game as possible.\"\n\nVan Wagenen said that while he had started exploring trade possibilities before Monday's deadline, \"we don't have anything on the horizon at this point.\" He added that the types of players the Mets need -- starters like Peterson and Wacha and an outfielder like Jake Marisnick, who has a hamstring strain -- could soon be activated from the injured list.",

        "body": "Antibody trials sponsored by Regeneron and Eli Lilly are off to a slow start because of a dearth of tests, overwhelmed hospitals and reluctant patients.\n\nAs coronavirus cases surge in the United States and treatments are needed more than ever, clinical trials for some of the most promising experimental drugs are taking longer than expected.\n\nResearchers at a dozen clinical trial sites said that testing delays, staffing shortages, space constraints and reluctant patients were complicating their efforts to test monoclonal antibodies, man-made drugs that mimic the molecular soldiers made by the human immune system.\n\nAs a result, once-ambitious deadlines are slipping. The drug maker Regeneron, which previously said it could have emergency doses of its antibody cocktail ready by the end of summer, has shifted to talking about how \"initial data\" could be available by the end of September.\n\nAnd Eli Lilly's chief scientific officer said in June that its antibody treatment might be ready in September, but in an interview this week, he said he now hopes for something before the end of the year.\n\n\"Of course, I wish we could go faster -- there's no question about that,\" said the Eli Lilly executive, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky. \"I guess in my hopes and dreams, we enroll the patients in a week or two, but it's taking longer than that.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Regeneron, Hala Mirza, said that all clinical trials involved an early learning period, and that the company was \"seeing positive momentum in recent days\" as it has sent testing machines to some research sites and has broadened criteria to allow more patients to participate.\n\nWhile much of the world's focus has been on the race to create a coronavirus vaccine, new drugs could also help curb the pandemic by making the disease less deadly. Because drugs are typically tested in sick patients in smaller clinical trials, they can also be developed more quickly than vaccines.\n\nEli Lilly and Regeneron are pursuing two of the most closely watched treatments: lab-engineered antibodies that could either fight off the virus in patients who are already sick or prevent infections in those who have been exposed. Although the Trump administration has heavily favored investment in vaccines, Regeneron has won deals from the federal government worth more than $500 million to ramp up manufacturing of its antibody treatment.\n\nBoth companies rushed to develop their products in record time and began large studies this summer at dozens of hospitals and clinics around the country. They are testing various groups of patients, such as those who are positive but not yet sick enough to be hospitalized, and those who have been exposed to the virus from someone already infected. All of the trials compare the experimental drugs to a placebo, or sham treatment.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-14T15:05:56.404Z If you recover from the virus, you're protected for up to three months, the C.D.C. says. Long-term financial damage may be greater than that of the last recession for states, economists say. U.S. retail sales rose 1.2 percent in July, returning to pre-pandemic levels. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe fast-moving disease has presented opportunities and challenges for the researchers testing antibodies. As the number of infections mounted in states like Florida, Texas and Arizona, there was no shortage of patients who would be eligible for trials. But at the same time, the outbreaks overwhelmed the very hospitals that would be overseeing the studies.\n\nIn remote meetings with doctors at trial sites around the country, Dr. Skovronsky said some had to step out to care for patients who required emergency intervention.\n\n\"That doesn't happen when you're setting up diabetes trials or cancer trials,\" he said. \"We've had investigators say: 'Look, I'd love to do research, but I don't have time to set up a new trial. I've got an I.C.U. full of patients.\"\n\nOne major hurdle has been testing. In both of the outpatient trials run by Eli Lilly and Regeneron, doctors must compete with a ticking clock. According to the rules of the Regeneron trial, a patient must be treated with the antibodies within seven days of the onset of symptoms. Both the Regeneron and Eli Lilly trials require giving the drug within three days of taking a positive test.\n\nBut with turnaround times in some areas lagging for five days or more, keeping within those time frames has proved difficult.\n\nDr. Anita Kohli, the director of research at Arizona Clinical Trials, a Regeneron trial site in Mesa, Ariz., said she got a rush of people wanting to volunteer for the outpatient study earlier this summer, when the outbreak was peaking in her state. \"Our phones were ringing, probably off the hook the first two weeks,\" she said.\n\nBut as labs were inundated with samples, straining supply chains and delaying results, Dr. Kohli said enrolling patients became difficult. \"If people are getting tested at these facilities, but they don't have the results, then how do we enroll them in trials?\" she said.\n\nDr. Kohli said Regeneron sent her a rapid-testing machine to speed up the results, and Eli Lilly did the same for its trial, which she is also running. A spokeswoman for Regeneron said the company had sent out \"a few dozen\" testing machines to clinical trial sites, and was planning to send more in the coming days.\n\nEli Lilly said it was working with state health departments and other local authorities to help speed up testing in certain areas, in addition to supplying some sites with testing machines.\n\nOther researchers said finding the right spot to give the experimental treatment to outpatients was complicated. Patients typically get tested at a drive-through site, and then return home, rarely visiting a hospital or clinic unless their condition gets worse. Bringing them into a medical center for treatment further strains the system, and risks infecting patients and health care workers who don't have Covid-19.\n\nSome sites have resisted bringing a highly infectious person onto their medical campuses, potentially sharing a lobby or elevator with people who do not have the virus. Once there, they must spend a few hours receiving an infusion of the treatment as well as getting blood tests and completing paperwork required for the study.\n\nAt some hospitals, officials have been able to use existing facilities. In Tyler, Texas, the UT Health North Campus medical center is an old tuberculosis hospital, with rooms that use negative air pressure to prevent viruses from spreading.\n\nBut in other locations, like Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., finding the right spot has been a struggle. Dr. Joshua Purow, who is overseeing the Eli Lilly outpatient trial at the hospital, rushed to get his site ready once he saw that infections were rising in the area.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 12, 2020\n\nCan I travel within the United States?Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine for 14 days. Here's an ever-updating list of statewide restrictions. In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own \"pod.\" \"Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,\" the C.D.C. says. If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nBut Holy Cross turned down his first choice, a corner of the emergency department, out of fears that the space would be needed for more severe Covid-19 patients. The idea of installing an outdoor tent was deemed too complicated, and refurbishing a room in a nearby office building would take precious weeks.\n\nWeeks passed before Dr. Purow finally secured a place to run the trial. It was in the emergency department, the first place he had requested.\n\n\"We finally have it all set up to go,\" Dr. Purow said. \"But now, our numbers are declining a little bit. We're not seeing as much as we thought we would.\"\n\nSo far, he said, he has enrolled just one participant, out of a hoped-for 25. Over all, the Eli Lilly outpatient trial is aiming for including 400 patients. The similar Regeneron study has a goal of enrolling about 1,500 patients.\n\nNot every trial site is seeing such hurdles. Dr. Jason Morris, who is overseeing the Eli Lilly study at his physician practice, Imperial Health, in Lake Charles, La., has already exceeded his goals and has enrolled about 45 patients. Dr. Morris said he or another doctor calls each person who tests positive for the virus at the group's urgent care clinic and tells them about the study.\n\nHe said he explains that the study is examining whether Eli Lilly's antibody can stop the virus from invading cells and replicating. \"When I break it down pretty simply like that, people are like, 'Oh, let's do that,'\" he said.\n\nBut some patients are reluctant to participate. Many people associate clinical trials with treatments that are given in life-or-death situations, and don't want to risk taking an experimental drug for an illness they may overcome on their own. Others have the opposite rationale: They don't want to go through the hassle of a trial only to receive a placebo.\n\nDr. Imad Shawa, who is leading the Eli Lilly trial at Franciscan Health Indianapolis, said people must decide whether to enroll in the trial before they get very sick.\n\nWhen test results come back, \"the majority of the time, patients are even slightly feeling better, or they're not getting any sicker,\" he said. \"So the perception is that all this is another mild thing that they can deal with.\"\n\nDoctors who are running studies are prohibited from making a hard sell -- patients must be informed of the risks and benefits of participating, and the very nature of a clinical trial means that no one knows if the treatment will work.\n\n\"We can't sort of paint it as a positive or a negative,\" said Dr. G. Marshall Lyon III, who is leading the Regeneron clinical trials at Emory University in Atlanta. \"We don't know if it's going to be directly beneficial to you; we don't know if it's going to be harmful to you.\"\n\nDr. Lyon, who said enrollment in the trial was going more slowly than he expected, said most people ended up \"taking a wait-and-see attitude.\"",

        "body": "SANTA CRUZ, Calif. -- Another morning without a sunrise. As forests burned in the distance, the leaden sky smelled like a campfire. Air-quality sensors glowed red. And once again, Dave Begley, a lumberjack who has been sleeping in his truck here since fleeing California's wildfires, woke up straining to breathe.\n\n\"I get winded so easy now,\" Mr. Begley, 59, said. \"I wear my mask, but it doesn't work. What can you do about it?\"\n\nMillions of coughing, wheezing, smoked-in people are trying to figure out the same question. Plumes of smoke from record-breaking wildfires are blurring skies across California and the western United States this summer and robbing people of a respite they had embraced to endure the coronavirus -- the simple pleasure of going outdoors.\n\nSporadic power outages and the relentless heat have made life indoors almost equally intolerable.\n\n\"You can't go outside, you can't run your air conditioning and you can't open a window,\" said Megan Cauley, 36, an information-technology manager outside San Francisco.\n\nBecause the outside now makes her 4-year-old and 15-month-old children cough, they have been playing for hours in a bathtub, away from any leaky windows. \"It was the only way to keep them moving and cool enough,\" she said.\n\nSmoke and fires are a natural part of life in the West. But smoky skies have been getting more common over the past decade as the West confronts a deepening drought. Some Californians, especially those with asthma, are starting to wonder how long their lungs can endure a climate marked by longer, fiercer wildfire seasons.\n\n\"I'm panting for air,\" said Evan Underwood, 28, who moved to the Bay Area two years ago. For the past couple weeks, as fires blazed across Northern California, Mr. Underwood has been getting winded unloading the dishwasher or walking across his apartment. A trip to the grocery store leaves him hyperventilating, his chest throbbing in pain.\n\n\"If things don't get under control we're going to have to move,\" he said.\n\nIn Colorado, the Denver Post reported that officials have started telling people to create a purified \"safe room\"as a barrier against smoke and ozone from fires and industrial pollution from sources including oil and gas production. The haze has blotted out saguaro-studded mountains in Arizona and turned Montana's big skies a rusty orange. The fires' tentacles have reached as far as Minnesota.\n\nIn the worst-affected corners of the West, some people now spend the days cloistered inside until their air-quality apps tell them it is safe to take a quick jog or bike ride. Others are sealing their doors and windows and hoarding air purifiers and heavy-duty filters for when they can use their air-conditioners. Pulmonologists and asthma specialists say they are swamped with calls from distressed patients.\n\nSome people are leaving altogether, abandoning their hazy hometowns in California to stay with relatives anywhere else they can breathe without gasping. After days of coughing and misery, Ms. Cauley said that she, her husband and two young children made the 13-hour drive to Seattle to stay with her parents until the skies clear.\n\n\"This is the one thing we can do something about,\" she said. \"We will just deal with whatever shape the house is in when we come back.\"\n\nOthers have fled to the coast or driven toward whichever nearby city seems to have the best air-quality index as the winds push the smoke in different directions. After Jake Orlowitz and his wife drove six hours north to get their 4-month-old son away from the smoke, he found his thoughts tugging toward friends and neighbors who had lost everything back home in the Santa Cruz mountains.\n\nStudies have found that 911 calls and emergency-room visits for cardiac distress and breathing emergencies shoot up in the hours and days after wildfires erupt.\n\nThe blazes burn not just Ponderosa pines, madrones and Douglas firs, but also cars, paint, plastic and insulation, and gales of tiny particles belched out in the fires can travel hundreds of miles and end up down someone's throat, slipping through most face masks like water through a colander. The particles can irritate sinuses, eyes and throats and inflame the lung sacs that bring oxygen to the blood.\n\nThere were an average of 49 smoky days across California last year -- nearly two weeks more than there were in 2011, according to an analysis of federal weather data by scientists at Stanford University's Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy and Asthma Research.\n\nResearchers found the number of smoke-filled days was growing the most in the southern part of California's San Joaquin Valley, where immigrant farmworkers spend long, hot shifts gulping down air laden with dust, chemicals and exhaust from farm equipment. The rise in smoke was slowest in desert areas where there is less to burn.\n\n\"We've seen in California in the last decade fires of a magnitude and intensity that's totally unprecedented,\" said Chris Field, the director of the Woods Institute for the Environment at Stanford. \"With climate change it's going to be an increasing part of life across the West for the rest of the century.\"\n\nAs hundreds of wildfires charred nearly 1.4 million acres of dry, overgrown fuels across California, and more across other states, doctors said they have seen a surge in complaints from patients.\n\n\"It's been a disaster,\" said James D. Wolfe, an allergist and immunologist and a clinical professor at Stanford who treats patients around Silicon Valley and farther down the coast. \"It was one patient after another, every 15 minutes, wheezing, unable to sleep. It's terrible.\"\n\nHe worried that a mother and 15-year-old daughter had exposed themselves to the coronavirus after attending a party that had been relocated indoors to avoid the smoke. A few days after the party, they had fevers, falling oxygen levels and coughs. The daughter told Dr. Wolfe she had never felt so sick in her life.\n\nDr. Wolfe said they had been tested for the coronavirus but did not yet have results.\n\n\"Pollution moved them indoors,\" he said. \"They were trying to do the best they could, and it backfired.\"\n\nIn the Santa Cruz emergency room where Julie Gorshe works as a physician assistant, more and more patients are coming in wheezing, coughing and with shortness of breath -- symptoms of smoke exposure, and also of Covid-19. Some with chronic respiratory problems had fled without their medicine or inhalers. Others who lost power no longer have working oxygen machines.\n\nThe virus has complicated people's plans for relief. People who took an impromptu vacation or stayed with family after other fires now say they are confounded by the risks of air travel or the question of whether they can safely move in with family members until the air at home is safer.\n\nDolly Patterson, 62, who lives in Redwood City, not far from the giant C.Z.U. Lightning Complex fires, said she has been vomiting for eight days straight in response to the heavy smoke. Her throat is so dry that she can sometimes barely speak. She has considered retreating to stay with family in Seattle or San Diego, but for the moment, she is stuck.\n\n\"I cannot get on an airplane and risk Covid,\" she said. \"When I can escape, I will.\"\n\nPublic-health experts suggest that people stay inside, buy expensive air-filtration systems and weatherproof their homes to keep the smoke from seeping in. But not everyone can afford such solutions or a $300 air purifier.\n\nTavo Diaz, a letter carrier in Santa Cruz, said he still had to deliver the mail, and even had to buy his own mask. He said the surgical mask provided by the post office was useless at filtering the fine particles that make him cough and redden his eyes, so he bought his own N-95 He takes his inhaler with him these days, and can taste the smoke long after he gets home at night.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the N-95, I'd be with a sinus infection already,\" he said. \"This is not normal.\"",

        "body": "LEGNAGO, Italy -- Raffaele Leardini, 72, slipped on his pink linen shirt, buttoned it up to the middle of his chest, combed back his hair and set off on Thursday with his wife to Caribe, their favorite outdoor dance hall. When they arrived, they found the club open but the dance floor sealed off with red and white tape.\n\n\"What is this?\" asked Mr. Leardini, a retired mechanic. \"They can't do this.\"\n\nBut they have. In an attempt to limit a resurgence of the coronavirus, Italy has banned dancing in nightclubs and outdoor dance halls.\n\nAs in other countries around the world, new cases in Italy are being driven by young people, with several clusters traced back to nightclubs crowded with maskless patrons. Yet the new rules aimed at stopping young people from gathering en masse have also swept up older Italians for whom an evening at the dance hall is a cherished part of life.\n\nAs lockdown measures were lifted, Caribe reopened in July -- with many new and hard-to-enforce rules. Only married couples or \"stable affections,\" which had to be declared in writing, could dance together. Masks were required on the dance floor, as partners clasped sanitized hands after registering their names and having their temperatures taken.\n\nIf masks were lowered, the DJ would stop the music. But even with the restrictions, the dancing lasted only a little over a month.\n\nThe Italian government's decree on dancing, issued on Aug. 16, made no distinction between packed, sweaty clubs blaring reggaeton and sedate community centers where people swirl in pairs to accordion-driven waltzes.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-24T14:35:13.772Z Work by researchers in Hong Kong finds that reinfection may be possible in rare cases. The F.D.A. approves plasma treatment, as Trump claims the agency is undercutting him. Europe limited mass job losses for a few months, but now a wave is coming. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nMany regulars at Caribe, which caters to an older clientele, said they understood that the government was trying to protect the country -- and people their age in particular -- but were frustrated that the ban included places that had been following the rules. A spokesman for the health minister said that any kind of dancing required a physical proximity that can spread infection.\n\nThe patrons didn't understand why they could no longer hold their partners on the dance floor while bars, beaches, amateur soccer courts and gyms stayed open.\n\n\"It was good to close down nightclubs -- teenagers just don't get it,\" said Mr. Leardini, who was so happy when the club reopened in July that he burst out crying when he heard the news. \"But here you have people with a brain and a mask.\"\n\nMr. Leardini had gone dancing at Caribe three times a week with his wife, Loretta Parini, for more than four decades. When forced to stop during the lockdown, he fell into depression. He said that he had gained weight and that every night he opened his closet and wondered whether he would ever again be able to wear his colorful collection of dancing shirts.\n\n\"What do I have -- eight more years ahead?\" he said, sipping a Corona beer from a wine glass. \"They can't take everything away from me.\"\n\nFor now, he and others had to content themselves sitting on white couches on the edge of the dance floor, tapping their feet as the club's singer, wearing a long, shiny pink dress, walked around the perimeter of the red tape, singing.\n\nGrazia Maria Bellini, 66, was among those listening on a recent night. Since the club reopened, she had resumed her Friday appointments at the hairdresser and bought a long green dress with little roses on the trim. But before she had the chance to show it off, the dance floor was closed again.\n\nSince the age of 11, she had worked at a polishing plant, spray-painting wood. When she retired and after her husband died, she gingerly tried the dance floor.\n\nShe didn't know the steps of the Liscio, Italy's traditional \"smooth dance,\" when she first went to a dance hall near her home in the northern town of Casaleone, but a more expert dancer took her hand -- and told her she was \"light as a feather.\"\n\nFour years later, he sat next to her in front of the taped-off dance floor.\n\n\"It's because these youngsters were all amassed\" that they had to stop dancing, Ms. Bellini said. \"The thing is that we don't have much else.\"\n\nThe Liscio -- which involves a combination of Viennese ballroom dances like the waltz, polka and mazurka -- became Italy's most popular dance craze in the 1970s, especially in the towns and villages along the Italian Riviera of the northern Emilia Romagna region.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome -- which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet -- and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don't show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms. More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nWhile the cheerful songs extolling the virtues of family are largely eschewed by the young, they remain staples for many older Italians, especially in the nation's northern lowlands. And in many communities, Liscio dance nights provide companionship and comfort.\n\nMoreno Conficconi, a Liscio musician from Emilia-Romagna better known as \"Moreno the Blonde,\" said it was a mistake to conflate dance halls and nightclubs.\n\n\"There is no crowd in our music,\" she said. \"There are only intentional hugs.\"\n\nWhen Italy announced the ban on dancing, the government promised to pay millions in subsidies to the owners of nightclubs, but many local community centers that host dance nights do not qualify.\n\n\"They close us down as nightclubs, but then they don't help us like they help nightclubs,\" said Maria Pina Colarusso, a volunteer from the Arci community center in Soliera, a town near Modena.\n\nShe said that since many of the community centers survived only on the piadina flatbreads and soft drinks they sell on the Liscio nights, they would be forced to close. She has already had to cancel the bookings of hundreds of locals who had rushed to get a spot for their masked Liscio nights.\n\n\"They closed our dance floor, but outside it there are way more dangerous things still going on,\" she said.\n\nAt the Caribe, everyone seemed to agree that Benito Garofalo, 80, was the best on the dance floor.\n\nMr. Garofalo lost his wife -- whom he described as \"not the most beautiful, but the best\" -- in December, and said dancing was the only thing that had helped him keep negative thoughts away.\n\n\"Now I don't have dancing, and the bad thoughts are back,\" he said.\n\nIn his perfectly ironed yellow shirt, Mr. Garofalo approached Cristina Danielis, 62, a recently retired obstetrician from nearby Mantua, who sat on a sofa in a flowery dress.\n\n\"Did they bring you drinks?\" he asked. \"I so wish I could ask you for a dance.\"",

        "body": "Usually, players have much more time to gear up to play in the long matches demanded by the Grand Slam tournaments.\n\nIt is an unprecedented situation: a United States Open with no spectators in a strictly controlled environment with competitors and their teams unable to venture beyond the tennis venue and their lodging.\n\nAnd one of the wrinkles of the decision to restart the 2020 season after a five-month break comes for the men's players as they play best-of-five-set matches.\n\nNot only do they have to search for top gear almost immediately by playing in that format in a Grand Slam tournament. They must then cross an ocean and do it again later this month on a different surface at the French Open, the Grand Slam event in Paris that has been moved from its usual dates in May and June because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I was extremely tired yesterday; it's not easy to play over four hours after such a long break,\" said Mikhail Kukushkin, who reached the third round of the U.S. Open with a five-set victory over No. 13 seed Cristian Gar\u00edn on Wednesday.\n\nBecause of that extended break, the longest of most players' careers, Novak Djokovic, the men's No. 1, said in a recent interview with The New York Times that he would have welcomed a \"conversation\" about downshifting to best-of-three-set singles matches for this U.S. Open.\n\nHe felt players had to deal with widely varying situations during the hiatus: some getting much better training conditions than others. Djokovic caught the virus during his much-criticized Adria Tour exhibition series, and though he experienced only mild symptoms, he said the lack of clarity on the long-term medical effects of the virus might be another reason to consider best-of-three.\n\n\"These kind of circumstances are very unusual,\" he said. \"I think a player's health and well-being and form and shape is maybe underestimated a little bit.\"\n\nBut the discussion never got beyond the preliminary phase.\n\n\"Our conversations were 100 percent with the ATP and the athletes, and they did not want to consider best-of-three,\" Stacey Allaster, the U.S. Open tournament director, said on Thursday.\n\nAllaster said the talks were with the ATP leadership, which includes the new chairman, Andrea Gaudenzi, and \"informally with players,\" but not with the ATP Player Council. Djokovic was president of that council until resigning last week when he helped establish a new men's player group.\n\nThough Gaudenzi has cited existing agreements with broadcasters and sponsors as part of the reason for the U.S. Open's being insistent on the current format, Allaster said those broadcasting and sponsorship contracts do not require playing best-of-five sets.\n\nIt is a significant point of difference for the Grand Slam tournaments, which are the only events in tennis to still use it.\n\n\"It doesn't feel like the wrong decision so far to keep it for this tournament,\" said Jim Courier, the former No. 1 and U.S. Davis Cup captain, after the first round of men's matches at the U.S. Open.\n\nYou could argue that a five-month break from tour play could actually help players be fresher, readier and healthier for marathon matches.\n\n\"It is extremely difficult to play best-of-five sets, especially in the hot and humid conditions here,\" Kukushkin said. \"But I believe that during this pandemic, all the players, they take care of their old injuries or took care of their fitness.\"\n\nPreliminary returns are encouraging.\n\nThere were 14 five-set matches in the first round of men's singles this year, and though a few had lopsided fifth sets as one player lost steam, there were three fifth-set tiebreakers as well as Andy Murray's gripping 4-hour-39-minute victory over Yoshihito Nishioka.\n\nSports and the Virus\n\nUpdated Sept. 2, 2020\n\nHere's what's happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to life:\n\nThe most complicated puzzle in sports is the return of college athletics during a pandemic. The University of California, Berkeley is allowing The Times an inside look at their journey's ups and downs.Neymar, soccer's costliest player, is one of three Paris St.-Germain players who played in last week's Champions League final to test positive for the coronavirus.Kristina Mladenovic was so close to a dominant victory. After it fell apart, she said that the restrictions she faced because of another player's positive virus test had taken a toll.\n\nIntriguingly, the number of retirements in the men's first round was the lowest at the U.S. Open since 2012: just two, with Jason Jung retiring in the fifth set against Federico Coria and Jaume Munar retiring in the third against Dominic Thiem.\n\nIn 2019, there were three retirements in the opening round; in 2018, there were nine.\n\nThis year's numbers might indicate that players had fewer physical issues upon arrival: logical considering the U.S. Open usually comes near the end of a long, grueling, jet-lagged season.\n\nAs for recovering from a five-setter, six of the men who won one in the first round were able to win their second-round matches, as well.\n\n\"If you have been fortunate enough to have the normal workout tools at your disposal, there's no reason this should be a heavier lift than normal,\" Courier said, pointing to the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam tournament of the year that starts in mid-January, typically two weeks after the season starts.\n\n\"Players come off an off-season, they go to Australia, they play a warm-up tournament and they go best-of-five in very extreme heat typically,\" Courier said. \"So it's not a different ask than that.\"\n\nBut Australia does come after an off-season of less than two months.\n\n\"It's definitely different; The length of the break this time was almost three times what you would usually get,\" said Dani Vallverdu, Andy Murray's former coach who is now working with Karolina Pliskova.\n\nIn a typical year, Vallverdu said, a player goes into the off-season having played 60 to 70 matches and does not lose much match fitness before the new season begins.\n\nNow, he said, \"guys didn't get more than seven or eight matches since last November,\"\n\n\"The big question mark for me is how players will be able to handle back-to-back five-setters or a few of them,\" he added.\n\nThe consensus is that you cannot replicate match play in practice.\n\n\"You can't train for this stuff, man,\" Frances Tiafoe said wearily on Thursday night after reaching the third round with a five-set victory over John Millman, one of the fittest players on tour. \"It's tough to put yourself in a position where you've got the nerves and anxious energy that you get playing at the highest level.\"\n\nWhat the players have never seen is a season with the French Open after the U.S. Open. There will be a narrow 13-day gap between the two, which is similar to the two-week gap that used to exist between the French Open and Wimbledon until Wimbledon moved back a week in 2015.\n\nThe French Open-Wimbledon double called for players to shift from clay to grass but only to cross the English Channel (La Manche if you are French). The U.S. Open-French Open double now will require a trans-Atlantic flight and a shift from acrylic hardcourts to clay.\n\n\"Going to grass meant much less rallies, so this time it's a different way around,\" said Jan-Lennard Struff, the German who will face Djokovic in the third round of the U.S. Open. \"Surface changes are always a big deal. You don't have to overthink it, but it will be difficult for everyone, playing on clay is a different game style.\"\n\nCourier thinks it is easier, in general, for players to switch from hardcourt to clay than clay to grass. \"There may be some fast-court players who don't agree,\" he said. \"But I think by and large it's easier to go from a faster court to a slower one where you have more time.\"\n\nThe players are accustomed to the hardcourt to clay shift, which usually happens in February and again in April. But they have never played two Grand Slam events in such a narrow window after a long break. Avoiding marathon matches in New York seems important if you want to thrive in Paris, too.\n\n\"It's going to be very interesting for the players who go deep at the U.S. Open,\" said Paul Annacone, Roger Federer's former coach who now works with Taylor Fritz, the rising American who is into the third round. \"How quickly can they turn around and get physically and mentally recharged and regroup?\"\n\nThe French Open challenge looks all the more daunting with the 12-time champion Rafael Nadal passing on the chance to defend his U.S. Open title to stay in Europe and prepare on his beloved red clay.\n\n\"I think it helps Rafa a ton,\" Annacone said. \"I always think he's a favorite but more so now. He has all this free time to prepare exactly as he wants. So for me, if someone were able to win both of them this year, the U.S. Open and French Open, it's arguably the toughest double.\"\n\nHow tough?\n\n\"In our current environment with the times we're living in, it would be one of the great doubles in tennis history,\" Annacone said.",

The latest unexpected feature of the coronavirus infection fascinated the public, and suddenly photographs of so-called Covid toes were everywhere on social media.\n\nBut almost all of the images depicted glossy pink lesions on white skin. Though people of color have been affected disproportionately by the pandemic, pictures of Covid toes on dark skin were curiously hard to find.\n\nThe problem isn't unique to Covid toes or to social media. Dermatology, the medical specialty devoted to treating diseases of the skin, has a problem with brown and black skin. Though progress has been made in recent years, most textbooks that serve as road maps for diagnosing skin disorders often don't include images of skin conditions as they appear on people of color.\n\nThat's a glaring omission that can lead to misdiagnoses and unnecessary suffering, because many key characteristics of skin disorders -- like red patches and purple blotches -- may appear differently on people with different complexions, experts say.\n\n\"Pattern recognition is central to dermatology, and a lot of the pattern recognition is training your eye to recognize certain colors that trigger you to think of certain diseases,\" said Dr. Jenna Lester, director of the skin of color program at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\n\"But the color in question is impacted by the surrounding color,\" she said. \"It can look different in darker skin. If you're only trained to look at something in one color, you won't recognize it in another color.\"\n\nDr. Lester recently reviewed 130 images of coronavirus skin disorders published in medical journals and found they were overwhelmingly of white people.\n\nAs the coronavirus spread, dermatologists started an international registry to catalog examples of skin manifestations of Covid-19. The registry compiled more than 700 images, but only 34 of disorders in Hispanic patients and 13 in Black patients were submitted.\n\nIt wasn't until July that Dr. Roxana Daneshjou and her colleagues at Stanford University published some of the first pictures of Covid toes in nonwhite patients in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\n\"We know for certain that if dark skin images are not well represented, skin doctors -- but also other doctors who are not skin experts -- are at a disadvantage for making a proper diagnosis,\" said Dr. Hao Feng, an assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Connecticut.\n\nDr. Feng reported recently that the omissions are still pervasive in textbooks, where only 10 percent of images illustrate dermatologic diseases in dark skin. When pictures of Black patients were available, they most often described syphilis. He found that one digital resource, VisualDx, had a more diverse display of images: 28.5 percent represented dark skin.\n\n\"If you have no experience with this in people of color, it's like saying you don't know how to examine the lungs or the heart,\" said Dr. Art Papier, a dermatologist who co-founded VisualDX.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-30T07:20:17.684Z California, as its infection rate declines, becomes the first state to top 700,000 known cases. European leaders weigh new lockdowns as alarming caseloads return. Universities are struggling to rein in their Greek systems, as fraternities and sororities foster outbreaks. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nAll doctors observe the skin for clues to disease. Changes in the skin can be the first indication of life-threatening conditions like sepsis, cellulitis or severe drug reactions to medications.\n\nImages of skin cancer in dark skin were underrepresented in educational materials examined in Dr. Feng's study -- yet skin cancer, though less common in people with darker skin, is more deadly in Black and Hispanic patients, and often diagnosed at a later stage.\n\nThe five-year survival rate is 66 percent for non-Hispanic Black patients, compared with 90 percent for non-Hispanic white patients.\n\nBlack patients are generally less likely than whites to see a dermatologist and less likely to undergo screening for skin cancer. Even when they do see a dermatologist, studies have shown, Black patients are less likely to get certain treatments than white people with the same conditions, like oral antibiotics for acne.\n\n\"I can tell you from my own clinical experience a lot of things get missed because people don't recognize the disease process in darker skin,\" Dr. Feng said.\n\nEven relatively common skin conditions can stump physicians if they have never seen them in people of color.\n\nWhen Dr. Lester was in medical school, she recalled, a Black patient came to the clinic with a mysterious rash that had a purplish hue. \"No one knew what it was,\" Dr. Lester said.\n\nA biopsy revealed it was a common skin condition that doctors usually diagnose on sight, without tests or procedures: psoriasis. Yet it often goes unidentified and untreated in people of color.\n\nThe medical literature describes psoriasis as \"salmon pink patches with silvery white scales, but that's not what it looks like in dark skin,\" Dr. Lester said. \"It has more of a purple hue, and a lot of my Black patients put tons of moisturizer on when the skin is dry, so the scales aren't as visible.\"\n\nMany garden-variety rashes will vary in appearance in different complexions. Eczema, which is typically described as making skin red and itchy, tends to be more bumpy in Black people, Dr. Lester said. Pityriasis rosea is usually described as having a distinctive pattern composed of a large spot with smaller spots branching out from it -- but it may not appear this way in people with dark skin.\n\nMelanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, often develops in Black people in spots where doctors may not think to look for it: on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.\n\nDoctors often miss rosacea in Black patients, too, because clinicians expect to see redness and visible blood vessels on the face, said Dr. Amy McMichael, chair of the dermatology department at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, N.C.\n\n\"You don't see as much red if the background skin color is brown,\" she said.\n\nPallor, which can be an indication of anemia as well as reduced blood flow and oxygen, will also have a different appearance in Black patients, said Dr. Lynn McKinley-Grant, an associate professor at Howard University College of Medicine and president of the Skin of Color Society, which promotes awareness and education about these variations.\n\n\"It's a different color, kind of a grayish color,\" she said. \"I have actually thought of George Floyd. When he's on the ground, his skin is a gray brown, showing lack of oxygen.\"\n\nKawasaki disease, a children's disease that bears similarities to a Covid-19 complication called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, causes inflammation in blood vessels and presents with redness, but \"how it appears in darker skin tone is very different,\" said Dr. Susan Taylor, associate professor of dermatology at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine.\n\n\"You don't want to miss that in a kid because you don't know how to look for the rash and your eye isn't trained to see it,\" she said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nDr. Taylor is a co-author of \"Dermatology for Skin of Color,\" one of the first textbooks that focused on the treatment of skin conditions in moderately to heavily pigmented skin. But new textbooks are not the solution, she said.\n\n\"We shouldn't have to write separate textbooks -- that information should be integrated into the quote-unquote standard textbooks,\" Dr. Taylor said.\n\nNearly half of dermatologists and dermatology residents say they were not adequately trained to treat skin conditions in people of color. For Black patients, that often translates into a prolonged, disheartening search for the right diagnosis.\n\nWhen Tierra Styles, 31, of Auburn, Ga., asked her pediatrician about a rough patch of skin on the back of her toddler's neck, the doctor said it was nothing. On later visits, it was diagnosed as scabies, then eczema. But the prescribed ointments had no effect.\n\nFinally, Ms. Styles took her son to a dermatologist who was Black. She said the sandpaper-like patch was a benign skin condition called keratosis pilaris.\n\n\"The doctor tried to pull up a picture on the internet, but she couldn't find one,\" Ms. Styles said. \"There was not one picture of an African-American person that she could show me.\"\n\nEllen Buchanan Weiss, a white mother of a multiracial child in Raleigh, N.C., was so frustrated by her fruitless online searches for information on her child's skin rashes that she started her own repository of skin images in an Instagram feed called Brown Skin Matters.\n\nAnyone can submit a photo; a physician reviews the images before they are posted.\n\n\"It started as a casual reference for other mothers,\" Ms. Weiss said. \"What's been surprising to me is that it's been used mostly by clinicians -- doctors, nurses, professionals teaching in medical schools.\"\n\nMany Black patients prefer to see Black dermatologists, who may be more familiar with and have a greater understanding of not only skin issues -- like acne, which can leave dark, hyperpigmented spots on dark skin -- but hair predicaments, said Dr. Natalie Moulton-Levy, a dermatologist in Manhattan.\n\n\"We as Black people don't do hair the same way a non-Black person does,\" Dr. Moulton-Levy said. \"When you're giving treatment options, some dermatologists are not familiar with that and say, 'OK, you have to wash your hair every day.' We don't wash our hair every day.\"\n\nBut getting in to see a dermatologist can be difficult, and waits are notoriously long. There is a shortage of dermatologists generally, and a shortage of dermatologists of color in particular: Only 4 percent of practicing dermatologists identify as Hispanic, and only 3 percent identify as Black or African-American, according to one study.\n\nBlack and Hispanic patients are far more likely than white patients to use the emergency room for dermatology problems, especially in rural areas and smaller cities where there are fewer dermatologists, studies have shown. People of color are half as likely as white patients to see a dermatologist for the same conditions.\n\nHealth insurance can also be a barrier to care. A 2014 study by the physician staffing firm Merritt Hawkins reported that dermatology was among the specialties least likely to accept Medicaid, with only 27 percent of dermatologists accepting payment from the government health plan compared with 63 percent of cardiologists.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nAt some safety-net hospitals, waits as long as a year to see a dermatologist have been recorded. Delayed doctors' appointments, especially for pediatric dermatologists, can have serious consequences.\n\nA Connecticut woman said that when her biracial daughter first developed patches of blanched, hypopigmented skin at age 10, it was misdiagnosed as a benign condition called pityriasis alba.\n\nThe woman, who asked not to be identified, to protect her daughter's privacy, tried to get her child an appointment with a dermatologist, but few in the area took Medicaid and those who did had an eight-month wait.\n\nWhen the mother switched jobs and obtained commercial health insurance, she made an appointment with a specialist at Yale University, who diagnosed her daughter with a rare cancer, primary cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, also called mycosis fungoides.\n\nThe treatment, which consists of ultraviolet light therapy, has been successful, and the blanched spots are no longer visible on her daughter's \"medium brown skin,\" the mother said. But it took two years to get the diagnosis. When she searched online, she said, \"I couldn't find anything that looked like my daughter, and it was mostly images of white skin.\"\n\nPhysicians often say that they \"do not see color,\" Dr. Moulton-Levy said. \"They are trying in a nice, benevolent way to say skin color doesn't matter.\"\n\n\"But it absolutely matters, in dermatology and all of health care,\" she said. \"'Colorblind' is a very difficult term for me to hear.\"",

        "body": "Making performances more accessible to audiences is part of the mission. Presenting shows that reflect the moment is another.\n\nAs a clear day faded into evening, the pianist and singer Michael Garin and his wife, the classically trained soprano Mardie Millit, were entertaining a crowd of diners, mixing show tunes with jazz, country, world music and mash-ups that wed Georges Bizet to Jerry Lee Lewis and Frank Zappa to Gian Carlo Menotti. It was late August, outside the West Bank Caf\u00e9 on 42nd Street and Ninth Avenue in Manhattan, where 30 years ago the owner Steve Olsen began presenting plays and cabaret acts downstairs in the Laurie Beechman Theater.\n\nLike all New York venues, the performance space was shuttered in March as the Covid-19 pandemic escalated. Once the summer stretched on, \"One of my technical directors discussed moving the piano upstairs and putting it inside the window,\" Olsen said on the phone, before the show. \"We have tables and chairs seating 16, so I call it the world's smallest cabaret room.\" (A new area accommodates 24 additional people.)\n\nLike many performers working in cabaret, the couple had initially turned to social media after the pandemic struck, with Garin livestreaming on Instagram for the Roxy Bar -- where he now plays outdoors -- then Facebook. \"We started with my phone duct taped to a music stand so it wouldn't fall off,\" Millit said. \"I'd read people's requests and hand them to him on a steno pad.\"\n\nWith fall looming, cabaret artists and venues are embracing technology with the same D.I.Y. spirit -- and, increasingly, more sophisticated production values -- determined not to let another season slip away. Outdoor performances are not logistically feasible for most, even with the cooperation of late-summer weather, so a number of establishments are offering virtual alternatives, and beginning to find ways to monetize them.\n\nAt Birdland, the booker and producer Ryan Paternite and the host, performer and producer Jim Caruso teamed with the site BroadwayWorld to create Radio Free Birdland, a pay-per-view series in which performances are filmed in advance, with a skeleton crew and no live audience. Caruso, who has moved his weekly open-mic online as \"Pajama Cast Party!,\" echoed what many cabaret professionals said: that quarantine hastened some necessary modernization. \"The club had purchased three cameras, as we'd been thinking of doing something like this; the pandemic just made it more of a necessity,\" he said.\n\nThe setup now is roomy, and cautious. \"We have a huge dressing room and a big green room, and we're inviting people to come with their piano players,\" Caruso said. \"Sometimes there are a few more people onstage, but everyone is masked till they walk on, and everything is sanitized.\" Participating artists include jazz, cabaret and theater regulars like Billy Stritch -- the resident pianist for the in-person \"Cast Party\" -- as well as Natalie Douglas, Julie Halston and Telly Leung.\n\nAlan Cumming is taking a similar approach, in a cozier setting, for \"The Club Cumming Virtual Variety Show,\" which has streamed two episodes from the East Village spot he co-owns. \"We have no more than about five people in the bar at once, wearing masks until their performances,\" said Cumming, who plans to present the show every few weeks, and has also been in discussions with artists about full-length programs. Viewers can connect on the video chat platform Looped for $20, or $50 for a ticket that provides them with a one-on-one video chat, \"so they can interact with other people and then with talent in a meet-and-greet afterward. Keeping that spirit alive is important.\"\n\nThe Public Theater's \"Joe's Pub Live!,\" which had been showcasing mostly archival performances for free since March, started livestreaming exclusively from artists' homes and studios in late August. The Duplex is livestreaming from both its cabaret space and performers' homes. Feinstein's/54 Below, a popular room for leading cabaret and Broadway performers, has rescheduled dates initially set through early October, with future plans subject to state and local reopening guidelines, and is \"exploring all our programming options, including livestreaming of shows,\" according to its one of its owners, Richard Frankel.\n\nMany cabaret owners and artists say they'd like to continue streaming shows, even after their more intimate rooms reopen to live audiences. \"I think it's going to become an important source of revenue for artists and venues,\" said Stephen Shanaghan, the co-owner and entertainment director of the East Village supper club Pangea, another haven for alt-cabaret artists, who is considering selling tickets for planned virtual programming \"on a tiered system, with a low-end price to encourage people to donate to the artists and venue directly.\"\n\nThere are other practical advantages to be considered, such as reaching fans outside New York and a younger audience in general. Ruby Locknar, the 21-year-old technical producer for \"Pajama Cast Party!,\" estimated that \"in the first week, our primary demographic was 40 to 60 years old. Now about 40 percent of our viewers are between 14 and 21.\"\n\nThis year, the Mabel Mercer Foundation's annual New York Cabaret Convention -- set to stream Oct. 20-21, from homes and venues in various cities, with a concert scheduled for Oct. 22 as part of the Radio Free Birdland series -- will showcase finalists in the convention's third, and first virtual, Teen Competition.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider.

Presenting shows that reflect the moment -- as protests for racial justice continue and the country reels from the impact of Covid on everyday life and the economy -- is another.\n\nThe singer and actress Natalie Douglas welcomes increased attention to race, but said, \"We'll have to see going forward how much of it is performative. There are plenty of times where I get an email or release inviting me to an event where there are many performers but not a single person of color, or maybe one.\"\n\nCabaret storytelling is often personal, and expanding its viewpoint only makes the art richer, explained Telly Leung, the son of Chinese immigrants. \"I always find cabaret is best when people can share their own unique stories, and race is a part of that,\" he said. \"When you have people paying top dollar to see big names in high-end cabaret, you have to ask yourself why there aren't more BIPOC among those big names.\" (Douglas and Leung are both featured in the Birdland series.)\n\nRepresenting a range of voices is crucial at Don't Tell Mama, which has maintained an outdoor piano bar with a singing bartender since Phase 1 of reopening -- and added a singing wait staff during Phase 2. \"It's our mission to be able to house emerging Latinx musical theater voices,\" said its general manager Joshua Fazeli, citing the drag queen Lagoona Bloo and the nonbinary singer Castrata as examples. \"Their message is urgent: We are not just here, we are queer and Brown, and we bring substantial value to the cabaret canon.\"\n\nAt Pangea, the veteran performance artist Penny Arcade started developing \"Invitation to the End of the World PT 2: Notes From the Underground\" in February, and now considers its title prescient. \"The situation under Covid is what we've been fearful of since the '60s,\" she said. \"We knew if there wasn't a roping in of corporate greed, of governmental disinterest, we'd have this kind of epic crisis.\"\n\nPangea's \"The Ghost Light Series,\" aiming to livestream this fall, will also feature the satirical singer Tammy Faye Starlite channeling the Trump spiritual adviser Paula White-Cain, and the queer song cycle \"Different Stars: A Reckoning with Time, Trauma and Consequence,\" for which the performer and composer Karl Saint Lucy crafted a narrative frame casting the Black artist James Jackson Jr. as a character who spends his time in quarantine watching Netflix and reflecting on a breakup.\n\nFor Douglas, \"One benefit of all this is that we're finding new ways to be creative, to get our ya-yas out.\" While, like others, she greatly misses the presence of a live audience, she was inspired shortly before her Birdland session, when she watched the British drag artist La Voix perform an exhilarating concert online. \"My husband said to me, 'Do what La Voix did.' The audience is there -- they're just on the other side of the camera.\"",

But locals ask: Why didn't you reach out before?\n\nWhen the Giraffe Manor, a popular hotel in Nairobi known for its roaming giraffes, posted a photo on its Instagram account in June with a caption saying that it would be \"opening for Kenyans\" and Kenyans could pay a special reduced rate to stay at the hotel, it received backlash from the very people it hoped to entice.\n\nFor many Kenyans, the offer was seen as insulting and only extended because foreign visitors, the lifeblood of the safari industry, were largely absent because of restrictions on international travel. Offering local rates seemed like a desperate ploy from a hotel where locals say they previously never felt welcome.\n\n\"My eyes just rolled when I saw that,\" Harriet Akinyi, a Nairobi-based travel writer, said in a phone interview. \"It's hypocritical that it took a pandemic for them to realize that they have to cater to the Kenyan market as well, not just the international market.\"\n\nThe Safari Collection, which owns the Giraffe Manor, said that the post was published by an independent agent and the wording was misconstrued. The hotel, the company said, has always been open to all guests, but this was the first time it ran a special, because it was the first time it had the empty rooms to do so.\n\n\"The situation with Covid-19 has resulted in an opportunity to welcome local guests who wouldn't normally book in advance -- we are usually booked up months in advance,\" said Jessica Pattison, head of sales and marketing for the Safari Collection, in an email, adding that the company employs more than 240 people and 95 percent of them are Black. The company would not reveal its local rates, but for international visitors, rooms range from $875 per night per person to $3,000 for a suite sleeping up to four per night, depending on the season and type of room.\n\nStill, the incident renewed conversations among Kenyans and other Africans who live in countries that are home to safari companies, tour operators and luxury lodgings that focus on attracting American and European visitors. Who, they ask, is really welcome to take part in these offerings? People in South Africa, Kenya, Tanzania and Botswana said that the local rates have allowed them to enjoy their own countries in recent months, but as borders start to reopen, they remain skeptical about whether they'll still be invited. Ms. Akinyi shared an email from Arijiju, a private-home retreat in Laikipia, where she was told that the residence had 'a strict target list of top-tier international media,' so she could not visit.\n\nBorder closures, national lockdowns and other measures put in place to stop the spread of the coronavirus have devastated Africa's $39 billion tourism industry. The tourism industry funds wildlife conservation across the continent and the lack of international tourists has led experts to fear that threatened animals would be poached at higher rates, further endangering them.\n\nSafari travel as marketed internationally is largely a luxury product, with beautifully appointed tent camps or lodges appealing to wealthy travelers. At the high end it can cost thousands of dollars a night, with guests flown between remote camps on private planes; even at the more modest end of the spectrum the cost tends to run to hundreds of dollars a night per person. That puts them far beyond the means of many Africans: In South Africa, for example, where Kruger National Park is a major draw for safari vacationers, the average earnings for Black residents between 2011 and 2015 were 6,899 rand ($413) per month, according to a 2019 report by the country's Department of Statistics. The same report showed that for white South Africans, who tend to go on more safari vacations, average earnings were 24,646 rand ($1,400) per month -- more than three times what Black South Africans make.\n\nSome think it is time to reshape the industry.\n\n\"We can't expect that Covid is the last issue that may cause a pause in travel, and companies have now seen that solely relying on international travelers is not sustainable,\" said Naledi Khabo, chief executive of Africa Tourism Association, a U.S.-based agency that promotes tourism to and within Africa. \"Having a consistent base of local travelers will be key to any safari business who wants to survive.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T08:29:45.489Z The C.D.C. cites health reasons for stopping evictions. Your smartphone may soon let you know you've been exposed. An N.I.H. panel says there is a lack of data to support the efficacy of using plasma to treat coronavirus patients. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nIn Tanzania, another country with a fast-growing middle class that is a popular destination for safaris and luxury stays, local rates have become the norm. Lodges and safaris are being marketed at half price in some cases and at even less than that at others.\n\nAndrew Mahiga, a project manager for a development project in Dar es Salaam, said that when he returned to Tanzania a decade ago, after living in the United States and Britain, he was committed to traveling the country and becoming reacquainted with his home. But he and his fianc\u00e9e have noticed that at some hotels and resorts, the services offered to locals can differ vastly from those offered to international tourists. That hasn't changed since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\"Even though places are becoming more accessible to us right now, the experiences are still not equal to those offered to foreigners,\" he said. \"When I stay someplace, they aren't as invested in me as a guest. They don't give suggestions for places nearby to see or excursions to go on and things to try, but foreigners -- that's all provided at length.\"\n\nMr. Mahiga, 35, said that recently he and his fianc\u00e9e have been focusing on staying at Airbnbs that are owned by Tanzanians and going on tours that are run by locals.\n\nAlthough many safari and lodging companies have Black African guides and staff, the African Travel and Tourism Association estimates that 15 percent of its 600-plus members are Black owners, something that locals say plays a part in the feeling that they are not welcome.\n\n\"These luxury resorts and companies that focus on foreigners are finally being friendly to local Tanzanians and that's good,\" Mr. Mahiga said. \"But since Covid started I've found myself wondering, 'Why don't I support really local business, especially when the foreign ones never wanted my money before?'\"\n\nFor their part, companies say that locals tend to plan their trips later than foreign visitors, so that usually when they inquire, they are already booked.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nFor Beks Ndlovu, the founder of African Bush Camps, an independently owned safari company, promoting local rates has always been a key part of operating a business in any country. Mr. Ndlovu's company has 15 luxury tented camps and lodges in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Zambia, and has, for years, offered advantageous local rates to residents of countries that are part of the Southern African Development Community, a regional economic community. For foreign guests, depending on the season, a stay can run between $400 and $950 per person per night, but for locals and people from the region it is $250 to $380 per person per night.\n\n\"This is not something that's new to us,\" he said. \"We've actively promoted our offerings and the rate we offer is very favorable to locals because we understand the earnings in this part of the world are different from that of the international traveler.\"\n\nMr. Ndlovu, who is Zimbabwean, said that offering local rates isn't enough; he believes that his company has been successful among locals in the countries where it has camps because locals are treated as well as Europeans and Americans are -- something that goes a long way, he said.\n\nSome people, like Lelo Boyana, who works in finance in Johannesburg and hosts the travel podcast Chica Travel, worry that the push for local guests won't last past the pandemic. Ms. Boyana said that although she has taken advantage of local rates throughout South Africa this year, she remains skeptical of how much of the money spent by travelers goes to locals, another common criticism of safari companies. Travelers, she said, need to ask more questions about where their money is going and companies need to do more than discount stays.\n\n\"I think what's obvious is that these companies are desperate for business,\" she said. \"If they wanted to have us, they would have made these rates available to us long ago and they would have publicized them before the pandemic. We are their last resort and their attempts are halfhearted. They still have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nMs. Khabo of the African Tourism Association said she thought this might be a turning point. As leisure travel within Africa becomes more popular, with new flight routes and the easing of visa policies, it would be bad business for companies to ignore African buying power. She expects the shift to a focus on domestic travel to continue after the pandemic.\n\n\"There is now a new opportunity to engage the local market and cultivate local ambassadors, so we will see which companies keep it going,\" she said.\n\nIn many cases, the decision to cater to local residents more aggressively is keeping camps busy. Asilia Africa, a company that operates 20 camps in East Africa, has always had local rates, but this year marks the first time the company has actively marketed them to residents. In previous years, people found out about the discounts by word of mouth and the occasional mention in the local press, Mercedes Bailey, a press manager at Asilia said.\n\nStaying open and keeping rangers in the bush discouraged poaching, Ms. Bailey added. Resident sales in June were about 60 percent higher than during the same period last year. Those sales have also never been higher than 20 percent, but the company expects them to surpass 50 percent this year.\n\n\"We have a social media campaign, targeting Africans,\" Ms. Bailey said in a phone interview. \"That's something we haven't done before, but people are coming and we are now asking ourselves: Are people coming now because they can't go anywhere else or have they always wanted to come, but didn't feel welcome?\"\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

        "body": "Universities have had mixed messages, competing agendas and a lack of transparency as they consider whether to hold college football in the fall, with billions of dollars at stake.\n\nAs Justin Fields, the star quarterback at Ohio State, was gathering more than 300,000 electronic signatures to beseech Big Ten university presidents to reverse their decision to postpone football this fall, he was applauded by his coach, Ryan Day, who in turn was being hailed by his athletic director, Gene Smith.\n\nNobody, though, was cheering on Dr. Curt Daniels.\n\nDaniels, the director of sports cardiology at Ohio State, had also been busy, working to publish a three-month study whose preliminary findings were presented to Pac-12 and Big Ten leaders before they shut down football earlier this month. Daniels said that cardiac M.R.I.s, an expensive and sparingly used tool, revealed an alarmingly high rate of myocarditis -- heart inflammation that can lead to cardiac arrest with exertion -- among college athletes who had recovered from the coronavirus.\n\nThe survey found myocarditis in close to 15 percent of athletes who had the virus, almost all of whom experienced mild or no symptoms, Daniels added, perhaps shedding more light on the uncertainties about the short- and long-term effects the virus may have on athletes.\n\nBut as Daniels's survey awaits the rigors of peer review, it has received scant attention, in part because Ohio State has refused to make public any testing data about its athletes -- who make up the bulk of the study -- other than to announce last month that it had shut down workouts because of positive virus tests. Thus, Daniels said he could not disclose any more information about the data, including the number of athletes tested and those found with myocarditis, until it is published. (The school has said it is following privacy laws, but those prohibit only the disclosure of personally identifiable information.)\n\nWhat is taking place at Ohio State -- mixed messages, competing agendas and a lack of transparency -- is playing out on a broader scale across the country as college football's powerhouse conferences decide whether to go forth with a fall season, with a shutdown risking billions in television and ticket revenue. Those who have pushed toward playing have done so with little or no public health justification, and despite widespread pronouncements earlier this year that if students could not sit in classrooms, they could not play sports.\n\nLast week, North Carolina, North Carolina State and Notre Dame, who will play in the Atlantic Coast Conference this season, backed off in-person instruction because of virus outbreaks, but encouraged their football teams to stay on campus. While some Southeastern Conference players used social media to criticize students for not wearing masks in classrooms, bars or fraternity houses, its schools were busy announcing plans to have upward of 25,000 fans at games -- even at Alabama, where a vice president told students Friday the school was on pace to run out of isolation beds by the end of the month. And a cardiologist at the Mayo Clinic, who advised the Big 12 and Conference U.S.A. to soldier on with football, said in a podcast that any conference that doesn't play because of myocarditis concerns is relying on \"wimpy, wobbly, weak\" evidence.\n\nNowhere, though, has there been more conflict than the Big Ten, where it took Commissioner Kevin Warren eight days -- and the prospect of angry parents demonstrating outside the conference offices -- to issue a letter that summarized the medical criteria upon which the presidents based their decision not to play.\n\nWarren has also had to beat back complaints from his own schools.\n\nFour of them expressed displeasure with the postponement, none as forcefully as Nebraska, which issued a statement not just from its football coach, Scott Frost, and its athletic director, Bill Moos, but also from Chancellor Ronnie Green and university system President Ted Carter. They said they would continue to consult the medical experts who assured them athletes were safest on campuses.\n\nAs for the team of medical experts the Big Ten leaned on for its decision? It is led by Dr. Chris Kratochvil, an infectious disease expert at ... Nebraska.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob Bowlsby, the Big 12 commissioner, said he did not feel compelled to release the medical underpinnings for his conference's decision to continue playing, even though new infection rates remained high in the counties of half its universities. \"Well, if we got to the point where we were going to not play it probably requires more of an explanation,\" he told reporters on a conference call. \"The decision to continue to move forward and stay the course, I think, is a different one.\"\n\nStanding out as an exception to the obfuscation has been the Pac-12, whose medical advisory committee of two dozen team doctors, infectious disease specialists, cardiologists and public health experts detailed in a 12-page document why it was not safe to play contact sports until at least next year. It said that infection rates in the conference footprint remain high, there are too many uncertainties about myocarditis and other effects of the virus, and testing has been inadequate. The document also laid out metrics to measure when sports could return.\n\nThe Pac-12 document was the latest iteration of a text that has been amended over the course of several months based on federal health directives, N.C.A.A. recommendations, community infection rates and other information. Gregory Stewart, the team doctor at Tulane, said that all conferences have put together similar documents and their medical advisory groups share them with one another. Anytime there are new directives from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the N.C.A.A., which has its own medical advisory group, or new approaches by other conferences, \"we compare it to ours and make sure we're good,\" said Stewart, who leads the American Athletic Conference medical advisory group.\n\nStill, few have been shared publicly, especially with any detail.\n\nThe A.C.C. published a seven-page report on July 29 focusing on protocols for playing, but there is no mention of virus side effects, and only one sentence -- lifted from the N.C.A.A. guidelines -- on local infection rates. It suggests that games could be canceled if campus or community transmission rates were considered \"unsafe\" by local public health officials, but the conference is still planning to play despite campus shutdowns at three of its schools.\n\nDr. Cameron Wolfe, an infectious disease specialist at Duke and chair of the A.C.C. medical advisory group, declined an interview request through a school spokeswoman.\n\nThe SEC announced Friday -- one day after Georgia State freshman quarterback Mikele Colasurdo announced he would miss the season because of a coronavirus-related heart problem -- that specific cardiac screening tests would be required for infected athletes, though it did not include a cardiac M.R.I. It also said it would require additional testing closer to games.\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakSports and the Virus\n\nUpdated Aug. 21, 2020\n\nHere's what's happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to life:\n\nThe Western & Southern Open tennis tournament -- long held near Cincinnati -- has been moved to Queens this year, making for an unusual doubleheader with the United States Open.The Mets had two games postponed after a player and a staff member tested positive for coronavirus.While live sports are back, spectators are not in most cases. Readers comment on what they were missing as fans in the stands.\n\nDr. John Swartzberg, an infectious disease and vaccinology professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley, who advised the Pac-12, has watched these worlds of medicine and college sports collide, with public health rationale being cloaked as carefully as a coach might conceal which quarterback had won a starter's role. He was asked if in the current environment -- where masks have become a political statement -- presidents and the medical teams advising them were seeing what their constituents want them to see in the data.\n\n\"It's seductive to go down that road, it clearly is,\" said Swartzberg, who observed that in such a polarized society, of which sports has increasingly become a microcosm, it would be easy to draw that conclusion -- even if he would not. \"I want to make it clear: There's no way I'd criticize a professor trained like I am who comes to different conclusion,\" Swartzberg added. \"But we all bring our own biases to our conclusions.\"\n\nHe laughed.\n\n\"I'm trying to be as generous as possible,\" Swartzberg said.\n\nHe sees echoes of what has played out on a bigger stage, the dance that the White House pandemic adviser Dr. Anthony S. Fauci performs around President Trump's desire to hear suggestions that benefit him politically. \"It's impossible not to. That's the way our thinking has been guided over the last four years,\" Swartzberg said. \"It's not possible to separate culture from sports.\"\n\nThat schism may help explain why Dr. Michael Ackerman, a cardiovascular genomics research professor at the Mayo Clinic, ended up on a Zoom call earlier this month with Big 12 presidents, athletic directors and their medical advisory group, and then a day later on a similar call for Conference U.S.A.\n\nAckerman believes myocarditis is being portrayed as \"the boogeyman,\" and he has criticized experts giving weight to a German study that showed that 60 of 100 patients who had recovered from the coronavirus had signs of myocarditis, saying the patients were middle-aged and not in the peak physical condition of college athletes. He also decried Colleen Kraft, an infectious disease doctor at Emory University who is an adviser to the N.C.A.A., characterizing her as an alarmist for saying that disregarding concerns about myocarditis was \"playing with fire.\"\n\n\"Is this a blaze that's out of control that's wreaking havoc or a campfire roasting marshmallows?\" Ackerman said in an interview.\n\nAckerman's position is outside the mainstream of the dozens of doctors who are advising university presidents and the N.C.A.A. on their decision. \"I'm used to swimming upstream,\" he said.\n\nBut Ackerman wedged his way into the discussion via Twitter, posting that shutting down college sports based on data about myocarditis would be \"NONSENSE!\" He said that two days later, he received an email from a Big 12 athletic director, whose name he could not recall, who asked \"would you be interested in expounding on your 250-character tweet\" during that night's meeting of Big 12 university presidents.\n\nWhen asked by The New York Times if he could check his email for the athletic director's name, Ackerman later replied that it was instead a Big 12 official. Asked for the name of the official, Ackerman said on Friday that the invitation had come through his secretary and that she was not working that day.\n\nBob Burda, a Big 12 spokesman, did not provide an explanation for how the conference connected with Ackerman.\n\nArizona President Robert C. Robbins, a cardiac surgeon, shrugged off Ackerman's characterization of the evidence as \"wimpy, wobbly, weak,\" saying it was best to err on the side of caution. He said it would be wise to monitor how professional sports leagues are screening their players for virus-related heart problems, and see where more data leads. \"Maybe it will turn out that Dr. Ackerman is right, that this is something that will turn out to not be a big problem,\" he said.\n\nMyocarditis in the aftermath of viral infections is not a new phenomenon. So as doctors began to understand how the virus works, it was not a surprise for them to see it attack the lungs and the heart, which if inflamed becomes vulnerable to potentially fatal arrhythmias during vigorous exercise.\n\nThe prescription is straightforward: Rest for at least three months until further tests have indicated the inflammation has dissipated.\n\nMost of this year's early research, though, involved older patients, some of whom may have had compromised immune systems, leaving doubt as to whether the coronavirus attacks the heart any more virulently than other viruses do. There was scant evidence on how it might have affected young elite athletes who did not already have health problems.\n\nThen by early August, shortly after the German study was published, examples began to surface of otherwise healthy athletes showing signs of myocarditis after they recovered from Covid-19. Boston Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez was sidelined for the season. Indiana freshman lineman Brady Feeney's doctor was concerned about Feeney's heart after a difficult bout with the virus. A 27-year-old former Florida State basketball player, Michael Ojo, who had recovered from the virus, died of an apparent heart attack at a practice in Serbia.\n\n\"That was probably the tipping point in us saying we're not ready to move forward,\" Dr. Jonathan Drezner, a cardiologist at the University of Washington who advised the Pac-12, said of myocarditis uncertainty. \"But it wasn't the primary reason.\"\n\nWatching from afar has been Daniels, the Ohio State cardiologist.\n\nThe primary tests for myocarditis are an echocardiogram (an ultrasound), an electrocardiogram (which records the heart's electric signals) and a blood test that measures a protein that is excreted when the heart muscle is damaged. But Daniels said a cardiac M.R.I., which he called the gold standard of testing for myocarditis, might reveal the condition when the other tests do not, though there are occasional false positives.\n\n\"It's as close as we can get to a heart biopsy without doing one,\" he said.\n\nIn May, as plans were being made to bring athletes back to prepare for their seasons, Daniels began working with the Ohio State team doctor James Borchers, who was coordinating the school's protocols for sports. They concluded that cardiac M.R.I.s would provide the most salient data.\n\n\"Everybody is saying now that maybe we should do cardiac M.R.I.s,\" Daniels said. \"We've got three months of data.\"\n\nJust what that data says remains largely hidden. Daniels said he is prohibited by the school from revealing how many athletes who had the virus have been tested, how many attend Ohio State, what sport they play, the severity of the myocarditis symptoms, what parts of the heart it attacks, or most other questions about the data. He said only that 13 to 15 percent have shown symptoms of myocarditis, which he revealed only because Gov. Mike DeWine had coaxed it out of him during a news conference.\n\nSoon, though, the peer review will be complete, which could clear the way for the study to be published, as soon as this week, Daniels said. That could open the door to more studies, larger data sets and better science about the risks that schools are asking unpaid athletes to assume -- at least for those who are interested in hearing it.",

        "body": "How to decode your child's symptoms, and advice on when to stay home and get tested.\n\nIt's inevitable. In the fall and winter your child is likely to develop a fever, runny nose or cough. Maybe even all three.\n\nIn past years, that probably wouldn't have been so worrisome. Usually children are sent back to school as soon as they are well enough to attend. But now parents are bound to wonder: Are those symptoms a sign of Covid-19? Should my child stay home? Does she need to be tested? If so, how often? The rules at different schools may vary.\n\nWith cold and flu season quickly approaching and the school year already underway in many states, parents need to know what to do. So we asked three pediatricians if it's possible to know whether your child's symptoms might be Covid-19, and how to proceed if you think your child has the disease.\n\nHow will I know if it's Covid-19, the flu or a cold?\n\nYou likely won't. Because the symptoms of Covid-19 mimic so many other typical childhood illnesses, it's really hard to tell.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there is no one very distinguishing feature,\" said Eva Cheung, M.D., a pediatric cardiologist and critical care specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital and Columbia University Medical Center.\n\nThe most common Covid-19 symptoms in children are a cough or a fever, or both, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The doctors we spoke with said they've often observed fever, diarrhea or congestion in children who have tested positive.\n\nBut there are a lot of other potential ways that the virus presents itself in children -- symptoms can also include loss of taste or smell, abdominal pain, headache, sore throat and difficulty breathing. Some of those symptoms are also signs of other illnesses that circulate during cold and flu season. (A chart on the C.D.C.'s website shows just how often these symptoms can overlap.)\n\nRemember that \"parents know their children best,\" said Meg Fisher, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist and the medical director of the Unterberg Children's Hospital at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch, N.J. If your child always gets allergies this time of year, for example, then it's probably safe to assume that's what's causing her runny nose. But if your child's symptoms seem out of the ordinary, it's best to talk to your child's pediatrician.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T16:44:28.117Z Two P.R. experts at the F.D.A. have been removed after the fiasco over convalescent plasma. 'We are incredibly concerned': Local health departments urge the C.D.C. to pull its new guidance on testing. Notre Dame will start in-person classes again next week after an outbreak forced it to go virtual. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nSome infected children won't have any symptoms. A multicenter study of more than 400 hospitalized children in France found that 45 percent of the 22 children who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, had none of the symptoms typically associated with Covid-19. This offers a clue as to how many children are potentially asymptomatic. But it's difficult to know what percentage of children will be asymptomatic in the general population because we don't know the total number of children who have had Covid-19 -- many of them may have never been tested.\n\nWhile it can be challenging for parents to identify Covid-19 symptoms from the usual cold or the flu, the Covid-related multisystem inflammatory syndrome, now known as MIS-C, has more distinguishable symptoms and characteristics. The condition, which affects children, is usually characterized by a fever of 101 or higher that doesn't go away; a red rash; and abdominal pain accompanied by diarrhea and vomiting. The syndrome, however, is quite rare.\n\nAt what point should I keep my child home from school?\n\nIf your child has a fever, keep her at home. Even before the pandemic, most schools required children with fevers to be kept at home and remain there until their fever had subsided for at least 24 hours.\n\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic, kids would often go to school with lingering runny noses and coughs because cold symptoms can sometimes drag on for weeks. In most school settings, it was not expected, nor practical, for parents to keep their children home for three weeks if their kids felt well enough to attend school and didn't have a fever.\n\nBut this school year is different, experts said.\n\n\"This is not the year to be sending your kid to school sick, even a little bit, even with mild symptoms, which I know is crazy. Because it's really hard for parents,\" said Adam Ratner, M.D., a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases and director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at N.Y.U. Langone. \"Sometimes mild symptoms are all we have to go on and kids are really good at shedding the virus, even if they don't have symptoms. And so I worry about spread from kids who have mild symptoms within the class.\"\n\nSymptoms that warrant staying at home include coughing, runny nose, sneezing, vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain, regardless of whether or not your child has a fever.\n\n\"We actually don't know whether or not the fever always comes first or it comes after,\" Dr. Cheung said, referring to the progression of the disease.\n\nShould my child take the antibody test?\n\nAntibody tests are useful mostly for surveys of large populations to get a rough estimate of how many people have had the disease, not to make individual diagnoses, according to experts at the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The test isn't helpful to parents wanting to know about their child's ability to spread Covid-19. And, similar to adults, even if a kid tests positive for the antibodies, it's unclear how protective the antibodies are or how long any immunity will last.\n\nThe test can, however, be used to help diagnose multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, in a child. New guidelines say that doctors should do both a Covid-19 test and an antibody test for MIS-C on children suspected of having MIS-C because it is not known how long after the initial infection that the inflammatory syndrome begins.\n\n\"Most of the kids we've seen with MIS-C have been antibody-positive, but not all of them,\" Dr. Ratner said.\n\nWhen and how often should I make sure my child is tested for Covid-19?\n\nIt depends on several factors: what your school requires, how prevalent Covid-19 is in your area, and the ease and speed with which you can get tested.\n\nIf your child has a fever combined with other symptoms of Covid-19 like a cough, runny nose or abdominal pain, then you should call your pediatrician and discuss the possibility of getting tested. The tests do help guide policymakers in figuring out how safe it is for schools to remain open.\n\nA negative test will provide some peace of mind. If the test is positive, then you will need to alert your child's school immediately and plan to quarantine your child for at least 10 days, per the latest C.D.C. guidelines.\n\nIf the test is readily available in your area and you can get the results back quickly -- meaning in a day or so -- then it might make sense to test your child even if the symptoms are mild and there is no fever.\n\n\"The overarching advice is that you just have to err on the side of caution much more readily in cities and places where the infection rate is high,\" Dr. Cheung said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIf a test comes back negative, then your child can most likely return to school quickly. Some schools may even require that you get the test.\n\nIf you cannot get a quick test result then the test becomes less useful. Say you waited seven days for your child's results and the test came back negative. You might assume that your child was in the clear. But what if your kid contracted the virus during the seven days you were waiting for your results?\n\nWhy not test asymptomatic kids for Covid-19?\n\nThe doctors agreed that testing asymptomatic kids semi-regularly or at random intervals throughout the year is not useful. And depending on the area where you live, tests could be in short supply.\n\nKeep in mind that people can continue to test positive for Covid-19 months after they contract the virus, even when they are no longer contagious, the doctors said. In other words, if your child tested positive, you would have no way of knowing when she got the virus -- unless, that is, you were testing your child every day, a costly strategy used by the N.B.A. (All three doctors interviewed said that daily testing for children is not feasible.)\n\n\"We've become so hooked on testing that people are getting the impression that testing somehow puts you in a bubble or protects you in some way,\" Dr. Fisher said. \"If you get tested, it's only a moment in time.\"\n\nThe C.D.C. advises asymptomatic people who were in close contact with someone with Covid-19 -- meaning that your child was within six feet of that person for at least 15 minutes -- to quarantine for 14 days from the day of the last exposure.\n\nIf your child is asymptomatic and was recently exposed to someone with Covid-19 and you would like to get tested, then it's best to wait about five days after being exposed before getting the test because the virus may still be incubating in the body, Dr. Fisher said.\n\n\"I wouldn't do it earlier because you're going to get that false sense of security that you're not infected -- and you might be,\" Dr. Fisher said.\n\nGetting tested isn't necessary for those who are asymptomatic, according to the C.D.C., even if you had close contact with someone with the disease. Exceptions, the agency noted, might be made for \"vulnerable\" individuals, or if health care providers or state or local public health officials recommend testing.\n\nThe agency also does not recommend universal testing of all students and school staff. The C.D.C. says that it's not clear whether this testing provides any additional reduction in person-to-person transmission of the virus beyond other infection prevention methods like hand-washing, mask-wearing and distancing. The A.A.P. agrees.\n\nRegardless of how vigilant you are and how careful the school is, it's impossible to avoid the risk of illness entirely.\n\n\"We know when children get together, illnesses are going to spread from child to child,\" Dr. Fisher said. \"So what we want to do is mitigate, not eliminate risk. If we're waiting to eliminate risk, we're never going to reopen school.\"",

        "body": "BRUSSELS -- Phil Hogan, the influential trade commissioner for the European Union, resigned Wednesday night over breaches to coronavirus guidelines during a recent dinner with lawmakers and other public figures in his native Ireland.\n\nMr. Hogan issued a statement expressing regret and making an \"apology to the Irish people.''\n\nHe was under great pressure at home after attending the dinner last week at a golf club, near Ireland's west coast, in violation of coronavirus restrictions. The dinner, attended by about 80 politicians and government officials, violated a ban on large gatherings and fueled a sense that the powerful consider themselves above the rules they impose on others.\n\nThe uproar had already led to the resignation of Ireland's agriculture minister and the disciplining of several lawmakers.\n\nMr. Hogan insisted on Tuesday that he had adhered to all rules during the trip, having gotten a negative coronavirus test. But Ireland's regulations require anyone coming from Belgium to undergo a 14-day quarantine, which Mr. Hogan did not do.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, leaders of Ireland's governing coalition, including the taoiseach, or prime minister, Micheal Martin, said in a joint statement that Mr. Hogan had been in breach of public health guidelines, and that his \"delayed and hesitant release of information has undermined public confidence.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-26T21:37:05.259Z The C.D.C. was pressured to change guidance on testing asymptomatic people who had been exposed to the virus. N.Y.C.'s subway and bus service would be reduced by 40 percent without federal aid, M.T.A. warns. At U.S.C., classes are online, but university officials report an 'alarming increase' in cases anyway. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nAs trade minister, Mr. Hogan, 60, occupied one of the most important positions in the European Commission, the bloc's bureaucracy. A large, boisterous and blunt man, Mr. Hogan, a 6-foot-5 former farmer, was considered a good choice to represent Europe to the Trump administration, which has made the American trade deficit a major issue in international relations. The bilateral trade relationship is worth about $1 trillion a year.\n\n\"Personality matters, especially with the United States,'' said Mujtaba Rahman, chief Europe analyst for the Eurasia Group. \"He could deal with Trump and Robert Lighthizer,\" President Trump's trade representative, he said. Just last week, Washington and Brussels agreed on a tariff reduction deal -- modest, but the first in a long time.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, the Commission president, will need to choose another Irish citizen to replace Mr. Hogan, though not necessarily with the same portfolio. There are numerous possibilities, including David O'Sullivan, who has much experience in Brussels. Mr. O'Sullivan was a senior trade official until 2010 and was most recently the bloc's ambassador in Washington.\n\nImportantly, Mr. Hogan's top deputy, Sabine Weyand, is expected to remain. Ms. Weyand, a German who had previously worked on Brexit, is considered one of the stars of Brussels, with a sharp eye for detail.\n\nMr. Hogan had also put some noses in Brussels out of joint when he floated his name as a candidate to run the World Trade Organization. While his candidacy was highly unlikely, some European officials felt he had underestimated the importance of the job he already held, with the European Union struggling to balance its trading interests between the Trump administration and a more aggressive China.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all.

        "body": "Researchers in South Korea found that roughly 30 percent of those infected never develop symptoms yet probably spread the virus.\n\nOf all the coronavirus's qualities, perhaps the most surprising has been that seemingly healthy people can spread it to others. This trait has made the virus difficult to contain, and continues to challenge efforts to identify and isolate infected people.\n\nMost of the evidence for asymptomatic spread has been based on observation (a person without symptoms nevertheless sickened others) or elimination (people became ill but could not be connected to anyone with symptoms).\n\nA new study in South Korea, published Thursday in JAMA Internal Medicine, offers more definitive proof that people without symptoms carry just as much virus in their nose, throat and lungs as those with symptoms, and for almost as long.\n\n\"It's important data, that's for sure,\" said Benjamin Cowling, an epidemiologist at the University of Hong Kong who was not involved in the work. \"And it does confirm what we've suspected for a long time -- that asymptomatic cases can transmit infection.\"\n\nDiscussions about asymptomatic spread have been dogged by confusion about people who are \"pre-symptomatic\" -- meaning they eventually become visibly ill -- versus the truly asymptomatic, who appear healthy throughout the course of their infection.\n\nThe new study is among the first to clearly distinguish between these two groups.\n\n\"There's been this big question pretty much since January, since data started coming out of China, about people that were asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic,\" said Jason Kindrachuk, a virologist at the University of Manitoba who was not involved in the work. \"What we haven't really had any clue of yet is what role people who are asymptomatic play in transmission of disease.\"\n\nThe new study measured the virus's genetic material in the patients; the researchers did not follow the chain of transmission or grow live virus, which might have more directly confirmed active infections.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-06T14:57:36.409Z A stalemate continues in the stimulus talks with a meeting set for later Thursday as Friday's job report looms. 'We have to try something different': Experts call for a large-scale rethinking of the U.S. testing strategy. In a worrying sign, France and Germany record higher daily totals of new cases than they've seen in months. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nStill, experts said the results strongly suggest that asymptomatic people are unwitting broadcasters of the virus.\n\n\"They don't look any different from the symptomatic population\" in terms of how much virus they carry, said Marta Gaglia, a virologist at Tufts University in Massachusetts who was not involved in the work. \"There's no actual reason to believe a priori that they would transmit any differently.\"\n\nDr. Cowling was more circumspect. Because asymptomatic people do not cough or sneeze, he said, it is possible that they are less efficient at expelling the virus than those who are clearly unwell.\n\nOn the other hand, Dr. Gaglia offered, people who feel ill tend to take to the bed or couch, whereas the infected but unaware may carry on with their business, sickening others along the way.\n\nThe South Korean team analyzed samples taken between March 6 and March 26 from 193 symptomatic and 110 asymptomatic people isolated at a community treatment center in Cheonan. Of the initially asymptomatic patients, 89 -- roughly 30 percent of the total -- appeared healthy throughout, while 21 developed symptoms.\n\nThe participants were mostly young, with a median age of just 25. (A study last week found that children, who are mostly mildly infected, also harbor at least as much virus as adults do.)\n\n\"The real strength of the study is they have a very large number of patients and they have very good follow-up,\" Dr. Gaglia said. \"When they talk about asymptomatic patients, they really, really know that these were true asymptomatics.\"\n\nThe study's estimate that 30 percent of infected people never develop symptoms is in line with findings from other studies. In an television interview on Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, tendered 40 percent as the figure.\n\n\"The good news about Covid-19 is that about 40 percent of the population have no symptoms when they get infected,\" Dr. Fauci said. But \"even though you are likely not going to get symptoms, you are propagating the outbreak, which means that you're going to infect someone, who will infect someone, who then will have a serious consequence.\"\n\nThe participants in the new study were all isolated when they tested positive for the virus and did not have the opportunity to infect others. Doctors and nurses tracked their temperatures and other symptoms, and tested their sputum -- which indicates virus present in the lungs -- as well as their noses and throats.\n\n\"Both groups had similar amounts of virus pretty much throughout the entire course of infection,\" Dr. Kindrachuk said. Asymptomatic people became virus-free a little sooner: around Day 17, compared with Day 19 or 20 for those with symptoms.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nBoth estimates are much longer than the period of quarantine required in most countries, Dr. Gaglia noted. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently decreased the recommended quarantine to 10 days from 14.\n\nBut several studies have suggested that infected people shed -- or pass into the environment -- live coronavirus for only about a week, even though the tests may pick up viral fragments in their bodies for much longer.\n\nDr. Cowling also noted that the study was retrospective, meaning the researchers looked at samples collected from people who had tested positive earlier, instead of following a group of people over time, identifying everyone who became infected as well as their contacts, and assessing their symptoms and virus levels.\n\n\"It would still be valuable to design a study like that,\" he said. Still, he conceded that comparing people with symptoms and without was challenging because infected people are found in varying ways.\n\nMost testing plans focus on people who need medical care, and rarely whole groups regardless of symptoms -- especially in places like the United States, where tests are often scarce to begin with.\n\nA lack of testing can also influence how much asymptomatic people contribute to the size of an outbreak.\n\nWith enough testing, everyone found to be infected could be separated from others. But if the testing is barely enough to catch the visibly ill, then asymptomatic people -- particularly the young and social -- may fan out into society and keep the virus circulating at high levels.\n\nMany other viruses can be spread by people without symptoms, usually at negligible levels, Dr. Kindrachuk said.\n\nIt's still unclear whether the new coronavirus is unusual in this respect, able to spread widely from asymptomatic people, he added, or whether it just seems so prolific because of the scale of the pandemic. Studies addressing those questions are underway.\n\n\"There are all these small nuances about this virus that are coming to light each day,\" Dr. Kindrachuk said.",

        "body": "The program Brushes With Cancer pairs patients with artists whose works make visible a disease that can be invisible and isolating.\n\nAs Covid-19 heightens the anxieties of cancer patients, online support groups step up efforts to help by means of social networking. One such group, Twist Out Cancer, sponsors an innovative program called Brushes With Cancer that matches patients with artists who create a unique piece of artwork to capture the experience of their disease.\n\nWhen I first heard about Brushes With Cancer, I was predisposed in its favor because I have witnessed firsthand the transformative capacity of the visual arts. Generally, I forewarn prospective patient-readers about the depressing account of ovarian cancer in my book \"Memoir of a Debulked Woman\"; however, one stranger's response elated me. Juliet R. Harrison sent me an art object that made the darkness visible. She had gutted the book -- cut into its cover, torn out most of its pages -- and then sutured it back together with splints, paste, fragmented words and wire. Broken, hollowed and rebound, it concretized the evisceration I had tried to protest.\n\nBrushes With Cancer promotes the exchange of this sort of uncanny gift. On the website of Twist Out Cancer, painters, designers, sculptors and photographers as well as survivors, patients and caregivers can sign up to engage -- with the aid of a mentor -- in a four-to-six-month partnership.\n\nJenna Benn Shersher, the chief executive of Twist Out Cancer, told me that when she founded it in 2012, an art history student named Anna Swarthout (now Moschner) posted a video saying that she felt robbed of her creativity while dealing with the same disease Ms. Shersher had overcome: gray-zone lymphoma. Could others provide her artwork -- without using the color gray, she asked? The \"huge response\" convinced Ms. Shersher that many would profit from such interactions: \"Not only do people get to tell their story; they then see it through someone else's eyes, which can be therapeutic.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-26T07:48:16.998Z The C.D.C. changes testing guidelines to exclude those exposed to virus who don't exhibit symptoms. The Trump administration ordered hospitals to report data to H.H.S. or risk losing funding. At the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump acknowledges the pandemic's human toll. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nBegun in Chicago, Brushes With Cancer has chapters in Philadelphia; Detroit; Austin, Texas; Toronto; and Tel Aviv. Artworks are displayed at its galas and auctioned off, and the money raised is plowed back into the program. \"What if the subjects who served as inspiration want to keep the work?\" I asked Ms. Shersher. She explained that they have first right: \"Relatives often chip in to contribute, although some people believe that the rendering of their cancer encounter should circulate more widely.\"\n\nAlthough the pairings were originally done in person, the program has pivoted in the pandemic, Ms. Shersher explained in an email. \"We decided in late March to move all of our programming and large scale art exhibitions and celebratory events into the virtual space,\" she wrote. \"This means that all artist and inspiration interactions are done virtually for the safety of our participants.\"\n\nThe works in Brushes With Cancer address and redress the fright and anguish of a disease that can be indiscernible in its progression and isolating as well as deadly.\n\nLike the art made from my deconstructed and reconstructed book, one work titled \"Walking In, Walking Out\" reconfigures a cancer memoir, Bob Kaufman's \"Replenished.\" Bryan and Liz Kuntz, with Ricky Kimball, created a surrogate of Mr. Kaufman, trudging across the pages of his account of surviving late-stage non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma and a bone-marrow transplant. The verso page with its gouges and gorges must have been difficult to slog through. It looks as if the solitary figure had to drag his feet across the treacherous terrain, ripping up his own language in an effort to reach the clear plain of the recto side.\n\nEquipped with a hat and a backpack, Mr. Kaufman's avatar straddles the adjacent but incongruent geographies of during and after treatment. The artists remind us how many patients set themselves simple goals: of walking out of the hospital on their own two feet and of disclosing their ordeal like an open book.\n\nFocused also on gritty determination, Bowen Kline's painting \"Bombs Away\" depicts Grace Fauls Lombardo holding a lit bomb inscribed with the message \"To Cancer. TlcN1. Love, Grace.\" In an accompanying legend, Mr. Kline states that doctors would look at Ms. Lombardo's diagnosis -- T1 is the breast tumor, c the size, N1 stands for one involved lymph node -- before looking at her. After diagnosis, Ms. Lombardo began a blog that she called \"grancer,\" a neologism that rhymes with cancer but contains all the letters of her hopeful first name.\n\nWhat makes Mr. Kline's figure more than a poster girl for a \"we-can-beat-cancer\" clich\u00e9? Ms. Lombardo's wary expression after she has lit the fuse to blow cancer to smithereens. \"Here goes nothing,\" she seems to be saying, \"but what the hell?\" Despite her bravado and the artist's comic approach, the proximity of the bomb to her head feels ominous.\n\nA number of the more poignant paintings sponsored by Brushes With Cancer confront loss more overtly. With a nod to Picasso, \"Our Tangled Stories\" depicts two closely aligned heads and torsos. To accompany it, Virginia Champoux-Sokoloff, describes her mother's 20-year-old struggle with breast cancer and then her different approach to the disease. Might the two figures represent the daughter, wide-eyed, and her dead mother, shut-eyed? Or they could be Ms. Champoux-Sokoloff before and after her mother's death.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nBut the artist Ishita Banerjee states that in the aftermath of a double mastectomy Ms. Champoux-Sokoloff suffered the loss of her husband to lung failure. From this perspective, the two interfused figures signify the patient and her beloved spouse. Circling lines radiate out from the center of both chests -- two breasts, two lungs, a breast and a lung -- to portray the intimacy of the living and the dead. A doubled yet single being in mourning, one cannot move without the other.\n\nOfer Katz undertook not a Cubist but an impressionist approach to grieving in his otherworldly painting \"Things I wanted to tell you -- Mark and Aliza Ainis at The Dead Sea.\" The artist explains that Aliza's father passed away after a long struggle with cancer on the day of her high school graduation and that she missed being able to tell him about her ongoing life. Mr. Katz \"wanted to create a scene that manifests the absence of conversation, but with a presence of deep paternal love.\" His consolation for her regret over unspoken words takes the form of a primal scene of numinous beauty.\n\nAwash in the blues that connect the sky with the landscape and the water, the father at the piano cradles his infant daughter in his lap while playing her a tune by the light of the silvery moon. Preserved on canvas, father and child reside together in what Freud called the oceanic: the sense of unbounded limitlessness, of being merged with each other and the external world. No one can drown in the Dead Sea, most people believe, because of its high salt content, though it is impossible not to anticipate the pianist and his swaddled baby sinking into the unfathomable depths of memory.\n\nLike Frida Kahlo, who painted flowers so they would not die, the participants in Brushes With Cancer illuminate the meaning of Thomas Merton's statement that \"Art enables us to find ourselves and lose ourselves at the same time.\"\n\nSusan Gubar, who has been dealing with ovarian cancer since 2008, is distinguished emerita professor of English at Indiana University. Her latest book is \"Late-Life Love.\"",

        "body": "Many experts -- including a scientist who worked on the Mayo Clinic study -- were bewildered about where a key statistic came from.\n\nAt a news conference on Sunday announcing the emergency approval of blood plasma for hospitalized Covid-19 patients, President Trump and two of his top health officials cited the same statistic: that the treatment had reduced deaths by 35 percent.\n\nMr. Trump called it a \"tremendous\" number. His health and human services secretary, Alex M. Azar II, a former pharmaceutical executive, said, \"I don't want you to gloss over this number.\" And Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, said 35 out of 100 Covid-19 patients \"would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.\"\n\nBut scientists were taken aback by the way the administration framed this data, which appeared to have been calculated based on a small subgroup of hospitalized Covid-19 patients in a Mayo Clinic study: those who were under 80 years old, not on ventilators and received plasma known to contain high levels of virus-fighting antibodies within three days of diagnosis.\n\nWhat's more, many experts -- including a scientist who worked on the Mayo Clinic study -- were bewildered about where the statistic came from. The number was not mentioned in the official authorization letter issued by the agency, nor was it in a 17-page memo written by F.D.A. scientists. It was not in an analysis conducted by the Mayo Clinic that has been frequently cited by the administration.\n\n\"For the first time ever, I feel like official people in communications and people at the F.D.A. grossly misrepresented data about a therapy,\" said Dr. Walid Gellad, who leads the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nIt is especially worrisome, he said, given concerns over how Mr. Trump has appeared to politicize the process of approving treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus. Over the next couple of months, as data emerges from vaccine clinical trials, the safety of potentially millions of people will rely on the scientific judgment of the F.D.A. \"That's a problem if they're starting to exaggerate data,\" Dr. Gellad said. \"That's the big problem.\"\n\nWhen asked where the 35 percent figure came from, an agency spokeswoman initially directed a reporter to a graph of survival statistics buried in the Trump administration's application for emergency authorization. The chart, analyzing the same tiny subset of Mayo Clinic study patients, did not include numerical figures, but it appeared to indicate a 30-day survival probability of about 63 percent in patients who received plasma with a low level of antibodies, compared with about 76 percent in those who received a high level of antibodies.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T00:17:10.084Z A judge struck down a state order requiring most Florida schools to open for in-person instruction. A U.S. measure protecting 12 million tenants from eviction ends, as requests for help in housing court spike. Work by researchers in Hong Kong finds that reinfection may be possible in rare cases. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nOn Monday, Dr. Peter Marks, the director of F.D.A.'s center for biologics, evaluation and research, said that the agency reviewed published studies of plasma and conducted its own analysis of data from the Mayo Clinic's program of hospitalized patients who received plasma. Although the size of the benefit varied, he said in a statement, \"there appears to be roughly a 35 percent relative improvement in the survival rates of patients\" who received the plasma with higher versus lower levels of antibodies.\n\nHe added: \"Given the safety profile observed, the totality of evidence regarding potential efficacy more than adequately met the 'may be effective' standard for granting an Emergency Use Authorization.\"\n\nConvalescent plasma, the pale yellow liquid left over after blood is stripped of its red and white cells, has been the subject of months of enthusiasm from scientists, celebrities and Mr. Trump, part of the administration's push for coronavirus treatments as a stopgap while pharmaceutical companies race to complete dozens of clinical trials for coronavirus vaccines.\n\nAlthough there have been some positive signs that it can reduce deaths in Covid-19 patients, no randomized trials have shown that it works. A popular access program set up this spring by the F.D.A. and run by the Mayo Clinic has provided the treatment to more than 70,000 people, but it has also, some researchers said, hindered enrollment in the more rigorous randomized trials that could definitively prove whether it works. The emergency authorization released on Sunday broadens that access program.\n\nStatisticians and scientists said that Dr. Hahn, in saying at the news conference that 35 out of 100 sick Covid-19 patients would have been saved by receiving plasma, appeared to have overstated the benefits.\n\nDr. Robert Califf, who was F.D.A. commissioner under President Barack Obama, said on Twitter on Sunday that Dr. Hahn should correct his statement.\n\nDr. Hahn did not respond to repeated requests for clarification on his comments.\n\nThe publicly released data from the Mayo Clinic shows that, among the larger group of more than 35,000 patients, when plasma was given within three day of diagnosis, the death rate was about 22 percent, compared with 27 percent when it was given four or more days after diagnosis.\n\nOn Sunday night, an agency spokeswoman posted a chart on Twitter claiming that plasma \"has shown to be beneficial\" for 35 percent of patients -- neglecting to mention that the figure was based on a subset of a subset of the data.\n\nIn an interview on Monday, one of the Mayo Clinic study's main authors, Dr. Arturo Casadevall of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said he was also stumped. \"Do I know where the 35 percent comes from?\" he said. \"No.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome -- which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet -- and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don't show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed.

Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms. More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nDr. Casadevall said that the F.D.A. had conducted its own analyses of the data, and that the paper he and his colleagues posted this month to a so-called preprint server -- before it has been peer reviewed by a medical journal -- contained only a portion of the total available data.\n\nDr. Casadevall said focusing on the 35 percent number distracted from the broader takeaway: that convalescent plasma shows promise, at a time when doctors have few other options. \"I think that I would not focus so much on that -- people can say things in many different ways, but I think that one has to look at the data,\" he said. \"I think the important thing is that all the indicators show a reduction in mortality.\"\n\nEmily R. Smith, an epidemiologist at The George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health in Washington, D.C., agreed that the issue was a distraction, but for a different reason.\n\n\"We're trying to track down numbers and preprints and Twitter slides, and that's a big distraction from the bigger issue of -- do we think there's good evidence to suggest this is safe and effective?\" she said.\n\nShe and others, including the F.D.A. in the emergency authorization itself, have said that existing data -- from the Mayo Clinic and other non-randomized studies -- cannot replace rigorous trials that will more definitively indicate whether the treatment is effective. On Monday, the chief scientist for the World Health Organization, Dr. Soumya Swaminathan, said at a news conference in Geneva that only a few of these convalescent plasma trials had reported findings, and that the trials had been relatively small. \"The results in some cases point to some benefit but have not been conclusive,\" she said. \"At the moment it's still very low-quality evidence.\"",

        "body": "While any face covering is better than nothing, clear plastic shields and masks with exhale valves allow large plumes of particles to escape and may also expose the wearer to more germs.\n\nFace shields and valved masks -- two options many people find more comfortable than cloth face coverings -- appear to be less effective at blocking viral particles than regular masks, a new study shows.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had already stated that clear plastic face shields and masks equipped with vents or valves are not recommended, because of concerns that they don't adequately block viral particles. But the new research, which uses lasers to illuminate the path of coughs, offers a striking visual demonstration of how large plumes of particles can escape from behind a face shield or vented mask.\n\n\"I think these visualizations are really powerful for helping the general public to see and understand what's happening,\" said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who studies airborne particles but who was not involved in the research.\n\nThe news will be disappointing to those looking for an alternative to regular face masks. Teachers and students, in particular, often prefer face shields because they are more comfortable to wear over long periods of time, can be easily cleaned and allow for better communication because they don't muffle the voice or hide facial expressions. Valved masks, with one-way vents designed to allow breath to escape while blocking germs from entering, can feel more breathable and prevent the mask from getting moist as quickly.\n\nBut the new research, published in the journal Physics of Fluids, shows that face shields and vented masks allow large plumes of particles to escape, putting those around you at risk. And while the research did not specifically look at the level of protection the shields and masks offer the wearer, it does suggest that people who use them may also be more vulnerable to exposure than if they wore a regular mask. Valved masks are a particular concern -- some of the nonmedical vented masks the researchers used had faulty valves, suggesting that some people may be walking around with open valves -- essentially large holes -- in their masks.\n\nTo conduct the research, scientists from Florida Atlantic University used hollow foam heads fitted with various face coverings. They pumped a vaporized mixture of glycerin and distilled water through the heads to simulate a cough or sneeze, and used lasers to illuminate the path of the plume.\n\nIn two separate studies, the researchers showed that even the best masks allow some particles to escape. In videos of tests using the gold-standard mask, an N95, a puff of particles can be seen jetting out around the bridge of the nose, where the fit is poor. (Other studies have shown that N95 masks, which should filter 95 percent of small particles, lose about a third of their filtering potential if the fit is improper.) That said, the researchers found that N95 masks, cloth masks and papery medical-style masks all block a significant amount of particles and appear to offer adequate protection for the typical person in the community who is practicing social distancing.\n\nBut when the hollow heads were fitted with clear plastic face shields or valved masks, the results were less encouraging. While the face shields did a good job blocking the initial splatter from the simulated cough, the laser illumination showed that plumes of aerosolized particles swirled out from under the shield.\n\n\"Masks act as filters and actually capture the droplets and any other particles we expel,\" said Siddhartha Verma, assistant professor in the department of ocean and mechanical engineering at Florida Atlantic University and the study's lead author. \"Shields are not able to do that. If the droplets are large they will be stopped by the plastic shield. But if they are aerosol sized, 10 microns or smaller, they'll just escape from the sides or the bottom of the shield. Everything that is expelled will very likely get distributed in the room.\"\n\nWhen a standard N95 mask with a valve was tested, a large cloud of particles also escaped through the valve, but the vent directed the plume downward. Standard N95 masks with valves, which are often used by construction workers and painters to prevent inhalation of dust and other particles, meet standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Even so, valved respirator masks are not allowed in sterile medical environments because they allow the wearer's germs to escape. During the pandemic, a number of knockoff versions of valved masks have appeared on the market, and while the valves look authentic, they don't really work.\n\nIn a mask with a working valve, the pressure inside the masks forces a small disk to open and let air out, but when you inhale the disk fits tightly against the hole and doesn't allow air in. \"What we found was that everything escapes through that exhalation valve,\" said Manhar R. Dhanak, a study co-author and chairman of the university's department of ocean and mechanical engineering. \"And in some of the non-N95 commercial masks, the valve just appeared to be cosmetic. They didn't function because they were of poor quality, so the disks basically didn't move out and in as we'd expect them to.\".\n\nWhile the study allowed the researchers to compare the relative effectiveness of various masks and face shields, the methods used did not quantify the volume or size of the particles that escaped.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe research is unlikely to be the final word on face shields. A 2014 study has often been cited as evidence that face shields offer extra protection to the person wearing them, but even that study concluded that the benefit was limited. While the face shields protected the wearer from large cough splatters, they were less effective against smaller coughs and aerosols. And after the cough, as larger particles settled to the ground and aerosols dispersed around the room, the face shield reduced aerosol inhalation by only 23 percent.\n\n\"Face shields can substantially reduce the short-term exposure of health care workers to large infectious aerosol particles, but smaller particles can remain airborne longer and flow around the face shield more easily to be inhaled,\" the researchers wrote, adding that for health workers, face shields should be worn in addition to masks, not as a substitute.\n\nIn Switzerland, health officials warned that a coronavirus outbreak in a hotel appeared to infect workers wearing face shields, while workers wearing traditional masks appeared to have been protected.\n\nDr. Marr said work in her own lab also shows that face shields offer almost no protection against aerosolized particles believed to play an important role in the spread of illness. \"It provides maybe 5 percent protection, if that,\" she said. \"It's almost nothing for the particle sizes we're concerned about.\"\n\nWhile face shields do block large splatters from a cough or sneeze, smaller particles get caught in air flows and never hit the plastic, slipping below it instead. \"Air can't pass through the face shield -- it has to bend and go around the shield,\" Dr. Marr said. \"The aerosols are going to follow that air flow around the shield. It's not going to splat.\"\n\nFor some people, a face shield may still be the best option. For instance, a child with developmental disabilities may be more inclined to use a face shield than a mask. A clear plastic face shield might also be useful to a caregiver who needs to communicate with someone who is hearing impaired. Although the findings suggest that a cloth or surgical mask offers more protection, experts say that any face covering is better than nothing at all and that face shields will keep some portion of large coughs and sneezes from splattering on the people around them.\n\nFor most people, a cloth mask of at least two layers, which covers the face from the nose to under the chin, is the best option.\n\n\"A good homemade mask works very well,\" said Dr. Verma. \"If it's comfortable, it can be worn for long periods of time. Definitely try to avoid shields only or masks with valves.\"",

        "body": "BERLIN -- It was shortly after 7 p.m. when a self-described healer got on stage outside the German Parliament and urged the jeering crowd of protesters to storm the building: \"There is no more police!\" she shouted. \"We have won!\"\n\nWhat followed was a scene many Germans thought had been confined to their history books: Hundreds of far-right activists waving the black, white and red flag of the pre-1918 German Empire that once inspired the Nazis broke through a police barrier and tried to force their way into the building.\n\nIt took only a few tense minutes before the police, though vastly outnumbered, managed to push them back. But Saturday's events marked an alarming escalation of the protests against Germany's response to the pandemic that have grown steadily bigger and -- on the fringes at least -- angrier.\n\nStrikingly, that outpouring of anger comes at a time when Chancellor Angela Merkel's government is enjoying high levels of trust and popularity, and the great majority of Germans approve of its virus control measures. Germany has managed the pandemic well, keeping the number of deaths low, reopening schools and pumping billions of euros into welfare programs that so far have kept unemployment at bay.\n\nSmall as they are in numbers, though, the group who tried to take over the historic Parliament building, the Reichstag, prompted shocked responses and grim comparisons to Germany's past.\n\n\"The fact that Nazis with imperial war flags try to storm the Bundestag recalls the darkest period in German history,\" Robert Habeck, the co-leader of Germany's Green party, told the Funke media group.\n\n\"It is intolerable that the Reich flag should fly again at the German Parliament,\" said Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, the head of Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right party.\n\nGermany's president, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, called it \"an unbearable attack on the heart of our democracy.\"\n\nSome 38,000 protesters from all over the country flocked to the German capital last weekend, the biggest number since the marches started in April. It was an eclectic crowd. There were anti-vaxxers like Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., anticapitalists, esoterics, ordinary citizens angry at having to wear face masks -- but also about 3,000 members of the far-right scene.\n\n\"We have everything from Hare Krishna fans to Adolf Hitler fans on the streets,\" said Matthias Quent, an expert on far-right extremism and the director of an institute that studies democracy and civil society. \"It's a very disparate crowd but what unites people is an angry discontent with the establishment. It's a mix of populist and egoist outrage.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-31T20:08:40.199Z The virus is resurging in Spain, which reported 53,000 new cases in the past week. Trump retweeted a fringe theory on virus deaths. But more than 183,000 have died in the U.S. With testing disrupted, storm-hit Louisiana watches other measures of the virus and sees trouble. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD, has tried to exploit the pandemic in the same way it used the refugee crisis in 2015, when the government accepted more than one million migrants into the country, to feed a narrative of impending crisis and government failure.\n\nThe migrant wave helped propel the AfD into Parliament in the last election, but the issue has lost much of its political potency, as the resettlement has been broadly deemed a success. And with its own lawmakers and voters deeply split over the country's coronavirus measures, the party has seen its share of the vote dip below 10 percent in recent polls.\n\nIn all, only 9 percent of Germans support the protests, polls suggest. And only one in 10 Germans say they disagree with virus-prevention measures like the requirement to wear masks on public transport, in stores and in public buildings including schools and libraries.\n\nAlmost eight in ten Germans said they would like to see greater compliance with pandemic controls, and some 28 percent said the measures were not strict enough.\n\n\"They shout 'We are the people,' but they're not,\" Mr. Quent said of the protesters who swarmed the Reichstag.\n\n\"In Germany, like many other European countries, we see that far-right parties are losing ground, that there is growing trust in incumbent governments,\" Mr. Quent said. \"In the short term the pandemic can't be exploited by far-right parties.\"\n\nIf the economy deteriorates further and unemployment rises, that equation may change, he said. Already, the AfD and more extreme far-right groups are trying to capitalize on the discontent as they begin positioning themselves for what may be a much uglier political scene some months from now.\n\nWhat worries officials and extremism experts more immediately is that even if the far right is a minority at the protests, it is radicalizing. Among those calling on supporters to join the protest on Saturday were Bj\u00f6rn H\u00f6cke, an AfD firebrand, and Martin Sellner, star of the extremist Generation Identity movement, both of whom have been classified as far-right extremists by the domestic intelligence service.\n\nMessage boards are flush with far-right conspiracy theories and prepper groups, which have long fantasized about a crisis so deep that it would lead to the collapse of Germany's liberal order. Ahead of Saturday's protest, which the city government had tried to block before being overruled by a court, several public groups on the messaging app Telegram had called for a \"storm on Berlin.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nSome had posted photos of themselves and their weapons. \"That is very unusual for Germany,\" Mr. Quent said.\n\nThe authorities are on high alert. Over the past 14 months, far-right terrorists have assassinated a regional politician on his front porch near the central city of Kassel, attacked a synagogue in Halle, in the east, and in February, killed 10 people in the west, in Hanau. Even before the pandemic hit Germany, far-right extremism and far-right terrorism had been officially identified as the biggest danger to the country's democracy.\n\nAt a same time, senior intelligence officials have expressed concern about far-right extremists infiltrating Germany's security services. Cases of far-right extremists in the military and the police, some hoarding weapons and explosives, have multiplied alarmingly in recent years. In July, the government disbanded an entire company of the KSK, the country's special forces, because it was infested with far-right extremists.\n\nAt the coronavirus protests on Saturday, far-right activists actively courted police officers deployed to secure the march, urging them to switch sides.\n\nThere have been several cases of police officers joining such protests, according to Robert Andreasch, a journalist who has been documenting their appearances. Two active police officers, a retired officer and one who was recently suspended were speakers at the rally on Saturday, one of them referring to a \"so-called pandemic\" and urging protesters to seek information outside the \"mainstream media.\" Another spoke of \"mask slavery.\"\n\nMeanwhile, it was three police officers who stood their ground on Saturday at the entrance to the Reichstag, the historic Parliament building, and held off the angry mob. A video of the three men pushing back against the demonstrators for several minutes before reinforcements arrived has gone viral in Germany.\n\nIt also ignited an uneasy debate about how to better protect the Reichstag. It is a point of pride that the building dedicated to \"The German People,\" as the inscription above its portico reads, remains open to those very people.\n\nThe best-selling tabloid Bild has called the police officers who protected it \"heroes\" and on Monday, President Steinmeier received them at his residence to officially thank them.\n\n\"Far-right extremism has deep roots in our society,\" Mr. Steinmeier said. \"It is a serious danger.\"\n\nChristopher F.

But there is a scenario they dread even more: a severe flu season, resulting in a \"twindemic.\"\n\nEven a mild flu season could stagger hospitals already coping with COVID-19 cases. And though officials don't know yet what degree of severity to anticipate this year, they are worried large numbers of people could forgo flu shots, increasing the risk of widespread outbreaks.\n\nThe concern about a twindemic is so great that officials around the world are pushing the flu shot even before it becomes available in clinics and doctors' offices. Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been talking it up, urging corporate leaders to figure out ways to inoculate employees. The CDC usually purchases 500,000 doses for uninsured adults but this year ordered an additional 9.3 million doses.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been imploring people to get the flu shot \"so that you could at least blunt the effect of one of those two potential respiratory infections.\"\n\nIn Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been waging his own pro-flu shot campaign. Last month, he labeled people who oppose flu vaccines \"nuts\" and announced the country's largest-ever rollout of the shots. In April, one of the few reasons Australia allowed citizens to break the country's strict lockdown was to venture out for their flu shots.\n\nA life-threatening respiratory illness that crowds emergency rooms and intensive care units, flu shares symptoms with COVID-19: fever, headache, cough, sore throat, muscle aches and fatigue. Flu can leave patients vulnerable to a harsher attack of COVID-19, doctors believe, and that coming down with both viruses at once could be disastrous.\n\nAccording to the CDC, flu season occurs in the fall and winter, peaking from December to February, and so was nearing its end as the pandemic began to flare in the U.S. in March.\n\nBut now, fighting flu proactively during the continuing pandemic presents significant challenges -- not only how to administer the shot safely and readily but also how to prompt people to get a shot that a majority of Americans have typically distrusted, dismissed and skipped.",

        "body": "VACAVILLE, Calif. -- How many things can go wrong at once?\n\nOn Wednesday millions of California residents were smothered by smoke-filled skies as dozens of wildfires raged out of control. They braced for triple-digit temperatures, the sixth day of a punishing heat wave that included a recent reading of 130 degrees in Death Valley. They braced for possible power outages because the state's grid is overloaded, the latest sign of an energy crisis. And they continued to fight a virus that is killing 130 Californians a day.\n\nEven for a state accustomed to disaster, August has been a terrible month.\n\nAcross the state there were 23 major fires reported on Wednesday and more than 300 smaller ones.\n\nIn the San Francisco Bay Area alone there were 15 wildfires, most of them burning out of control and feeding off the grasses and shrubs desiccated by the extreme heat. Thousands of residents were ordered evacuated in the wine country of Napa County and from the hills above Silicon Valley in Santa Cruz and San Mateo Counties.\n\nIn Southern California, fires were reported in Ventura and Riverside Counties -- and sweeping through one of the world's biggest collections of Joshua trees, burning a 43,000-acre stretch of the Mojave National Preserve. Images of the fire showed the iconic trees shooting flames into the air like blowtorches.\n\nThe evening breezes that many Californians rely on to chase the heat from their homes had vanished. And for those with air-conditioning, the power outages were a constant threat to that remedy.\n\nBut closer to the fires, residents had more urgent concerns.\n\nEdie Kansas left her home outside Vacaville, northeast of San Francisco, at 1 a.m. on Wednesday as a wall of fire traveling down hillsides threatened the cattle ranch that has been in her family since the 1860s. When wildfires struck in past years, inmate fire crews from nearby prisons quickly arrived to help protect homes. But this year, partly because of the coronavirus, the number of inmate crews has been slashed. Some prisoners are under quarantine and others were released early to mitigate the spread of the virus in prisons.\n\nThe fires, the power outages and the threat of the coronavirus have conspired to make 2020 the worst year Ms. Kansas can remember.\n\n\"This year,\" Ms. Kansas said. \"It's just so horrible.\"\n\nThe wildfires threatening Vacaville are known together as the L.N.U. Lightning Complex, and have destroyed more than 50 homes and are threatening nearly 2,000 more buildings, the authorities said.\n\nWest of Vacaville on Wednesday afternoon, houses along Pleasants Valley Road were consumed by flames, ash was flying through the air and smoke poured from vast rows of fire plodding down forested hills.\n\nIn just 12 hours, from Tuesday evening to Wednesday morning, the area's fires, which have injured four people, grew more than 14,000 acres. They now cover more than 46,000 acres in Napa, Sonoma and Solano Counties -- larger than the size of Washington, D.C. -- and are completely uncontained.\n\nCalifornia has had 6,754 fires this year, Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Wednesday, compared with just more than 4,000 at the same time last year.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-19T23:37:52.538Z Some teachers' unions push to delay in-person learning, and more colleges go online only. Local officials hid information about the outbreak from China's leadership, a U.S. report finds. Hold off approving plasma for emergency use, Fauci and others urged the F.D.A. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nBut Mr. Newsom, who declared a state of emergency on Tuesday to access out-of-state resources, emphasized that California was painfully familiar with the challenges of a busy wildfire season, and that officials have been bracing for months. \"This is what the state does,\" he said.\n\nMr. Newsom thanked other governors for sending additional resources, including Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona and Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas. \"We're putting everything we have on these fires,\" he said.\n\nMr. Newsom also mobilized the California National Guard to assist with relief efforts.\n\nThe cause of the fires is still under investigation but many appear to have been started by an unusually large number of lightning strikes over the weekend. Chief Jeremy Rahn, a Cal Fire spokesman, said California had experienced \"a historic lightning siege\" over the past 72 hours that resulted in about 11,000 lightning strikes, igniting more than 367 new wildfires.\n\nEven before the season began, Mark Ghilarducci, the director of the state's office of emergency services, said the pandemic was bringing \"an almost oppressive level of complexity\" to fire planning, from evacuation plans to reductions in manpower, notably among inmate fire crews. Cal Fire said it usually had about 190 inmate fire crews but this year had only 90 deployed or ready to deploy.\n\nWhile it is too early to say whether climate change influenced this heat wave, warming linked to human-caused emissions of greenhouse gases has generally contributed to the state's worsening fires. Climate change has also expanded the fire season, once largely confined from August to November, to nearly year-round.\n\n\"And if that's not bad enough,\" Mr. Ghilarducci said, \"now we have to deal with a worldwide pandemic. In a fire season. With the power off. What else do you want from us?\"\n\nNew fire precautions were announced in July by Mr. Newsom. Among them: protocols to beef up fire crews and to prevent the virus from spreading in evacuation centers. The new evacuation rules include health screenings upon entry to a shelter, extra cleaning, prepackaged meals, cordoning off evacuees with coronavirus symptoms, and the repurposing of college dorms, Airbnb houses, campgrounds and hotels into evacuation shelters.\n\n\"We have to think differently,\" Mr. Ghilarducci said. \"We know sticking everybody into a big room at a fairground isn't going to work this year.\"\n\nIn Riverside, Nevada and Contra Costa Counties, dozens of evacuated families are being sent first to emergency hotel lodging rather than to the high school gyms that usually serve as evacuation centers.\n\nIn the coastal town of Pescadero, south of San Francisco, authorities used the high school as an evacuation center on Wednesday. Normally, cots would be set up for people to spend the night. But no one is allowed inside now, so aid workers have been setting up displaced residents at nearby hotels.\n\nRita Mancera, the executive director of Puente, a social services organization helping evacuees, said people have been bringing their pigs, turkeys, goats, cows and horses to the school parking lot.\n\nMasked volunteers were handing out water, food and hand sanitizer. People waiting at the school have to sit outside or in their cars. Dealing with the evacuees during a pandemic was \"kind of overwhelming,\" Ms. Mancera said. \"We're asking people to be social distanced.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 17, 2020\n\nWhy does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nPower cuts have added an extra layer of complexity to the multiple crises in the state.\n\nMr. Newsom blamed a lack of planning in an angry letter to the energy agencies on Monday.\n\n\"Collectively, energy regulators failed to anticipate this event and to take necessary actions to ensure reliable power to Californians,\" Mr. Newsom said, adding, \"This cannot stand.\"\n\nThe state's electrical grid is deep in transition from a fossil-fuel-driven system to one increasingly reliant on renewable energy. Dozens of workhorse power plants have been shuttered. Some had grown old, inefficient and environmentally hazardous to the air and marine life. Others proved uneconomical as the state pushed carbon-free sources like solar and wind.\n\nWith the threat of even more destructive and aggressive fires in the fall, when faster winds propel them across the parched landscape, some health officials are concerned that smoke pollution could make people more susceptible to respiratory infections like Covid-19.\n\nThe fires in California are already spreading smoke across a wide region, with the National Weather Service's Bay Area office warning that air quality in the area will be \"very poor for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nIn many parts of the Bay Area, the air quality index, a measure of the level of air pollution, was higher than 200 on Wednesday.\n\nThat number is high compared with other cities known for poor air quality like New Delhi, which had an index of 154, and Beijing, where that number has hovered around 150 this week. The air quality index scale goes up to 500, but anything above 100 is considered unhealthy, and above 200 is \"very unhealthy,\" according to the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nStudies have also shown that in areas with poor air quality, people are more likely to die if they contract the coronavirus. And coughing, difficulty breathing and headaches are symptoms that both the virus and wildfire smoke exposure can cause, making it more difficult to know which may be the source.\n\nSolano County, which includes Vacaville and has about 450,000 residents, has been averaging about 76 new coronavirus cases a day over the last two weeks, according to a New York Times database.\n\nFor some Vacaville residents, losing power made the situation even more treacherous. As a wildfire approached his home, Philip Galbraith did not receive any type of alert when his power shut off on Tuesday night. He assumed it was part of intentional blackouts meant to lower power usage.\n\nThen a neighbor began \"desperately banging\" on his door, alerting him to the evacuation.\n\nAt 2:45 a.m. he fled.\n\n\"I got out of the house, in pretty much what I had on,\" he said. \"I got my son and we left.\"\n\nA two-hour drive southwest, in Pescadero, Lynne Bowman gestured to the trailer where she slept.\n\n\"This is where I live now,\" Ms. Bowman said. She, her husband and her daughter evacuated their house on Tuesday in 45 minutes, bringing clothes, jewelry and their two dogs, Viggo and Hedy.\n\nJust days earlier, Ms. Bowman was celebrating her daughter's wedding, a 20-person socially distanced affair. Now, she is contemplating the confluence of catastrophic events in the area.\n\n\"Yeah, pandemic, fire,\" she said. \"I mean, it is apocalyptic in many ways.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Kellen Browning from Davenport, Calif., Ivan Penn from Burbank, Calif., Jill Cowan from Los Angeles, Shawn Hubler from Sacramento, Henry Fountain from New Mexico, and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs, Lucy Tompkins and Derrick Bryson Taylor from New York.",

        "body": "The patient did mount an immune response to the new infection, however, and did not experience symptoms.\n\nA 33-year-old man was infected a second time with the coronavirus more than four months after his first bout, the first documented case of so-called reinfection, researchers in Hong Kong reported Monday.\n\nThe finding was not unexpected, especially given the millions of people who have been infected worldwide, experts said. And the man had no symptoms the second time, suggesting that even though the prior exposure did not prevent the reinfection, his immune system kept the virus somewhat in check.\n\n\"The second infection was completely asymptomatic -- his immune response prevented the disease from getting worse,\" said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who was not involved with the work but reviewed the report at The New York Times's request. \"It's kind of a textbook example of how immunity should work.\"\n\nPeople who do not have symptoms may still spread the virus to others, however, underscoring the importance of vaccines, Dr. Iwasaki said. In the man's case, she added, \"natural infection created immunity that prevented disease but not reinfection.\"\n\n\"In order to provide herd immunity, a potent vaccine is needed to induce immunity that prevents both reinfection and disease,\" Dr. Iwasaki said.\n\nDoctors have reported several cases of presumed reinfection in the United States and elsewhere, but none of those cases have been confirmed with rigorous testing. Recovered people are known to carry viral fragments for weeks, which can lead to positive test results in the absence of live virus.\n\nBut the Hong Kong researchers sequenced the virus from both of the man's infections and found significant differences, suggesting that the patient had been infected a second time.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-24T16:37:28.781Z Work by researchers in Hong Kong finds that reinfection may be possible in rare cases. Zoom reports partial outages, disrupting the first day of virtual classes for many U.S. students. 336 socially distanced Republican delegates gather to renominate Trump for president. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"I believe this is the first reported case that is confirmed by genome sequencing,\" said Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nThe study is to be published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. The Times obtained the manuscript from the university.\n\nThe man's first case was diagnosed on March 26, and he had only mild symptoms. In accordance with regulations in Hong Kong, he was hospitalized on March 29 even though his symptoms had subsided, and released on April 14 only after he had tested negative for the virus twice.\n\nHe had no detectable antibodies after that first bout with the virus. He was positive again for the coronavirus on a saliva test on Aug. 15 after a trip to Spain via the United Kingdom; the test was administered at the airport. The man had picked up a strain that was circulating in Europe in July and August, the researchers said.\n\nHis infections were clearly caused by different versions of the coronavirus, Dr. To said: \"Our results prove that his second infection is caused by a new virus that he acquired recently, rather than prolonged viral shedding.\"\n\nCommon cold coronaviruses are known to cause reinfections in less than a year, but experts had hoped that the new coronavirus might behave more like its cousins SARS and MERS, which seemed to produce protection lasting a few years.\n\nIt's still unclear how common reinfection from the new coronavirus might be, because few researchers have sequenced the virus from each infection.\n\n\"We've had, what, 23 million cases documented thus far, but the fact that one out of them at this point has been reinfected should not cause undue alarm as of yet,\" said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University in New York.\n\n\"However, it remains very, very concerning -- and this does nothing to dispel that -- that we may be subject to repeat infection with this virus,\" he said.\n\nDr. Iwasaki was more sanguine. She noted that the man had no antibodies after the first infection but produced them after the second exposure. Immunity is expected to build with each exposure to a pathogen exactly in this way, she noted.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome -- which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet -- and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don't show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms. More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"Again, it's what the textbook says should happen,\" she said. \"When you have second exposure to the same pathogen, you should elevate the antibody, and that's what's happening.\"\n\nMost people who are infected with the coronavirus produce detectable antibodies that would be expected to protect against the virus. Even people who had only mild symptoms, including this man, may also have immune \"memory\" in the form of B and T cells that prevent symptoms on second exposure.\n\n\"The majority of patients likely have a cocktail of immune responses that activate on second exposure,\" said Brian Wasik, a virologist at Cornell University. \"This Hong Kong patient also seems to have been asymptomatic on second infection, perhaps due to some immune response.\"\n\nBut the researchers said it's also possible that in some people, a second exposure will prove more severe. \"It cannot be generalized yet, because there's still a possibility that the second infection can be worse,\" Dr. To said.\n\nBuilding immune memory is not unlike boosting memory of a person, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe initial bout with the new coronavirus is likely to result in \"non-sterilizing immunity,\" but the virus will elicit a stronger response with each exposure, he said: \"It is often these second and third exposures that help to solidify the memory response for the long term.\"\n\nOver all, experts said, it's unclear how often people might become reinfected, and how soon, after a first bout with the virus.\n\n\"Those remain open questions, because one person exhibiting a mild reinfection, clearly documented as a distinct strain of the virus, does not provide enough evidence one way or another,\" Dr. Shaman said.",

        "body": "The American Museum of Natural History is going for an intimate experience -- allowing hundreds, not thousands, of visitors in per hour -- when it reopens on Sept. 9.\n\nDon't expect to put your arm around Teddy Roosevelt for a selfie. Or poke a finger in a moon crater, or scrape the mighty jaw of a T. rex.\n\nWhen the American Museum of Natural History reopens on Sept. 9, it will -- like all cultural institutions that have been retrofitted for the Covid era -- look and feel a little different.\n\nThe sculpture of Roosevelt, seated on a bench just inside a lower entryway and formerly a popular spot for photos, has been cordoned off with stanchions. Ditto the model of the moon in the Rose Center for Earth and Space, where once you could stand and learn your lunar weight.\n\nTouch screens are off, and so are the Imax films at the Hayden Planetarium. The hall of meteorites will stay unexplored, and the small theater tucked underneath the long, long tail of the Titanosaur will remain empty. Under the behemoth's outstretched neck last week, a museum staff member was testing an about-to-be deployed army of automatic hand sanitizer machines. Their robotic blurp is now part of the soundtrack to many exhibition halls.\n\nThe reimagining and re-engineering of the museum experience is meant to be noticeable, and assuring, said Ellen V. Futter, the museum's president. \"We're very keen for people not only to be safe but for people to feel safe,\" she said, especially as they re-enter large public spaces for possibly the first time in many months.\n\nBut for all the changes -- which include the museum's hours, ticketing, prices and live programming (none to speak of) -- much will remain the same. The blue whale is still suspended there. (Where else could hold her?) The dioramas are just as frozen, if now a little less dusty. The museum has used the longest closure in its 150-year history as an opportunity to do some deep cleaning.\n\nOne recent weekday, a worker was perched atop a lift, swabbing a far back corner of the tippity-top of a prosauropod's glass case. The floors are ultrapolished. So are the T. rex's teeth.\n\nEven the interactive objects that are now off-limits have been protectively spiffed up, with an eye toward the moment when they can be accessible again. Michael Meister, the director of exhibition design, was rolling through the dinosaur rooms with a cart laden with custom-made plexiglass covers, popping them on. \"They're all made to be flexible -- to come right off,\" he said. \"The goal isn't to hide anything or remove anything,\" because the expectation, the hope, is that these adjustments will be temporary, he said.\n\nOn the museum's front steps, the statue of Roosevelt on horseback, flanked by an African man and a Native American man -- for years the object of criticism as a symbol of racism and colonialism -- is still there, though the museum and the city agreed in June that it should be removed. No plans have yet solidified, but the exhibition \"Addressing the Statue\" continues, now with new signage to help control crowds in a narrow hallway there.\n\nAcross the museum, there are new air filters, one-way traffic patterns and orange stickers denoting where to stand in each corner of an elevator, to maintain social distancing. (Only two people at a time, the museum requests.)\n\nThat is a tall order when the Central Park West building normally has about 5 million visitors a year, nearly half a million of them schoolchildren. Now, capacity is capped at 25 percent, but a spokesman for the museum said they plan to go below that initially, for an even more intimate experience -- allowing hundreds, not thousands, of visitors in per hour, up to about 3,500 a day. Early sales for timed tickets have been strong, he said. (The museum reopens to members on Sept. 2.)\n\nThe museum has operated through pandemics and serious outbreaks before. In 1908, it opened an exhibition about tuberculosis, the bacteria-borne lung disease that was the city's leading killer at the turn of the 20th century. It was a proto-blockbuster of a show, with lines around the block; as many as 10,000 people saw it on a single day, according to the museum.\n\nIts success led to the creation of a public health division at the museum, whose curator had the foresight to begin collecting specimens of bacteria and other microbes. That collection formed the basis of a national repository that still exists today, as a key resource for researchers.\n\nEarly in this pandemic, the museum created online resources to help the public understand the coronavirus and the search for a cure; more programming is planned. Its scientists are also working on related research. Sharing facts and evidence-based science \"is very much in our sweet spot,\" Ms. Futter said. \"Science and education have never been more important.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nFun is good too. The museum is re-upping \"The Nature of Color,\" an immersive exhibition which had just opened when the pandemic shutdown began on March 13.\n\nTo re-enter the grand halls and ornate spaces of institutions like the Natural History or the Met, after months in which our world shrank so much -- to too-small apartments and overly familiar neighborhoods, the numbing roteness of domestic routine -- is to quickly rediscover awe. Art museums give us beauty and challenge our thinking. Natural history museums, which showcase the evolution of our world and its multifarious cultures over eons, offer perspective.\n\nEven for Ms. Futter, who began visiting the museum as a girl of 5 or younger, it was emotional to return. \"Going in and out of its doors every single day and night, and not having done so for months, was difficult and painful,\" she said. \"Coming back was moving and actually very happy.\"\n\nShe expects that many museumgoers may be flooded with emotion too -- with nostalgia and a sense of community, relief and joy at the return, however vigilant, to a vibrant remembered life.\n\n\"The visit itself is transporting,\" she said. \"We let you visit everywhere, seven continents and outer space, on Central Park West and 79th Street.\"\n\n\"Equally true is the enormous reassurance that there are some things that are constant -- and we are one of them.\"\n\nAmerican Museum of Natural History\n\nThe museum reopens on Sept. 9 (doors open to members on Sept. 2). Advanced purchase of timed tickets required. 212-769-5100, amnh.org.",

        "body": "Sorry, but your browser needs Javascript to use this site. If you're not sure how to activate it, please refer to this site: https://www.enable-javascript.com/\n\nA 33-year-old man was infected a second time with the coronavirus more than four months after his first bout, the first documented case of so-called reinfection, researchers in Hong Kong reported Monday.\n\nThe finding was not unexpected, especially given the millions of people who have been infected worldwide, experts said. And the man had no symptoms the second time, suggesting that even though the prior exposure did not prevent the reinfection, his immune system kept the virus somewhat in check.\n\n\"The second infection was completely asymptomatic -- his immune response prevented the disease from getting worse,\" said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who was not involved with the work but reviewed the report at The New York Times' request. \"It's kind of a textbook example of how immunity should work.\"\n\nPeople who do not have symptoms may still spread the virus to others, however, underscoring the importance of vaccines, Iwasaki said. In the man's case, she added, \"natural infection created immunity that prevented disease but not reinfection.\"\n\n\"In order to provide herd immunity, a potent vaccine is needed to induce immunity that prevents both reinfection and disease,\" Iwasaki said.\n\nDoctors have reported several cases of presumed reinfection in the United States and elsewhere, but none of those cases have been confirmed with rigorous testing. Recovered people are known to carry viral fragments for weeks, which can lead to positive test results in the absence of live virus.\n\nBut the Hong Kong researchers sequenced the virus from both of the man's infections and found significant differences, suggesting that the patient had been infected a second time.\n\n\"I believe this is the first reported case that is confirmed by genome sequencing,\" said Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To, a clinical microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nThe study is to be published in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. The Times obtained the manuscript from the university.\n\nThe man's first case was diagnosed March 26, and he had only mild symptoms. In accordance with regulations in Hong Kong, he was hospitalized March 29 even though his symptoms had subsided and released April 14 only after he had tested negative for the virus twice.\n\nHe had no detectable antibodies after that first bout with the virus. He was positive again for the coronavirus on a saliva test Aug. 15 after a trip to Spain via the United Kingdom; the test was administered at the airport. The man had picked up a strain that was circulating in Europe in July and August, the researchers said.\n\nHis infections were clearly caused by different versions of the coronavirus, To said. \"Our results prove that his second infection is caused by a new virus that he acquired recently, rather than prolonged viral shedding.\"\n\nCommon cold coronaviruses are known to cause reinfections in less than a year, but experts had hoped that the new coronavirus might behave more like its cousins, severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome, which seemed to produce protection lasting a few years.\n\nIt is still unclear how common reinfection from the new coronavirus might be because few researchers have sequenced the virus from each infection.\n\n\"We've had, what, 23 million cases documented thus far, but the fact that one out of them at this point has been reinfected should not cause undue alarm as of yet,\" said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University in New York.\n\n\"However, it remains very, very concerning -- and this does nothing to dispel that -- that we may be subject to repeat infection with this virus,\" he said.\n\nIwasaki was more sanguine. She noted that the man had no antibodies after the first infection but produced them after the second exposure. Immunity is expected to build with each exposure to a pathogen exactly in this way, she noted.\n\n\"Again, it's what the textbook says should happen,\" she said. \"When you have second exposure to the same pathogen, you should elevate the antibody, and that's what's happening.\"\n\nMost people who are infected with the coronavirus produce detectable antibodies that would be expected to protect against the virus. Even people who had only mild symptoms, including this man, may also have immune \"memory\" in the form of B and T cells that prevent symptoms on second exposure.\n\n\"The majority of patients likely have a cocktail of immune responses that activate on second exposure,\" said Brian Wasik, a virologist at Cornell University. \"This Hong Kong patient also seems to have been asymptomatic on second infection, perhaps due to some immune response.\"\n\nBut the researchers said it's also possible that in some people, a second exposure will prove more severe. \"It cannot be generalized yet, because there's still a possibility that the second infection can be worse,\" To said.\n\nBuilding immune memory is not unlike boosting memory of a person, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe initial bout with the new coronavirus is likely to result in \"nonsterilizing immunity,\" but the virus will elicit a stronger response with each exposure, he said: \"It is often these second and third exposures that help to solidify the memory response for the long term.\"\n\nOverall, experts said, it is unclear how often people might become reinfected, and how soon, after a first bout with the virus.\n\n\"Those remain open questions, because one person exhibiting a mild reinfection, clearly documented as a distinct strain of the virus, does not provide enough evidence one way or another,\" Shaman said.",

        "body": "It's August; an attempt at a fall culture season beckons, somehow, but a sense of great fragmentation persists. On Instagram I see artists and culture workers in Europe behaving more or less normally for the season -- that is to say, on vacation. Elsewhere, new horrors have taken over -- as in Beirut, where in the wake of a cataclysmic warehouse explosion, artists are sifting through the rubble of devastated gathering spaces and galleries.\n\nAnd then there's the United States, where symptoms of collapse are all over the culture, and maybe also, hopefully, some signs that we can build a society with more mutual care once we emerge. It's hard to avoid doomscrolling. Yet amid the algorithm's torrential spew, beauty still insists on breaking out -- in images and insights that honor our communities as we all try to push through, and ones that remind us of other places and possibilities.\n\nKwasi Boyd-Bouldin\n\n@_kwasi_b and @thepublicwork\n\nThe Los Angeles photographer Kwasi Boyd-Bouldin interprets his city through the broad streetscapes and utilitarian low-rise architecture in which the working-class and immigrant people who keep the place functioning proceed through the day. It's a local's look, keen to the poetry of auto-body shops and money-transfer agencies, to signs that hang askew and beat-up vehicles and always the sharp, unyielding sunlight. Before the coronavirus crisis, Mr. Boyd-Bouldin was not photographing people directly as much as seeking their traces, like an archaeologist, in his stark cityscapes. But on the second account he has put up this year, @thepublicwork, you'll see people -- his kind of Angelenos, those just getting by -- as they navigate their ordinary chores in this terrain. These \"snapshots from the lost world,\" as he calls them in one brief essay, are reminders of community. \"Our casual interactions with one another were a reflection of the human condition in its purest form,\" he writes. \"It's one of the most valuable aspects of daily life taken from us by this pandemic.\"\n\nCommunity Access Art Collective\n\n@artcollectivenyc\n\nSome 40 artists in multiple mediums make up the Art Collective at Community Access, an organization in New York that provides housing and support services for people living with mental health conditions. Some are highly trained working artists with decades of material; others have found in the studio a fresh, vital outlet. The work can be stunning, like a recent collage by Zeus Hope incorporating vintage newspaper with a jazz solo's serrated energy, or the paintings of John Smith themed on the New York City subway. The pandemic has meant restrictions on studio work for a group that, in the last year, has been increasingly visible with exhibitions, both physical and online; fortunately, its Instagram feed continues to share not only the art (and links to an online gallery for pieces that are for sale) but also glimpses of this dynamic crew's productive life and rich individual stories.\n\nThe White Pube\n\n@thewhitepube\n\nWhen Zarina Muhammad and Gabrielle de la Puente started The White Pube, their caustic but dead-serious criticism platform, they were students at Central Saint Martins, the art school in London, who had come face to face with the art world's political and institutional biases. Five years later, the duo, based in Liverpool and London, have grown a big following without sacrificing their rollicking, text-messagey style, nor their rigor and curiosity. This is accountability work, often lambasting major British museums and celebrity artists, but fundamentally constructive, with care for community arts organizations and underrepresented voices. The pair, and occasional co-conspirators, have a rich archive of criticism on their website, but their Instagram feed is a great point of contact. Britain is their main arena, but their perspective travels nicely.\n\nDiptyk Magazine\n\n@diptykmagazine\n\nBased in Casablanca, Morocco, the bimonthly Diptyk is a rare bird in today's media landscape: a high-quality art magazine from the global South that has managed to go the distance since it began in 2009. The perspective is both Moroccan and cosmopolitan, covering artists and events across Africa and the Mediterranean basin. What I appreciate about regional publications like this one is the way they reorient my perspective, shifting the center away from the usual hubs of global art and finance. Diptyk is published in French, and you won't find it on American newsstands, but its Instagram feed is a rich resource for art discovery, elegantly selected with lots of links to explore.\n\nZeitz Museum of Contemporary Art Africa\n\n@zeitzmocaa\n\nThe Zeitz MOCAA, in Cape Town, opened in 2017 in a spectacular converted granary, with the aim to become Africa's top contemporary-art venue. After wobbly beginnings, a leadership overhaul brought in the star Cameroonian curator Koyo Kouoh to run the place, and with her, sharper programming and fresh energy. The coronavirus has hit South Africa hard, shutting museums indefinitely, but Zeitz MOCAA has been busy online, offering digital panels, children's activities and even dance parties. And Ms. Kouoh and her team are keeping the intellectual flame burning with an excellent series of Instagram Live interviews with fellow curators from across Africa as well as with artists like Wangechi Mutu, archived on the museum's YouTube channel.",

    "Five-Minute Coronavirus Stress Resets": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In this emotional equivalent to an ultramarathon, it's key to have some stress-reducing strategies available that work quickly and efficiently to help you hit the reset button.\n\nHere's why: Struggling with chronic worry gets in the way of effectively managing your emotions. Unfortunately, many people who experience distress try to escape their unpleasant emotions by distracting themselves in ways that ultimately backfire.\n\nIf you suspect you might be one of them, ask yourself whether you have a tendency to judge your emotions -- it's a common thing to do. But it can fuel a vicious loop of feeling, then avoiding the feelings and feeling even worse. Pushing away feelings is like trying to force a beach ball underwater: They will pop back up. Instead, notice and normalize difficult emotions; ideally, negative feelings, including fear, can motivate us to solve problems.\n\nSo rather than dealing with anxiety and uncertainty by getting lost worrying, then chasing short-term fixes with longer-term consequences, like procrastinating, using food or marijuana to cope or relying on benzodiazepines -- the anti-anxiety drugs like Xanax -- it's helpful to experiment with quick strategies that will empower you. These strategies are not necessarily a cure, but can help lower the intensity of overwhelming emotions, allowing you to recalibrate to better deal with challenges you face.\n\nMy patients often reflect that an additional perk of strategic coping is boosting your sense of mastery -- the hope that arises when you stretch yourself and accomplish something difficult, like coping with your anxiety in a productive way.\n\nTry Music Medicine\n\nFocusing on relaxing sounds reduces stress. In research spearheaded by Dr. Veena Graff, an assistant professor in the department of anesthesiology and critical care at the University of Pennsylvania, preoperative patients were assigned either to music medicine -- listening to Marconi Union's \"Weightless\" -- or prescribed a benzodiazepine. Remarkably, serene music proved nearly as effective in easing patients' jitters as the medication option, with no side effects.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-06T09:16:46.781Z 'We have to try something different': Experts call for a large-scale rethinking of the U.S. testing strategy. In a worrying sign, France and Germany record higher daily totals than they've seen in months. New jobless claims in the U.S. are set to exceed 1 million for the 20th week. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nTo honor your unique taste, explore different options and create a playlist that you find comforting when you need a break. Keep in mind that although it can seem cathartic to hear songs that validate your emotions (for example, listening to lyrics about heartache while feeling lonely), research on inducing varying mood states concludes that we can improve our experience with a more uplifting soundtrack. \"Music can lift us out of depression or move us to tears -- it is a remedy, a tonic, orange juice for the ear,\" as Dr. Oliver Sacks wrote in \"Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain.\"\n\nCool Off\n\nMarsha Linehan, a professor emeritus in psychology at the University of Washington, popularized an exercise in dialectical behavior therapy to regulate intense emotions that involves immediately lowering your body temperature by creating a mini plunge pool for your face. This sounds odd, but it activates your body's dive response, a reflex that happens when you cool your nostrils while holding your breath, dampening your physiological and emotional intensity.\n\nTo do it, fill a large bowl with ice water, set a timer for 15 to 30 seconds, take a deep breath and hold your breath while dipping your face into the water. While this isn't conventionally relaxing, it will slow your heart rate, allowing blood to flow more easily to your brain. I love watching my clients try this over our telehealth calls and seeing firsthand how quickly this shifts their perspective. Just being willing to do this, I tell my clients as they prepare to submerge, is a way to practice being flexible.\n\nPace Your Breathing\n\nOne of my favorite ideas that never fails to fill me with gratitude, no matter what else is happening, comes from the mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn, who likes to say, \"As long as you are breathing, there is more right with you than wrong with you.\" In \"The Healing Power of the Breath,\" Drs. Richard Brown and Patricia Gerbarg offer a range of exercises to promote resilience. One of my favorites: Slow your breathing down to six breaths a minute by consciously inhaling and exhaling (to practice this timing, you can use a secondhand and inhale for five seconds, exhale for five seconds, and repeat four times, or try a guided recording). Paced breathing offers a host of physiological benefits, like reducing your blood pressure, which helps promote a sense of tranquillity. When people tell me it feels challenging to breathe in a certain way when they feel panicked, I tell them to start with alternative soothing activities, like music, and work their way up to paced breathing.\n\nPractice 'Anchoring'\n\nAnother way to stay present rather than spin into a crisis is to notice if you are engaged in thinking that isn't helping you. Our interpretations of events supercharge the intensity of our emotions. After all, anticipating, \"This will go on for years!\" in a moment of anguish will only inspire more hopelessness. But mindfulness, or learning to see more clearly as opposed to jumping to conclusions, is a nice remedy for anxiety. One brief way to enter the moment is known as \"anchoring,\" a popular strategy.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 4, 2020\n\nI have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nStart by physically centering yourself by digging your heels into the floor -- this evokes a feeling of being grounded in reality. Then take a moment to observe: What am I thinking? Feeling in my body? Doing? Then ask yourself: Is my response: A) Helpful? B) Aligned with my values now? Or C) Related to future worries or a past problem? While we can get stuck in specific thoughts, stepping back to more generally decide if those thoughts are helpful can get us out of rumination mode. It may also help to tape a list of these prompts on your computer to remember to take a step back and refocus when your thoughts are only making things worse.\n\nHyperventilate\n\nIf you struggle with physical sensations of anxiety, like muscle tension and feeling like you can't get enough air, a counterintuitive yet important way to manage is to practice bringing on those sensations in more quiet moments to improve how you tolerate stressful ones.\n\nLearning to repeatedly welcome physical symptoms allows you to stop seeing them as catastrophic. In a recent therapy group I led on Zoom, my clients prepared to try this by ordering thin coffee straws. I set my timer for a minute as they pinched their noses and tried to breathe only through the straw.\n\nWe also worked on replicating the other sensations they associated with fear, like muscle tension, dizziness and shortness of breath. We held a plank, spun in circles and ran in place. Some people were surprised that the practice experience was worse than the anxiety they normally felt. Others found it was similar, which felt liberating -- they didn't have to wait for the feelings to catch them off guard -- and instead could purposefully habituate themselves to them.\n\nRecently, at the end of a long day of video calls with patients, my 5-year-old daughter asked, \"When will the germs go away?\" After removing my 3-year-old's sneaker from my 1-year-old's mouth, I saw a request from a client about an urgent check-in. I practiced paced breathing and pulled up our nightly dance party playlist (by request: Justin Timberlake's \"Can't Stop the Feeling\") before discussing my daughter's feelings and returning to work.\n\nNow I hope you create your own plan with the strategies above. By practicing managing your emotions, you'll experience a sense of freedom in your life. I don't know about you, but I'd chase that over any mindless short-term alternative.\n\nJenny Taitz is an assistant clinical professor in psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of \"How to be Single and Happy: Science-Based Strategies for Keeping Your Sanity While Looking for a Soul Mate\" and \"End Emotional Eating.\"",

        "body": "The nation's testing efforts will be further overwhelmed once influenza, R.S.V. and other seasonal viruses arrive.\n\nCome fall, the rise of influenza and other seasonal respiratory infections could exacerbate already staggering delays in coronavirus testing, making it easier for the virus to spread unnoticed, experts said.\n\nIn typical years, doctors often don't test for flu, simply assuming that patients with coughs, fevers and fatigue during the winter months are probably carrying the highly infectious virus. But this year, with the coronavirus bringing similar symptoms, doctors will need to test for both viruses to diagnose their patients -- further straining supply shortages in an already overwhelmed testing system.\n\nA handful of manufacturers have begun making tests that can screen for several pathogens at once. But these combo tests are expensive and will likely make up only a fraction of the market. Some researchers are trying to make their own multi-virus tests as well, but they almost certainly won't fill in the gaps.\n\n\"The flu season is a bit of a ticking time bomb,\" said Amanda Harrington, medical director of microbiology at Loyola University Medical Center. \"We are all waiting and trying to prepare as best we can.\"\n\nFlu viruses and coronaviruses differ in many ways, including how they spread, how long they linger in the body and the groups they affect most severely. Food and Drug Administration-approved antivirals and vaccines exist for the flu, but no such treatments yet exist for the coronavirus, which has killed about 800,000 people worldwide in less than a year.\n\nBeing infected with one virus doesn't preclude contracting the other. And researchers also don't yet know how risky it is for a person to harbor both viruses at the same time.\n\nThose differences make it essential to tease the two pathogens apart, as well as rule out other common wintry infections like respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V., which hits the very young and very old especially hard.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T07:27:39.143Z A judge struck down a state order requiring most Florida schools to open for in-person instruction. The F.D.A. 'grossly misrepresented' plasma data, scientists say. At the Republican National Convention, Trump and his allies engage in revisionism on the virus. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nBut testing for individual viruses poses many challenges for doctors and laboratory workers already fighting their way through supply shortages. Several of these tests use similar machines and chemicals, and require handling and processing by trained personnel.\n\nWhat's more, many flu and R.S.V. tests vanished from the market this spring as the companies that make them rapidly pivoted to address the coronavirus.\n\nLate summer is typically when laboratories start stockpiling flu tests, R.S.V. tests, and flu-R.S.V. combo tests in anticipation of the autumn surge, said Susan Butler-Wu, director of medical microbiology at LAC+USC Medical Center, which purchases thousands of these tests every winter. But the supply chain shake-up has left shelves empty just weeks ahead of one of the busiest times of the year.\n\n\"Many people are legitimately concerned about the winter because we're not able to squirrel away our nuts right now,\" Dr. Butler-Wu said. \"Every lab is fighting to get what they need for their system.\"\n\nA few test manufacturers are trying to maximize efficiency by developing tests that can spot several pathogens at once. BioFire and Qiagen, for instance, have already made tests that can simultaneously screen for more than 20 bacterial and viral pathogens, including influenza viruses, R.S.V. and the new coronavirus.\n\n\"The beauty of these panels is: it's everything,\" said Esther Babady, director of the clinical microbiology service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.\n\nBut the bigger the panel, the bigger the price tag -- and \"those costs can add up really quickly,\" Dr. Babady said. These ultra-comprehensive tests will probably only be used in the sickest patients, which means health workers can't rely exclusively on them. And while coronavirus testing in the United States has largely been comped, federal funding sources like the CARES Act haven't explicitly addressed the issue of combo diagnostics, leaving ambiguous how much patients might have to pay.\n\nCheaper options do exist, including some that can screen patient samples for only the most likely microbial culprits.\n\nCalifornia-based Cepheid, which received emergency approval for a coronavirus-only test earlier this year, is putting the final touches on a new test for four pathogens -- two types of flu, R.S.V. and the coronavirus -- which will deliver results in about half an hour. Pending emergency authorization from the F.D.A., the company expects to roll the test out sometime in the next couple of months. Almost all of the roughly 2,000 American labs currently running Cepheid's stand-alone Covid-19 test probably will be buyers.\n\n\"We do expect strong demand for this,\" said Dr. David Persing, the company's chief medical and technology officer.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome -- which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet -- and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don't show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms. More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nBut Cepheid is small, and it has already maxed out its production lines at about 2 million coronavirus tests per month. Production is ramping up, Dr. Persing said, but slowly, and in the meantime, the company will need to phase out coronavirus-only testing to make room for its new product.\n\nAnother company, Hologic, is working on a three-virus test for two types of flu and the coronavirus, which will be available in time for flu season, according to a representative. But Hologic declined to specify a more concrete timeline or estimate production volume for its new panel.\n\nDozens of public health laboratories run at the state and county level -- which process hundreds of thousands of samples from hospital patients, health workers and nursing homes every week -- will soon be using a new test for three viruses, coronavirus, influenza A and influenza B. The combo test was designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cleared for use by the F.D.A. in July.\n\nThe C.D.C.'s test is a boon for efficiency, said William Glover, assistant director of infectious diseases at North Carolina's state public health lab. It will also help labs search for flu cases by sampling large swaths of the general population, a process called surveillance. But in order to meet local testing demand, Dr. Glover's team will likely need to supplement that test with a combination of commercial panels. Given the supply shortages that have thwarted testing thus far, he said, \"my plan is to have as much diversity in platforms as we possibly can.\"\n\nSome labs are trying DIY combo tests, including some loosely based on the C.D.C.'s original three-virus recipe. \"That's always an option for us,\" said Dr. Laurel Glaser, director of the clinical microbiology lab at the University of Pennsylvania. \"It could loosen up the supply chain.\"\n\nThese laboratory-developed tests can now be deployed without seeking F.D.A. review, the Trump administration announced on Wednesday. That could make it easier for big testing companies like Quest Diagnostics to make a proprietary combo panel, which is in the works, according to a company representative.\n\nStill, most labs don't have the time or resources to tinker with new tests, and the DIY versions often end up being more labor-intensive than their industry counterparts, said Jennifer Dien Bard, director of the clinical microbiology and virology laboratory at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.\n\nPreparing for this year's flu season has become an onerous process of layering contingency plans atop contingency plans, Dr. Babady said. \"Figuring out all those pieces before November is what's keeping us up at night.\"\n\nThere has been at least one tentative glimmer of hope: The flu season this year may be milder than in the past. Countries in the southern hemisphere, like Australia, which get hit with the flu six months before the U.S. does, have experienced an unusually tempered flu season, due in part to concerted efforts in physical distancing and sheltering in place.\n\n\"Distancing should also keep other viruses at bay,\" Dr. Harrington said. \"It might just be a completely atypical season.\"\n\nDr. Butler-Wu offered a less rosy view. Adherence to public health measures in the U.S. has been patchy at best, she said: \"If people aren't going to mask, aren't going to distance, we can anticipate there's going to be high demand for testing.\"",

I remember writing a lot of stories in towns with less than 50 residents.\n\nNow, I work in the Washington bureau of The New York Times, where I coordinate Freedom of Information Act requests. The act gives Americans the right to request documents and data from any federal agency. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. And it is an important source for investigative reporting.\n\nBut I still follow news from South Dakota, where Gov. Kristi Noem has made little of any coronavirus threat to her state, and refused to issue face-mask or stay-at-home orders. She joined President Trump at Mount Rushmore to celebrate the Fourth of July, an event that worried health officials.\n\nI thought of Sturgis.\n\nFor 80 years, bikers have gathered at the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, in western South Dakota. Although I had never attended a rally, I had seen -- and heard -- the motorcycles on the interstate. I had read stories about the races, entertainment and immense campground where thousands of bikers stay. More than one South Dakotan had shared a story of mischief.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-03T09:47:02.666Z As the C.D.C. prepares for two vaccines, here are some answers to a few of the most common questions. As outbreaks disrupt life on campus, colleges take a zero-tolerance stand against parties. New outbreaks test South Korea's strategy. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nBefore the 10-day gathering, which began on Aug. 7, the state's tourism agency had predicted that around 250,000 people would attend, half of what the event had drawn in previous years. Many residents feared the virus could quickly spread among the community and hoped Sturgis would be canceled. Coronavirus hot spots were emerging in places where large gatherings had happened.\n\nMy reporting instincts told me to go there.\n\nI pitched the idea of covering the rally to the National desk and volunteered to go. Soon, I was on a flight to Rapid City, S.D., with a face shield and a mask. Many passengers in the small airplane were dressed ready for Sturgis, donning leather vests, bandannas and boots.\n\nSouth Dakota's natural beauty stayed with me after I moved. A constant breeze keeps you comfortable there in the summer. During the half-hour drive to the rally from the airport, I was surrounded by a roaring parade of motorcycles.\n\nThe photographer Benjamin Rasmussen and I wanted to meet the people who had come to Sturgis. Bikers traveled from across the country, including from states with strict social distancing measures and mask requirements. Many of those I spoke to told me that the rally gave them a sense of relief. They could cut loose from the rules their states had imposed to stop the spread of the virus. I repeatedly heard the word \"freedom.\"\n\nFor most people I met, safety wasn't a concern. Finding those who were wearing masks was almost like a game of \"Where's Waldo?\" People stood shoulder to shoulder as they admired bikes parked along streets. They shared drinks and food. They sang at the top of their lungs during concerts.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIt was my first motorcycle rally, and I saw the appeal. People talking over their bikes, riding together to buffalo-filled Custer State Park, and enjoying the fairlike atmosphere. I wore a mask and tried to keep a distance between me and the people I interviewed.\n\nAfter the rally ended, I stuck around for a few days to finish my reporting. I admired the Black Hills. I encountered bikers at my hotel in Rapid City and area restaurants.\n\nWhen it was all said and done, some attendees went home with new tattoos, leather goods and bike decals. Others took the virus with them. States including Colorado, Minnesota and Nebraska are reporting cases linked back to the event. Minnesota just announced that a man in his 60s there had died of Covid-19 after attending the rally.\n\nOver the past week, South Dakota has recorded more than 2,000 coronavirus cases, an increase of 200 percent from the average two weeks earlier, according to a New York Times database. The state has shown no signs of putting in effect countermeasures to combat the virus as children return to school and the state fair approaches this weekend.\n\nI'm still keeping my eye on South Dakota.",

        "body": "How parents can distinguish between hand-washing that is a reasonable reaction to a real threat and something more concerning.\n\nIn May, a 15-year-old boy set up a socially distanced visit with a friend. They met on opposite sides of a sidewalk -- a full six feet apart -- and talked.\n\nBut when the teenager returned home, he brought with him a new set of Covid-19 fears, according to John Duffy, the boy's therapist and a child psychologist in Chicago. How could he be sure six feet was a safe distance?, the teenager wanted to know. He began washing his hands more frequently. He stopped touching countertops. And he hasn't wanted to see friends since.\n\nThe pandemic has understandably intensified our need for good hygiene and safety precautions. But for some children and teens, these precautions have crossed the line from careful to compulsive. And for parents, it can sometimes be hard to distinguish between a reasonable reaction to a very real threat and something more concerning.\n\nThere's little data available yet on the toll the pandemic has taken on the mental health of children. But Eric Storch, an expert on obsessive-compulsive disorder and a professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, said calls to the university's O.C.D. program have jumped significantly, by about 25 percent, since March. He attributed it in part to telemedicine improving access, and in part to worsening mental health concerns. Dr. Duffy said the number of his patients experiencing O.C.D.-like symptoms has tripled during this time.\n\nAbout 500,000 children and teens in the United States have obsessive-compulsive disorder, according to the International OCD Foundation.\n\nObsessive-compulsive disorder has two main components. Obsessions take the form of uncontrollable thoughts, urges, feelings or uncomfortable sensations. Compulsions are behaviors repeated over and over. These can include excessive handwashing, showering or sanitizing, but also checking things, putting things in order, tapping, touching, seeking reassurance or asking the same question repeatedly.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T08:29:45.489Z The C.D.C. cites health reasons for stopping evictions. Your smartphone may soon let you know you've been exposed. An N.I.H. panel says there is a lack of data to support the efficacy of using plasma to treat coronavirus patients. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"The key in O.C.D. is this functional relationship between the two,\" said Jennifer Freeman, director of research and training for the Pediatric Anxiety Research Center at Bradley Hospital in Rhode Island, and an O.C.D. specialist. The compulsion neutralizes the worry, but the relief is often short-lived, \"so obsessions come back, ritualizing seems like the only answer, and a vicious cycle is created.\"\n\nO.C.D. is far more complicated than germs and handwashing. Obsessions can be about dirt, germs and illness, but also about self-injury or thoughts of harm coming to oneself or one's family, or the world. And not all young people with the disorder are suffering in ways related to Covid. Interestingly, Dr. Freeman said, many kids who were in treatment for O.C.D. before the pandemic feel uniquely equipped to handle the stressors of this time. \"They're saying, 'This is how I've always felt. Now the rest of the world understands.'\"\n\nStill, many kids are \"suffering terribly, and suffering more so because of the pandemic,\" Dr. Freeman added. For them, if their schools are opening this fall for in-person classes, leaving the house and going back to school \"is going to be really hard, and that's real.\"\n\nFor teens with Covid-19 anxieties, being with friends who are more cavalier about risk is especially difficult, Dr. Duffy said. \"I'm working with kids who are super conflicted. They don't want to miss anything, they don't want to seem weird, and yet they are very focused on fear of transmission. And there isn't much space for them to express that.\"\n\nSo how should parents address their kids' fears and behaviors? How can they tell the difference between a reasonable response to a dangerous virus and something that might require treatment?\n\nLook for disproportionate fear\n\nIt makes sense to be cautious, but with O.C.D., you're disproportionately afraid, said Tara Peris, co-director of the Child O.C.D., Anxiety and Tic Disorders Program at the University of California, Los Angeles. Parents should look for behavior that falls outside their family's norms and the guidelines set by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe C.D.C., for example, recommends washing hands for 20 seconds with soap and water after being in a public place. \"If somebody moves into the realm of washing their hands 20 to 30 times a day, or if they're spending 15 to 20 minutes when they do wash, or they can't get out of the bathroom, then they're clearly more worried than they need to be,\" Dr. Peris said. \"I'm interested in whether kids are following instructions around them or whether they're washing to relieve distress, and whether that need is expanding over time or building and taking on a life of its own.\"\n\nIf it's affecting family life, friendships and a person's ability to do schoolwork, those are red flags, Dr. Peris said.\n\nTrust your instincts\n\nOne complicating factor, Dr. Duffy said, is that it's difficult to assess whether a person's basic functioning is disrupted when the pandemic itself is disruptive to basic functioning. We're working with a modified baseline, he said.\n\n\"What I tell parents is trust your radar,\" he said. \"If your child seems off emotionally, or raw or fragile in a way you wouldn't expect, or significantly different than peers or siblings, then you won't regret bringing a professional into the situation.\"\n\nTreatment works\n\nThe most effective approach for those with mild to moderate O.C.D. is cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure response prevention, which involves gradually introducing a person to the thing that scares them without giving in to rituals, Dr. Storch said. And the good news, he said, is that this treatment is effective at reducing symptoms more than 75 percent of the time. In more extreme cases, these therapies can be paired with medication.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nLara Koelliker, who is 18 and has been treated for O.C.D. since age 8, said she had severe symptoms for three years before finding a therapist who specialized in exposure therapy. The treatment helped her manage her symptoms by giving her coping mechanisms, she said.\n\n\"I've learned how to sit with my uncomfortable feelings, and I don't give in to my compulsions,\" she said. \"Now the part of me that has been equipped with all these strategies jumps in.\"\n\nTherapy on Zoom\n\nMany therapists are using video calls to treat patients now. And being inside a patient's house, virtually speaking, can be useful for exposure treatment, as home is often \"where O.C.D. lives,\" Dr. Freeman said. Some kids, for example, have fears involving contamination from pets, family members, or parts of their house.\n\n\"On Zoom, I can say, 'Can you show me that room? Can you show me that couch? Do you think you can sit on that couch? Can we do it together?'\"\n\nValidate feelings\n\nBeyond therapy, parents' top priority needs to be listening to their kids, Dr. Freeman said.\n\n\"Validate, validate, validate what the kids are feeling,\" she said. \"And be willing to have difficult conversations that stir up anxious distress in all of us. It's really important not to tell a child they shouldn't be sad, anxious or upset. That invalidates the emotions they're feeling.\"\n\nAddress school anxieties\n\nYoung people anxious about returning to school \"should be encouraged to express their anxieties, and parents and school personnel should not dismiss them,\" Dr. Freeman said. It's important that students understand that some school rules may be more strict than the rules at home to accommodate more people. They should also know, she said, that it's possible to feel simultaneously anxious and excited about going back.\n\nDr. Duffy suggests that students whose schools are opening do two things before school starts: Create a plan with a school counselor or adviser for when they're feeling anxious in real time, and set up a walk-through of the campus with a staff member so the child can become familiar with any Covid-related changes, such as partitions in the classrooms or tape on the floor to maintain social distance.\n\n\"The schools in my area are offering this option,\" he said, \"and it's alleviating a lot of fear by providing some sense of familiarity.\"",

        "body": "JERUSALEM -- Just as a graduation for 400 students was breaking up on Monday night in the blockaded Gaza Strip, a university official rushed to the stage of the brightly lit soccer stadium and took the microphone to address the crowd of Palestinian families, few wearing masks.\n\nThe authorities had just reported four new cases of Covid-19 in the territory, a place that had yet to report a single case of community spread. Every known patient had contracted the virus while traveling elsewhere -- but these four had not.\n\n\"We ask you not to spend additional time here,\" pleaded the official, Said al-Namrouti, urging people who gathered for the Islamic University's education college graduation to go home immediately. \"There's an exceptional situation outside the stadium related to the coronavirus.\"\n\nThe discovery of the first four cases of community transmission of the virus deep inside Gaza set off an epidemiological investigation into the outbreak's source, and prompted Hamas, the militant group that governs the territory, to impose a 48-hour curfew, a first step in the effort to control the outbreak.\n\nBut it has also raised fears that the pandemic could spread quickly in the densely populated enclave, exacerbating the already dire economic situation confronting its nearly two million residents. On Tuesday, the Health Ministry reported two new cases of local transmission, which it said were not linked to the first four.\n\nExperts warned that Gaza's health sector, already devastated by years of war and conflict, lacked the resources to deal with a widespread outbreak.\n\nGerald Rockenschaub, the head of the World Health Organization's mission, said Gaza's medical institutions have only about 100 adult ventilators, most of which were already in use, and noted that authorities were in need of more test kits.\n\n\"For years, the situation has been going from bad to worse,\" said Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Al Azhar University in Gaza City. \"If we need to shut down for several weeks, I'm worried we could be heading for a disaster.\"\n\nIsraeli and Egyptian restrictions on the movement of goods and people into and out of Gaza have contributed to the devastation of its economy, with poverty widespread and unemployment around 45 percent. Israel says the restrictions are intended to prevent Hamas and other militant groups from gaining access to weapons or the means to build them.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T23:02:48.204Z The C.D.C. changes testing guidelines to exclude those exposed to virus who don't exhibit symptoms. The Trump administration ordered hospitals to report data to H.H.S. or risk losing funding. 'No second chances': Colleges are coming down hard on students who violate virus restrictions. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nOn Tuesday, the effects of the new curfew were visible: Mosques, restaurants, cafes, wedding halls and other places were shut. Beaches were practically empty.\n\nFeras al-Hamami, a vendor who usually earns less than $9 daily, said authorities prevented him from selling long skinny rolls of bread from his portable cart.\n\n\"I live on what I make every day,\" said Mr. Hamami, 21, the sole provider for his wife and himself. \"If I don't work, I don't have money for food.\"\n\nSobhi al-Khazendar, a legal adviser at a gas company in Gaza City, said the virus worried him even more than violent conflicts between Israel and militant groups in the territory.\n\n\"When there's a war, I usually know where it's safe to go,\" said Mr. Khazendar, 27. \"The virus is different. It can be anywhere and everywhere. I have no idea how I can avoid it.\"\n\nWhile security forces limited movement throughout the territory by setting up checkpoints, they permitted residents outside the Maghazi refugee camp, where the first four infected people live, to leave their homes only for \"absolutely necessary matters\" like purchasing medication and food, said Salama Maroof, the head of the Hamas-run government media office.\n\nThe four infected people are members of the same family, Mr. Maroof said.\n\nThe restrictions on movement, however, were not universally observed. In Shejaiya, a neighborhood in the eastern part of Gaza City, hundreds marched through the streets in a funeral procession for four Islamic Jihad fighters who died in an explosion on Monday. On side streets, encouraged by Gaza's frequent power outages, people relaxed near their homes and went for short walks.\n\nAshraf al-Qidra, a spokesman for the Hamas-operated Health Ministry, said at a news conference that authorities had tested the four people from the Maghazi camp after learning they had been in contact with a relative who tested positive at a hospital in East Jerusalem.\n\nHe didn't offer an explanation as to how the virus entered the territory, but said contact tracing continued. Until Monday, authorities had found infections only at quarantine facilities, where all returning travelers were required to isolate for three weeks and pass two tests before being permitted to leave.\n\nThe discovery of the local cases on Monday came as tensions between Israel and Hamas have sharply risen. Palestinians in Gaza have launched flaming and explosive-laden balloons as well as a number of rockets into Israeli territory.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all.

Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIsrael has responded by blocking the entry of all goods into Gaza except for \"essential and humanitarian equipment.\" The new restrictions apply to fuel, worsening power outages.\n\nMr. Abusada, the political scientist, said he thought the sudden emergence of the pandemic in central Gaza would at least postpone a military confrontation between Israel and Hamas.\n\n\"The focus right now is on containing the virus,\" he said, \"but that doesn't mean an escalation won't take place later.\"\n\nHazem Qassem, a spokesman for Hamas, said the militant group wanted the Israelis to follow through on a number of commitments he said they made in indirect negotiations.\n\n\"We aren't seeking an escalation, but the Israeli side needs to stop procrastinating in fulfilling its obligations,\" he said. \"The virus won't prevent us from continuing to make our demands.\"\n\nMr. Qassem said Hamas was demanding Israel take action to improve Gaza's electricity infrastructure, permit the development of an industrial zone and allow the export of more goods and the import of \"dual-use\" items -- products that Israel says can be used for both civilian and military purposes -- among other measures. The prime minister's office declined to comment on Mr. Qassem's remarks.\n\nMr. Rockenschaub, of the World Health Organization, said that it was possible to contain the virus in Gaza, but it would require intensive contact tracing. \"This is far from being over, but I think there's still a chance to avoid a wide-scale outbreak,\" he said.\n\nMr. Khazendar said he found out about cases at the Maghazi camp while he was enjoying a coffee with friends at a coffee shop on the beach.\n\n\"Up until yesterday, we felt like we were living in another world, without the virus. We were acting like it didn't exist,\" he said. \"We shouldn't have been so complacent, but all I can hope for now is that God protects us.\"\n\nAdam Rasgon reported from Jerusalem, and Iyad Abuheweila from Gaza City.",

Parents should not try to keep troubling news from their children, they wrote, nor should they take refuge in overly technical talk, but should acknowledge their own emotional distress without overwhelming the child's emotions or fears with their own.\n\n\"Not telling them does not protect them,\" said one of the authors, Louise Dalton, a consultant clinical psychologist in the department of psychiatry at Oxford, who led the project together with Elizabeth Rapa, a senior postdoctoral researcher. \"Even young children are aware of the changes that have happened in everyone's life.\"\n\nThe group had developed guidance for the health care workers who found themselves in the new pandemic position of having to deliver bad news by phone, and they worried, Dr. Rapa said, that family isolation during the pandemic meant that \"children would be even more invisible.\" So their guidelines emphasized the importance of finding out whether the deceased person left children who would need to be told, and offering help to the family member who would have to do the telling.\n\nThey wrote guidance for the family member who has to do the telling, which Dr. Rapa called \"a step-by-step guide to help parents or any adults have one of the most difficult conversations you're ever going to have with your child.\" The specific scenario they had in mind was a parent, at home in lockdown with one or more children, getting a phone call that a grandparent or other family member had died, though their advice applies to many other situations.\n\n\"Parents were taking this horrendous phone call to learn that granddad had died,\" Dr. Rapa said. \"Children would know that granddad was not very well, they would know in lockdown that mum has taken this phone call -- you would have hardly any time to prepare.\" The first instruction for parents is to take a minute to breathe \"as slowly and deeply as you can.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-30T14:43:25.154Z California, as its infection rate declines, becomes the first state to top 700,000 known cases. European leaders weigh new lockdowns as alarming caseloads return. Universities are struggling to rein in their Greek systems, as fraternities and sororities foster outbreaks. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"Thinking about talking to children about this probably feels the hardest thing in the world,\" the guide begins. \"Try to keep your focus on the next few minutes and how you want the children to hear the news of their loved one's death.\"\n\nIt's a conversation that changes with the age and understanding of the child, but remember that children as young as 2 will understand that something has happened, Dr. Rapa said, and will need to be included.\n\nDr. Elena Lister, an adult and child psychiatrist on the faculty at Columbia and Cornell medical centers who specializes in grief and loss, said, \"I'm a believer in no rush, holding your child, being close to your child, letting that sink in for a few seconds, waiting to see what comes up.\"\n\nAnswer the specific questions a child asks, Dr. Lister said, for example about the actual cause of death: \"The doctors couldn't help her with her breathing enough.\" And let the child know, \"We're going to have a lot of time to talk about this, we'll get through this together.\"\n\nBe prepared for common reactions, including being asked if you are going to die as well. Especially with younger children, be ready to revisit the topic, check in with them a day later, and ask them what they understand, Dr. Rapa said.\n\n\"I don't think of it as one conversation,\" said Dr. Lister, who has written about the experience of losing her daughter to leukemia. \"It's step one of a difficult conversation.\"\n\nUse very specific and literal language. Young children may hear \"we've lost granddad,\" for example, and assume that the next step is to go find him.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nMake sure that children are not blaming themselves, Dr. Dalton said. That may mean reassuring the child that the person who died was well taken care of in the hospital, that everyone did everything that could be done. Talk about practical measures to prevent transmission -- masks and hand hygiene. Talk about the scientists who are working on vaccines.\n\nAcknowledge your own sadness, and that you miss the person who has died.\n\nWe're living in a world right now where experts on grief and loss have a lot to teach us about everyday parenting. Our behavior as parents is already affected by the stress of the pandemic, both acute and chronic, Dr. Lister said. \"The acute part puts us all in a state of hyperarousal,\" she said, but the chronic stress is particularly wearing.\n\n\"Kids are seeing loss in many different ways,\" Dr. Lister said. Their schools, their friends, their routines, their summer plans -- and then on top of that, the constant talk about disease and death. \"They're surrounded by it -- in the news, their parents are talking about it -- it's so unlike regular life where we all chug along at a kind of level of denial of our mortality,\" Dr. Lister said. \"This environment has caused us all to live in a soup of mortality awareness.\"\n\nChildren are scared and anxious, Dr. Lister said, and they may be encountering misinformation, or misunderstanding some of what they see and hear. Bring up the difficult topics with your children, she advised. Try not to discuss them at bedtime, and remember that what you say to one sibling may well be passed along to the next. Having these conversations, she said, \"teaches them you can handle the hard stuff -- they feel less alone.\"\n\nAgain, be prepared for conversations about whether you -- or some other family member -- will die from the virus. How you answer that, of course, will depend on the child's age. For a 4-year-old, you might say, \"I wash my hands,\" Dr. Lister said, \"I am healthy, I am doing everything I can to stay as well as possible.\" Go into more detail for older children, but \"you cannot guarantee what you cannot guarantee.\"\n\nEspecially after someone has died, \"the full range of emotional reactions is entirely normal,\" Dr. Dalton said. Children may have increased anxiety, including separation anxiety, may be unusually clingy, or overreact emotionally to small events. But if a child is consistently withdrawing, refusing to take part in activities that usually give pleasure and comfort, the child may need more help. Children's emotional distress often shows up in disturbances of eating or sleeping, but persistent behavioral changes may warrant a talk with your pediatrician or a referral for mental health services.\n\n\"We need to be honest and specific with children -- as adults, we have to be courageous,\" Dr. Dalton said.\n\nDr. Perri Klass is the author of the forthcoming book \"A Good Time to Be Born: How Science and Public Health Gave Children a Future,\" on how our world has been transformed by the radical decline of infant and child mortality.",

        "body": "Hotel companies have been promoting new cleaning initiatives for months as a way to regain traveler confidence. But guests at some hotels in the United States say they are not living up to the promises.\n\nIn June, Charles Kunz stayed at the Westin Atlanta Airport and found \"the largest cockroach I've ever seen\" on his bed the next morning. The lawyer from Durham, N.C., a Titanium member of Marriott's Bonvoy loyalty program, said the insect \"was the size of my pinkie. I live in the South and I'm no stranger to bugs.\"\n\nIn July, Jeff Coons and his wife spent three nights at the Sheraton Panama City Beach Golf & Spa Resort in Florida. The Smyrna, Ga.-based airline product development executive and Bonvoy Lifetime Platinum member found mask usage \"seemingly optional\" among hotel staff, and only one hand sanitizer dispenser could be found anywhere. The toilet seat assembly in his bathroom was broken, and there was an oversized Lego block beneath a guest room chair.\n\nMajor hotel companies have been promoting new cleaning initiatives since the spring as a way to regain the confidence of the traveling public in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. But some guests at hotels in the United States -- including their most valuable guests, loyalty program members -- say they are not living up to their promises.\n\nAddressing the experiences described by Mr. Coons and Mr. Kunz, a spokesman for Marriott, whose brands include Sheraton and Westin, said the company \"has had a longstanding reputation for high standards of hotel cleanliness.\" The spokesman, John Wolf, said these standards have been enhanced multiple times since the pandemic began, adding that in the \"rare\" case a hotel does not comply with them, Marriott works to \"reinforce\" them.\n\nOther travelers, after stays at both chain and independent hotels across the country, have gone to TripAdvisor, Facebook and forums like FlyerTalk to report dissatisfaction with enforcement of cleanliness and mask-wearing standards. Chain hotels receiving complaints included Embassy Suites by Hilton Myrtle Beach Oceanfront Resort in South Carolina and Marriott's Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville. Among the independent hotels cited recently on TripAdvisor were the Boar's Head Resort in Charlottesville, Va., and Hawks Cay Resort in Duck Key, Fla.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if this becomes the center of a coronavirus outbreak,\" wrote one commenter on TripAdvisor after listing concerns about the cleanliness of the common areas and hotel rooms at the Boar's Head. (The general manager responded on the site, writing, \"I can assure you that the experience you had and may have witnessed is not standard, nor OK, especially now. I can assure you and others that our staff and our property have very strict protocols for the safety of our guests.\"\n\nThe issue of cleanliness aside, the pandemic has wreaked havoc with all sectors of the travel industry. According to a report issued last week by the U.S. Travel Association, a trade group, the pandemic, since the beginning of March, has resulted in more than $341 billion in cumulative losses for the travel industry in the United States. In a forecast released this month, STR, a lodging research company, and Tourism Economics, a forecasting and analysis firm, predicted \"full recovery in U.S. hotel demand and room revenue remains unlikely until 2023 and 2024, respectively.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-26T07:48:16.998Z The C.D.C. changes testing guidelines to exclude those exposed to virus who don't exhibit symptoms. The Trump administration ordered hospitals to report data to H.H.S. or risk losing funding. At the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump acknowledges the pandemic's human toll. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nBut cleanliness, or the lack thereof, is the primary factor for would-be travelers, according to a study to be released today by the American Hotel and Lodging Association. Surveying around 700 travelers who spent five or more nights in a hotel in 2019, the study aimed to uncover frequent travelers' sentiments about enhanced cleaning standards.\n\nWhen presented with eight factors that could determine their next hotel stay, the highest percentage of respondents -- 34 percent -- reported that cleanliness was the number one factor when choosing a hotel. Other factors included safety, price and location.\n\nHenry Harteveldt, the founder of Atmosphere Research Group, a San Francisco-based travel market research firm, also conducted a survey of 2,500 business and leisure travelers in the United States last month. Three-quarters of respondents said they were somewhat or very concerned about catching Covid-19. Of the approximately 1,060 respondents who had stayed at least once in a hotel in the previous year, over 80 percent said it was important that hotels exceed guidelines for cleaning guest rooms issued by the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The C.D.C. guidelines include, among other measures, the frequent use of E.P.A.-approved disinfectants on \"surfaces and objects touched by multiple people,\" as well as practicing social distancing and wearing masks.\n\nIf hotel owners fail to maintain cleanliness standards, Mr. Harteveldt said, \"guests may be fearful about what else could go wrong. This could affect their willingness to return to the hotel and their brand loyalty to the hotel group.\"\n\nAlthough hotel companies, including Marriott and others, have instituted these new cleanliness standards, in many instances they do not own or operate the hotels bearing their brand names. According to STR, 61 percent of the 56,300 hotels in the United States today are branded, while 39 percent are independent. Most branded hotels are independently owned and operated by third parties, who are responsible for maintaining a brand's cleanliness standards.\n\n\"Just because you walk into a hotel that has a brand name associated with it, that doesn't mean the brand has any direct management involvement with that property,\" said Mr. Harteveldt.\n\nNot surprisingly, cleanliness issues also pose problems for some hotel housekeepers.\n\nLydia Hernandez, who has worked as a housekeeper for 15 years at the Hilton Philadelphia at Penn's Landing, is a member of Unite Here, a hospitality workers' union in Canada and the United States. When the pandemic began, she only worked one day a week; more recently, she has been working five days a week, 8.5 hours each day. Ms. Hernandez said the hotel currently has between eight and 10 housekeepers working full-time; before the pandemic, she said there were 35.\n\nHer greatest concern now is the number of guest rooms she is assigned to clean daily. Before the pandemic, she cleaned all guest rooms every day, a process she said took half an hour per room. Now she only cleans a guest room when a guest checks out and must follow Hilton's new cleanliness standards. These include deep-cleaning 10 high-touch areas, decluttering paper amenities and placing a seal on the door of the guest room to indicate it has not been entered since it was cleaned.\n\nMany guests today, she said, are \"messier. They leave rooms to the point where it's a disaster. They drink, eat chips, throw these all over the floor, in the bathroom, bathtub. It's really bad.\"\n\nShe frequently cannot complete cleaning of the 14 guest rooms she is assigned daily because of the length of time each requires. It normally takes her between 40 to 60 minutes to clean a guest room today, more than an hour if it is especially dirty.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe Hilton Philadelphia at Penn's Landing is managed by Pyramid Hotel Group and owned by a local developer Daniel J. Keating, III. Alan Cagle, the general manager, called the hotel's commitment to the safety of team members and guests \"second to none,\" and noted that the hotel \"has maintained an open line of communication with housekeepers regarding their workload during the pandemic.\" He also said the hotel's standard practice now to clean guest rooms only when a guest checks out limits \"potential exposure and risk for our essential employees.\"\n\nDaily room cleaning was the norm before the pandemic; for sustainability and cost-cutting reasons, some brands permitted guests to opt out. The W.H.O. currently recommends suspending these opt-out programs, a step some hotel companies have taken in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nThe frequency of room cleaning is a topic of much debate in the industry: Last month the city of San Francisco's board of supervisors passed a \"healthy buildings\" ordinance that requires daily hotel room cleaning. Local hotel groups and the A.H.L.A. are suing, claiming the ordinance would \"create hardship for an industry that is already suffering.\"\n\nIn the new A.H.L.A. study, almost 90 percent of respondents said limiting in-room housekeeping to \"by request only\" would increase their comfort level, and almost 60 percent did not want daily housekeeping.\n\nIf hotel owners neglect new cleanliness standards, Mr. Harteveldt warned this could come back to haunt them in the age of social media.\n\n\"People can and do share all aspects of travel. To post images of dirty or inadequately cleaned rooms that others may see, with the risk that the images go viral, will create a much bigger problem for the hotel owner and brand in the long run than the cost of properly cleaning the rooms,\" he said.\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

The woman was just a little short of breath when Navarro-Mill\u00e1n first saw her; a day later, she deteriorated so rapidly that she was rushed to intensive care, put on a ventilator and hooked up to a dialysis machine for her failing kidneys. Navarro-Mill\u00e1n feared that she would die. (She survived after spending two months sedated on the breathing machine.) When Navarro-Mill\u00e1n saw another Covid-19 patient soon after -- a white man in his 60s already struggling to breathe -- her first thought was, Not again. Believing that the prevailing standard of care -- which, lacking drugs to directly fight the virus, consisted primarily of supportive measures like supplemental oxygen -- was insufficient, she resolved to try something different, a treatment that was heretical in some circles but that she thought could save his life.\n\nNavarro-Mill\u00e1n had unusual expertise for a hospitalist. Weill Cornell had asked her to move into that role when the pandemic hit, but she was a rheumatologist by training, a doctor whose specialty is autoimmune ailments in which the immune system, tasked with defending the self from invading pathogens, inexplicably turns on the body's own tissues. Now she drew on her experience to try to help this Covid-19 patient.\n\nShe suspected that the greatest danger here wasn't the coronavirus itself but an immune overreaction so severe that it could cause lungs to fill up with fluid and prompt organs to shut down, possibly killing the patient. Rheumatologists often describe this type of immune reaction as a \"cytokine storm\" or \"cytokine release syndrome.\" Cytokines are proteins released by cells in order to send messages to other cells -- signaling, for instance, that a viral invasion is underway. The number of different cytokines is large, perhaps exceeding 100, and each one calls for a specific response. To save her patient, Navarro-Mill\u00e1n decided that she would have to calm his immune system and prevent that storm from getting started.\n\nEarly in her career, Navarro-Mill\u00e1n worked at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where most of her patients had lupus, an autoimmune disease that can affect various parts of the body, including the kidneys, blood and even the brain. Its sufferers are especially prone to cytokine storms, which are often triggered by viral infections. What Navarro-Mill\u00e1n saw now in her Covid-19 patients wasn't, she thought, all that different from what she encountered in Alabama.\n\nA major lesson learned from her years there was that saving patients from cytokine storms often required doctors to intervene early, preferably long before the patients landed in the I.C.U., when it was frequently too late to bring the immune system to heel. So, the sooner she treated her Covid patient by tamping down his inflammatory response, she figured, the better. At the same time, she was leery of subduing his immune system for too long or too profoundly, because that might hobble his body's ability to fight the virus that was making him sick in the first place.\n\nAn array of drugs was available to her, ranging from antibodies that target specific pathways in the immune system to molecules that have a more widespread effect on the body. One, called tocilizumab, blocked the cytokine interleukin-6, but it remained in the body for up to a month -- too long, in her view. Steroids, which dampen the entire immune system, might open the door to other infections. (Hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug that has been promoted by President Trump for its supposed coronavirus-fighting potential, also happens to suppress the immune system. But because this effect, which is mild, comes only after months of daily use, it is unlikely to be suitable as a way to quell an immune firestorm started by an infection. The evidence so far suggests that it doesn't work as an antiviral remedy, either, and that it can cause severe side effects.)\n\nNavarro-Mill\u00e1n settled on anakinra, a drug originally developed to treat rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition. The drug targets a cytokine involved in fever called interleukin-1. As a biologic, anakinra mimics the body's own antibodies; unlike other biologics, however, it remains in the body for mere hours, not weeks. If her attempt at immune suppression here started to go awry -- if some other infection took hold -- it could be reversed quickly.\n\nAfter her patient provided his consent, Navarro-Mill\u00e1n gave him the anakinra. His improvement was rapid. When she had first seen him, he was wearing nasal tubes that dispensed oxygen; by the next morning, his condition had deteriorated, and he needed a rebreather mask to get more oxygen. He received his first anakinra injection that day; the morning after, his breathing became less labored and he no longer needed the mask. Nose tubes were sufficient. A little more than a week later, he went home.\n\nNavarro-Mill\u00e1n was not a lone pioneer in what she was doing. Horrified by the death toll among very ill patients, physicians around the world had already tried or were trying versions of her approach; as they battled the novel coronavirus, these doctors were trying to calm immune systems that they thought were out of control. Navarro-Mill\u00e1n thus belonged to a community of physicians who, eager to lower the mortality rates among their hospitalized Covid patients, were turning to still-unproven treatments directed at the immune system.\n\nThe idea of manipulating the immune system as a way to fight Covid-19 first arose last winter in China after physicians there observed that greater inflammation seemed to correlate with worse outcomes. In March, some Italian doctors turned to immune-modulating drugs as well, says Marco Gattorno, head of the Center for Autoinflammatory Diseases and Immunodeficiencies at the Giannina Gaslini Institute in Genoa. So many intubated patients were dying, he told me, that physicians felt they had to try something to lower mortality rates. \"They were rather desperate, because they realized that indeed it was a grave problem,\" he says, referring to his colleagues on the front lines. \"We were able to convince the people not to be too shy with glucocorticoids\" -- that is, steroids. And the death rate among I.C.U. patients at his hospital who received immune-modulating drugs seemed to decline.\n\nIt's probably no coincidence that those who have been most forcefully advocating to try Covid-19 therapies that rein in the immune system are often rheumatologists. Their specialty makes them quite familiar with the vagaries of the immune system and the drugs used to try to control it. But their willingness to use immune-modulating drugs in this pandemic without supporting evidence from robust studies is sometimes frowned upon by other specialists, many of whom worry about the consequences of deliberately weakening immune defenses while an infection is raging.\n\nThis proposed fix is something of a paradox. It posits that the best way to help some patients survive Covid-19 may not be to fortify the immune system, so that it can fight the virus with greater ferocity, but to subtly suppress the counterattack, so that the patient avoids self-destruction. The notion is controversial, not least because differentiating an appropriate immune response from a self-harming one can be difficult. An added wrinkle is the fact that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, may itself stifle aspects of the immune response, meaning that additional immune suppression could make things worse.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-11T13:30:05.963Z Russian vaccine works 'effectively enough,' President Putin said. But it hasn't completed Phase III tests. Virus cases have surpassed 20 million worldwide. Trump considers a rule that would block Americans thought to have the virus from returning home. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nEach new study further complicates the picture of what exactly is going wrong with the immune system in severe Covid-19 cases. But the evidence continues to mount indicating that something is going awry, immunologically speaking. And in the absence of a vaccine, figuring out the best way to correct this dysfunction may prove crucial to helping patients survive the disease. This might be the case even if a course of treatment includes antiviral medicines. In a recently published preliminary report involving remdesivir, for example, some Covid-19 patients who received that antiviral drug experienced accelerated recovery times -- remdesivir seemed to help, in other words. But the drug did not significantly lessen overall mortality rates. The very sick still died. One reason for this lack of improvement, according to Chaz Langelier, an infectious-disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, might be that the immune system, not the virus directly, is driving the disease in these instances. Helping those patients may require calming the immune system.\n\nWhile Langelier and other physicians recognize this enduring problem in medicine -- the fact that the immune system can do us in -- they still don't necessarily endorse the practice of giving immune-suppressing drugs to Covid-19 patients outside an actual trial. \"It's treading in dangerous territory to practice without evidence-based principles,\" Langelier told me in early May. \"I think it is just too early to know if that type of approach is really beneficial or it's just putting people at risk.\" Then he added, \"We're obligated to do no harm.\"\n\nRheumatologists don't entirely disagree. But a global pandemic is a unique situation, several told me. In some situations, \"letting disease kill the patient is also doing a kind of harm,\" says Randy Cron, a pediatric rheumatologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \"When people are dying in large numbers,\" he told me, \"we don't have the time frame to wait.\"\n\nThere is a natural tension between what physicians themselves sometimes describe as the art and the science of medicine. Medicine's bedrock, its science, consists of treatments and protocols that have been tested rigorously and proven to work (better than placebos do). But in daily practice, as they try to help patients, none of whom are the same, doctors sometimes move slightly beyond what has been proven, particularly when established practices prove ineffective or when it's unclear what really ails a patient. They may draw on personal experience or case studies in the medical literature. They might prescribe drugs off-label, or for uses other than what they were approved for, and, within certain bounds, fiddle with dosages. As Navarro-Mill\u00e1n put it to me, \"Nothing in medicine is fixed or precise, unlike other sciences.\"\n\nThe tension between the interpretive (or creative) and the conservative (or scientific), which is probably felt to some degree by every doctor, can escalate in times like the current moment. Doctors and scientists are facing a virus never seen before and are therefore figuring out how to treat it for the first time. Some doctors feel impelled to try new treatments in order to help their patients. But this may, as Langelier points out, end up in conflict with Hippocrates' injunction that physicians \"do no harm.\" And certainly, there have been episodes in which doctors took action in a way that they thought should work but turned out to cause harm. For example, once scientists got around to thoroughly studying hormone-replacement therapy for postmenopausal women, beginning in the 1990s -- a treatment that made sense in theory -- they discovered a major downside: It increased the risk of breast cancer, heart disease and other ailments among certain groups of women.\n\nThat doesn't mean that physicians' experiences are useless or don't warrant attention. A recent opinion piece in The Journal of the American Medical Association noted the current \"cacophony\" of observational studies and pointed out that even these so-called weak studies can help advance Covid-19 treatments as long as they lead to well-designed follow-up trials. Stronger studies can test the ideas generated by weak studies (though the authors warn against publishing those weak studies in medical journals, so as not to unduly influence care).\n\nIn the United States, physicians' efforts to suppress the immune system in Covid-19 patients have been uncoordinated. Institutions formulate their own approaches. As Covid-19 overwhelmed New York, doctors at Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, a borough hit hard by the virus, convened a task force to develop a plan of care focused on the immune system. Over the course of months at New York University Langone Medical Center, critical-care doctors slowly increased their use of steroids, according to Sam Parnia, director of critical-care and resuscitation research. The gradual embrace of steroids stemmed in part from observations that patients seemed to improve when treated with them, and then worsen when the drugs were withdrawn.\n\nOfficials at Temple University Hospital in Philadelphia early on established a protocol for Covid-19 patients centered on aggressive immunomodulation. Roberto Caricchio, the head of rheumatology there, told me that the hospital, which serves a high-risk, mostly African-American and Hispanic population, immediately began giving steroids in low doses to everyone who tested positive for Covid-19 and who needed oxygen. Depending on the levels of various inflammatory indicators, patients might then be given anakinra -- the short-acting drug that Navarro-Mill\u00e1n used -- or tocilizumab, the longer-lasting drug that blocks the cytokine interleukin-6.\n\nIn Southern California, Thomas Yadegar, medical director of the I.C.U. at Providence Cedars-Sinai Tarzana Medical Center, says he changed how he cared for Covid-19 patients after a number of them suddenly and inexplicably deteriorated and several died. Starting in April, as soon as the oxygen in their blood began dropping -- and before admission to the I.C.U. -- Covid-19 patients at his hospital began receiving sarilumab, then, later, tocilizumab. He told me that the number of patients needing intubation has since declined greatly. \"If you told me in January that you were coming into my I.C.U. to give immunomodulators, I would have called security and had you thrown out,\" he says.\n\nAt Weill Cornell, Navarro-Mill\u00e1n spent the April surge working with a team of internal-medicine doctors and rheumatologists, giving anakinra to Covid-19 patients who met certain criteria. (In June, she returned to rheumatology full time.) This summer, Navarro-Mill\u00e1n and her colleagues published a case series, or purely observational study, in the journal Arthritis Rheumatology. They detailed the outcomes for 11 of their hospitalized patients. Seven who were treated within 36 hours of the onset of symptoms -- defined as worsening shortness of breath that didn't improve with supplemental oxygen -- were able to avoid being put on ventilators and went home; four who were treated four or more days after symptoms began ended up on ventilators (one died). Although the study wasn't designed to generate firm conclusions -- among other shortcomings, it was tiny and contained no untreated comparison group -- giving anakinra to patients early in their care seemed to produce better results, as Navarro-Mill\u00e1n anticipated. She is now seeking F.D.A. approval for a stronger trial involving multiple hospitals and doctors to test anakinra on Covid-19.\n\nIt wasn't until late June that a controlled study produced strong evidence suggesting that what so many doctors were already trying might actually work. That's when University of Oxford scientists released data from the best designed and largest trial to date -- nearly 6,500 subjects took part -- that has explored an immune-suppressing therapy for Covid-19 patients. The Recovery trial, which has since been published as a preliminary report in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that moderate doses of the steroid dexamethasone cut deaths by one-third among patients on ventilators and by one-fifth among those receiving oxygen who weren't on the breathing machines. This was a marked improvement in survival rates, and reason for hope. The findings included an important caveat, though: Mildly ill patients didn't fare any better when given steroids. In fact, in this subgroup, there was a trend toward worse outcomes.\n\nOne possible explanation for these divergent results is that suppressing the immune system in mildly ill patients actually delays, rather than helps, their recovery. For those who are beating back the virus just fine on their own, the treatment might hinder that process. If this is what's happening, it would support a criticism I heard often from skeptics, who oppose using immune-suppressing drugs outside trials: Not only might treatments expected to help patients end up doing them no good -- they might do actual harm.\n\nOne such critic is Carolyn Calfee, a critical-care specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, who opposes targeting the immune system unless it is done in trial settings. But even she refers to the Recovery results as \"practice changing.\" In late July, she said, experts at U.C.S.F. were discussing how to incorporate the study findings into the hospital's Covid-19 protocol. Some questions remained, but \"this study has definitely changed my view,\" she told me. \"I think we have to take it very seriously.\" (Chaz Langelier, too, found it convincing.) N.Y.U. also included dexamethasone in its official treatment plan after the study's results came out, Sam Parnia says, as did the hospital at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, where Randy Cron had pushed for months to give immune-modulating drugs to Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe results of the Recovery trial have not displaced the discomfort Calfee and others feel about giving immune-suppressing drugs to Covid-19 patients in situations other than well-designed trials, however. Suppressing the immune system to help patients survive infections has been tried before, they point out. And it largely failed.\n\nEvery year, nearly 200,000 Americans develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, from the flu and other infections or from massive trauma -- car accidents, say, or burns. More than one-third of these patients die. Sepsis, a condition in which an overwhelming reaction to infection triggers blood-pressure loss and organ failure, contributes to 30 to 50 percent of all deaths in the hospital. (Other conditions that weaken the body, like cancer, can contribute to the development of sepsis in patients, meaning that sepsis may simply be the final diagnosis in a patient's long decline.) Even before Covid-19, lower-respiratory-tract infections were humankind's single greatest killer among communicable diseases, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nIf an overexuberant immune response is a major contributor to these conditions, as many suspect, then it's paramount to come up with methods to combat them by calming the immune system. That has proved to be easier said than done. \"In both sepsis and ARDS, we haven't made the strides we wish we could have,\" says Nuala Meyer, a critical-care physician and scientist at the University of Pennsylvania's medical school.\n\nAnd some of the immune-modulating drugs now being tried against Covid-19 have failed to help sepsis and ARDS patients in the past. Researchers have been \"trying for decades to find treatment without any success for ARDS,\" Calfee told me. Advances have been made in non-drug-based management of the condition. Ventilators now pump smaller \"breaths\" for their patients than in the past, because studies have indicated that larger breaths cause spikes in inflammation. And patients with more inflammation fared worse. But, Calfee says, \"there's been absolutely zero success in pharmacological therapy.\"\n\nToday's trials may have a better chance of succeeding, however, because scientists increasingly recognize that patients who appear to suffer from one affliction -- ARDS, say -- can be divided into smaller groups, defined by measurements of inflammation and other criteria. And some hope that these smaller, more clearly defined subsets of patients will benefit from treatments tailored to them. That's one takeaway from Calfee's own reanalysis of an old trial.\n\nIn 2018, she and an international team went back over data from a study originally conducted in the early 2010s that tested a statin, usually used to protect against heart disease, for ARDS. (Statins have anti-inflammatory properties.) The trial didn't show a benefit when first published, but after Calfee sorted the patients according to how much inflammation they experienced, she discovered that, in fact, those who suffered the worst -- 35 percent were in what she calls a \"hyperinflammatory\" state -- were less likely to die if they received treatment instead of a placebo. Patients not in this inflamed state, however, did not benefit from the treatment. \"Maybe there are actually patients within these groups responding,\" Calfee told me. \"But we can't see them because there's so much noise.\" Randy Cron and his colleagues reached a similar conclusion after re-examining an old trial testing anakinra on sepsis, which was also initially deemed a failure. They found a subgroup of subjects with features of macrophage activation syndrome -- a kind of cytokine storm that involves bleeding, clotting and liver dysfunction -- who did, in fact, seem to improve after being treated.\n\nRetrospective parsing of old studies can't definitively prove that something works. Only large, well-designed trials that follow patients after treatment can. But these reanalyses hint at the existence of smaller groups within the broader syndromes that may respond to drugs directed at the immune system. And it may be possible to further subdivide these groups according to how exactly their immune systems have become unbalanced -- too much of the cytokine IL-1 here, for example, or too much IL-6 there -- and then to correct the unique imbalances of individual patients with specific drugs. This approach, which remains somewhat theoretical, highlights a concept that's already a buzzword: \"precision medicine,\" the idea of tailoring care to the particular biology or unique dysfunction of a patient.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nFor Calfee, the likely existence of differing, narrower types of disease within what have largely been thought of as single syndromes underscores why study design is so important -- and why the dexamethasone treatment in the Recovery trial may have succeeded where previous trials testing steroids yielded contradictory findings. Earlier studies included ARDS or sepsis patients whose illness stemmed from a variety of causes. But the Recovery trial focused solely on Covid-19 patients. \"We see much clearer results,\" Calfee told me. The implication is that when scientists design trials, they should apply strict criteria in selecting study participants. \"It's possible that if we focus our trial on subsets of patients,\" she says, \"we may have a better chance of identifying effective therapies.\"\n\nMeyer, Calfee and Langelier hope that all the attention and energy now being brought to bear on the problem of immune overreaction, in response to coronavirus, will yield new remedies that work on lots of other medical conditions as well. Such treatments might not only save many thousands of ARDS and sepsis patients every year; they could serve us well during the next viral pandemic, which is also likely to be respiratory.\n\nThe original source of the novel coronavirus, thought to be horseshoe bats in China, may prove to be a source of therapeutic inspiration, too, when it comes to overcoming Covid-19. The only mammals that fly, bats are unusual in several ways. They live far longer than many other similarly sized mammals -- decades, in some cases, compared with years. And they host, without apparent symptoms, a variety of viruses that are lethal to humans. So some scientists are asking how it is that bats carry their viruses without succumbing -- and whether we can tweak the human immune system to make it more batlike.\n\nOne hypothesis follows from the animals' adaptations to flight. Flapping wings requires immense amounts of energy, causing bat cells to spew out large quantities of a metabolic byproduct called reactive oxygen species, which might be thought of as cellular exhaust. In other animals, that cellular waste, which bears some resemblance to a viral infection, might trigger overwhelming inflammation -- a cytokine storm. But bats have evolved ways to keep that inflammation in check.\n\nA consequence of such adaptation is that some viruses can establish long-term infections in their bodies. Yet to compensate for \"turning down\" one function of their immune system, bats have \"turned up\" another to prevent their bodies from being completely overrun by viral hangers-on. They produce unusual amounts of antiviral cytokines called interferons. In some species, even as one part of their immune system remains slow to rouse and relatively muted, another part, the front-line antiviral defenses, seems to engage readily and with force, tightly controlling viral infections.\n\nIt may be that fending off bat coronaviruses with batlike panache requires a strong initial antiviral response -- interferon -- followed by a cleanup crew, in essence, that works very softly, preventing a cytokine storm. Indeed, a few years ago, Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, and his colleagues found that mice infected with the coronavirus SARS-CoV (which also came from bats originally) survived the infection if they quickly generated a strong interferon response. Animals that failed to produce interferon early, however, died not because the virus killed them but because they produced so much interferon later that their overreactive immune systems did them in. \"If interferon comes up late, it causes really bad disease,\" Perlman told me. \"In most infectious diseases, the immune system is a major part of the problem.\"\n\nAn immunological disposition that resembles what bats have could explain why children are less vulnerable to severe Covid-19 disease than adults. Children, whose immune systems are immature and developing, have naturally high levels of interferons and other cytokines circulating in their bodies. \"Kids are just off the charts with inflammation -- without symptoms,\" says Paul Thomas, an immunologist at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. Crucially, too, they have high levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine called interleukin-10, which may play a role in preventing damage from the constant inflammation. This immune profile -- an elevated baseline level of interferons and IL-10 -- may be what helps children survive Covid-19. But it generally wanes as they reach early adulthood. (Nor are they invulnerable in the meantime: Some develop a multiorgan inflammatory condition from Covid-19 that resembles Kawasaki disease.)\n\nAdults experience less inflammation and, as they enter old age, have a harder time mounting that interferon response at all, a problem called immune senescence. This deficiency may be why older people get so much sicker from Covid-19, Thomas told me. Aging immune systems may find themselves playing catch-up, increasing the chances that they will overdo it later and damage the self. A pre-existing immune imbalance may also be why people afflicted with conditions that often feature low-level, chronic inflammation -- including heart disease, diabetes and obesity -- fare worse when battling Covid-19. These diseases may tip their immune systems toward overreaction.\n\nTantalizing, if still inconclusive, evidence has begun to emerge that giving interferons could help in managing Covid-19. In July, the British biotech company Synairgen reported that inhaled interferon-beta, which would probably lessen the side effects that can accompany the drug in its injected form, greatly reduced severe illness in a small trial. (The company has yet to publish the actual data from the trial, as it plans to do, so its claims should be viewed with skepticism.) Recently, scientists in Hubei Province in China conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who were given antiviral medication plus an inhaled interferon, called IFN-alpha2b. They found that the interferon improved outcomes in a subset of patients. As seemed to be the case in Perlman's studies with mice, timing mattered. Those who took the interferon earlier saw the most benefit compared with those who didn't take it, while those who took it later seemed to fare worse.\n\nThese interferons are not acting as an immune suppressant, of course, but as a kind of immune stimulant. Still, they might pre-empt an excessive immune response by helping to bring a virus under control at the start of an infection, so that there is no reason to overreact later. Clearly this is the optimal outcome: Once an immune response to a pathogen has served its purpose, it shuts down to prevent damage and allow the organism to resume its normal functioning.\n\nJanelle Ayres, a physiologist specializing in infectious diseases at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, describes this concept as a \"disease tolerance mechanism\" -- the ability, sometimes hard-wired, sometimes induced by environmental factors, to survive infections without falling ill. \"Our traditional view has been: To survive an infection, you have to kill it,\" she told me. \"We have a very disease-centric approach to biology.\" But infection doesn't always equate to disease. Many of the most frightening pathogens -- tuberculosis, cholera, polio and now the coronavirus -- don't cause illness in everyone they infect. Some people experience these infections with few if any symptoms. Their immune systems evidently handle the invasion with the perfect balance of aggression, restraint and repair -- or tolerance -- to stave off disease. The drugs of the future, Ayres hopes, will enable these native tolerance mechanisms that help some shrug off, with few ill effects, the diseases that sicken and kill others.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic has already prompted many physicians to bend in this direction. So few tools exist to reliably eliminate the virus from our bodies that they have, out of necessity, turned to the idea of prodding the immune system in various ways. They have shifted their focus in a manner that Ayres has long argued is necessary: from eradicating the pathogen to helping the patient survive the pathogen. They are, in a way, pinning their hopes on innate tolerance mechanisms.\n\nDozens of trials are currently underway that focus on the immune system. These involve everything from cheap, over-the-counter pain medication to expensive antibodies manufactured in living cells. The drugs they are testing include anakinra, used by Navarro-Mill\u00e1n; leronlimab, a drug with anti-inflammatory properties originally developed to treat H.I.V.; and drugs that block IL-6 (full disclosure: My wife works for Genentech, owned by Roche, which manufactures tocilizumab, one of the IL-6 blockers). One study in Britain is testing high doses of a stomach-friendly formulation of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory ibuprofen, better known in the United States as Advil. (Don't try this at home.) Researchers are even looking into low-dose X-ray radiation as a way to calm the immune system, a method that was used in the early 20th century to treat pneumonia but has since fallen out of use.\n\nThere's an intriguing trial on an old drug originally developed to treat gout, a painful inflammatory condition of the joints, called colchicine. The drug, which was recently shown to offer protection against heart attacks, targets the very pathway -- called NLRP3 inflammasome -- that some scientists believe is naturally dampened in bats. Unlike biologics, which are given intravenously, colchicine can be taken in pill form. And while biologics can cost hundreds of dollars per dose, colchicine is dirt cheap. \"We think that in the setting of this viral infection, NLRP3 gets activated aberrantly,\" says Priscilla Hsue, a professor of medicine at U.C.S.F. and one of the physicians overseeing the trials. \"And that leads to downstream badness.\" The drug, it's hoped, will prevent the immune system from ever getting to the point where it becomes overly activated. The study aims to start treatment early by sending pills to the homes of patients who have tested positive for Covid-19. \"The thought is, If we can intervene early with an anti-inflammatory agent, we can have an impact on slowing down progression and keeping patients off ventilators,\" Hsue says.\n\nIt remains to be seen which, if any, drug will work best, and what might be the unforeseen consequences of suppressing the immune system in the midst of its battle with the coronavirus. Some trials are already showing failures. Despite promising results from early, weak studies, two of the strongest trials to date on the IL-6 blockers tocilizumab and sarilumab suggest no benefit. (The pharmaceutical companies running the studies, Roche and Regeneron, are continuing with other trials testing their IL-6 blockers.)\n\nOr maybe the studies would have produced better results had they been designed differently. Thomas Yadegar, who thinks tocilizumab can be a lifesaver, if used in the right way, surmises that one study didn't employ stringent-enough criteria for choosing its study patients. Navarro-Mill\u00e1n thinks the trials tried to treat patients too late in the course of the disease. She likened these efforts to trying to cure Stage 4 metastatic cancer -- probably doomed from the start.\n\nOther researchers also raise this issue of timing -- when doctors should administer drugs to curb immune responses -- in a more general sense. Suppressing the immune system too soon after infection could be counterproductive because it might squelch the initial antiviral response and allow the coronavirus to proliferate, says Dawn Wahezi, a pediatric rheumatologist at Children's Hospital at Montefiore. Yet treating too late may make it impossible to quell the eventual immune overreaction. \"Knowing when is the right time -- I think that's one of the key components,\" Wahezi told me. \"There's a very delicate window where immunomodulators can help.\"\n\nThe debate over study design parallels another disagreement, this one over the very term \"cytokine storm.\" Several non-rheumatologists told me that they found the phrase, which has been widely used to describe the immune overreaction that is suspected of taking place in severe Covid-19 cases, maddeningly imprecise and unhelpful. Their frustration partly comes from the fact that the term encompasses an array of syndromes with different causes, including trauma, burns, infections, cancer, genetic disorders, autoimmune diseases and more.\n\nAdrienne Randolph, a professor of anesthesia and pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, told me that doctors and scientists who use the term \"need to be specific about what they are defining as cytokine-storm syndrome, at what level.\" She went on to say: \"All of these patients have cytokines that are elevated, but what cytokines are you following, and for what? And which cytokines are most predictive?\" That specificity is important, she and others argue, because it could dictate the pathways physicians will target and the drugs they'll use.\n\nThis complaint about terminology extends to the question of what levels of inflammation really qualify as a \"storm.\" Cytokine levels reported in many Covid-19 patients have been far below -- sometimes by orders of magnitude -- those seen in other conditions that prompt a strong inflammatory response, like ARDS. For these and other reasons, Calfee and Meyer have preferred to regard Covid-19 as a variation on the ARDS they see every flu season -- one that can, if it progresses too far, kill people -- rather than as the sort of systemic meltdown that can occur in sepsis patients.\n\nAs I spoke with doctors about these and other disagreements, it became clear that some of the differences in the willingness to use drugs off-label to modulate patients' immune systems, as well as embrace the term \"cytokine storm\" more generally, derive in part from an immersion in distinct scientific literatures. Intensivists and critical-care doctors, among others, operate in a discipline -- and are familiar with that medical literature -- in which treating the immune system has been tried for ARDS and sepsis and for the most part didn't work. But rheumatologists know another literature in which targeting the immune system seems to succeed. These are not always huge, robust studies. Individually, autoimmune diseases are relatively rare, which makes it hard to conduct large trials with hundreds of patients to study a given drug in, for example, the sliver of lupus patients who develop cytokine storms. The best available evidence sometimes comes from case series. As Navarro-Mill\u00e1n points out, anakinra is not F.D.A.-approved for treating cytokine storms. Even so, she and Cron and other rheumatologists consider its use standard care.\n\nEveryone's immune system is different; how a given disease affects an individual patient can vary greatly. As a result, Navarro-Mill\u00e1n told me, she's always dealing with her patients' idiosyncrasies, always tinkering, always adjusting, always experimenting to some degree. Uncertainty, in other words, doesn't stop her from trying to help her patients. \"We still treat it to the best of our knowledge and with the best evidence we have at hand,\" she says. \"We have done this for years with some successes and some failures.\" Why, she asks, shouldn't she take the same approach with sick Covid-19 patients?",

        "body": "Curators of the new Makeup Museum had to completely rethink their first exhibition.\n\nNew York's first Makeup Museum, an immersive, interactive concept focusing on touch and experimentation, was slated to open in May. Its premiere exhibition, \"Pink Jungle: 1950s Makeup in America,\" would encourage visitors to take part in experiences like mixing their own makeup or indulging in facials modeled on the ones given to Marilyn Monroe and Greta Garbo. Artifacts of that halcyon era, like elaborate compacts or rhinestone-studded lipstick cases, would be available for handling.\n\nThen the pandemic hit.\n\nAll museums closed, of course, and have only recently started to reopen, with many new restrictions. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, for example, which reopened in late August, only takes timed tickets or reservations and requires masks and temperature checks. An interactive makeup museum, however, devoted to the idea of applying products to one's face, seemed like another challenge to figure out altogether.\n\nBut on Tuesday, the Makeup Museum finally opened to the public after a complete rethink of the place. Sampling colors and handling objects were replaced with social distancing rules, enhanced technology and mask requirements. In addition to the usual creative demands of mounting an exhibit, the curators faced \"so much uncertainty, so many more logistical challenges,\" said Doreen Bloch, a museum co-founder.\n\nThe presentation of \"Pink Jungle\" was completely overhauled. Gone were any tactile elements that could not be immediately sanitized and the prop-heavy, Instagram-worthy photo stations that have become the hallmark of other new interactive museums like the Museum of Ice Cream and the KGB Espionage Museum. The \"Mix Lab,\" an interactive station where guests could create their own take-home beauty elixirs, was scrapped and the exhibition is now \"an entirely touchless experience,\" Ms. Bloch said\n\nThe thrust and look of the show, which focuses on the influence of the post-World War II era, with its red lips and signature cat eyes, remains the same. \"The innovation of the 1950s really set the course for where makeup is today,\" Ms. Bloch said.\n\nBut curators also realized, partly because of the Black Lives Matter protests this summer, that they needed to highlight the \"tension,\" Ms. Block explained, between nostalgia for a glamorous era and the reality that it was \"very Eurocentric, very white-centric, very heteronormative.\"\n\nAs such, the museum is displaying vintage copies of Jet magazine, which spoke specifically to Black women, but offered problematic advertisements for skin-lightening creams and other products that centered on the beauty ideal of whiteness. A copy of a 1954 book called Femme Mimics: A Pictorial Record of Female Impersonation, offers a rare inside look at drag in an era when just wearing the clothing of the opposite sex was often still illegal.\n\nRegarding other objects in the exhibition, like eyeliner tools, hair dryers, and lipstick cases that show the evolution of packaging and equipment, curators met via FaceTime this summer to discuss how to reconfigure socially distanced display cases, wall mountings and demonstration tables. Touch screens to guide visitors through the show were replaced with an interactive phone app, which is also a way to visit the museum remotely.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nMs. Bloch said that not opening the Makeup Museum was never an option. \"Everyone was so unanimous that the community wants and needs this,\" she said. \"So many people have been just so face-to-face with technology every day, that there is this craving for just being in that holy space that is a museum.\"\n\nAnd even though the museum is leaning heavily on technology to ensure a safe visit, it still offers an \"analog\" world, Ms. Bloch said.\n\n\"Museums just have an ability to hone our attention and allow us to focus on items or stories that matter and tell history in a really profound way,\" she continued. \"That's never been done before for beauty.\"\n\nThe Makeup Museum is at 94 Gansevoort Street in Manhattan's Meatpacking District.

        "body": "In March, the photographer Brenda Ann Kenneally was visiting Troy, N.Y., when the coronavirus pandemic hit the East Coast. She grew up in the area, bouncing among friends and group homes after her mother kicked her out when she was 12. Kenneally has spent decades immersed in the intimate lives of a group of upstate families who share her legacy, using images to explore the way economic forces ravage people's lives for generations. \"I knew every single layer of disadvantage they lived on a daily basis would be exacerbated by Covid,\" she says.\n\nAs April unfolded, Kenneally checked on friends in crowded apartments and shelters in and around Troy, and for weeks she was the only person wearing a mask. Stressors were so common -- evictions, unemployment, isolation -- that Covid-19 hadn't yet struck many of them as particularly significant. But as jobs continued to disappear in New York and around the country, Kenneally knew that millions of Americans were now being thrown into the kind of precarity that the people she knew had long endured. \"It was the moment to connect the root causes of all the things that people could be shamed for with what you see in front of the camera,\" she says. \"The situations that define a life of scarcity were becoming democratized.\"\n\nShe returned to Queens, where she lives, packed up her pull camper and enlisted Rafael Gonzalez, the father of her 26-year-old son, beginning what would become a 92-day trip across the country documenting food insecurity. She and Gonzalez met as homeless teenagers working for a carnival, so they knew the road.\n\nHunger Embed AMERICA AT HUNGER'S EDGE See all the photographs Brenda Ann Kenneally for The New York Times\n\nThe highways were quiet as they headed north. They visited Salvation Armys and food pantries in Canandaigua, Utica and Buffalo. Kenneally knocked on car windows and walked the lines. Every postindustrial town and city they passed through looked abandoned. \"You couldn't tell if they had been closed down because of globalization three decades ago or Covid,\" she says.\n\nThey made a brief return to Troy before heading west. On Mother's Day, Kenneally joined the Stocklas family for a meal. Family members had pooled their benefits from SNAP (the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- food stamps) to buy the food. \"I've been watching the Stocklases struggle to put dinner on the table for 15 years,\" Kenneally says. Kenneally's mother was aided by food stamps after her father left, and she used federal food benefits, too, especially when raising her own son as a single mother.\n\nThen Kenneally and Gonzalez left for Pennsylvania. From there to Gary, Ind., to Chicago, charities and nonprofits were adjusting to new safety protocols to deliver food. The Salvation Army has more than 7,600 centers of operation, and many waived eligibility requirements. Food banks distribute to local pantries, which in turn get groceries directly to people or to organizations that serve hot meals. Volunteers -- many of them senior citizens -- were now at risk, so staff was scrambling to find help while converting to curbside pickup. In Parma, Ohio, the school district, like so many across the country, had essentially become its own food bank. In Memphis, a woman became a distribution point for her condominium complex, giving away boxed lunches that she retrieved from her niece's school.\n\nPrecarity wasn't new to Kenneally, but what was striking now was the astonishing scale. Lines at food banks stretched to hundreds of cars, some carrying people who had never sought food assistance before. In Houston, Catholic Charities was providing food to as many as 2,000 people every six hours. The Mamie George Community Center there gave out 567,000 pounds of food in 2019; between March 18, 2020, and July 6, when Kenneally arrived, the M.G.C.C. had already distributed 528,437 pounds.\n\nAt a time when the heat and the fear were rising, when Americans were urged to keep distance from loved ones, when protesters -- outdoors -- were risking their safety, strangers let Kenneally and Gonzalez, wearing masks, into their homes and kitchens to watch them prepare their food and eat. \"They understood that telling their food-struggle story now and even pre-Covid was important,\" Kenneally says. She moved in close, photographing this ordinary intimacy under extraordinary circumstances. \"I want you to feel like you are there, to go in there, to be vulnerable and to honor the fact that these people are making themselves vulnerable.\"\n\nIn 1936, Dorothea Lange took what would become a world-famous photograph of 32-year-old Florence Owens Thompson, in Nipomo, Calif. It was early March, and Lange was speeding home to Berkeley, where she lived. She glimpsed a handwritten sign that read \"Pea-Pickers Camp,\" but at first she drove right past it.\n\nShe had spent that bitter cold February following migrant workers who had fled the Dust Bowl and were following crops. Many were starving. By 1936, thousands were flooding into California every month, and police officers were stationed at the state's borders to turn back anyone deemed a \"transient.\" Lange was taking photographs for the Resettlement Administration, a New Deal agency that would soon change its name to the Farm Security Administration, which relocated poor urban and rural people into government-planned communities. The government's goal was to educate voters who hadn't been so hard hit by the Great Depression and didn't know much about the degrees of suffering in their midst.\n\nAfter Lange passed the pea-pickers sign, she drove for another 20 miles, wanting to believe, she later wrote in an article, that she already had enough evidence of hardship, but she had an argument with herself: \"Dorothea, how about that camp back there? ... Nobody could ask this of you, now could they? ... To turn back certainly is not necessary. Isn't this just one more of the same?\" She turned back to see for herself.\n\nShe found Thompson and three of her children huddled under a tattered, dirty tent. \"She said that they had been living on frozen vegetables from the surrounding fields, and birds that the children killed,\" Lange wrote. \"She seemed to know that my pictures might help her, and so she helped me.\"\n\nLange's photographs of Thompson ran in The San Francisco News shortly afterward. The public reaction to the image of an attractive mother and her daughters was immediate: letters of concern, calls to action, donations. The government assembled 20,000 pounds of emergency food, but by the time it was shipped to that particular migrant camp, the woman had already packed up her seven hungry children and pressed on. The image, which eventually came to be titled \"Migrant Mother,\" circulated widely and increased popular support for the New Deal programs that evolved into what remains of our social safety net today. Until 1978, her name -- and that she was of Cherokee descent -- remained unknown.\n\nOur treatment of hunger as an emergency, rather than a symptom of systemic inequities, has long informed our response to it, and as a result, government programs have been designed to alleviate each peak rather than to address the factors that produce them. \"Hunger becoming public is the start of a struggle, but it's only the beginning of what's required for change,\" says Laurie B. Green, an associate professor of history at the University of Texas at Austin, whose research looks at the moment in the 1960s when public health commissions, politicians and the media \"discovered\" hunger.\n\nThe severing of hunger from its socioeconomic context minimized the relationship between the restructuring of land, labor and industrial farming and its effect on diets and access to healthful food. Federal surplus-commodity programs grew out of the Great Depression, providing hungry people with leftover staples like flour, rice and lard. But their priority was to subsidize white farmers; the starchy diet did little to alleviate malnutrition. In the early 1960s, some areas began to offer food stamps instead. But because the coupons needed to be purchased every month, and values were set by local counties, they were inaccessible to the poorest -- especially Southern Black residents -- who were now unable to get any food at all. Activists like Fannie Lou Hamer organized against the program. The purchase requirement remained in place until 1977.\n\nThe first food bank opened in 1967. That December, Look magazine published photographs by Al Clayton, part of an expos\u00e9 about a destitute family living in a windowless shack on no more than \"coffee, flour and an inch of rice in a cellophane bag.\" The next year, a CBS documentary, \"Hunger in America,\" featured a baby in an American hospital crib dying of starvation onscreen. Public pressure led to legislation that improved access to food stamps and created the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC) in 1972.\n\nBut those programs weren't designed to eliminate need. WIC limits the age of child recipients; SNAP meets roughly two-thirds of a household's food needs, and recipients run out of food by the end of the month. \"Our whole safety net is based on the premise that all able-bodied adults can get a job, and every kind of assistance is temporary,\" says the Princeton sociologist Kathryn Edin.\n\nIn the 1980s, in response to cuts to food benefits during the Reagan administration, hunger was discovered again with commissions and reports. The underlying problem was bound up with the increasingly punishing nature of the American economy, especially for people of color. Food banks were supposed to fill in the gaps. But today more than 37 million Americans are food insecure, according to the U.S.D.A. \"We call it an emergency food system, but it's a 50-year emergency,\" says Noreen Springstead, executive director of WhyHunger, which supports grass-roots organizations that approach food insecurity systemically.\n\nFood insecurity no longer looks like a skinny mother in a tent or children with rickets and kwashiorkor; it looks like fast food at the end of the month when SNAP runs out, or rural \"food deserts,\" where few food banks reach. Its legacy is diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.\n\nThe pandemic has revealed the fragility of a highly centralized industrial food system and has given us a glimpse of the tenuous lives of the workers who farm, process, deliver and ring up the food we need. It also has shown, as Springstead points out, just \"how close people are to the edge of the abyss. They can't keep their apartment and can't pay for their groceries; they are one paycheck away from, 'What am I going to do?'\"\n\nPrograms created to help the poorest Americans now supplement the working poor. More than half of all SNAP recipients work. The pandemic has heightened food insecurity. The Salvation Army reported an 84 percent increase since last year in the number of boxes handed out at their drive-through pantries. Meals on Wheels has seen a 47 percent increase in the number of people it serves. In addition to federal subsidies, food banks rely on private donations, which historically decline during economic downturns. Corporate donors are selling more of the food they would ordinarily donate because it's no longer expiring on the shelves.\n\nEven before the pandemic, food insecurity was entangled with unaffordable housing, health care costs, unreliable transportation. In Troy, before she traveled across the country, Kenneally met with her friend Barbara Broomall. Three days before the eviction moratorium, federal marshals put Broomall, her three children and their belongings on the street. With the pandemic lockdown, it became clear that her only option was a room in the Schuyler Inn, a homeless shelter that was once a hotel. Broomall and her son both received S.S.I. for mental health issues, and the $1,457 rent ate up the checks. She had no car to reach her children's schools to collect the food they were distributing, though before the school kitchens were up and running, they were offering only snacks -- Ritz crackers, chips, granola bars -- so it wasn't worth bus fare. The Schuyler Inn didn't provide Wi-Fi, so her daughter tried to connect to her schoolwork in a Burger King parking lot.\n\nIf they go on for too long, temporary solutions become permanent. Food banks become bureaucracies; hotels meant to hold the overflow of shelters, like the Schuyler Inn, become homes. Public schools, which have never reconciled their hours with the actual schedules of working people, become essential hubs for entire communities.\n\nOn July 16, toward the end of her travels, Kenneally pulled up to the fields of Hatch, N.M. Teodula Portillo, 47, had been up since 4 a.m. She had allowed her teenage sons 20 more minutes to sleep and didn't wake her 11-year-old twin daughters because they cannot work legally until they are 12. By 5:30 a.m., Portillo and her boys were bent over picking onions, for which they are paid by the bushel. Employers are required to pay minimum wage only for certain tasks that are part of agricultural work. Portillo receives SNAP intermittently -- if she earns too much, they are not eligible. Kenneally knelt on the dirt and began shooting, some 900 miles from Nipomo, where Lange took her iconic photograph, which helped Americans discover the hunger that both she and Kenneally knew too much about. The attachment to this discovering is as persistent as the underlying social problems -- which to this day remain ignored.\n\nAdrian Nicole LeBlanc, an independent journalist and MacArthur fellow, was embedded in an assisted-living facility as Kenneally began her trip for this issue. They have worked together since 2003. Brenda Ann Kenneally is a multimedia journalist who, over 30 years, has produced participatory media projects with families from her home community, including \"Upstate Girls: Unraveling Collar City.\" She is currently assembling a multimedia autobiography, charting her experience from being a disenfranchised youth to becoming a Guggenheim fellow and frequent contributor to the magazine.\n\nHunger Embed AMERICA AT HUNGER'S EDGE See all the photographs Brenda Ann Kenneally for The New York Times",

        "body": "One-third of passengers aboard a bus were infected by a fellow passenger, scientists reported.\n\nIn late January, as the new coronavirus was beginning to spread from China's Hubei Province, a group of lay Buddhists traveled by bus to a temple ceremony in the city of Ningbo -- hundreds of miles from Wuhan, center of the epidemic.\n\nIt was a sunny day with a gentle breeze, and the morning service was held al fresco, followed by a brief luncheon indoors.\n\nA passenger on one of the buses had recently dined with friends from Hubei. She apparently did not know she carried the coronavirus. Within days, 24 fellow passengers on her bus were also found to be infected.\n\nIt did not matter how far a passenger sat from the infected individual on the bus, according to a study published in JAMA Internal Medicine on Tuesday. Even passengers in the very last row of the bus, seven rows behind the infected woman, caught the virus.\n\nThe only factor that may have mitigated the risk of infection was sitting near a window that could be opened, or near the door.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-01T19:27:41.843Z Children of color are infected and hospitalized at higher rates than white children, new research shows. Florida severs ties with Quest for taking too long to report 75,000 test results, DeSantis says. Across the globe, students are returning to the classroom. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe incident adds to a large body of evidence indicating that the coronavirus can be transmitted by tiny particles that linger in the air, and not just through large respiratory droplets that fall quickly to the ground.\n\nThe World Health Organization acknowledged the virus may be airborne in July and that these particles may seed superspreader events in closed spaces like restaurants and workplaces.\n\nThe new study \"adds strong epidemiological evidence that the virus is transmitted through the air, because if it were not, we would only see cases close to the index patient -- but we see it spread throughout the bus,\" said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech and a leading expert on airborne viruses.\n\nThe two buses carrying passengers to the event had cooling units that were recirculating air inside the vehicles. \"That would facilitate the virus in the air and spread it around the bus,\" Dr. Marr said. None of the 60 passengers on the second bus was infected.\n\nDr. Muge Cevik, an expert on infectious diseases and virology at the University of St. Andrews School of Medicine in Scotland, said that the outbreak was likely caused by a combination of factors: a long trip, a confined environment, a crowded bus and an individual who was probably extremely contagious because she was in the early stages of the infection.\n\n\"There isn't really a dichotomy between aerosol and droplet transmission,\" Dr. Cevik said. \"There have to be multiple things happening at the same time for this type of high risk transmission to occur. This was the wrong place, the wrong time, the wrong person.\"\n\nThe study's authors, who are physicians with the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, concluded that \"future efforts at prevention and control should consider the potential for airborne spread of Covid-19.\" The study was published previously online as a preprint.\n\nThe outing to the Buddhist temple was what scientists refer to as a natural experiment. It took place on Jan. 19, when there were still no confirmed Covid-19 cases reported in Ningbo. The circumstances conveniently allowed for a comparison between similar passengers on two different buses.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus.

In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nSome 300 people attended the temple ceremony, but only 128 made the 50-minute trip by bus. One bus carried 68 passengers, including the individual who was infected, while the second bus carried 60 people. None of the worshipers wore masks.\n\nThe paper in JAMA Internal Medicine does not describe the infected individual and says the person did not have symptoms until the after returning from the temple. But a version of the study published in China says the individual was a 64-year-old woman and that she developed symptoms on Jan. 18, a day after dining with guests from Hubei and a day before going to the temple. She took medicine but did not see a doctor.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\n\"The Chinese paper says the index case was unwell the day before going to the temple, so she was probably very infectious, because we know that viral load is really high around the time of symptom onset,\" Dr. Cevik said.\n\nThe outdoor ceremony lasted two and a half hours and was followed by a brief lunch, which took place in a spacious room that did not have recirculating air-conditioning. When the passengers returned to their buses, they took the same seats they had occupied earlier.\n\nIn addition to the passengers who became infected, another seven individuals who attended the ceremony were infected. They did not travel by bus, but said they had been in close contact with the infected passenger.\n\nThe potential for airborne transmission in close confined spaces raises concern about the winter months, when people will be spending more time indoors, Dr. Marr said.\n\nHer advice: \"Avoid crowded indoor spaces where people are not wearing masks and the ventilation is poor.\"",

        "body": "The pandemic has made some children more worried about leaving the sides of parents and caregivers. Experts shared strategies to help soothe them.\n\nFor Greg Clapp, it felt like a switch had flipped. Six weeks ago, Clapp's son, Nolan, went from being a content, even-keeled soon-to-be 2-year-old to a toddling ball of nerves -- almost overnight.\n\nDuring routine family walks around the neighborhood, Nolan, usually perfectly happy around new people, started running to his parents, whimpering to be picked up and held whenever a stranger passed. At bedtime, Nolan started attaching himself to the nearest parent, shrieking if his mother or father left the room even for a few minutes, and wailing as he was put him down for bed.\n\nSince then, the anxiety hasn't let up, leaving Clapp and his wife scrambling to find ways to help their son cope when they step away.\n\n\"We're just trying to let him know that when he's in our house, it's a safe place whether Mom and Dad are there or not,\" said Clapp, a stay-at-home father based just outside of Milwaukee. \"We're always there for him if he needs us.\"\n\nSeparation anxiety is normal and happens as children begin to differentiate between things that are safe and familiar and things that are new and different. Classic symptoms include clinginess when a parent or caregiver is present, and crying or short tantrums right after the person leaves the room or home.\n\nFor most kids, separation anxiety sets in between 8 and 12 months of age and fizzles out around age 3. But for kids who have a condition called separation anxiety disorder, which affects between 3 and 5 percent of children, those meltdowns can persist into elementary school and even after. They may escalate over time and include physical symptoms such as headaches, stomach aches or bowel problems.\n\nThe current pandemic has added an extra layer of stress and disruption. Symptoms might increase, especially in households where one or more parents are essential workers who are now home less often, and strategies for dealing with separation anxiety episodes may be harder to execute.\n\nResearch shows that there is a right and a wrong way to handle separation anxiety episodes, and there are distinct signs that indicate when parents should seek medical help.\n\nDetermine if the anxiety is a normal reaction\n\nAnxiety often has a negative connotation, but it's a crucial protective mechanism that children begin to develop during their first year of life, said Karin L. Price, Ph.D., the chief of Psychology Services at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston.\n\nHealthy anxiety warns us when danger might be ahead, and for babies and toddlers, separation anxiety marks a developmental milestone as children begin recognizing that loved ones offer the most safety and protection. \"It's evidence of secure attachment to caregivers or to parents,\" Dr. Price said. When children 12- to 18-months-old don't show any distress when separated from loved ones, \"that's when we're actually more concerned.\"\n\nShort, manageable meltdowns that happen right after day care drop-off, at bedtime, or when a parent leaves the room are normal and generally self-limiting, Dr. Price added. Those episodes can also happen during periods of transition, such as after moving into a new home or starting a new school. They typically last only a few minutes and go away entirely after the child has had a few weeks to adjust to the new routine.\n\nBut meltdowns that drag on, persist month after month, or escalate to the point of interfering with the child's ability to do age-appropriate activities could be signs of a more complex problem, said Eli R. Lebowitz, Ph.D., director of the Program for Anxiety Disorders at the Yale Child Study Center.\n\nSeparation anxiety disorder is the most common anxiety disorder in children ages 12 and younger, and symptoms can emerge as early as age 2. The causes aren't entirely clear. Genetics play a role -- if one or both parents have an anxiety disorder of any kind, their children are more likely to have separation anxiety disorder. The disorder can also be triggered in the wake of a stressful life event, like the death of a loved one, Dr. Lebowitz said.\n\nAs the coronavirus isolates families and disrupts daily schedules, it's not always easy to know if a child's anxiety is the result of quarantine and will disappear once life gets back to some version of normal, or if it's a symptom of separation anxiety disorder.\n\nErin Siraguse, a mother of three in Burke, Va., is searching for answers for her 5-year-old son, Beckett. Last summer, after the family's beloved nanny moved away, Beckett became clingy and started crying whenever Siraguse left the room.\n\nSiragues gave birth to her third child in December. Then the pandemic hit, eviscerating daily routines and social activities. Beckett's episodes worsened. Instead of just crying, Beckett screams, throws himself on the floor, and can't calm down unless he's held and rocked. \"I've never seen anxiety like his before,\" Siragudes said. Beckett is being evaluated for anxiety disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\nParents who are concerned that their child may be showing signs of separation anxiety disorder should see a therapist who specializes in treating pediatric anxiety as early as possible, Dr. Lebowitz said. If left untreated, anxiety disorders increase the risk of other mental health conditions such as depression. Treatment generally involves using cognitive behavioral therapy to help kids learn to manage symptoms plus training to help parents manage tantrums.\n\nDe-escalate meltdowns and prevent future ones\n\nThere are also evidence-based strategies that all parents can use to try to prevent or de-escalate meltdowns that come from separation anxiety. When children are calm enough to listen, validate their feelings by acknowledging that you understand why the situation makes them feel scared, and encourage them to practice being brave and trying an activity on their own. This strategy takes time and patience, but it's more effective in the long term than giving in and trying to stay within children's eyesight or allowing them to avoid situations involving separation, said Golda Ginsburg, Ph.D., professor of psychiatry at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine.\n\n\"If you are always rescuing your child from anxiety-provoking situations, they never learn that they can master the situation on their own,\" Dr. Ginsburg said. Parents can also inadvertently make separation anxiety worse by prolonging goodbyes and paying attention to tantrums, and forgetting to reward quiet acts of bravery, like playing alone or going to bed without fuss.\n\nFinding opportunities for children to exercise their \"brave muscles\" and safely practice being away from their parents is especially tough in quarantine, said Paula Yanes-Lukin, Ph.D., director of psychology in the Children's Day Unit at the Youth Treatment and Evaluation of Anxiety and Mood Program at Columbia University. If you suspect that your child might struggle with an upcoming event, like starting remote learning, returning to preschool or an overnight visit with family, practicing the routine a few days before can help your child prepare.\n\nYou can also teach your kids strategies they can use in situations that make them anxious, Dr. Yanes-Lukin added. One way is by giving them a transitional object -- something small and personal that reminds your child of home -- that they can keep in their pocket or cubby and retrieve when they need to feel a connection to loved ones.\n\nKids aren't the only ones with tension. Anxious parents can exacerbate their children's anxiety, so take steps to relieve your own stress, too. Sean Leacy, a father of four in Tacoma, Wash., takes a holistic approach to managing anxiety in his house. Two of Leacy's children exhibit separation anxiety symptoms and have been diagnosed with sensory processing disorders. Leacy has stress management strategies individualized to each child, but he also credits City Dads Group, a nationwide parenting support group for fathers, for helping keep his own anxiety and parenting stress in check.\n\n\"It's an opportunity for dads to hear that they're not alone in it, which is so easy for us to feel like, especially during pandemic,\" he said.\n\nThe separation anxiety phase can be tough on children and equally tough on struggling, frustrated parents who are trying to help their kids make it through an exceptionally hard year. There is one silver lining, said Dr. Lebowitz. \"It passes.\"\n\nChristina Couch is a freelance journalist and the assistant director of professional development for the M.I.T.

        "body": "Ms. Wells is a staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company.\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus pandemic, many people began social distancing from relatives and investing additional time with pets. Animal shelters reported record numbers of pets going into foster homes, with placement rates from 50 percent to 70 percent, according to the ASPCA and the Best Friends Animal Society. Petfinder.com saw adoption inquiries nearly double from March to May compared with the previous three months. But when it eventually comes time for people to return to work, pets may be ill-equipped to handle the long days at home alone.\n\nThis transition period may create separation anxiety, which experts we spoke with say is as real for cats and dogs as it is for humans. Experts define separation anxiety as a pet's distress caused by the absence of the owner. Signs may include chewing on doors, excessive howling or pacing, inappropriate marking or scratching and obsessive grooming. It's estimated that mood disorders are diagnosed in 20 percent to 40 percent of dogs referred to animal behavior practices, according to a 2001 study in The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. And more than 13 percent of cats have exhibited symptoms of separation anxiety, according to a 2020 study published in the open-access journal PLOS One.\n\nOwners of well-behaved pets may think their animals won't have any problems adjusting, but that may not necessarily be the case. \"The problem isn't going to manifest itself when the owner is home,\" said Dr. Wailani Sung, a veterinary behaviorist at the San Francisco SPCA. \"They don't realize that their dogs are adapting to them being around, and when they leave for work it's going to be a shock to them.\"\n\nTo avoid returning home to a chewed-up throw pillow or a urine-soaked bedspread, pet owners should take steps now to help ease the transition.\n\nHiring a trainer for virtual sessions is a good start. We spoke with professionals to find out what else you can do to prepare your pet for your eventual return to work. Their tips all require consistency, patience and, of course, plenty of fun.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-08T07:02:16.850Z As the U.S. relief talks falter again, Trump says he is prepared to act on his own. Cuomo says N.Y. schools can reopen in-person but leaves it up to districts to determine if, when and how. Thousands of cases went unreported in California when a computer server failed. See more updates More live coverage: Markets Take a walk -- without your pet.\n\nWhen a dog scratches at the door after you leave to run an errand or a cat mistakes that pile of dirty laundry for a litter box, experts say your pet is really telling you that it's worried you're leaving for good. Now is the time to train your pet to understand that you'll eventually be back. Start by taking a 15-minute walk without your pet -- after its bathroom break, of course -- and bring the entire family so that the animal is left alone. Connect a pet camera to observe your pet's behavior while you're away. If your pet responds well to your absence, increase the time away to 30 minutes the next day, and keep the trip frequency sporadic -- perhaps two or three times per week. Since pets love routine, you should also adjust their feeding and walking times to reflect your schedule before you return to work.\n\nIf your pet continues to show other signs of distress, reduce the time of the walk until your pet appears relaxed, and then build your way back up more slowly. \"We want to leave and come back before they get upset,\" Dr. Sung said. If you can work up to the four-hour mark, she added, most pets will be fine for an entire workday.\n\nBreak up the day with new visitors.\n\nIf quarantine restrictions have been lifted in your area, consider hiring a pet professional to give your pet someone to interact with while you're away. Even just weekly visits can break up the monotony and temporarily help mild symptoms of separation anxiety, Dr. Sung said. When you're searching for someone who has been trained to handle animals with separation anxiety, find a professional who is reliable and patient, said Hadley Raysor, the founder of the Dandy Dogwalker in Alameda, Calif. \"A good pet sitter or dog walker will pay attention to your dog's behavior and body language, and will be available to communicate with the pet owner about escalating behavior,\" Mx. Raysor said.\n\nTry toys or activities to keep your pet occupied.\n\nInvesting in quality pet accessories will ensure a peaceful transition when you're ready to spend time away from your pet. \"You want things that allow them to interact with their environment in a positive way,\" said Mikel Delgado, a certified applied animal behaviorist and a postdoctoral fellow at the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of California, Davis. \"While you're doing your work, your pet can do their own work, too.\"\n\nFor dogs, stuff the rubber Kong Classic with chopped-up fruit, peanut butter or plain yogurt, freeze it, and then set it on your dog's bed as you head out the door. \"It takes their mind off of your leaving, and by the time they're done it's time for a nap,\" Dr. Sung said. Wirecutter also likes sprinkling kibble or treats on the Paw5 Wooly Snuffle Mat, which is great for dogs with a penchant for sniffing the ground for food crumbs.\n\nFor cats, a 15-minute session with a toy that mimics a bird's flight movements, such as Petmate's Jackson Galaxy Air Prey Wand, can tire them out before you leave. Sprinkling Yeowww Catnip on a cat tree or a window perch entices them to exert their energy in a positive way (rather than scratching up the furniture). And a kibble-dispensing puzzle toy, like the PetSafe SlimCat Interactive Toy and Food Dispenser, will simultaneously keep them entertained and tire them out at mealtimes.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Use calming aids to help your pet relax.\n\nOver-the-counter pheromones and calming aids help companion animals remain relaxed, especially when there has been a change in routine. Wirecutter and Dr. Sung both recommend Adaptil products for dogs and Feliway products for cats. \"It helps increase their confidence and decrease their anxiety,\" Dr. Sung said. Chewable calming treats are a little cheaper than pheromone sprays and diffusers. Look for calming supplements that contain alpha-casozepine, L-theanine or L-tryptophan, Dr. Sung added, because they're backed by research. If you can't afford commercial calming aids, place a used pillowcase or a T-shirt you've worn recently next to your pet's favorite napping spot; it has your scent on it and should soothe the animal.\n\nConsult the pet professionals.\n\nIn more severe cases, you may find yourself at a loss about how to deal with your pet's behavior. Animals may act out by damaging baseboards, chewing on their crates, urinating inappropriately or excessively grooming themselves until they develop bald spots. \"I've had dogs that jumped out of the window trying to follow their owner,\" Dr. Sung said. \"I've actually had one break their leg.\"\n\nIt's important to address a pet's unwanted behavior before it spirals out of control, and experts say even the smallest signs of distress should be taken seriously. An accredited dog trainer or an animal behaviorist can help pet owners develop a training curriculum. There's no state or federal certification needed to be a pet trainer in the United States, so Wirecutter recommends hiring credentialed professionals registered with the Animal Behavior Society, the Certification Council for Professional Dog Trainers or the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants for their use of evidence-based approaches. The Academy for Dog Trainers in Emeryville, Calif., founded by Jean Donaldson; the Karen Pryor Academy in Waltham, Mass.; and the Victoria Stilwell Academy in Atlanta, Ga. are also reputable options, said Anna Wong, a graduate of the Karen Pryor Academy and the owner of Mutts Have Fun, a dog-training business in the San Francisco Bay Area.\n\nYou may need to consult a vet behaviorist if a trainer isn't successful in helping your pet transition to spending time without you, as your animal may have a severe case of separation anxiety. If you meet with a professional in person, wear a mask during training sessions, and always wash your hands and wipe down your pet's belongings after every visit. Virtual sessions are also an option. The American College of Veterinary Behaviorists lists qualified experts, like Dr. Sung, in its directory. Vet behaviorists guide pet owners by reviewing an animal's medical history, behavior and environment to develop a training game plan, and they can determine whether medications, like those used to treat panic disorders in people, can aid the rehabilitation process.\n\n\"They're living in our world,\" Dr. Sung said, \"and if you can be patient and provide clear instructions, your pet will thrive.\"\n\nInterested in learning more about the best things to buy and how to use them?

        "body": "Nervous about the possibility of going back to the workplace? Here's what to take into consideration.\n\nSince the coronavirus hit the United States in the spring, about 35 percent of American workers have switched to telecommuting, according to a recent survey by the National Bureau of Economic Research. And with the end of summer fast approaching, you may be wondering about your return to the office -- should you return at all.\n\nOr even if you continued to go into work, you might feel uneasy about the rising number of cases across the country and the prospect that you or your colleagues may contribute to the spread of the virus. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, known as OSHA, has suggested that employers develop an infectious disease preparedness and response plan, as well as implement basic preventive measures, like promoting frequent hand-washing and telling employees to stay home if they are sick. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also has a list of best practices, such as identifying how employees could be exposed to the coronavirus at work and encouraging them to wear face coverings.\n\nStill, employers may not enforce safety precautions because OSHA's recommendations are not mandatory, said Merrick Rossein, a professor at CUNY School of Law. \"The biggest problem and complaint from lots of advocacy groups is that there's very little teeth,\" he said. Virginia took the matter into its own hands last month, becoming the first state to mandate workplace safety rules in response to the pandemic.\n\nIn any case, \"there's no way you can just completely eliminate the risk, but what you have to do is minimize the risk,\" said Wafaa El-Sadr, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Columbia University. \"It will require everybody doing their bit.\"\n\nHere are some tips and things to take into consideration as you figure out your return to the office.\n\nBe prepared for things to look different.\n\n\"The whole process of coming into the office is likely going to change,\" said Elizabeth Brink, a principal and global work sector leader at the architecture and design firm Gensler.\n\nSome businesses have set up contactless entries: Employees in certain properties developed by Rudin Management in New York can enter the building hands-free by pulling up a QR code on an app created by its tech start-up, Prescriptive Data, that also allows users to check the air quality and elevator wait times (some are limited to four riders at once). Additionally, the developer has installed sanitizer dispensers at each entry point of its office buildings as well as diagrams that illustrate how to enter and exit the building to prevent crowding.\n\nOnce you reach the area where your desk is, you'll probably notice that seats have been rearranged to ensure social distancing. \"Any office that I've heard of that has hot-desking\" -- or unassigned seating -- \"as the basis for their layout has abandoned that,\" said Colin Koop, a partner at the New York office of SOM, a global architecture and design firm.\n\nHis workplace introduced a checkered seating layout that allows for about 40 percent maximum occupancy. The tentative plan is for employees to be phased back in progressively and eventually split into two groups that alternate coming in every two weeks to maintain that spacing.\n\nSome of SOM's clients are installing plexiglass dividers between desks, which has been recommended by OSHA for all work environments, particularly in retail and manufacturing.\n\nMany employers are also peppering their businesses with signage, said Ms. Brink, whether it's a reminder for employees to wash their hands, wear masks or limit occupancy in common areas. The goal is to clearly communicate, and enforce, safety precautions that may put employees at ease.\n\nYou may not notice invisible changes, like improvements made to the space's air quality. \"There are advanced cleaning technologies somebody can put in that require a specialist,\" said Joseph Gardner Allen, the deputy director of the Harvard Education and Research Center for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nFind out what's expected of you.\n\nEnforcing social distancing and the use of face coverings in the workplace are the most critical safety measures, Dr. El-Sadr said, but you may encounter other precautions, too. For example, your employer may be staggering employees' return dates. If so, you could find out who goes first: those deemed most essential or those whovolunteer? Will shifts be staggered throughout the week to reduce density in the office, or throughout the day, so employees relying on mass transit can avoid commuting during rush hour?\n\nThe C.D.C. suggests employees fill out daily health surveys and disclose whether they have Covid-19 symptoms before coming into work. But that comes with limitations. \"You have some people who may minimize the symptoms, and you have some people who might exaggerate the symptoms,\" Dr. El-Sadr said. But she has found that \"most people will be quite honest.\"\n\nEmployers may also implement daily temperature screenings. Related Companies -- the main developer behind the Hudson Yards complex in New York City -- has installed infrared cameras in the lobbies of several large office buildings in the city that signal when a person's temperature is over 100 degrees, said Philippe Visser, Related's president of office development. Some companies are putting technology in their employees' hands: The staff returning to work at Rudin Management's New York office has been checking symptoms using an app from a company called TrueCare24, said Samantha Rudin, the firm's senior vice president.\n\nWhile not all people who test positive for the coronavirus have a fever, if an employee is feeling feverish and knows her temperature will be checked before going into the office, she may be more inclined to stay home, Dr. Allen said.\n\nIt's also important to understand how your company will respond if an employee tests positive for the coronavirus. In most cases, employers shouldn't have to shut down their facilities, according to the C.D.C. If fewer than seven days have passed since a sick employee has been at work, the C.D.C. suggests closing off any areas she had used for prolonged periods of time. If possible, the employer should wait 24 hours before cleaning and disinfecting, lest other workers become exposed to the virus, and open doors and windows to allow for ventilation.\n\nEmployers should also alert workers who may be infected and ask them to stay home for two weeks while they monitor their symptoms.\n\nKeep in mind that your employer's strategy for reopening most likely depends on your industry and your company's resources. If your employer hasn't already announced its plans, ask about them. \"Your company and building should be communicating frequently about what strategies they're putting in place,\" Dr. Allen said.\n\nKnow your rights.\n\nIf you feel as if your employer isn't taking the necessary steps to ensure your safety or is discriminating against you for any reason, read up on federal, state and local laws.\n\nThe Equal Employment Opportunity Commission enforces several federal anti-discrimination laws, including the Americans With Disabilities Act. If an employee has a disability that puts her at greater risk from the coronavirus, she may be entitled to accommodations that would reduce her exposure, like a modified work schedule or shift assignment, unless the employer can prove the accommodations would be an undue burden on it.\n\nThe Family and Medical Leave Act offers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to full-time workers who have worked for their employer for at least one year; 13 states and Washington have laws that require paid sick leave; and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, an emergency measure passed in March by the federal government, offers two weeks of paid sick leave to eligible employees who are ill, quarantined, seeking diagnosis or preventive care for coronavirus. It also covers those caring for a sick relative or child whose school is closed or whose child care provider is unavailable.\n\nAdditionally, in the early days of the pandemic, several large employers, like Apple and Walmart, announced new sick leave policies in response to the outbreak.\n\nNot sure where you stand? Find a local advocacy group that can offer advice. There's Make the Road New York, a nonprofit with sister organizations in a number of states, which supports workers' rights and offers legal services to those in need. Or reach out to A Better Balance, a national nonprofit that often receives calls through its helpline from pregnant and low-income workers who may be entitled to specific accommodations but aren't sure of their rights, according to Dina Bakst, a president and a founder of A Better Balance.\n\nEmployees can only do so much, Ms. Bakst said: \"The onus should be on the employer to ensure health and safety.\"",

        "body": "There is a statistician's rejoinder -- sometimes offered as wry criticism, sometimes as honest advice -- that could hardly be a better motto for our times: \"Update your priors!\"\n\nIn stats lingo, \"priors\" are your prior knowledge and beliefs, inevitably fuzzy and uncertain, before seeing evidence. Evidence prompts an updating; and then more evidence prompts further updating, so forth and so on. This iterative process hones greater certainty and generates a coherent accumulation of knowledge.\n\nIn the early pandemic era, for instance, airborne transmission of Covid-19 was not considered likely, but in early July the World Health Organization, with mounting scientific evidence, conceded that it is a factor, especially indoors. The W.H.O. updated its priors, and changed its advice.\n\nThis is the heart of Bayesian analysis, named after Thomas Bayes, an 18th-century Presbyterian minister who did math on the side. It captures uncertainty in terms of probability: Bayes's theorem, or rule, is a device for rationally updating your prior beliefs and uncertainties based on observed evidence.\n\nReverend Bayes set out his ideas in \"An Essay Toward Solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances,\" published posthumously in 1763; it was refined by the preacher and mathematician Richard Price and included Bayes's theorem. A couple of centuries later, Bayesian frameworks and methods, powered by computation, are at the heart of various models in epidemiology and other scientific fields\n\nAs Marc Lipsitch, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Harvard, noted on Twitter, Bayesian reasoning comes awfully close to his working definition of rationality. \"As we learn more, our beliefs should change,\" Dr. Lipsitch said in an interview. \"One extreme is to decide what you think and be impervious to new information. Another extreme is to over-privilege the last thing you learned. In rough terms, Bayesian reasoning is a principled way to integrate what you previously thought with what you have learned and come to a conclusion that incorporates them both, giving them appropriate weights.\"\n\nWith a new disease like Covid-19 and all the uncertainties it brings, there is intense interest in nailing down the parameters for models: What is the basic reproduction number, the rate at which new cases arise? How deadly is it? What is the infection fatality rate, the proportion of people with the virus that it kills?\n\nBut there is little point in trying to establish fixed numbers, said Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida.\n\n\"We should be less focused on finding the single 'truth' and more focused on establishing a reasonable range, recognizing that the true value may vary across populations,\" Dr. Dean said. \"Bayesian analyses allow us to include this variability in a clear way, and then propagate this uncertainty through the model.\"\n\nA textbook application of Bayes theorem is serology testing for Covid-19, which looks for the presence of antibodies to the virus. All tests are imperfect, and the accuracy of an antibody test turns on many factors including, critically, the rarity or prevalence of the disease.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-04T07:05:52.634Z Fauci defends Birx after she is criticized by Trump. Trump derides Democrats as lawmakers and administration officials try to break stimulus impasse. The deadline for 2020 census counting has been moved up by a month. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe first SARS-CoV-2 antibody body test approved by the F.D.A., in April, seemed to be wrong as often as it was right. With Bayes theorem, you can calculate what you really want to know: the probability that the test result is correct. As one commenter on Twitter put it: \"Understanding Bayes' theorem is a matter of life and death right now.\"\n\nThe logic of uncertainty\n\nJoseph Blitzstein, a statistician at Harvard, delves into the utility of Bayesian analysis in his popular course \"Statistics 110: Probability.\" For a primer, in lecture one, he says: \"Math is the logic of certainty, and statistics is the logic of uncertainty. Everyone has uncertainty. If you have 100 percent certainty about everything, there is something wrong with you.\"\n\nBy the end of lecture four, he arrives at Bayes's theorem -- his favorite theorem because it is mathematically simple yet conceptually powerful.\n\n\"Literally, the proof is just one line of algebra,\" Dr. Blitzstein said. The theorem essentially reduces to a fraction; it expresses the probability P of some event A happening given the occurrence of another event B.\n\n\"Na\u00efvely, you would think, How much could you get from that?\" Dr. Blitzstein said. \"It turns out to have incredibly deep consequences and to be applicable to just about every field of inquiry\" -- from finance and genetics to political science and historical studies. The Bayesian approach is applied in analyzing racial disparities in policing (in the assessment of officer decisions to search drivers during a traffic stop) and search-and-rescue operations (the search area narrows as new data is added). Cognitive scientists ask, 'Is the brain Bayesian?' Philosophers of science posit that science as a whole is a Bayesian process -- as is common sense.\n\nTake diagnostic testing. In this scenario, the setup of Bayes's theorem might use events labeled \"T\" for a positive test result -- and \"C\" for the presence of Covid-19 antibodies:\n\nNow suppose the prevalence of cases is 10 percent (that was so in New York City in the spring), and you have a positive result from a test with accuracy of 87.5 percent sensitivity and 97.5 percent specificity. Running numbers through the Bayesian gears, the probability that the result is correct, and that you do indeed have antibodies is 79.5%. Decent odds, all things considered. If you want more certainty, get a second opinion. And continue to be cautious.\n\nAn international collaboration of researchers, doctors and developers created another Bayesian strategy, pairing the test result with a questionnaire to produce a better estimate of whether the result might be a false negative or a false positive. The tool, which has won two hackathons, collects contextual information: Did you go to work during lockdown? What did you do to avoid catching Covid-19? Has anyone in your household had Covid-19?\n\n\"It's a little akin to having two 'medical experts,'\" said Claire Donnat, who recently finished her Ph.D. in statistics at Stanford and was part of the team. One expert has access to the patient's symptoms and background, the other to the test; the two diagnoses are combined to produce a more precise score, and more reliable immunity estimates. The priors are updated with an aggregation of information.\n\n\"As new information comes in, we update our priors all the time,\" said Susan Holmes, a Stanford statistician, via unstable internet from rural Portugal, where she unexpectedly pandemicked for 105 days, while visiting her mother.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 3, 2020\n\nI'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Is the coronavirus airborne?The coronavirus can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. It's unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization.\n\nThat was the base from which Dr. Holmes refined a preprint paper, co-authored with Dr. Donnat, that provides another example of Bayesian analysis, broadly speaking. Observing early research in March about how the pandemic might evolve, they noticed that classic epidemiological models tend to use fixed parameters, or constants, for the reproduction number -- for instance, with an R0 of 2.0.\n\nBut in reality, the reproduction number depends on random, uncertain factors: viral loads and susceptibility, behavior and social networks, culture and socioeconomic class, weather, air conditioning and unknowns.\n\nWith a Bayesian perspective, the uncertainty is encoded into randomness. The researchers began by supposing that the reproductive number had various distributions (the priors). Then they modeled the uncertainty using a random variable that fluctuates, taking on a range of values as small as 0.6 and as large as 2.2 or 3.5. In something of a nesting process, the random variable itself has parameters that fluctuate randomly; and those parameters, too, have random parameters (hyper-parameters), etcetera. The effects accumulate into a \"Bayesian hierarchy\" -- \"turtles all the way down,\" Dr. Holmes said.\n\nThe effects of all these up-and-down random fluctuations multiply, like compound interest. As a result, the study found that using random variables for reproductive numbers more realistically predicts the risky tail events, the rarer but more significant superspreader events.\n\nHumans on their own, however, without a Bayesian model for a compass, are notoriously bad at fathoming individual risk.\n\n\"People, including very young children, can and do use Bayesian inference unconsciously,\" said Alison Gopnik, a psychologist at the University of California, Berkeley. \"But they need direct evidence about the frequency of events to do so.\"\n\nMuch of the information that guides our behavior in the context of Covid-19 is probabilistic. For example, by some estimates, if you get infected with the coronavirus, there is a 1 percent chance you will die; but in reality an individual's odds can vary by a thousandfold or more, depending on age and other factors. \"For something like an illness, most of the evidence is usually indirect, and people are very bad at dealing with explicit probabilistic information,\" Dr. Gopnik said.\n\nModeling humility\n\nEven with evidence, revising beliefs isn't easy. The scientific community struggled to update its priors about the asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19, even when evidence emerged that it is a factor and that masks are a helpful preventive measure. This arguably contributed to the world's sluggish response to the virus.\n\n\"The problems come when we don't update,\" said David Spiegelhalter, a statistician and chair of the Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication at the University of Cambridge. \"You can interpret confirmation bias, and so many of the ways in which we react badly, by being too slow to revise our beliefs.\"\n\nThere are techniques that compensate for Bayesian shortcomings. Dr. Spiegelhalter is fond of an approach called Cromwell's law. \"It's heaven,\" he said. In 1650, Oliver Cromwell, Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, wrote in a letter to the Church of Scotland: \"I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, think it possible you may be mistaken.\"\n\nIn the Bayesian world, Cromwell's law means you should always \"keep a bit back -- with a little bit of probability, a little tiny bit -- for the fact that you may be wrong, \"Dr. Spiegelhalter said. \"Then if new evidence comes along that totally contradicts your main prior belief, you can quickly ditch what you thought before and lurch over to that new way of thinking.\"\n\n\"In other words, keep an open mind,\" said Dr. Spiegelhalter. \"That's a very powerful idea. And it doesn't necessarily have to be done technically or formally; it can just be in the back of your mind as an idea. Call it 'modeling humility.' You may be wrong.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

Tears dampened the corners of my mask as I contemplated all that had brought me to this point: considering ending my relationship. It wasn't a twin loss at 19 weeks; it wasn't the several subsequent miscarriages; it wasn't the birth of our two children, a cross-country move, or a contentious N.F.C. Championship game between my beloved Seattle Seahawks and his Green Bay Packers in January that threatened the longevity of our relationship.\n\nIt was a global pandemic that had left us sheltering in place for months, him risking exposure to continue to provide for his family as an essential worker, as I worked from home and picked up the parenting slack. Forced to live in close quarters without access to any outside support or reprieve, overwhelmed by the additional parenting responsibilities and unable to access any kind of affordable child care, we were fighting more and understanding each other less. Amid all of this, I was left to contemplate whether or not my relationship could find a way to survive Covid-19.\n\nI know I'm not alone. It's not uncommon for me to peruse social media and read a post from a mom asking for guidance as she prepares to tell her partner she wants to separate, or a mom filing divorce papers and asking single moms for advice. Studies have shown that financial problems, too much arguing and an unequal division in parenting and household responsibilities are among the top reasons couples separate or file for divorce.\n\nCircumstances are ripe for the dissolution of parents' relationships with the unemployment rate at 10.2 percent, the country careening toward a recession and working moms -- who were shouldering the majority of child-rearing duties before the onset of a public health crisis -- being disproportionately affected by Covid-19.\n\nNearly one in 10 of married or partnered people in the United States say they are very likely to separate from their partner or spouse at least in part because of issues related to the pandemic, according to an Ipsos poll released Aug. 4. The same poll found one in five married or partnered people were fighting more with their significant other during this time, and 30 percent of partnered or married respondents said they're more annoyed with their partner than usual. But the long-term effects of the pandemic on couples -- however big or small -- still remain unknown, and mostly anecdotal.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-26T19:23:08.601Z The C.D.C. was pressured to change guidance on testing asymptomatic people who had been exposed to the virus.

Melanie asked that her name not be used to protect the privacy of her family, as she and her husband have not yet shared their decision to separate with family members or friends. \"I think the pandemic exacerbated existing problems within our relationship by forcing us to live together in what I've described as a 'pressure cooker,'\" she said.\n\n\"After the first two weeks, when the fun adventures of life without day care got boring and work started piling up, I realized it was over. I missed my friends. I missed being alone. I missed driving by myself -- anywhere. I started to get really depressed, to the point where I felt like I wasn't a person anymore, and eventually I realized it was because all of my happiness came from things I did outside of my home, not from my relationship with my husband.\"\n\nMelanie said she would have panic attacks when she heard her husband wake up in the morning -- a time she used to treasure when she commuted to work. \"I knew I'd feel smothered for the rest of the day,\" she said. \"I started hiding in my bedroom after our son went to bed, just to avoid my husband.\"\n\nDr. Rogers explained: \"The anxiety that many of us feel, particularly in the setting of the uncertainty from the pandemic, can place an enormous strain on relationships between parents, especially now that many are faced with making decisions about their children's schooling.\"\n\nHaving conflicting beliefs on how to navigate the ongoing pandemic is certainly the main factor driving Natalie Reeves Billing, 38, a children's book author, social-media entrepreneur and mom of three who lives in Liverpool, to reconsider her marriage. Her husband, who is 21 years her senior, has been fixated on the Covid-19 crisis since its onset, and has acted, she said, extreme in his precautions.\n\n\"He is a practical and logical person,\" she told me. \"But his discoveries scared him, and he began to unintentionally pass those fears onto our kids. After over five months of isolation, I am ready to follow my heart and look at mental health as the most important thing for me and my children. I know there are horrible decisions ahead for me, and that is causing a lot of pain. I value stability, and family is very important to me -- I came from a broken home. I have no wish to live separately from my husband, but I also won't allow my children's mental health to suffer.\"\n\nIn addition to an elongated period of trauma and the politicization of the virus, which has made it that much harder for parents to agree on what is best for themselves and their children, the ongoing disparity in the distribution of parental labor has also increased the chances of relationship strife.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"The extra burden on women to manage the household and children, and the expectation that this is the case, explicitly or not, can create an unequal power dynamic that values one person's work more than the others,\" said Jessi Gold, Ph.D., a psychiatrist and assistant professor for the Department of Psychiatry at Washington University in St. Louis. \"Resentment can fester and lead to strain in relationships, particularly the longer this goes on.\"\n\nSome of the disparity in parenting roles is unavoidable, but some isn't. Dr. Rogers encourages couples to discuss \"ways the partner with fewer responsibilities can both acknowledge and support the parent who is taking on more tasks.\" An open and direct line of communication is also vital for parents who know they are going to separate, or are in the process of filing for divorce.\n\n\"I think the No. 1 component of a well-done, healthy parenting plan is flexibility,\" Carolan says. \"We are living in times when parents need to be flexible with each other, and have to take each other into consideration because a healthy co-parenting relationship is what is in the best interest of all children.\"\n\nAnd since financial uncertainty, travel restrictions and an increased difficulty in accessing child care can make separation or divorce difficult, if not impossible, a couple's flexibility and communication is more key than ever. Discussing the realities of their situation has been pivotal for Melanie and her husband, as they have been forced to truly consider the financial implications of separating during a global pandemic.\n\n\"I own my business, and it's on really shaky ground right now due to Covid shutdown,\" she said. \"My husband works for a start-up that is marginally healthier, but also shaky. The last thing I want to do is leave and then lose my job. I'm terrified of not having health insurance, and I'm terrified that I'll feel pressured to start dating or even marry someone right away for financial security if I do [stop working]. That's just not something I'm willing to consider. So I want to make sure I have a plan and the resources I need first. Divorce or separation is something that's coming down the road, but once we know what child care and the economy looks like.\"\n\nStacy D. Phillips, a family law lawyer and partner at Blank Rome in Los Angeles, explained that delaying separation or divorce proceedings is also not uncommon. \"People's incomes are uncertain, and house values and other asset values have shrunk. People are unsure of what they can afford.\" And while Phillips says some couples are taking advantage of a partner's financial hardship and divorcing while assets are down, others \"want to wait to deal with splitting [when] a sense of 'normalcy' returns.\"\n\nAs for me and my family, I don't know what will happen in the future -- with the pandemic, my first grader's school schedule or my partner. When we found out I was pregnant with twins mere months into our relationship. When we found out I was pregnant with twins mere months into our relationship, we told one another that if we could get through this, we could get through anything. And we've said the same thing anytime a difficult situation or traumatic event has threatened our relationship. But he is still leaving the safety of our home every day to go to work at a facility where people have died from Covid-19. And I'm still stuck at home with two children, tasked with helping my son learn remotely and tending to a needy 1-year-old as I work from home. The pandemic has forced us to face existing issues in our relationship, have difficult conversations and be even more thoughtful in how we communicate.\n\nI can only hope, like our efforts to help mitigate the spread of Covid-19, that it's enough.\n\nDanielle Campoamor is a freelance writer and editor.

        "body": "Facing a resurgence of the coronavirus, public schools in the suburbs of the nation's capital decided in recent weeks that more than a million children would start the school year from home. On Friday, officials in Maryland's most populous county said that private schools, including some of the nation's most elite, had to join them.\n\nGov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, abruptly overruled that directive this week, contending that Maryland's private schools should be allowed to make their own reopening decisions. The governor staked out his position on the same day that a group of parents filed a federal lawsuit seeking to overturn the county's order, saying it discriminated against private and religious schools.\n\nThe wrangling threw into sharp relief the challenges facing local health officials as they piece together a response to the pandemic only to see their efforts encounter political resistance and legal pushback. Montgomery County officials said on Tuesday that they were reviewing the governor's order to see whether it negated their directive.\n\nThe dispute represents a contentious new front in the discussion over inequality in American society, as some private and parochial schools -- with their smaller class sizes, greater resources and influential supporters -- find ways to move ahead with reopening plans that are outside the grasp of public school systems.\n\n\"Parents in private schools are just generally more able to get their preferences heard,\" said Christopher Lubienski, a professor of education policy at Indiana University, adding that allowing private schools to opt out of public health orders provided new evidence of how schools in the United States were \"really efficient engines of inequality.\"\n\nMr. Hogan said on Monday that county health officers did not have the authority to order private schools to teach online, noting in his statement that school boards and superintendents have made individual decisions on plans for reopening with the help of local health officials. Private institutions, he said, should be allowed to do the same.\n\n\"This had nothing to do with public health, and everything to do with their own notions of fairness and equity,\" said Timothy Maloney, the lawyer for parents suing the county health officer.\n\nHis clients include families whose children attend Our Lady of Mercy, a Catholic school in Potomac, Md., which plans to offer in-person learning options with a mask-wearing mandate and social distancing, among other measures.\n\n\"The community was in an uproar,\" Mr. Maloney said. He noted that private and Catholic schools had been closely following the state's guidelines for safely reopening schools, and had invested millions of dollars in retrofitting buildings.\n\nMontgomery County is home to some of the most expensive and exclusive schools in the country, including St. Andrew's Episcopal School in Potomac, attended by President Trump's youngest son. St. Andrew's has been preparing for scenarios that include online learning or a hybrid model involving some instruction on campus.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-05T07:58:24.076Z As talks drag on, McConnell signals openness to jobless aid extension, and negotiators agree on a deadline. Novavax sees encouraging results from two studies of its experimental vaccine. Mississippians must now wear masks in public, governor says. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nMr. Trump has inserted himself often into the debate over schools reopening, threatening to withhold federal funds from those that do not teach in person. \"Much of our Country is doing very well,\" he tweeted on Monday. \"Open the Schools!\"\n\nAbout 90 percent of U.S. children attend public schools, which tend to have less money and larger class sizes than private and parochial schools, and less flexibility to make changes to their curriculum, facilities or work force. Public schools in many places must also negotiate with teachers' unions, many of which have pushed for their schools to remain online or adopt more stringent health measures.\n\n\"Public education is about leveling the playing field,\" said Pia Morrison, president of the Service Employees International Union chapter that represents some public school employees in Maryland and Washington. But the pandemic has exacerbated the economic disparity between many public and private school students, she said.\n\nReturning to school has already proven challenging, with some districts that opened classrooms this week and last seeing positive cases immediately and having to quarantine students and staff members, or even shut down temporarily. On Tuesday, the second day of its school year, Cherokee County in Georgia closed a second-grade classroom after a student tested positive for the virus.\n\nSchools in many parts of the United States face the near-certainty of outbreaks because of the prevalence of the virus in their communities, highlighting the tension between private school decisions and public health directives.\n\nIn New Mexico, Albuquerque Academy, one of the most prestigious private schools in the Southwest, developed an elaborate in-person reopening plan that included shifting to a trimester system, installing portable air filtration systems in every classroom and introducing touchless water fountains.\n\nPublic schools in Albuquerque, however, opted to start the year online as the state's coronavirus cases started climbing at a fast clip.\n\nNew Mexico's public education department does not have the authority to tell private schools when to start classes. But Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham determined in July that private schools had to follow the same public health orders that apply to other businesses in the state, meaning they could operate only at 25 percent capacity.\n\nDespite making several adjustments, Albuquerque Academy chose to start the year with teachers working on campus and students taking classes online; it will re-evaluate how things are going in several weeks.\n\n\"You need to abide by the public health order,\" said Julianne Puente, the academy's head of school, emphasizing that she appreciated the clear position from New Mexico's governor. \"You don't have to agree, but at a time like this when there's clarity, at least then you know, this is the structure.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 4, 2020\n\nI have antibodies.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nSeveral of the country's most elite boarding schools, including Phillips Academy in Massachusetts, Choate Rosemary Hall in Connecticut, and Phillips Exeter Academy and St. Paul's School in New Hampshire, say they plan to reopen this fall. Those schools and others have described safety protocols that include staggered returns to campus, reduced athletic schedules and online classes to begin their terms.\n\nIn Florida, which is enduring some of the heaviest coronavirus caseloads in the country, Dr. Mary Jo Trepka, chair of the epidemiology department at Florida International University, said the decision by Miami-Dade County Public Schools -- the nation's fourth-largest district -- to put off opening in person until at least October was \"a really wise move.\"\n\nThe Archdiocese of Miami announced last week that its schools would also provide instruction online until at least Sept. 18. And several of Miami's elite private schools said this week that they, too, would keep teachers and students at home for now.\n\nBut some charter schools plan to reopen. At a special meeting of the Miami-Dade County Commission on Tuesday, Mayor Carlos Gimenez pressed the county attorney about whether his administration would have authority over public charter schools if they violated county rules requiring masks and prohibiting large gatherings. The answer: probably not.\n\nAlthough the school district in Broward County, Fla., will also start the year online, Pine Crest, a prestigious private school with campuses in Fort Lauderdale and Boca Raton, will open on Aug. 19 with the option for parents to send their children to classrooms. Pine Crest had the resources to invest in equipment such as plexiglass dividers for desks, hand-sanitizing stations for classrooms and buses, and an app for students to screen their symptoms every morning.\n\nIn the Washington area, Georgetown Prep in North Bethesda, Md., had planned for at least some in-person classes until Montgomery County's order on Friday. In a letter to families, the school's president said on Monday that it would consider the county's directive and Governor Hogan's response and \"evaluate how best to proceed.\"\n\nMany private school decisions in the Washington area remain in flux, just as they do across the country, said Amy McNamer, executive director of the Association of Independent Schools of Greater Washington, which has 76 members in the region.\n\n\"Right now, I have to tell you, it's a very stressful time to be a school leader,\" Ms. McNamer said, adding that some private schools that were planning two weeks ago for a hybrid opening have opted instead to return to school virtually.\n\nStill, Ms. McNamer acknowledged that independent schools enjoyed some advantages, with the ability to make decisions based on the needs of a smaller community, compared with the array of factors that public school leaders have to consider.\n\n\"The comparison is perhaps, you know, the Titanic versus a small sailboat,\" she said.\n\nColin Moynihan contributed reporting.",

        "body": "(Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n\nMild COVID-19 induces prolonged immune response\n\nIn patients with mild COVID-19, immune responses last months and possibly longer, researchers found. Early reports suggested that in mildly ill patients, antibodies decrease and immunity wanes soon after recovery. But a study from China last month on 349 COVID-19 patients, which has not yet undergone peer review, found similar immune response patterns at six months regardless of symptom severity. And in a study published on Saturday ahead of peer review, U.S. researchers performed blood tests in 15 patients after mild COVID-19, looking for three signs of lasting immune responses: antibodies, so-called memory B cells, and memory T cells. Three months after recovery, patients still had \"all three of these defense layers,\" reducing their risk of reinfection, study co-author Lauren Rodda of the University of Washington School of Medicine told Reuters. If they do become reinfected, they are less likely to become severely ill or be contagious, Rodda said. Test results at three months were unchanged from results at one month, so her team believes this is a lasting response. Because the findings show immune responses last three months, if not longer, Rodda added, they support U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advice that patients need not be retested for COVID-19 within the first three months after an infection. Both studies were posted on the website medRxiv. (https://bit.ly/3g2fLBv; https://bit.ly/2CyMSPF)\n\nCOVID-19 survivors at risk for psychiatric disorders\n\nA study of more than 62,000 COVID-19 survivors has found significant risks for mental health issues. Researchers found that one in 16 COVID-19 patients who never had a mental illness will be diagnosed with one within three months after infection. This risk is about twice as high as expected and is even higher among patients who were sick enough to be hospitalized, study leader Maxime Taquet of the University of Oxford told Reuters. Most common are anxiety disorders, but depression, insomnia, and rarely, dementia, also occur, he said. The study, reported on Sunday on the medRxiv website ahead of peer review, also found higher-than-average COVID-19 rates in people with a previous psychiatric diagnosis. Taquet's advice for patients: \"If you experience anxiety, low mood, insomnia or memory loss after COVID-19, you should see a medical professional as there might be ways to improve these symptoms.\" (https://bit.ly/3iT7Ect)\n\nViral load not linked with smell or taste recovery\n\nVirus levels in the nose and throat have been linked to COVID-19 symptom severity, but Hong Kong researchers who expected viral load to correlate with smell and taste impairment were in for a surprise: viral load was not linked to the severity of these so-called olfactory and gustatory symptoms, nor with how long it takes for the sense of smell or taste to return to normal. The findings, reported in the journal Laryngoscope, are based on data from 39 patients in Hong Kong who developed problems smelling or tasting - or both. On average, it took 10 days for these senses to return. Four to six weeks after becoming ill, 72% had completely recovered the ability to smell and 83% were able to taste again. But there was no statistically significant link between viral load and severity of these symptoms or the recovery time. (https://bit.ly/2CDhTSI)\n\nEarly use of antibody-rich convalescent plasma may be best\n\nTreating seriously ill COVID-19 patients with antibody-rich blood plasma from people who have recovered from the disease can lower the risk of death, and new data from a nationwide U.S. study may help fine-tune the use of this so-called convalescent plasma. At 2,807 hospitals between April 4 and July 4, more than 35,000 hospitalized patients with, or at risk of, life-threatening COVID-19 respiratory problems received a transfusion of at least one unit of COVID-19 convalescent plasma. Roughly half the patients were in intensive care units and roughly one-quarter needed mechanical ventilators. Mortality rates were lower when plasma was given within three days of diagnosis, rather than later, the researchers found. And the more antibodies in the plasma, the lower the recipients' risk of death. In a report posted ahead of peer review on medRxiv, the research team concluded that while the study was not a gold-standard randomized trial, the findings added to evidence that \"the quality and manner in which convalescent plasma is administered to patients hospitalized with COVID-19 may reduce mortality.\" (https://bit.ly/2DZ8OEg)\n\nOpen https://tmsnrt.rs/3a5EyDh in an external browser for a Reuters graphic on vaccines and treatments in development.\n\n(Reporting by Nancy Lapid; Editing by Will Dunham)",

Spectators rang cowbells. I heard the \"Rocky\" theme twice along the course.\n\nExcept the spectators were naked. And I was, too.\n\nThat's because the race was the Bouncing Buns Clothing Optional 5K, held at the Sunny Rest Resort, a nudist resort in Palmerton, Pa.\n\n\"Not enough of us do things outside the box anymore, particularly as we get older,\" said Ron Horn, race director and co-owner of Pretzel City Sports, which put on the race.\n\nI've run a handful of Pretzel City's clothed (or as naked runners call them, \"textile\") races, but the nude events never appealed to me, not when there were a zillion other races to run.\n\nBut this year, it caught my attention in part because almost all other races have been canceled because of the coronavirus.

In March, four members of my family were sick with Covid-19. In June, my brother was in the hospital for weeks after a driver struck him while he was on a bike ride.\n\nI've spent five months trying to find glimpses of joy in small, simple things, like the sight of a bird on the tree I planted last year, or the feel of my dog's very soft ear. But the idea of a big, outlandish thing that might bump me out of my gloom had a certain draw.\n\nWhen a friend who lives in upstate New York said she was 90 percent willing to commit to making the trip to participate in this race, I thought maybe I should go, if for nothing else than to see her.\n\n\"What else do you have to do?\" she asked.\n\nSunny Rest was founded as a nudist resort in 1945 and, except for the lack of clothing, looks like a lot of other campgrounds, with mobile homes, cabins, tents and RVs. There's a pool, spa, volleyball and tennis courts, hot tub, and hiking and biking trails. Most people go about their daily activities wearing nothing but shoes or sandals, maybe a hat. It's private property, so laws against public nudity are not an issue. Pretzel City has been putting on races there for 13 years.\n\nThe events are meant to be fun, but the race organizers recognize that there is something of a taboo around nudity, so it anonymizes race results when posting them online, listing participants only by first name, last initial and home state. Knowing the privacy concerns, Pretzel City's race director announced before the race that a photographer and I would be covering the event, and that we would include only those runners who consented to being photographed and interviewed.\n\nSeveral runners were eager to talk to me, including Bruce Freeburger, 69, who drove from Detroit to run this race. He operates the website naked5k.com. Its slogan: \"I did wear shoes!\"\n\n\"It's not 'Girls Gone Wild,'\" he said of naked runs. He believes that those who run nude tend to be \"unselfish, and more sportsmanlike.\"\n\nAs soon as I pulled into Sunny Rest (after showing my ID and having the license plate of my car recorded by security), I saw a man in a wide-brimmed sun hat and no pants walking toward the pool.\n\nBy the time I parked near the race start, I felt prim. Some runners were clothed, but most were in some state of undress. A woman breastfed her child while she checked in. A man waited to run in just sneakers and a Viking helmet -- he hung his mask from one of the horns when he wasn't near other people. I saw my friend, already stripped down. She fit right in. I gave her an elbow bump and took off my shorts. It didn't feel weird, at all.\n\nTo prepare for the experience, I'd tried running completely naked on the treadmill in my basement, and determined that going braless was impractical for me. So I took the Donald Duck approach and wore a hat and sports bra but no bottoms. When I checked in, I was handed a race bib and a T-shirt, but then a staffer -- naked except for mask and gloves -- wrote my race number with a marker on my leg. Where was I going to pin a bib anyway?\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nI lined up near the start, a body in a sea of 115 bodies, ages 9 through 78, all standing six feet apart. The energy felt zippier here than at a normal race -- almost giddy. While most of the runners were from Pennsylvania, only a handful were also members of the Sunny Rest Resort. That meant almost everyone had traveled to this place -- from places as far away as Ohio, Delaware and West Virginia -- for the opportunity to do something unusual.\n\nRunners were required to wear masks to pick up their packets, and asked to wear them when near other people. Pretzel City also moved the start and finish area away from the more crowded part of the resort toward the camping sites, so we had more space to spread out. Over a bullhorn, Horn asked us to put our arms straight out by our sides and said, \"If you are touching someone you are not sleeping with, you are standing too close.\"\n\nAfter the initial newness of being aware of my butt bouncing around, everything felt pretty much the same as in a clothed race. We started at 10:15 a.m., and I'm usually done running by 8 a.m. in the summer, so it was hot. I was grateful for my hat, and the sunblock and anti-chafing balm I'd applied all over my body. By the first mile, I was coated in sweat.\n\n\"I don't have a shirt to wipe off my face!\" another runner shouted. The more experienced naked runners had thought to carry little towels.\n\nPart of the course was an out and back, so I saw the leaders coming back as I went out. With a full view of their entire, naked forms in motion, I felt appreciation, in the same way I'd look at a nice painting.\n\nI didn't worry about anyone else appreciating my body -- from the naked ladies cheering from their trailer's outdoor bar to the gentleman doing naked squats on his deck. The race didn't feel sexualized at all, and I didn't worry about which parts of my body were not perfectly flat and smooth, about what parts of my body shook with every step. I was just another body in motion.\n\nI was feeling what many runners had told me before the start of the race -- that this was freeing. Richard Whalen, 43, of Folcroft, Pa., said that for him it's also a celebration of who he is now. He's a recovering alcoholic who took up running after he stopped being too hung over to run in the morning. \"There's a sense of freedom here to show off your beautiful body.\"\n\nThat's also why Jim and Susan Fiordeliso of Yardley, Pa., came too. Last year, Mr. Fiordeliso, 53, had heart surgery, after which they vowed to take better care of their bodies. That included moving to a plant-based diet, as well as lots of walking and running. They've lost 210 pounds between them. It was their first time at a nude race, and they treated it as a celebration of their new lives. \"I loved it and I would do it again,\" he said.\n\nAnd then there's just the fun of it. \"I'm not a nudist type. I'm not an exhibitionist type,\" said Michael Lyons, 35, of Douglassville, Pa., who has done both naked road races and bike rides. \"I'm just a goofball who likes to do fun things.\"\n\nI finished in 30 minutes, 26 seconds, good enough for fifth place in my category. My award: a medal that I wore at around my neck with nothing but my sandals, bandanna and a fresh coating of sun block.\n\nJen A.

        "body": "NEW DELHI -- India now has the fastest-growing coronavirus caseload of any country in the world, reporting more than 75,000 new infections per day.\n\nCrowded cities, lockdown fatigue and a lack of contact tracing have spread Covid-19 to every corner of this country of 1.3 billion people. This week, the authorities said that one-sixth of a tiny tribe on a remote, coral-fringed island had come down with the virus.\n\nHealth experts say the virus reproduction rate is ticking up as more state governments, desperate to stimulate an ailing economy, are loosening lockdown restrictions, which is spreading the virus further.\n\n\"Everything right now is indicating toward a massive surge in the caseload in coming days,\" said Dr. Anant Bhan, a health researcher at Melaka Manipal Medical College in southern India. \"What is more worrying is we are inching toward the No. 1 spot globally.\"\n\nDuring the strict lockdown that held from late March to late May, most of India's Covid-19 cases were concentrated in urban areas, Dr. Bhan said. But as restrictions on interstate travel were eased, many people started moving from the cities to rural areas, bringing the virus with them.\n\nSome public hospitals have been so overwhelmed that doctors have had to treat patients in the hallways. In some cases, people in critical condition have no place to get help, even if they don't have the coronavirus.\n\nOne woman in the New Delhi area who was going into labor was turned away from eight hospitals in 15 hours. She died in the back of an ambulance, in her husband's arms.\n\nMore than 60,000 Indians have died from Covid-19, and India will soon have the third-largest death toll, after the United States and Brazil. Its overall number of reported infections is already the world's third-highest.\n\nIndia has reported more than 3 million total cases, and its day-to-day increase is now substantially higher than that of either the United States or Brazil, which have reported between 40,000 to 50,000 new infections per day in recent days.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T13:57:23.327Z 'We are incredibly concerned': A group of local health departments urges the C.D.C. to pull its new guidance on testing. For many schools in the U.S., returning to the classroom means a stop in the courtroom. Trump promises a vaccine by the end of the year, and boasts of his pandemic response. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nPer capita, however, India has had far fewer deaths than those two countries and many others, which doctors say reflects the country's younger and leaner population. Older people and those who are obese are believed to be more vulnerable to Covid-19. Some experts wonder, though, if Indian government agencies are unaware of many Covid-19 deaths or are intentionally underreporting them to keep the public from panicking.\n\nOne reason the country is reporting such a steep rise in infections now is simply that it is testing more. India performs nearly a million tests a day, compared with 200,000 a day two months ago.\n\nSo far, the biggest contributor to the new caseload and deaths is the western Indian state of Maharashtra, home to the commercial capital of Mumbai. That one state has accounted for at least 34 percent of deaths in the past 14 days. More than 23,000 people with Covid-19 have died there.\n\nIn Mumbai, where millions live in tightly packed slums -- in some cases, eight or 10 people to a room -- the highly contagious virus has proved difficult to stamp out. It has swept through slums like Dharavi, an industrious, vibrant, endless warren of tiny alleyways and boxlike homes stacked on top of each other.\n\nIn a 24-hour period this week, Maharashtra, which has a population of 120 million, recorded 355 deaths. The positivity rate, which measures the percentage of coronavirus tests that come back positive, of Maharashtra's health care workers has become one of India's highest, at 15 percent.\n\nIndia is now reporting around 1,000 Covid-19 deaths every day. Officials said on Friday that more than 73 percent of the new cases were coming from 10 of India's 28 states. The worst-hit are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat.\n\nLike anywhere else, the response to the virus has varied greatly from community to community. Doctors said that India's northeastern states, where religious community groups have led door-to-door awareness campaigns, have fared better than many other parts of the country.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider.

The resident shared pictures of the inside of a Port Blair hospital, which showed piles of wet garbage clogging the hallways.\n\nIndia strictly monitors access to its Indigenous tribes, which have protected status. The small groups living in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are some of the most carefully guarded.\n\n\"When a tribal group gets affected,\" Dr. John said, \"that means the virus is everywhere.\"",

        "body": "NEW DELHI -- The Indian economy contracted by 23.9 percent in the second quarter, the most drastic fall in decades, as lockdown restrictions meant to contain the spread of the coronavirus wiped out jobs and businesses.\n\nIndia's decline was the worst among the world's top economies, with the U.S. economy shrinking by 9.5 percent in the same quarter and Japan by 7.6 percent.\n\nData released by the Indian government on Monday showed the extent of the collapse in gross domestic product in the three months ending in June, with the construction, manufacturing and transport industries among the hardest hit. The figures reflect the onset of India's deepest recession on record since 1996, when the country first began publishing its G.D.P. numbers.\n\nIndia's picture is further complicated by the fact that so many people here are \"informally\" employed, working in jobs that are not covered by contracts and often fall beyond government reach, such as rickshaw driver, tailor, day laborer and farm hand. Economists say official numbers are bound to underestimate that part of the economy and that the full damage could be even greater.\n\n\"The strict lockdown led to a sharp contraction in activity in Q1 with job or income losses being faced by people,\" said Aditi Nayar, an economist at ICRA, an investment and credit rating agency in New Delhi. \"Less formal sectors could manifest in a deeper contraction when revised data is released subsequently.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-31T18:29:30.913Z India now has the third-highest death toll from the virus. Trump retweets fringe theories on the virus as the U.S. has more than 6 million cases. With testing disrupted, storm-hit Louisiana watches other measures of the virus and sees trouble. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nIn late March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi implemented one of the most severe lockdowns anywhere, ordering all Indians to stay inside, halting transportation and closing most businesses.\n\nMillions of workers who over the years had been drawn to the urban centers for jobs started returning home to rural areas. But as the ailing economy contracted even more, officials desperate to stimulate business lifted some of the lockdown restrictions, allowing more movement, which led the virus to spread wide and far. The country is now recording the world's highest number of daily new infections.\n\nJust a few years ago, India, with a population of 1.3 billion people, was one of the world's fastest-growing large economies, clocking growth of 8 percent or more.\n\nBut even before the pandemic hit, the economy had begun to slow down. For example, car sales plunged 32 percent last year in August, the largest drop in two decades.\n\nThe data released on Monday showed that consumer spending, private investment and exports had all suffered tremendously. The sector including trade, hotel and transport dipped 47 percent. India's once mighty manufacturing industry shrank by 39 percent.\n\nThe only bright spot, though relatively faint, was the agricultural sector. Thanks to strong rains this monsoon season, the sector grew by 3.4 percent versus 3 percent last quarter.\n\nEconomists said that the surging coronavirus cases in the country might push recovery further away and that the central bank would increasingly come under pressure for additional stimulus payments and rate cuts.\n\nMs. Nayar, the economist, said that while some parts of India's economy had started to recover, the rising number of infections and the steps taken to contain them suggested an uneven recovery. India has had 3.6 million infections (the third-highest number, after Brazil and the United States) and around 80,000 new cases reported each day, which is far more than anywhere else. Its death rate, though, remains substantially lower, which epidemiologists say is a product of India's population being younger than that of many countries.\n\nAcross India, many of the 28 states swing between opening up their economies and suddenly locking them down again, throwing businesses into confusion and keeping many people away from markets and shopping malls.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider.

But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nMr. Modi has said that he wants his country to become a $5 trillion economy by 2024 -- the next major election, in which he is expected to run for a third term. In 2019, India's G.D.P. was around $2.9 trillion, making it the world's fifth-largest economy, behind the United States, China, Japan and Germany. But next year, many economists believe, India's economy could be 10 percent smaller.\n\nArun Kumar, a professor at New Delhi's Institute of Social Sciences, said that the informal part of India's economy, which includes the millions of migrant workers who have lost their jobs, has suffered an even bigger blow than most people realize.\n\n\"My estimate is after the government takes the unorganized sector into account,\" he said, the overall economic slide would be \"minus 40 percent.\"\n\nOn Thursday, India's finance minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, blamed all of the country's economic woes on the coronavirus.\n\n\"It is an act of God,\" she said during a meeting with representatives from state governments, who have been begging for more federal help.\n\nBut opposition politicians have reiterated that India's economy had been stumbling for years under Mr. Modi, long before the pandemic. On Monday, after the dismal G.D.P. figures were released, they made fun of Ms. Sitharaman, saying that if the agricultural sector was the only part of India's economy doing well, it must be thanks to an \"Act of the Rain God.\"",

        "body": "Banks have tightened standards, becoming more choosy about their borrowers and asking a lot of questions.\n\nAs public school teachers, Tori Smith and her husband have careers that should survive the coronavirus economy, but their mortgage lender wasn't taking any chances.\n\nIt told them that they would have to put down more money to keep the interest rate they wanted, then dialed back what it was willing to lend them. And Ms. Smith said it had checked their employment status several times during the approval process -- and again a few days before the couple closed on their home in Zebulon, N.C., last month.\n\nMs. Smith said she had never gotten a straight answer about the new requirements, but she ventured a guess. \"I felt like we had to bring more just because of Covid,\" she said.\n\nThe economic crisis caused by the pandemic has driven interest rates to rock-bottom levels, meaning there has hardly been a better time to borrow. But with tens of million of people out of work and coronavirus infections surging in many parts of the country, qualifying for a loan -- from mortgages to auto loans -- has become more trying, even for well-positioned borrowers.\n\nLenders that have set aside billion of dollars for future defaults have also tightened their standards, often requiring higher credit scores, heftier down payments and more documentation. Some, such as Wells Fargo and Chase, have temporarily eliminated home equity lines of credit, while Wells Fargo also stopped cash-out refinancing.\n\nIt's not unusual for lenders to tighten the credit reins during a downturn, but the current situation has made it especially challenging for them to get an accurate read on consumers' financial health. Borrowers have been able to pause mortgages, halt student loan payments and delay paying their tax bills, while millions of households have received an extra $600 weekly in unemployment benefits. Those forms of government support could be masking an underlying condition.\n\n\"It makes it hard for a lender to understand what the consumer's true state of credit quality is and their ability to pay back a loan,\" said Peter Maynard, senior vice president of global data and analytics at the Equifax credit bureau.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-04T15:41:32.849Z N.Y.C.'s health commissioner resigns after clashing with the mayor over the virus. 'Long days, long nights': Washington prepares for a prolonged fight over virus relief. Israel's rocky reopening of its schools may be a lesson for the U.S. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nCredit card companies, for example, mailed out 57 million offers to consumers in June, a historic low and down from 272 million a year earlier, according to Mintel, a research firm that has been tracking the offers since 1999. Some banks have stopped offering the types of cards that attract people who may be focused on paying down debt, such as BankAmericard, Mintel found.\n\nIssuers are also being careful with cards belonging to current customers, said Mark Miller, associate director of insights for payments at Mintel.\n\n\"Some dormant accounts are being closed,\" he said. \"So if they have a credit card sitting in a drawer, those accounts are at risk of being closed, and credit lines with a $10,000 limit may eventually be knocked down to $8,000.\"\n\nFor auto loans, borrowers with lower credit scores and thin credit histories face more rigorous requirements and less generous terms, including shorter loan periods.\n\n\"Subprime borrowers are not getting loans as readily as they were pre-pandemic or a year ago,\" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, referring to consumers with credit scores below 620.\n\nInterest rates for new and used vehicles remain low -- below 4 percent at many banks and credit unions -- but only for more qualified borrowers, said Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at BankRate.com.\n\n\"Good credit and a down payment are required to get the best rates, with weaker credit increasingly sidelined -- particularly for older-model used car purchases,\" he said.\n\nFord Motor said it hadn't tightened standards on loans through its financing unit, but last month it introduced a program to make wary borrowers more comfortable. Those who buy or lease a car through Ford's financing unit before Sept. 30 can return it within a year if they lose their jobs. Ford said it would reduce the customer's balance by the vehicle's book value, and then waive up to an additional $15,000.\n\nIf that measure is meant to stoke demand, no such program is necessary for home buyers.\n\nFor the first time in nearly half a century of tracking, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged about 2.98 percent, according to Freddie Mac. The mortgage industry made $865 billion in loans during the second quarter, the highest amount since 2003, when quarterly originations twice topped $1 trillion, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication.\n\nAnd that's with lenders being picky about their customers and particular about their requirements. JPMorgan Chase, for example, will make mortgages to new customers only with credit scores of 700 or more (up from 640) and down payments of 20 percent or higher. USAA has temporarily stopped writing jumbo loans, which are mortgages that are generally too large to be backed by the federal government, among other products. Bank of America said it had also tightened its underwriting, but declined to provide details.\n\nMs. Smith and her husband, Philip Ellis, had hoped to go through a first-time homebuyer program at Wells Fargo that would require them to put down 3 percent. They even sat through a required educational course. But two weeks before closing on their $205,000 home, their lending officer said they needed to put down 5 percent to keep their rate.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 3, 2020\n\nI'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Is the coronavirus airborne?The coronavirus can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. It's unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization.\n\nA week later, Ms. Smith said, they learned their loan was for less than what they had been preapproved for -- and they needed to come up with an additional $4,000. In the end, their down payment and closing costs exceeded $14,000 -- about 45 percent more than they had anticipated.\n\nThe couple, who had married in April, used money recovered from their canceled wedding reception. Ms. Smith said they were also lucky to have the support of their families, who fed and sheltered them so they could save every penny. But the stability of their jobs was also most likely a crucial factor.\n\n\"I think our ability to secure the loan was due to us both being schoolteachers and having a contract for employment already for the following year,\" she said.\n\nWells Fargo said it hadn't increased its credit score requirements, but it has raised down-payment minimums on certain loans not backed by the government because it had to suspend most interior appraisals of homes during the pandemic. Even under normal circumstances, there are a variety of situations in which borrowers may be asked to raise their down payment or obtain a better rate by doing so, a company spokesman said.\n\nSome lenders also want to know more about borrowers' other possible sources of cash.\n\nWhen Chris Eberle, a technology executive, and his wife were locking in their jumbo mortgage for a new home in Palo Alto, Calif., their lender, a California mortgage bank, wanted to know not only how much they had in their retirement accounts but how easy it was to get at that money.\n\n\"They wanted, account by account, details on the withdrawal and loan options,\" Mr. Eberle said.\n\nAnd they, too, had to put down more than they had planned. Before the crisis, a jumbo loan could be had with 10 percent down. Mr. Eberle said they had to put down 20 percent -- and found a cheaper house to make it easier.\n\nOther borrowers, including the self-employed, are being asked to provide more detailed proof of their earnings -- at least when they're getting a loan that will be backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. .\n\n\"Employment and income verification for self-employed borrowers is now multiple times more detailed as it previously was,\" said Ted Rood, a loan officer in St. Louis who lends nationally.\n\nIncome verification is also more rigorous across the board, and Mr. Rood said he was required to do two verifications over the phone. It makes sense, he said: He had just prepared a loan for a married couple -- a gym owner whose income had suffered and his wife, a speech therapist with a seemingly more stable position because she was able to work with clients remotely.\n\n\"We were set to close on a Monday in early June,\" said Mr. Rood, who was working at Bayshore Mortgage Funding, which is based in Timonium, Md., at the time. But when the loan processor called the wife's employer the Friday before, the processor learned that the woman had been laid off.\n\nThe lender withdrew the loan.",

        "body": "Impact investments are outperforming traditional bets in the coronavirus crisis, which may be a turning point for wealthy investors looking to generate change.\n\nImpact investments, which aim to promote a social good or prevent a social ill, have significantly outperformed traditional bets during the coronavirus pandemic. And their returns are enticing hesitant investors to rework their portfolios.\n\nImpact investing typically focuses on three categories: environmental, social and governance, known as E.S.G. Returns can be tracked through various exchange-traded funds. For example, the S&P 500 technology E.T.F., for example, is up 25 percent this year, while the S&P 500 energy E.T.F., which includes oil and gas stocks, is down 34 percent.\n\nOver all, 64 percent of actively managed E.S.G. funds beat their benchmarks versus 49 percent of traditional funds through the first week in August, according to research from RBC Capital Markets.\n\nThe private markets are seeing similar interest. Take Vital Farms, which was founded in 2007 in Austin, Texas, to sells eggs from pasture-raised hens.\n\n\"A few years ago, venture capitalists scratched their heads at an egg farm,\" said Dave Kirkpatrick, managing director at SJF Ventures, which was one of the first private investors in the farm. But Vital Farms, which grew through private investment before going public at the end of July, is valued at more than $1 billion.\n\nNow, other investors are coming to him with questions about sustainable and profitable agriculture, said Mr. Kirkpatrick, who is also a founder of Impact Capital Managers, a trade group that seeks to show that impact investing can be a way to achieve higher returns.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis may be a turning point for wealthy investors, whom advisers have long seen as a key constituency to expand the market for investments that aim to do good and still provide solid returns.\n\n\"Every time something goes wrong in the world, it's a boost to impact investing,\" said Nancy E. Pfund, a managing partner and co-founder of DBL Partners. \"There's a generalized frustration that whatever people have been doing for the last X number of years, it's not working.\"\n\nThis has caused a shift in strategy, she said: \"You're seeing people flock to impact investing, and now there are the returns.\"\n\nInvestment dollars have begun to follow returns. In the first half of the year, $20.9 billion went into impact funds, which was just shy of the amount of new money for all of last year, according to a report from Morningstar. (The 2019 number was, in turn, four times the 2018 total.)\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T14:39:24.040Z 'We are incredibly concerned': A group of local health departments urges the C.D.C. to pull its new guidance on testing. For many schools in the U.S., returning to the classroom means a stop in the courtroom. Trump promises a vaccine by the end of the year, and boasts of his pandemic response. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe data heartens advisers who see this as a moment when they can stop making the case that individuals need to give up returns to make impact investments (a belief, known as concessionary returns, that has been largely refuted).\n\n\"The impact portfolios are very significantly outperforming the traditional ones,\" said Brad Harrison, a co-head of impact investing at Tiedemann Advisors. \"It only escalated in the last year while we've been dealing with this pandemic.\"\n\nYet like all investing stories, there is some complexity to this one.\n\nCreating an impact portfolio today is easier than it once was, but it takes considerable attention. Eric Lemelson, a philanthropist and vineyard owner in Oregon, has focused on clean-energy investments for nearly 20 years, and his portfolio has been almost entirely made up of impact investments for the past decade.\n\n\"I made the decision to decarbonize the entire portfolio,\" Mr. Lemelson said. But the move took time.\n\n\"With U.S. markets, it was relatively easy to start the move,\" he said. \"With the developing world, it was more difficult because there was less transparency.\"\n\nHis success with his personal wealth allowed him to steer the foundations he is a part of to change their investment portfolios. One, the Lemelson Foundation, was started by his father, Jerome, an inventor who had more than 500 patents. Now, 75 percent of its endowment is in impact investments.\n\n\"I made the case with my family that as a foundation, we have an obligation to lead,\" he said.\n\nBut Mr. Lemelson also supported his argument with solid returns. \"Increasingly, it will become obvious that well-managed investment portfolios don't give up anything at all,\" he said.\n\nEven in the face of data, the sector faces headwinds. Just last year, Daniel and Sheryl Tishman, whose wealth comes from the family's real estate companies, sought to put the $100 million that seeded their NorthLight Foundation into impact investments, but they encountered pushback from managers.\n\nOne manager they interviewed said that what they were trying to do was not possible, said Kate Sinding Daly, executive director of the foundation, which focuses on the environment. \"That's an old-school view,\" she said.\n\nFiguring out how to execute on their investment thesis was challenging. For example, the foundation had all its money in impact investments but was still switching among different assets in that sector, Ms. Daly said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"The environmental stuff was easy,\" she said. \"It's the issues around human rights, gender issues, arms, military investments and all that stuff.\"\n\nThat's a difficulty that other investors are going to run into. Excluding oil companies remains a straightforward choice. Investing in ways that promote an idea or a thesis -- like equity -- is more complex. And it's not always easy for the advisers to do it well, either.\n\n\"It seems like the new queries we get are not from the asset managers but the intermediaries -- the consultants and financial advisers who struggle to sort the wheat from the chaff,\" said Joshua Humphreys, president and senior fellow at the Croatan Institute, a think tank focused on investing for social good. \"There's a big education learning curve from a lot of advisers.\"\n\nYet he is cautiously optimistic. \"I am hopeful that the tide is turning, but I'm also worried that there is a lot of greenwashing going on,\" he said, using the term for when asset managers simply tick the boxes that make them look as if they care about impact investments but don't really put in the work.\n\nIt's important for individuals to look at the authenticity of asset managers and how rigorous their screening methods are.\n\nNot everyone is bullish on this moment. There is some skepticism that impact investments look good because investments like energy and financial companies in traditional portfolios have not performed well over the past nine months.\n\n\"The outperformance is pretty explainable by the shock to the oil industry,\" said Mark Cirilli, a co-founder and managing partner at MissionPoint Partners, a private equity firm. \"It has much more to do with the demand shock, as opposed to good companies with high E.S.G. scores are better run in a pandemic.\"\n\nMr. Cirilli said he believed that more individual investors, even skeptical ones, were moving money into impact investments, but that the driver was sound economic fundamentals. Companies are being forced to respond to investor demands for greater corporate responsibility.\n\nHe pointed to the food industry, where several meat processing plants had serious coronavirus outbreaks in their factories, which prompted concerns about the safety and robustness of the country's food supply chain.\n\n\"Covid has raised the awareness of the fragility of our economic system, and to me that's an investable trend,\" Mr. Cirilli said.\n\nFor some investors, though, the hope is that strong returns will persuade others to remake their portfolios to focus on impact. \"The market is changing fundamentally,\" Mr. Lemelson said. \"This is not just another challenge. It's the challenge.\"",

        "body": "Want to get The Morning by email? Here's the sign-up.\n\nGood morning. Congress will return from break this week to vote on a Postal Service bill. The Democratic National Convention kicks off tonight. And scientists say there may be good news for cities hit hard by the coronavirus.\n\nToday, we're turning this section over to our colleague Apoorva Mandavilli, who has been covering the pandemic for The Times's Science desk.\n\nThe pandemic will end only when enough people are protected against the coronavirus, whether by a vaccine or by already having been infected. Reaching this threshold, known as herd immunity, doesn't mean the virus will disappear. But with fewer hosts to infect, it will make its way through a community much more slowly.\n\nIn the early days of the crisis, scientists estimated that perhaps 70 percent of the population would need to be immune in this way to be free from large outbreaks. But over the past few weeks, more than a dozen scientists told me they now felt comfortable saying that herd immunity probably lies from 45 percent to 50 percent.\n\nIf they're right, then we may be a lot closer to turning back this virus than we initially thought.\n\nIt may also mean that pockets of New York City, London, Mumbai and other cities may already have reached the threshold, and may be spared a devastating second wave.\n\nThe initial calculations into herd immunity assumed that everyone in a community was equally susceptible to the virus and mixed randomly with everyone else.\n\nThe new estimates are the product of more sophisticated statistical modeling. When scientists factor in variations in density, demographics and socialization patterns, the estimated threshold for herd immunity falls.\n\nIn some clinics in hard-hit Brooklyn neighborhoods, up to 80 percent of people who were tested at the beginning of the summer had antibodies for the virus. Over the past eight weeks, fewer than 1 percent of people tested at those same neighborhood clinics have had the virus.\n\nLikewise in Mumbai, a randomized household survey found that about 57 percent of people who live in the poorest areas and share toilets had antibodies, compared with just 11 percent elsewhere in the city.\n\nIt's too early to say with certainty that those communities have reached herd immunity. We don't know, for example, how long someone who was infected stays protected from the coronavirus. But the data suggests that the virus may move more slowly in those areas the next time around.\n\nFor more on herd immunity, read Apoorva's latest article.\n\nIn other virus developments:\n\nHealth experts are concerned that a severe flu season this fall and winter may lead to a \"twindemic.\" In response, they're making an urgent plea for everyone to get a flu shot.\n\n\"New York is like our South Korea now.\" Here's how the city has succeeded -- so far -- in staving off a second wave.\n\nNew studies show encouraging signs of strong, lasting immunity, even in people who developed only mild coronavirus symptoms.\n\nLater today, The Times is introducing a newsletter on the seismic changes to preschool, K-12 and higher education during the pandemic. Sign up below.\n\nTHREE MORE BIG STORIES1. Congress steps up Postal Service fight\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi will call the House of Representatives back into session this week to vote on legislation to block recent cost-cutting measures at the Postal Service amid growing concern that delivery delays are an attempt by President Trump to suppress voting by mail during the pandemic.\n\nDemocrats also called on the postmaster general and another top official to testify later this month. The moves come as the Postal Service has removed mail-sorting machines, cut overtime and informed states that it might not be able to meet their deadlines for delivering mail ballots.\n\nAttorneys general from at least six states are mulling lawsuits to block the administration from reducing service, The Washington Post reported.\n\n2. A national convention, minus the spectacle\n\nThe Democratic National Convention, which starts today in Milwaukee, will be a largely virtual affair. Joe Biden won't travel there to accept the nomination in person. Most speeches will be delivered remotely. No rowdy delegates will throng the convention floor.\n\nHow will going virtual affect the convention's impact? For speakers, addressing an empty room will reduce fanfare and spectacle. For party members seeking to mobilize supporters, the remote format may depress grass-roots energy.\n\nBut barring glitches, the convention is likely to give voters a TV experience similar to what it offers every four years. \"In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if more people tune in this year than in 2016,\" said our colleague Lisa Lerer, who writes the On Politics newsletter. \"I mean, we're all stuck at home anyhow!\"\n\nThe convention's first of four nights will feature Michelle Obama and Senator Bernie Sanders as headline speakers. Here's how to tune in.\n\nIn other election news:\n\nDespite a policy agenda that favors America's wealthy, Trump has so far struggled to attract as many superrich donors and seven-figure checks to aid his re-election effort as he did for his 2016 campaign, a Times analysis found.\n\n3. Migrant children and families detained at hotels\n\nThe Trump administration is using major hotel chains to detain children and families taken into custody at the border, a practice that has ballooned in recent months under an aggressive border closure policy related to the pandemic.\n\nBecause the hotels exist outside the formal detention system, they are not subject to policies requiring that migrants be provided access to medical care and healthy food. For children who arrived at the border alone, parents and lawyers often have no way of finding them or monitoring their well-being.\n\n\"A transportation vendor should not be in charge of changing the diaper of a 1-year old, giving bottles to babies or dealing with the traumatic effects they might be dealing with,\" said a former ICE employee.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nTens of thousands of demonstrators turned out in Minsk on Sunday to protest President Aleksandr Lukashenko of Belarus, who claimed victory in a fraudulent election last week. The gathering appeared to be the largest protest in the country's history.\n\nUnder pressure from governments and investors to address climate-change concerns about their products, Europe's oil companies are accelerating their production of cleaner energy.\n\nThe National Weather Service said it would investigate reports of fire tornadoes arising on Saturday from a 20,000-acre wildfire in Northern California.\n\nLives Lived: For years, Luchita Hurtado worked in the shadow of her artist husbands and more famous peers, painting at night when her children were asleep. Then a trove of the Venezuelan-born artist's work was discovered, and she became an art world sensation in her 90s. She died at 99.\n\nIDEA OF THE DAY: The trouble with dollar stores\n\nDollar stores are some of the most ubiquitous retailers in the United States. According to the latest data from the National Retail Federation, the industry's top two chains -- Dollar General and Dollar Tree -- each have more than 15,000 locations. That's nearly three times as many stores as Walmart has.\n\nBut while deeply discounted prices might seem like a welcome arrival, those savings often come at a cost to the neighborhoods they move into.\n\nRising crime. An investigation by ProPublica and The New Yorker found that dollar stores have become magnets for crime and killing. Since the start of 2017, the report said, there have been more than 200 violent incidents involving guns at Family Dollar or Dollar General stores, nearly 50 of which resulted in deaths.\n\nPoor nutrition. Dollar stores' shelves are mostly stocked with frozen and packaged foods, and the chains often move into urban and rural areas where fresh produce is hard to find. Officials worry that the flight of fresh foods may increase already high rates of heart disease and obesity, The Times reported last year.\n\nFewer jobs. In many cities, dollar stores have forced local retailers out of business. But they operate on a \"lean labor model,\" according to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, meaning the stores usually employ fewer people than the ones they replace.\n\nPLAY, WATCH, EAT, READMake something savory\n\nTostones, a staple dish throughout the Caribbean and Latin America, are crisp, golden, flower-shaped delights. Made of flattened green plantains that are fried twice, serve them as a savory app or a side dish. Learn how to make them here.\n\nFun reads, sans the beach\n\nBeach reads are a state of mind, not dependent on a place. So even if the closest you get to a cool ocean breeze this summer is a fan, that doesn't mean these books are off the table. Here's a roundup of fresh picks to get you started, including the latest by Kevin Kwan, the author of the popular \"Crazy Rich Asians\" series.\n\nPick a card, any card\n\nFrom doing tricks with a deck of cards cut from milk cartons to using a wand made of medical tape, many prison inmates worldwide have turned to magic as a creative outlet.\n\n\"Everybody wants to feel like they matter. And in prison, most of us don't,\" said one enthusiast. With magic, he said, \"I can practice, and make my mind go someplace else. I get taken away for a minute.\"\n\nDiversions\n\nListen to 10 new songs to kick off the week, including tracks by Miley Cyrus and Sufjan Stevens.\n\nA bee, or not a bee? There are about 4,000 bee species in the U.S., but many other insects share their black-and-yellow patterns. Here's how to spot the difference.\n\nGames\n\nHere's today's Mini Crossword, and a clue: Titan condemned to hold up the heavens for eternity (five letters).\n\nYou can find all of our puzzles here.\n\nThanks for spending part of your morning with The Times. See you tomorrow.\n\nP.S. The word \"quaranteammate\" appeared for the first time in The Times this weekend, as noted by the Twitter bot @NYT_first_said.\n\nDavid Leonhardt, this newsletter's usual writer, is on break until Monday, Aug. 24.\n\nYou can see today's print front page here.\n\nToday's episode of \"The Daily\" is about Operation Warp Speed and its aggressive timeline for developing a vaccine.

        "body": "Last year I was abruptly let go from my job. I ramped up my side business, which was fine except that now the pandemic has caused an immediate decline -- and potential future decrease -- in business because my clients cannot quickly adapt to technology to allow for work to continue. My clients requested that I reschedule work until the fall of this year; they think that is when business will return to pre-crisis levels. (This is an industrywide issue as well.)\n\nThe trouble is that I never told my elderly parents that I was let go. I no longer talk about the job, a topic we used to discuss frequently. Now I discourage discussion about it, saying it is a \"toxic work environment.\" Instead, I steer the discussion toward small triumphs with my side job, which is now my primary source of income. During this economic turbulence caused by the pandemic, both parents often verbalize how blessed our family is that all of their children are still employed. I continue to play along because I don't want my octogenarian parents worrying about it.\n\nI have not shared the news with my family because I am hurt and embarrassed by the circumstances of my departure from the job. I am considering taking legal action to address what I believe to be disparate treatment. I feel as if discussing this matter will be a \"downer\" for everyone at a time when we all crave good news. I believe that I have good reasons for not sharing my job loss with my parents, who tend to share details I would rather keep private. Still, I think I behaved unethically by not fully sharing my situation with them. What do you think? Name Withheld\n\nIt's a sign of something morally odd about our attitude to employment that you feel ashamed of having been fired, even though you think the firing was unjust. (You say \"embarrassed,\" but that's usually a gentler way of saying the same thing.) If you're right, the shame should attach not to you but to the people who fired you. And yet your response is entirely representative. People tend to think that having a job gives them a kind of moral standing, marks them out as a contributor, a giver and not a taker.\n\nI'm tempted to say that this is a very American idea. Benjamin Franklin, in his autobiography, wrote of his \"bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection,\" which involved such maxims as \"Industry: Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.\" (Max Weber later cited Franklin's cherishing of industry as evidence for what he called the Protestant ethic.) But then I think of the French film \"Time Out\" and the Japanese film \"Tokyo Sonata,\" each of which memorably depicts a fired white-collar worker whose family thinks he is still going to the office. The workplace as a source of worth is a widespread tenet. So I can see why you wanted to keep this from your parents. Losing your job -- a condition that the pandemic has now visited upon tens of millions of Americans -- imposes harms beyond the financial ones.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-04T09:15:14.275Z 'Long days, long nights': Washington prepares for a prolonged fight over virus relief. Israel's rocky reopening of its schools may be a lesson for the U.S. Hurricane Isaias arrives in North Carolina as officials along the East Coast scramble. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nYou understandably don't want your folks to worry, and you might well feel that it is up to you whether you disclose what happened. Family relationships don't require frankness about everything. They may, on the contrary, require discretion about certain things. But deceiving your parents about your employment status is wrong, a pattern of deception that isn't in keeping with a loving relationship. You should end the charade before your parents learn the truth from someone else and are left feeling betrayed. It won't be easy, I realize. Letting them know that you haven't been honest with them is bound to be a source of shame -- this time justified.\n\nMy husband and I are very fortunate financially. We are the quintessential \"DINKs\" (double income, no kids): We have white-collar jobs and our savings are good. We could live on his salary even if I were to lose my job. That seems like a real possibility: While layoffs may not be imminent, the organization I work for, a nonprofit, was already on a shrinking budget before the current economic shock. Now the odds are even higher that they will have to let people go before the year is out. (I am actively looking for another position.)\n\nShould I lose my job, is it ethical for me to claim unemployment benefits, at a time when an unprecedented number of people are doing the same? Sure, I would be legally entitled to do so. But I fear that I would be taking money that I don't really need -- and that someone else desperately does -- out of a system that seems likely to be spread even thinner the longer the downturn goes on.\n\nIf someone can afford not to take unemployment benefits, are they ethically obligated not to? During these scary economic times, do we have an obligation to \"flatten the curve\" at the unemployment office as well as the hospital? Name Withheld, California\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 3, 2020\n\nI'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Is the coronavirus airborne?The coronavirus can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. It's unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization.\n\nI just mentioned the concern many people have to be a giver, not a taker, and that's clearly one that you share. Unemployment payments are a legal right for those who qualify, which doesn't mean you have to exercise the right. But it isn't incidental that, like Social Security, the program of unemployment insurance to which you would be applying is not means-tested. There may be political advantages to that design: In a society like ours, benefits that aren't means-tested tend to garner more support and carry less stigma. In our present economic circumstances, too, we don't want people to cut back on spending, and your unemployment pay will reduce the temptation to do so.\n\nOf course, your particular decision will not make much difference to the world: Not taking these benefits will save the government an amount that's well within the rounding error of the budget, and spending it won't increase demand detectably. (At least not in the aggregate: I suppose it might make a detectable difference for a small neighborhood store you patronize regularly.) But there's nothing wrong about taking part in a basically just system in ways permitted by its rules.\n\nI am Jewish by birth, upbringing and culture but consider myself an agnostic. Questions about the existence of God have no interest for me, and my religious observance is more family- than God-oriented. In this period of intense suffering and loss, though, I've struggled with how to honestly express feelings of hope and sorrow. \"You're in my heart\" or \"I hope your loved one gets better\" just doesn't seem to carry the same weight as \"I'm praying for you\" -- and recently, I've found myself saying that to people I know who are deeply religious, even though I don't literally pray. I don't want to be facile or deceptive, but it is what people say in our country. If the other person has already spoken about God's will, is responding in their lingua franca a sign of empathy or a kind of appropriation? Jezra Kaye, New York\n\nNot every use of religious language signals religious commitment. An atheist can say \"Bless you\" when someone sneezes; it's just a conventional formula. The same is true of \"goodbye,\" said at parting, even though it's an abbreviation of \"God be with you.\" When people leave my presence in Asante, the region of Ghana where I grew up, I often say \"Wo ne Nyame nko,\" which literally means \"Go with God.\" (It's more traditional than the alternative, which is an Asantified version of \"bye-bye,\" namely \"Baabae-o.\") I'm pretty sure I'm not misleading anyone. \"I'm praying for you\" could, against a certain cultural background, be formulaic in just this way.\n\nBut what if \"I'm praying for you\" brings someone consolation not just by expressing compassion and concern but by suggesting, falsely, that you are actually praying? Perhaps religious people would be especially prone to mistake your parrotings for promises. What's at stake, in these circumstances, isn't appropriation but deception. Nor is this a white lie, a trivial fib meant to spare someone's feelings. The act depends upon deceiving listeners about something that is -- from their point of view, if not yours -- genuinely important. Like many attempts at kindness, it would be, at the very least, condescending.",

Bon app\u00e9tit.\n\nAs students arrive on campuses in New York for an academic year upended by the coronavirus pandemic, administrators are grappling with an array of challenges -- including how to isolate students coming from the many states subject to New York's 14-day quarantine rule.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome -- which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet -- and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don't show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nFeeding those students, it turns out, is a big task. New York University and Cornell University, among others, have dealt with it by providing meals at no charge to out-of-state students who have been allowed to move into dormitories before classes start.\n\nThe prospect of free food may sound good, but what showed up in brown paper bags three times a day at N.Y.U. got poor reviews from students, who were quick to share TikTok videos and memes of their unripe oranges, watermelon chicken salads and other unhappy meals.\n\nDanielle Gould, a sophomore, tried to make the best of the situation, posting a video of a breakfast she received as an \"incoherent sounds\" meme on TikTok. What did it show? A cookie, chips, salad dressing, salt and pepper.\n\nEven if students are not well fed, Ms. Gould said, \"at least people can be entertained.\"\n\n[Read more about the meals at N.Y.U.]\n\nAnnette Yang, a first-year N.Y.U. student studying media, culture and communications, said that she had not received some meals and that some of the food she did get smelled as if it had gone bad.\n\n\"PLEASE DON'T SKIP MY ROOM FOR FOOD!\" Ms. Yang wrote on a sign she posted on her door. \"I haven't gotten food today or yesterday. Pls help.\"\n\nOn Thursday, N.Y.U. issued a statement apologizing to the 2,600 students who are living in isolation, for what it said were \"valid\" complaints about a \"particularly regrettable error.\"\n\nIt's Tuesday -- keep on keeping on.\n\nMetropolitan Diary: Trick or treat\n\nDear Diary:\n\nIt was my first Halloween in my first Manhattan apartment.\n\nHaving grown up on Long Island, I assumed that trick-or-treating was strictly a suburban phenomenon, so I had not kept track of the date.\n\nBut shortly after I returned home from work on Oct. 31, my bell rang. When I opened the door, I was surprised to find a small boy wearing a costume and holding a shopping bag that appeared to be empty.\n\n\"Trick or treat?\" he said hopefully.\n\n\"Wait a minute,\" I said before running off to the kitchen.\n\nNo treats anywhere. But I didn't want to send him away empty-handed.\n\nIn desperation, I grabbed a cantaloupe from the counter, rushed back to the door and dropped the melon into the boy's bag.\n\nAs he walked away silently, he appeared to be staggering under the weight of the unusual treat.\n\n-- Karen R.

        "body": "This is the Coronavirus Schools Briefing, a guide to the seismic changes in U.S. education that are taking place during the pandemic. Sign up here to get the briefing by email.\n\nToday, we're looking at the implications of New York City's decision to push back the start of school. And we're taking a deep dive into a crucial question: Is it safe to send kids back into the classroom?\n\nNew York City's last-minute delay\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio announced that New York City would delay the start of its school year, shortly before it was set to begin. The city's 1.1 million public schoolchildren will not attend any in-person or remote classes until Sept. 21.\n\nThe delay \"seemed inevitable for weeks,\" said our colleague Eliza Shapiro, who writes about education in New York City. \"The question was whether the mayor was going to acknowledge what so many educators were telling him -- that they needed more time.\"\n\nThe deal, which was hammered out during an overnight bargaining session, gives teachers and administrators more time to prepare for the most closely watched reopening effort in the country. It also gives the mayor a longer runway to pull off one of the most ambitious -- and riskiest -- city initiatives in decades:\n\nTeachers will return to their classrooms next week to prepare, including virtual check-ins with students to make sure they're ready for remote learning.\n\nFulfilling a major union demand, the city will require random monthly testing in all city schools, starting in October.\n\nMost children who have opted for in-person school will attend on a hybrid model: one to three days per week in the classroom; the rest online.\n\nDesks will be six feet apart, so only nine or 10 children will be in most classes at a time, about a third of the typical number.\n\nEveryone will have to wear a mask, except during a quick lunch in classrooms.\n\nOpen windows, even on cold and rainy days, will keep fresh air moving.\n\nNew York City remains the only major school district in the country that plans to offer any in-person learning. Once the epicenter of the pandemic, the city has maintained low infection rates for months.\n\nPublic health experts generally agree that classrooms can open with testing and safety measures. And most say that the city's low-income students -- who have struggled to access remote learning, and rely on schools for meals and social services -- urgently need in-person classes. Nevertheless, returns to in-person school have frequently led to spikes in cases across the country.\n\nWhat it means: \"New York City is learning that having the virus under control is only the first step to reopening schools,\" Eliza said. \"No other big city in the country has even reached that step, but as they do, they're going to confront all these logistical issues inherent in creating two versions of school -- one online and one in person.\"\n\nThe school testing initiative will also be one the largest sustained efforts in the country, with implications well beyond the classroom. The federal government also just announced it will send millions of rapid coronavirus tests to states to support school reopenings.\n\nAround the world\n\nThe Times took a look inside classrooms in more than a dozen countries, including in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan, above.\n\nIn Wuhan, China, the original epicenter of the pandemic, state-run news media said nearly 1.4 million students returned to school on Tuesday.\n\nDespite a steady rise in cases, some schools in Russia reopened on Tuesday, with few precautions. Teachers and children are not required to wear masks.\n\nStudents returned to some classrooms in France on Tuesday, even though cases are soaring.\n\nTake a tour through more countries with our photo essay.\n\nThe toughest call for parents\n\nOur colleague Apoorva Mandavilli has been closely following the latest research on the coronavirus and children -- both as a science reporter and a parent with a difficult decision to make.\n\n\"I've been updating a balance sheet in my head. Every study I read, every expert I talked to, was filling in columns on this sheet: reasons for and against sending my children back to school come September,\" she wrote.\n\nAmong the latest developments:\n\nThis summer, coronavirus cases, hospitalizations and deaths increased faster in children and teenagers than among the general population, according to data compiled by the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nStudies have found that children carry large amounts of virus in their airways. That suggests they may be contagious, even without any symptoms.\n\nTwo South Korean studies, although flawed, suggested children can transmit the virus.\n\nUnfortunately -- maddeningly -- there are no definitive answers yet. But most experts are clear about one thing: Schools should reopen only when less than 5 percent of people in a community have recently tested positive. Most U.S. districts don't meet that standard.\n\nSchools Reopening \"Back to School\n\nUpdated Sept. 2, 2020\n\nThe latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.\n\nFlorida severed ties with Quest Diagnostics after discovering it delayed providing results from nearly 75,000 coronavirus tests that date back to April.Students across the globe, from Wuhan to London to Tel Aviv to Florida, headed back warily to classrooms this week.As colleges reopen in the pandemic, students must decide whether to report classmates who might be violating Covid rules.Learning in 2020 is going to be a roller-coaster of adjustment. Here's advice on how to retain some joy.\n\nThrough her reporting, Apoorva found some reassurance. Even with higher infection rates and a few serious inflammatory responses, children are still much less likely than adults to have a severe case. Reports from Europe hint that it is possible to reopen schools safely. And schools can take sensible precautions, including moving activities outdoors, imposing social distance rules and requiring masks.\n\nThe bottom line: \"Don't just look at one study when making decisions about education & health,\" Apoorva tweeted. \"Look at the whole body of evidence.\"\n\nSo, what decision did she make about remote or in-person school? You'll have to check out the full article.\n\nRelated news: Children of color are much more likely to become infected and severely ill from the coronavirus than white children. Risk factors include lower incomes, parents who are frontline workers and living in multigenerational households.\n\nCollege update\n\nThe University of South Carolina suspended 15 students and six Greek organizations for holding parties and large gatherings.\n\nJames Madison University, in Virginia, announced Tuesday that it will transition to primarily online learning. The school's dashboard showed 601 active cases since July 1 and a test positivity rate of over 16 percent.\n\nKansas State University is battling four new coronavirus outbreaks tied to its football team and three Greek organizations, The Associated Press reported.\n\nK-12 update\n\nIn Vermont, snow days may be less likely this year because of the complicated logistics of hybrid teaching.\n\nA cyberattack hindered virtual learning for public school students in Miami on Tuesday, the second day in a row the school system experienced problems.\n\nWith few plans for widespread testing, educators and administrators in Texas fear outbreaks. \"Unless you're doing routine testing, you're not going to be able to identify those kiddos who are asymptomatic and presymptomatic,\" one epidemiologist told The Texas Tribune.\n\nIn Michigan, five K-12 districts reported new outbreaks last week. But state health officials are not disclosing which districts had the outbreaks.\n\nTip of the day: Face masks for kids\n\nFace masks can be annoying for kids, if not downright scary. Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, took a look at the best cloth mouth coverings for your children.\n\nTo come up with their recommendations, they looked at some 70 cloth masks for kids, pored over scientific studies, spoke with health experts and researchers, and tested the finalists with a panel of 10 kids, ages 3 to 10.\n\nAlso: Cold season is coming. We asked three pediatricians how to parse whether your child's symptoms might actually be Covid-19.\n\nHave you tried to get pediatric testing?\n\nOur colleagues Sarah Kliff and Margot Sanger-Katz are looking into the availability of coronavirus testing for children.\n\nIf you've struggled to find a suitable testing site -- or you've had to make a ton of calls or drive a long way to secure a test -- they'd love to hear from you.

        "body": "JERUSALEM -- With the coronavirus spreading fast through the Gaza Strip, the Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed Monday night to cool its latest round of hostilities with Israel in exchange for a cash infusion from Qatar and for Israel's agreement to let fuel flow back to Gaza's power station, officials said.\n\nFor several weeks, Gaza, ruled by Hamas, has launched hundreds of balloons laden with incendiary devices and explosives -- and more than a few rockets -- into southern Israel, torching large tracts of farmland and keeping thousands of Israeli civilians on edge. Israel has responded with frequent airstrikes and tank fire on what it said was Hamas military infrastructure in Gaza.\n\nFar from resolving anything, though, Monday's agreement -- which effectively bought the promise of a month's calm -- was just another familiar step in the miserable minuet that has entangled Israel and Hamas for years.\n\nHamas again promised that it was to get long-sought progress on major economic projects; it did not detail them, but as of last week it was demanding an extended power line and a new industrial zone that could alleviate Gaza's appallingly high unemployment rate.\n\nBy contrast, Israel announced that it was merely allowing routine cargo activity at the Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza and permitting Gaza's fishermen to resume plying the Mediterranean waters up to 15 nautical miles off its shores.\n\nOnce again, it was understood by each side that the failure to live up to its promises could bring about another round of escalation.\n\n\"This decision will be tested on the ground,\" the Israeli military agency responsible for Gaza, the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories, said in a statement. \"If Hamas, which is accountable for all actions that are taken in the Gaza Strip, fails to stand by its obligations, Israel will act accordingly.\"\n\nFor his part, Yehya Sinwar, the leader of Hamas in Gaza, announced that the agreement would \"contain the escalation and halt the Zionist aggression on our people.\"\n\nTalal Okal, a Gaza-based political analyst, said the understanding had little hope of leading to a long-term cease-fire.\n\n\"We're in the middle of a vicious cycle,\" he said. \"It seems that the situation hasn't changed significantly and that the tensions can come back in the snap of a finger.\" He said the success of Monday's agreement would depend on Israel's willingness to implement it -- something he accused the country of evading in past deals with Hamas.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-31T22:22:03.340Z The virus is resurging in Spain, which reported 53,000 new cases in the past week. Health care workers with Covid-19 may be going undiagnosed, according to a C.D.C. report. Trump retweeted a fringe theory on virus deaths. But more than 183,000 have died in the U.S. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe agreement was trumpeted by Mohammed al-Emadi, a Qatari ambassador who heads that nation's Committee for the Reconstruction of Gaza and has been shuttling back and forth between Israel and Gaza for days. But while he alluded to projects that Hamas has agitated for, he said that the calming of tensions was \"paving the way\" for their implementation, suggesting that work was not about to begin imminently.\n\nNone of the parties publicly disclosed the amount of Qatar's cash infusion. A person familiar with the agreement, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss it, put the payment at $27 million.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what Hamas would use the money for. Officials say that previous payments from Qatar have been used in Gaza, which is in dire economic condition, to buy fuel, pay civil servants' salaries and provide relief to impoverished families.\n\nPolitics has loomed over the heated-up Gaza-Israel border in multiple ways, analysts said -- particularly with an election coming up to decide the leadership of Hamas. Khaled Meshal, a former Hamas leader now in exile in Qatar, is believed to be vying to topple Ismail Haniya, the Gaza-based Hamas political director.\n\nMr. Haniya and Mr. Sinwar have sought to show that they are capable of compelling Israel to make meaningful improvements to conditions in Gaza, whether in easing its blockade or in advancing big projects.\n\nBut the political situation in Israel, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been in a kind of permanent campaign mode, repeatedly dangling the prospect of taking the country to another election, has made it difficult to imagine Israel doing much to benefit Hamas in the near future.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nFor Qatar, meanwhile, restoring calm can enhance its stature in the region, said Celine Touboul, a Gaza expert and co-director of the Economic Cooperation Foundation, an Israeli think tank. \"Simply put, they want to be a player,\" she said. \"And to be a player for them is to demonstrate that they can contribute to shift the situation and calm it.\"\n\nHamas noted in announcing Monday's understanding that it would help provide a measure of relief to Gaza in light of its battle with the coronavirus. But the most crucial missing element in that fight was electricity, as Israel had halted shipments of fuel into Gaza in retribution for the flaming balloons and rockets.\n\nThat standoff became dire last Monday, when Hamas officials reported the first cases of community transmission. And the spread of the virus in Gaza appears to have accelerated: As of Monday morning, there were 243 active cases of local spread and 37 among returning travelers held at quarantine facilities, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Officials have reported three virus-related deaths in the past week.\n\nVirus testing kits are in short supply in Gaza, the ministry said, and it is testing at a slow pace. As of Monday morning, it had conducted just 670 tests in the preceding 24 hours.\n\nNickolay E. Mladenov, the United Nations special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, wrote on Twitter that he welcomed Monday's agreement: \"Ending the launching of incendiary devices and projectiles, restoring electricity will allow #UN to focus on dealing with the #COVID19 crisis. All parties should return to the calm understandings.\"\n\nMr. Mladenov and Ambassador Emadi, among other officials, were expected to meet on Tuesday at the Erez crossing between Israel and Gaza.\n\nEarlier on Monday, the United Nations humanitarian coordinator for the Palestinian territories, Jamie McGoldrick, called upon Hamas to stop the rockets and balloons and Israel to restore electricity, which was down to just four hours a day, \"in line with its obligations as an occupying power.\"\n\n\"The situation is hindering the provision of services in the quarantine facilities and the capacity of the health system to cope with the increased demands, such as the ability to detect new COVID-19 cases,\" Mr. McGoldrick said. \"Power outages in hospitals are having serious repercussions, with patients in intensive care, chronic and emergency cases particularly vulnerable.\"\n\nDavid M.

        "body": "The Iowa senator's comments echoed a false claim, spread by President Trump over the weekend, that deaths from Covid-19 have been inflated.\n\nAs Iowa sees a sharp spike in coronavirus cases, Senator Joni Ernst, a Republican in a tight race for re-election, echoed a debunked conspiracy theory that Covid-19 deaths were being greatly inflated and suggested that health care providers had a financial motive to falsify cases.\n\nMs. Ernst said she was \"so skeptical\" of the government's national statistics about virus fatalities during a visit on Monday to Waterloo, a city in northeast Iowa.\n\n\"They're thinking there may be 10,000 or less deaths that were actually singularly Covid-19,\" Ms. Ernst said. \"I'm just really curious. It would be interesting to know that.\"\n\nMs. Ernst's comments seemed to repeat a false claim spread by President Trump on Twitter over the weekend, which the company removed for violating its rules against sharing disinformation because it is linked to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory.\n\nThe claim, retweeted by Mr. Trump and spread widely by others on social media, inaccurately said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \"quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6%\" of deaths -- or about 9,000 people -- \"actually died from Covid.\"\n\nThe claim was apparently based on a C.D.C. data table updated last week showing 161,332 death certificates that listed Covid-19 as a cause of death. In 6 percent of cases, Covid-19 was the only cause of death. The other 94 percent included underlying conditions such as high blood pressure or diabetes.\n\nBut as health experts have repeatedly emphasized, it is a misreading of the data to suggest that a person infected with the virus who had other health problems, or comorbidities, did not die of Covid-19.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T19:31:25.677Z The C.D.C. tells health officials to be ready to distribute a vaccine by November, raising concerns over politicized timing. Virus fallout from the Sturgis Rally: A death in Minnesota, cases in South Dakota and beyond. New studies show inexpensive steroid drugs can help critically sick people survive Covid-19. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, responded on Tuesday to Mr. Trump and others who have tried to minimize fatalities based on death certificates.\n\n\"That does not mean that someone who has hypertension or diabetes who dies of Covid didn't die of Covid-19. They did,\" Dr. Fauci said. \"It's not 9,000 deaths from Covid-19, it's 180-plus-thousand deaths,\" he said, adding that there should \"not be any confusion about that.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Ms. Ernst walked back her skepticism over the death toll.\n\n\"Over 180,000 Americans have died because of Covid-19,\" she said in a statement issued by her Senate office. \"What matters is that we are getting the resources to Iowa that are needed to fight this virus and continuing to support our health care workers on the front lines, and that's what I'm focused on.\"\n\nMs. Ernst, who is fending off a stiff challenge from her Democratic opponent, Theresa Greenfield, had also suggested on Monday that doctors and hospitals had a financial incentive to inflate coronavirus statistics. \"These health care providers and others are reimbursed at a higher rate if Covid is tied to it, so what do you think they're doing?\" she told voters gathered between fields of corn and soybeans.\n\nThe Iowa senate race is on track to be the most expensive in state history as national Democrats target Ms. Ernst, a former National Guard commander in Iraq, in their drive to win a Senate majority. Republican groups are responding in kind, pouring money into defending Ms. Ernst, a first-term senator who has been considered a rising Republican star. She was one of few campaigning G.O.P. senators who spoke at last week's Republican National Convention, where she praised Mr. Trump's relief for farmers for financial losses during the pandemic, which came on top of massive bailouts because of lost agricultural exports during his trade wars.\n\nPublic polling shows the Iowa senate race is a statistical tie. In the latest fund-raising quarter, Ms. Greenfield brought in just over $6 million, $2.4 million more than Ms. Ernst, though the incumbent had more cash in her campaign account.\n\nThe pandemic is increasingly an issue in the race as Democrats in Iowa criticize Republican officials, including the governor, for a laissez-faire response that has placed Iowa high up in several unfortunate statistics.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nAccording to a tracking project by The New York Times, Iowa has had the most new virus cases per capita of any state over the last seven days. Ames and Iowa City, home to the state's two largest public universities, rank second and fourth nationally among metro areas with the most cases per capita over the past two weeks, according to Times data.\n\nGov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican, has balked at mandating masks be worn statewide, and has been criticized for barring K-12 schools from holding online-only classes unless the virus positivity rate reaches 15 percent or above in their counties. The state's recent spike in cases has occurred as both K-12 and college students returned to campuses.\n\nThe governor only last week ordered bars and nightclubs to close in the two big university cities. Meanwhile, Iowa State University, in Ames, said it would allow 25,000 fans to attend a football game on Sept. 12, about 40 percent capacity for its stadium.\n\nMs. Greenfield, a businesswoman who, like her opponent, grew up on a farm, called on Wednesday for a statewide mask mandate, which Ms. Ernst has said should be a personal choice.\n\n\"We all want to beat this coronavirus pandemic, restart our economy, begin the school year safely, and get back to normal,\" Ms. Greenfield said. \"The science is clear -- the best way to do that is if we all wear our masks.\"\n\nDavid Yepsen, a former political reporter and columnist at The Des Moines Register, said the coronavirus was just one issue unsettling the electoral landscape in a largely rural state that Mr. Trump easily won in 2016. Ms. Ernst, who lives in a county of just 5,700 people, should have a natural advantage over the Des Moines-based Ms. Greenfield, 56, who is appearing on a general election ballot for the first time.\n\n\"The governor's managed to make everyone unhappy with the uncertainty over school openings, closing or not closing bars,\" Mr. Yepsen said. \"Ernst's musing about conspiracy theories\" about coronavirus plays into that unease, he added.\n\nBut Ms. Ernst, 50, who has been more visible on the campaign trail, including appearances like the one in Waterloo, has a clear appeal to rural voters. \"As always in rural America, the cultural issues of religion, guns, abortion and now crime drive a lot of votes and this will hurt Democrats,\" Mr. Yepsen said. \"Kenosha and Minneapolis are a little too close and will fire up the G.O.P. base.\"",

        "body": "Ms. Urquiza, who gave a scathing speech on the first night of the Democratic National Convention, spoke to The Times about her father's support of President Trump and on the country's need for leadership.\n\nOne of the most memorable speakers of the first night of the Democratic National Convention was a woman whom many voters had never heard of: Kristin Urquiza, whose father, a supporter of President Trump's, died of the coronavirus in Phoenix in June, not long after Arizona lifted many of its stay-at-home restrictions.\n\n\"My dad was a healthy 65-year-old,\" she said during the convention. \"His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump -- and for that he paid with his life.\"\n\nIn May, Ms. Urquiza, 39, graduated with a master's degree in public policy from the University of California, Berkeley, and had planned to continue her work with international environmental policy. But the death of her father, Mark Anthony Urquiza, has prompted her to turn her focus on the impact of the coronavirus crisis in the United States. After writing a blistering obituary, in which she blamed the country's leaders for her father's death, and holding a vigil at the Arizona State Capitol on the day of his funeral, Ms. Urquiza garnered national attention, including from Democratic strategists.\n\nAlready, her words are being featured in two political advertisements targeting voters in several swing states. The New York Times spoke with her about her family's politics -- her father, she noted, voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 -- and what she planned to do in the weeks leading up to the presidential election.\n\nThe conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nQ. The circumstances that led to your speech were clearly tragic. What was your family's experience with the coronavirus crisis?\n\nA. My dad woke up on June 11 feeling sick. My mom called me right away and started to list symptoms, and I immediately thought it was Covid. I was terrified.\n\nI'm an only child and I was really focused on taking care of my parents. We got him a test the next day, but he never got the results because he quickly deteriorated.\n\nLatest Updates: 2020 Election 3m ago The convention 'feels so lonesome' without the crowds, says the longest-serving member of the D.N.C. 15m ago Trump speaks positively about conspiracy theorists who believe in QAnon. 39m ago Emma Gonz\u00e1lez will narrate a video as the convention highlights gun violence. See more updates\n\nReally in that moment, the other thing I remember immediately thinking is, This shouldn't be happening.\n\nWe knew about this virus, but we didn't have a national mask mandate. That's what I remember feeling so deep in my core, that this was a colossal failure of leadership that has put my dad's life at risk.\n\nHe went into the hospital on June 16, went into the I.C.U. on June 26 and passed on June 30.\n\nDuring that time, my mom ended up testing positive as well, so my dad was so terrified. Luckily, she didn't get as sick as my father -- she had extreme exhaustion and some other symptoms. But he was texting from his hospital bed while he was dealing with his own fight, saying we have to get ahead of this. It was terrifying.\n\nThe day before he went to the I.C.U., he was telling me he thought he was going to be home on Monday. This virus can just decimate people so quickly. The doctor I spoke to didn't expect my dad to take the turn that he did.\n\nI live in San Francisco, and I was making the calculation of \"Do I go home?\" trying to think about mitigating my own risk. It was a lot, it required a colossal amount of resiliency. When my dad passed, I was driving home to Phoenix; I took the phone call on the side of the highway at a gas station. I still can't believe how it happened. But the thing that really inspired me to be honest was when I talked to aunts and uncles, I saw the same anger I had.\n\nTell us more about your father -- what was he like?\n\nHe worked in aerospace manufacturing, making sure the parts coming off the line met the specifications. He had been working for a long time and was an essential worker so was continuing [to work] during the shelter-in-place. But his company lost a big contract and he was furloughed in April.\n\nHe was a huge lover of karaoke. He could not carry a tune to save his life, but he did it with gusto. He came from a big, close-knit family -- he was one of six. He was an informal promoter to bring people together to celebrate anything.\n\nSo I know that when a friend of his had a birthday and things were open, he was eager to meet up with friends and catch up with them. He felt it was safe to go out. I counseled him that it's not actually safe, but he said, \"Why would the governor say it was safe when it isn't?\"\n\nYou spoke about your father's vote for Mr. Trump -- how much did the two of you discuss politics?\n\nHe was a Republican for most of his life. I just learned recently that when my parents got married, my mom was a registered Republican and he was a Democrat, but he said, \"Well, I'll be a Republican so we don't cancel each other out.\" I think my dad over time became very loyal to the party. He was an enthusiastic supporter of Trump. He liked that he was a businessman. He thought that he would bring a fresh perspective to his position.\n\nMy entire life I never saw eye to eye with the Republican Party, but in particular, the last few years. My dad and I talked constantly about politics. It was always very cordial. It was kind of fun to test out ideas with him, because I knew he would always be a friendly audience and encourage me to fight for what I believed in.\n\nMy dad's father was from Mexico, and everyone else in his family is a Democrat. Immigration is one the of the topics I have been really passionate about and outraged at Republicans about. But my dad didn't go so deep on that.\n\nWhen he was in this hospital, we ended up talking about politics. I asked him, \"What do you think now?\" He told me that he felt sideswiped and betrayed by what was happening. I didn't have the heart to dig in further, but there was a part of me that wanted to. I didn't want him to feel like he was doing something wrong. My dad was following what he was told by people who are supposed to be leaders.\n\nWe had multiple conversations when basically what I was hearing from him was a parroting that I knew to be incorrect. That is part of what is so frustrating about this entire situation. We are living in a moment of time where there is a crisis and people are muddled in so much misinformation that we are drowning in a way that prevents us from protecting ourselves.\n\nMy parents did a really good job of keeping me safe when I was a kid, and it's part of my responsibility to do the same for them now. But it's not a white, sketchy van that says \"free candy\" on it to be afraid of; it's not even just the coronavirus. It's important to be direct about what we're facing and what we're up against. People need leadership to keep them safe.\n\nHow did you make the decision to turn grief into advocacy?\n\nI saw people in the neighborhood I grew up in waiting in line for hours for [Covid] tests in 107-degree heat -- predominantly immigrants, predominantly Latinx. If I didn't speak out, I didn't know who would. It has been not just for me, but also for my broader community. When we fail, it is landing on the shoulders of people on the front lines, on the communities that are already living on the margins. Our lives deserve to be prioritized.\n\nGovernor [Doug] Ducey was lock step with Trump on reopening quickly -- that caused a spike across the country. I was not comfortable to have him with blood on his hands without being open about that. I felt it was my patriotic duty to be honest with you.\n\nI saw the response from AIDS activists as a model. This isn't about me; this is for people who don't have the opportunity to speak out, to tell their story. When I look at videos of me at the first vigil, I am reconnected with the anger and rage that I felt. I can only relate it to a summer storm in the desert, with wind and dust and lightning and rain. If I didn't channel that into something productive, I was terrified I would implode. So by leaning into the advocacy, I couldn't save my dad's life, but I could potentially have that sort of higher purpose.",

        "body": "More Than a Vote, a group of athletes headlined by LeBron James, is fighting voter suppression in Black electoral districts by pushing to keep polling stations open in key swing states.\n\nMore Than a Vote, a collective of athletes headlined by LeBron James that is fighting to combat voter suppression, will announce a multimillion-dollar initiative to increase the number of poll workers in Black electoral districts ahead of November's general election.\n\nThe project, a collaboration with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, aims to recruit young people to serve at polling locations in Black communities in swing states, including Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Ohio. The effort will involve poll worker recruitment, a paid advertising campaign and a corporate partnership program that will encourage employees to volunteer as poll workers.\n\nElection officials throughout the country have reported a shortage of poll workers to staff in-person voting sites amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has upended every facet of American life -- including the electoral process. In April, Wisconsin, one of the first states to hold a primary election after the virus spread nationally, had to cut in-person locations in Milwaukee to five from 180 because of poll worker shortages. Experts said the closures had a particular effect in Black communities, where access to in-person polling locations is already under threat. Residents in line waited for more than four hours, and many complained about not receiving a mail-in ballot after requesting one. The national outcry after the Wisconsin primary left a lasting impression on the group of athletes, which formed More Than a Vote in June in the wake of a national outcry against ongoing racism.\n\nMr. James and several other basketball stars involved in the More Than a Vote effort are currently quarantined at the N.B.A. campus in Orlando, as the league seeks to finish its season and crown a champion. In a phone interview, two other members of the initiative -- Michael Vick, the former N.F.L. star, and Renee Montgomery of the W.N.B.A. -- framed the efforts as necessary to ensure equitable ballot access.\n\n\"As someone who had their voting rights restored,\" said Mr. Vick, whose record-setting career was sunk by after he pleaded guilty to a felony charge in 2007 for his involvement in a dogfighting ring, \"I want to influence younger people to be a part of this More Than a Vote campaign.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-24T17:49:20.113Z Work by researchers in Hong Kong finds that reinfection may be possible in rare cases. Zoom fixes partial outages that disrupted the first day of virtual classes for many U.S. students. 336 socially distanced Republican delegates gather to renominate Trump for president. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"We want to get them to register, get involved and try to help society in whatever way they can,\" he added. \"It's about becoming a leader in your own right.\"\n\nMs. Montgomery, who plays for the Atlanta Dream, is currently sitting out the women's basketball season to focus on political activism. She is a former college national champion and W.N.B.A. champion with the Minnesota Lynx.\n\n\"I felt like I needed to do something in my community,\" Ms. Montgomery said. \"We can't just protest. We have a responsibility to take those protests and take that energy and march all the way to the polls.\"\n\n\"I live in Atlanta, so this issue is right on my front door,\" she added. \"We have the long lines, it's condensed and Covid is being used as a way to have voter suppression.\"\n\nThis is More Than a Vote's second national campaign. Previous efforts included partnerships with teams in Los Angeles and Atlanta to turn their stadiums into polling places, as well as a statewide effort in Florida to help the formerly incarcerated restore their voting rights. This year, athletes across the country -- and particularly Black athletes -- have seen a surge in political activism mirroring the national wave. Mr. Vick credited people like Mr. James and Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who knelt during the national anthem to protest racism, for making political advocacy a priority for the modern athlete.\n\n\"When you're young, the way you look at life, you don't think that your vote counts,\" Mr. Vick said. \"When that was taken away from me, I felt like I had an obligation. I felt like I did myself a disservice.\"\n\nIn focusing on poll workers, the group has landed on an issue that election officials and civil rights organizations believe will loom large in this year's election. Because election site volunteers had typically been older Americans, a population uniquely affected by the coronavirus, experts such as Sherrilyn Ifill of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund worry about the effect of them staying home this year -- reduced polling locations in November and possibly longer lines, all of which could reduce voter turnout.\n\nMs. Ifill said the push to recruit poll workers was part of a multipronged approach from voting rights organizations, whose persistent concerns about voter suppression and ballot access are now amplified by the coronavirus. Access to mail-in ballots should be ensured, she said, but states should also take precautions to make in-person voting safe and accessible.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome -- which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet -- and received supplemental oxygen.

Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms. More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze.

It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"Black people, particularly middle-aged and older Black people, prefer to vote in person rather than vote by mail,\" Ms. Ifill said. \"We need more poll workers and we need younger poll workers who can be resilient and work during early voting as well.\"\n\nJocelyn Benson, who as Michigan's secretary of state oversees the election process there, said she was grateful for the spotlight the athletes will bring to the issue.\n\n\"We've had three successful elections in Michigan so far this year because we have been able to fully staff our poll,\" Ms. Benson said. \"If we don't have that, we can't operate an election.\"\n\nThe increased attention on the issue, however, has been outpaced by the strong need for poll workers. Detroit and Flint, two of Michigan's urban centers with a high percentage of Black residents, still need 1,000 to 2,000 poll workers, Ms. Benson said.\n\n\"This is the ballgame,\" she said. \"This is not just a benevolent effort. This is not just an important partnership. This is critical.\"",

        "body": "One state learned the hard way that technology won't get us out of this pandemic. But it can help.\n\nThis article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.\n\nIn the coronavirus panic in the spring, Utah hired a small tech company to create an app to trace state residents who were infected with the virus and help notify their contacts about possible exposure.\n\nIt didn't go well.\n\nOnly about 200 people used the virus-alert app, Healthy Together, for its main intended purpose. Utah then shut down the key feature entirely. Critics of Healthy Together said that state officials spent too much on rushed and unproven technology.\n\nThis feels like a familiar tale of failures by government officials and botched pandemic technology. It is, but the story didn't end there.\n\nThe app company, called Twenty, and Utah public health officials focused the app on less ambitious but potentially more useful purposes, including relaying coronavirus test results and digital symptom checks at schools and workplaces. It's too soon to call Healthy Together a success or a failure, but the app now has a manageable purpose.\n\nThe saga of Healthy Together shows both what can go wrong with virus-fighting technologies and how digital helpers -- if we establish trust and don't overstate their capabilities -- have a role to play in the human-led fight against the virus.\n\nLet me state this plainly: Many virus-tracing technologies, like the first version of Healthy Together, have been a mess.\n\nIn Utah, state officials told me that many people were reluctant to share their location information via an app with the public health department so it could try to figure out who they might have come into contact with. The state didn't do much to convince people that the app might be helpful.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak and the Economy 3h ago Around the world, public opinion on the economy has turned 'bleak,' Pew says. 4h ago Michael Bloomberg gives $100 million to historically Black medical schools. 4h ago Help wanted, depending on the industry. See more updates More live coverage: Global\n\nThis is not an isolated problem for contact tracing efforts. People don't necessarily trust government or technology companies. It can feel embarrassing or creepy to tell a public health official who you might have exposed to a dangerous virus. Apple and Google are releasing technology that will make it easier for states to set up virus exposure alerts for smartphones, but it won't fix the trust problem.\n\nIn Utah, Healthy Together dropped the location-tracking technology for now, but it still lets people see a map of coronavirus testing centers near them and offers information about how to get tested and who will pay for it, and simpler stuff like whether restaurants nearby are allowed to serve dine-in meals.\n\nA version of the app also offers questionnaires to assess potential coronavirus symptoms for people who work in some health care facilities and colleges including Brigham Young University.\n\nNone of this is magic, and that's fine. We do need some of these digital helpers to supplement the human-powered fight against the pandemic. We just need to be sure to keep technology restrained to what it can reasonably do.\n\nTwo of Twenty's co-founders, Diesel Peltz and Jared Allgood, were humble about what they learned. \"We came in with a little na\u00efvet\u00e9,\" Peltz told me. \"We had to be honest with ourselves about our limitations and where we can help the [public health] strategy and amplify it.\"\n\nUtah State Representative Andrew Stoddard said that he believed Healthy Together wasn't worth the money, but that it and similar technologies had a role to play in the state's pandemic response.\n\n\"I hope the lesson learned is that technology is innovative and helpful, but there are arenas where technology isn't the best option,\" he said.\n\nIf you don't already get this newsletter in your inbox, please sign up here.\n\nFacebook made new election rules. Now it has to enforce them.\n\nFacebook made several big policy changes on Thursday to try to lower the temperature on a tumultuous U.S. presidential election in November. The new rules are sensible on paper, but the question now is whether Facebook can effectively enforce them.\n\nMy colleague Mike Isaac has all the details on Facebook's new rules. The biggest one to me: Facebook said it would apply an informational label to posts by political candidates or campaigns that try to prematurely declare victory in the election or cast doubt on the legitimacy of mail-in voting.\n\nThis election is going to be unlike any other. Far more Americans are expected to vote by mail to avoid the risk of a coronavirus infection, and that most likely means counting votes will take more time than usual.\n\nIf ballot tallies take days or longer, one concern is that President Trump or other candidates might declare victory before all votes are counted, or dispute the outcome. One late night tweet or unchecked Facebook post from the president could contribute to a lack of public trust in the election system.\n\nAs wild as this might have seemed a few years ago, Facebook has become essential plumbing in democracy, and the company knows the world is watching how it acts in this election.\n\nBut making rules is only half the battle. When the president posted in July a baseless claim about voter fraud, Facebook's attempt at added context was a link to an election information help page. The supposed information label wasn't actually informative about what the president said.\n\nOn Thursday, Facebook added a context label to one of Mr. Trump's posts that did add useful information about what he said.\n\nAnd for Facebook to enforce new rules about the election, it will rely in part on social network users flagging posts that seem off, and on teams of workers who must assess whether a post goes against the company's guidelines.\n\nFor particularly sensitive rules like whether a politician is sowing confusion about an election, I would bet that any decisions about whether to remove a post or append contradictory information will ultimately be made by Facebook executives. Those can be tough calls and might take time to make. And on Facebook, bogus information can get millions of eyeballs in a flash.\n\nBefore we go ...\n\nWhat it's like to be duped by Russian trolls: My colleague Sheera Frenkel talked to one American who wrote for a news website that turned out to be a covert Russian government-backed propaganda campaign. The writer thought it was strange when editors had a poor grasp of English and waved off some of his article ideas. But he didn't find out he was ensnared in a propaganda campaign until a reporter contacted him this week.\n\nWhat does Facebook do when political leaders spew hate? Facebook banned the accounts of a prominent Indian politician, T. Raja Singh, over his online posts and comments that have called Muslims traitors and said some Muslim immigrants should be shot. The Wall Street Journal has been reporting on internal division at Facebook over whether the company has protected Singh and some other members of India's ruling party who have used Facebook to encourage hatred of or violence against Muslims.\n\nInstagram scams work because we want stuff easy and fast: A writer for The Verge bought overpriced and crummy secondhand furniture after seeing it listed on Instagram, and dug into why people fall for Instagram pitches for low-quality or sometimes fraudulent merchandise. \"The scam works by exploiting our own consumerism -- the idea that everything we want should be readily available, and cheap, and delivered within days,\" The Verge wrote.\n\nHugs to this\n\nThis is one big and beautiful sheep.\n\nWe want to hear from you.

        "body": "Classes will start remotely. But the nation's second-largest school district will track infections among nearly 700,000 students and 75,000 employees.\n\nAmid public alarm over the inadequacy of coronavirus testing across the nation, Los Angeles schools on Monday will begin a sweeping program to test hundreds of thousands of students and teachers as the nation's second-largest school district goes back to school -- online.\n\nThe program, which will be rolled out over the next few months by the Los Angeles Unified School District, will administer tests to nearly 700,000 students and 75,000 employees as the district awaits permission from public health authorities to resume in-person instruction, said Austin Beutner, the district's superintendent.\n\nIt appears to be the most ambitious testing initiative so far among major public school districts, most of which are also starting school remotely but have yet to announce detailed testing plans.\n\nNew York City, where the virus has been under control, is the only major school district in the country planning to welcome students back into classrooms part time this fall. The city is asking all staff members to be tested before school starts on Sept 10 and has said it will provide expedited results.\n\nStaff members should be tested regularly throughout the school year, New York City has said. It is not yet clear how often students will be tested or whether the city will take random samples from the 1.1 million children at its 1,800 public schools.\n\nMr. Beutner said that Los Angeles's program, developed over the past four months, would begin this week, well before schools are expected to let students into classrooms, and that it would augment -- and probably far exceed -- existing testing efforts run by the city and county of Los Angeles.\n\nOverseeing the testing will be a task force of epidemiologists, analysts and other experts from the University of California, Los Angeles; Johns Hopkins University; Stanford University; Microsoft; and the insurers Anthem Blue Cross and Health Net. Mr. Beutner said he would lead the initiative with Arne Duncan, who served as education secretary in the Obama administration and who will coordinate with other government agencies.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-16T12:02:59.293Z A teachers' strike closes down a school district in Arizona that was set to begin classes on Monday. The F.D.A. gives emergency approval for a new spit test as U.S. testing stalls. South Korea warns of another outbreak tied to a church. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary measures,\" said Mr. Beutner, adding that the goal was to make the program a national model.\n\nSurging infection rates have put Los Angeles County on a state public health watch list that has prevented schools from allowing students physically back into classrooms. The school district, which announced in July that it would begin the year with only online instruction, was among the first in the nation to abandon plans for even a partial in-person return.\n\nSince then, though reports of new infections appear to be slowly declining, public schools across the country have pulled back from more ambitious plans to reopen as case numbers have remained persistently high.\n\nPublic health experts have said that expanded coronavirus testing, with rapid results, is the key to curbing the spread of the virus, particularly in schools, where teachers and students mingle regularly in close quarters. Six months into the pandemic, however, testing remains a persistent hurdle, with backlogs and other issues at state health departments, including California's, and long wait times in some areas for test results.\n\nThe Trump administration has also provided mixed messages on testing. The nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, has promised \"more testing, not less,\" but the administration's virus testing chief, Adm. Brett P. Giroir, has advised against mass testing.\n\nIn a conference call last week, Admiral Giroir told reporters that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explicitly \"does not recommend routine baseline testing of all students or all employees.\"\n\n\"Not only do we not recommend this strategy of testing everyone on a frequent basis,\" said Admiral Giroir, \"but I think it could instill a false sense of security: 'Well, I'm negative, therefore I can do whatever I want to do.'\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 12, 2020\n\nCan I travel within the United States?Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine for 14 days. Here's an ever-updating list of statewide restrictions. In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own \"pod.\" \"Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,\" the C.D.C. says. If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nMr. Beutner cited advice from the director-general of the World Health Organization: \"Test, test, test.\"\n\nHe noted that a recent survey of district employees found that 88 percent wanted a robust system of testing and tracing. He compared the testing initiative to other broad community efforts that the district has undertaken during the pandemic, such as its provision of more than 50 million free meals.\n\nThe testing program, which is expected to cost the district about $150 million, or about $300 per student, will start small with about a few thousand teachers and other district employees, who will be working from sanitized school facilities rather than from home, Mr. Beutner said. Initial testing, to be done at 42 regional school facilities across the sprawling district, will also include about 2,000 children enrolled by employees at school-based day care programs.\n\nAfter that first round of testing, which Mr. Beutner said was expected to take a few weeks, the district will gradually broaden testing to all employees and students, with a goal in the early phases of establishing a baseline. Student testing will be done at neighborhood schools. Family members who show virus symptoms will also be asked to come in for testing, but the logistics haven't been determined yet, Mr. Beutner said.\n\nEpidemiologists will determine testing frequency, he said, and initial contact tracing will be done by school employees such as school nurses and bus drivers, who have been idled by the county's stay-at home order.\n\nApps developed for the district by Microsoft will be used to manage self-screening, tracking and record-keeping, Mr. Beutner said, and researchers at Stanford, Johns Hopkins and the University of California, Los Angeles will do analysis and epidemiological modeling pro bono. Mr. Beutner said the district would rely on two testing companies to supply and process spit and nasal PCR tests -- Clinical Reference Laboratory in Kansas and SummerBio, a small Bay Area start-up that specializes in automated test processing. The district, he said, will be SummerBio's first customer.\n\n\"The opportunity to use testing to get ahead of the virus was missed in January and again in May due to a lack of capacity,\" Mr. Beutner said. Now, he added, with students stuck at home, Californians have another chance.\n\n\"We must be ready with a robust system of testing and contact tracing so the third time can be the charm,\" he said.\n\nSheryl Gay Stolberg and Eliza Shapiro contributed reporting.",

        "body": "Pressing our hearts together is my husband's fast-track return to the intimacy he grew up with. For me, growing up with a more reserved British dad, it took some getting used to.\n\nSome of us are clearly more suited than others to our current culture of social distancing and virtual get-togethers. My husband and I fall into opposite camps: Seth is a heartfelt, non-ironic hugger from Berkeley, Calif. I am not.\n\nFor me, a hybrid of a British dad and Brooklyn-born mom, used to quick and choppy hellos and goodbyes, Seth's style took some getting used to.\n\nGrowing up, my parents mostly hugged and kissed as an act of reconciliation. My dad is a Brit and I learned to express love the way he does: through wisecracks, banter and play fighting. Instead of a hug at my graduation, it was a few pats on my shoulder and a brisk kiss on my cheek.\n\nWhen Seth and I met, it was spring of my senior year in college in upstate New York: Snow mounds thawed as green buds and tiny bursts of flowers struggled to emerge. After weeks of eyeing each other on our quad, we ran into each other at the bottom of the stairs near the campus apartments. He said something; I don't remember what. I was close enough to smell patchouli on him and note his scruffy sideburns. As much as I'd fantasized about a moment like this -- pulling him close, the ripe potency of our chemistry -- in reality, talking to a crush was too excruciating. I flashed a smile and muttered a one-liner my dad would've admired, before slipping off to my apartment to be alone with my regrets.\n\nTen years and 3,000 miles later, both of us had found our own ways out to California. I'd rolled the dice with a one-way ticket to San Francisco, and Seth had moved to Oakland, adjacent to his home turf.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T09:04:43.454Z The White House announces a major virus test-kit deal, just days after the C.D.C. moved to discourage testing. Trump promises a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, and boasts of his pandemic response. Hurricane Laura and the virus collide in Louisiana and Texas. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nBy age 31, I was eager to graduate from the dating world. One day, while I was scrolling through profiles on OkCupid, Seth's face popped up. I'd recognize those amber eyes anywhere. Fortified by years of therapy and an established career path as a therapist myself, I was as ready as I'd ever be to embark on a relationship with a guy who I'd later find out was the son of a couples' therapist and neuropsychologist. I pinged him (a virtual embrace).\n\nThree days later, there he was: leaning against the wall of a taqueria in San Francisco, skinnier and more freckled than I remembered. He smiled as I approached and, of course, leaned in for a hug. It was my first taste: warm, close and unwavering -- but not awkward. I pulled back in a daze, lest I melt. We ordered burritos and took them to a park. Chomping away, we played the college name game. By the last nub of my burrito, we'd bridged those 10 years.\n\nA few hours later, we sealed the date with a lingering cuddle at a gritty bus stop. We'd kissed at the bar, but it was the hug -- our hearts pressed together so intensely -- that stayed with me. Ten, 11, 12 seconds passed before we parted. I took that feeling home with me on the bus. Never in 31 years had anyone ever hugged me like that.\n\nOver the next few weeks, I discovered that Seth lived alone with a cat and loved ecstatic dancing and skinny-dipping in cold lakes in the Sierras. But what separated him from a lot of men was his emotional availability. He wasn't afraid to let people get close. In fact, he invited almost everyone in. At a friend's party one night, after we'd mutually decided it was time to go, I waved a loud goodbye to everybody before heading out. And then I waited. And waited. Finally, I walked back up the steps and peeped in through the door frame. As it turns out, Seth's way of saying goodbye is hug-centric: No person left unhugged.\n\nBy the one-year mark, we had shifted from rom-com to soap opera drama. My aloofness and privacy triggered Seth's impulse to connect. His need for closeness clashed with my tendency to seek solitude when I was upset. Neither of us backed down. After an argument, if Seth initiated a makeup hug too early, our bodies remained stiff and unforgiving. Hugging at these times held an emptiness; it became a sham.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nWhat made this relationship different from others I'd had was how we always came back to each other in the end: to talk, to listen, to laugh. Seth learned to give me the time I needed before we talked, even if it felt foreign to him. Then he'd say: \"Come here. I need ventral to ventral.\" Pressing our hearts and abdomens together was his fast-track return to the type of love and intimacy he grew up with: lifelong friendships, earnest communication with good eye contact, processing feelings over a cup of tea. Over the years, I gradually shared with him shadowy, cobwebbed parts of myself, and grew less fearful and more appreciative of his brand of intimacy. My hugging style evolved: I began to absorb more, and shy away less.\n\nRapidly, we did everything couples are warned against doing -- move in together, plan a wedding, buy a house, get pregnant -- all in two years' time. After a sushi dinner with our parents to celebrate our pregnancy, my father stood up, not to toast us, but to speed the night along. He said, in his quick, slapdash manner: \"OK, OK, good night, everybody. What good news, but it's time to get home.\" Then he dodged out the door. The rest of us followed, and watched as Seth's father chased mine half a block down the street.\n\n\"Hold on, I need to hug you goodbye,\" he called out, wagging a finger good-naturedly.\n\n\"Oh, come on!\" my father protested. \"We've already hugged once!\"\n\n\"Well,\" Seth's father said, smiling, \"Let me give you one more.\"\n\nSeth and I have been married for six years, and now have two kids, ages 2 and 5. I've had all of this time to embrace the hug, and I've made real progress. But now, with the coronavirus pandemic, the world is taking a long hiatus from hugging. Instead of greeting people in the usual way, I'm now raising elbows from six feet away, air-hugging, virtually hugging, even emoji hugging. In this crisis, my husband and daughters are the only people I touch. When I collapse-hug my husband at the end of a long day, or snuggle my daughters at bedtime, I'm aware that the act of embracing transmits compassion, connection and love -- an invitation to deepen a relationship.\n\nWhen Covid-19 is behind us, I hope we return to hugging, outside our families. But meanwhile, I am grateful to be married to a champion hugger, who has passed on his skills to our daughters. I've come a long way in the art of hugging, and I still have much to learn.\n\nAnd I wonder: What will it mean to hug again on the other side of this?\n\nAriella Cook-Shonkoff is a licensed psychotherapist and art therapist based in Berkeley, Calif.",

        "body": "How college students can stay healthy during an unpredictable fall semester.\n\nCollege life was designed around community and togetherness. Now we are attempting to retrofit it for the opposite -- with physical distancing, fewer people and the elimination of most in-person gatherings.\n\nThe final days of summer offer an opportunity for incoming students and their families to prepare for a semester anchored by public health principles.\n\nAs an infectious disease expert and chief health officer for the University of Michigan, I've spent the past four months deeply involved in planning efforts to bring thousands of young people back to a campus as safely as possible. I have talked with public health and student services colleagues at many other colleges, and while each school may have a different approach to testing or allowing students to move into residence halls with roommates, certain aspects of campus life will be broadly similar. Following are suggestions for how to minimize the health risks on and around campuses this fall.\n\nTravel and Move In\n\nSince the number of people who can assist with the actual move-in process and the time allotted for unloading will be limited at most schools, pack efficiently and take care of longer goodbyes ahead of time.\n\nOnce students are on campus, nonessential travel (especially out of state) will be discouraged. Most schools have canceled fall breaks and will wrap up in-person learning before Thanksgiving, with any remainder of the semester completed remotely.\n\nParent and family weekends are among the many events that will not happen. With limitations on in-person visits, students should plan on alternative ways to stay connected. Create a schedule for regular video chat check-ins to provide support but also allow for independence.\n\nYour Room Is Your Home\n\nStudents living in residence halls can expect limits on movement (to connecting halls, for example), use of common areas, and guests. Because of the need to maintain physical distance, most students will spend a lot of time in their rooms, especially if libraries and other gathering places are closed or have capacity limits. Your room will be your \"home\" and the place you study, sleep, eat and attend class virtually.\n\nThink carefully about what you need to be comfortable and productive, but resist bringing excess stuff. You will appreciate the extra space, and packing up will be easier whenever you leave. If you have a roommate, the circumstances of this semester present unique pressures. You will spend far more time in your room than ever before, and you are each vulnerable to the risks the other takes, so you need to have an honest conversation to set expectations and boundaries. Open communication, respect, kindness and patience will go a long way.\n\nAlthough policies may vary, face coverings will be part of your uniform anytime you leave your room. Face coverings provide protection only if worn correctly, so try different types of cloth masks to find one that fits well and is comfortable to wear for several hours. You should be able to talk and move around without the mask requiring frequent adjustment. Think of face coverings like underwear -- have several pairs, wash them often and don't share.\n\nEating on the Run\n\nCampus dining halls will continue to offer meals, but dine-in options will be limited and may require reservations. The alternative will be takeout meals consumed in designated eating areas or in your room.\n\nBecause of capacity limits and a screening process for entry, getting food may require more time. Students should have some shelf-stable snacks and meals that can be prepared with minimal equipment in their rooms, such as instant oatmeal, canned soup, dried fruit, peanut butter and crackers. A refrigerator and microwave will help. Since access to a full-service grocery store may be limited, consider options to restock, including delivery services and convenience stores.\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakBack to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 12, 2020\n\nThe latest highlights as the first students return to U.S. schools.\n\nA Georgia school district that reopened last week has quarantined more than 900 students and staff members. Some in the community see it as a predictable debacle; others, a rousing success.The Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences will not play college football this fall. \"Too much uncertainty, too much risk,\" the Big Ten commissioner said.As districts decide how to handle the fall semester, parents are podding up, scheduling tutors and enlisting relatives. Explore your pandemic schooling options.A district in Illinois says students need to follow the school dress code, even when learning from home. No pajama pants allowed.Classrooms\n\nWith large, introductory classes being fully remote on most campuses, in-person learning will likely be limited to small groups and activities that cannot be done remotely such as science labs, studio work and performance programs. Explore opportunities to get extra help for classwork via office hours, review sessions and tutoring resources, all of which may be done virtually. Successful remote learning means having the right technology and ensuring stable access to broadband. Many schools have laptop programs and other ways to support students who do not have reliable equipment.\n\nStaying Healthy\n\nInvestigate the local health resources and have a plan for what to do if you develop symptoms suggestive of Covid-19. Larger institutions are more likely to have a full-service health center on campus, while smaller schools might have longstanding relationships with health care providers in the community.\n\nWith more than 6,600 cases of coronavirus already linked to colleges by the end of July, many campus health centers have gained considerable experience managing infections and are well positioned to provide compassionate, student-focused care for mild to moderate illness. The medical staff can facilitate transfers to emergency departments if needed. Most colleges have designated living space for students who become ill or require quarantine after close exposure to someone with Covid-19. If home is within a few hours and students can safely travel by car, this may be a good option.\n\nWhile student health fees often cover routine services, this is not the same as health insurance. Be sure to review policies about out-of-network coverage for your health insurance plan. Depending on restrictions, it may be prudent to purchase insurance plans offered by the school. Depending on the state, low-income students may qualify for Medicaid coverage.\n\nCovid-19 health kits should include a functional thermometer and basic, over-the-counter medications (such as acetaminophen, cough drops, cough suppressants). Hand sanitizer and disinfecting wipes can help keep the living space clean. Fingertip pulse oximeters, which are growing in popularity, can be used to measure blood oxygen levels should symptoms of Covid-19 develop. This type of monitoring can be an early warning sign, before a patient has difficulty breathing, that urgent medical evaluation is needed.\n\nGetting a flu shot will be especially important this year, with concerns that concurrent outbreaks of Covid-19 and influenza will quickly overwhelm health system capacity. The flu vaccine this year is expected to be available starting in September.\n\nDepending on state restrictions, indoor fitness centers will likely remain closed. Develop a regular exercise routine, ideally with activities that can be done outdoors or with minimal equipment in your room.\n\nPromoting Social Well-Being\n\nEven before Covid-19, loneliness has been epidemic on college campuses. Social and emotional well-being is essential to overall health. Young adults need face-to-face interaction with other young adults. The focus should be on picking the safest options, making good decisions and managing social expectations.\n\nMeeting in person means sticking with small numbers (10 or less), wearing masks and being outdoors whenever possible. Be open to different types of interactions -- take a walk, play video games remotely, sit in a circle outside. There will be less mixing but perhaps more potential for deep friendships.\n\nTaking care of yourself means getting enough sleep and making good decisions about drugs, alcohol, vaping and sexual activity, all of which pose health concerns during normal times and can also increase Covid-19 risk. For some, seeing pictures of other students at parties is likely to increase FOMO -- the fear of missing out -- but some colleges regard hosting parties as a violation that could result in being thrown out of school.\n\nIn This Together\n\nStarting college during a pandemic means taking on both shared risk and shared responsibility. While testing has a role, consistent adherence to basic public health measures -- wearing a mask, washing your hands and physical distancing -- is the most important aspect of prevention. A successful fall semester requires a social contract of sorts, since your behavior affects everyone around you as well as everyone they are exposed to. Ultimately behavior (not the academic calendar) will determine how long the semester lasts.\n\nDr. Preeti Malani is chief health officer and a professor in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Michigan.",

        "body": "The coronavirus has forced a race celebrated for its accessibility to embrace social distancing. But can you take an entire country along for the ride from inside a bubble?\n\nOne rider said he worried cycling fans would ignore edicts about masks. A small-town mayor said he would do his best to abide by limits on crowd sizes. A team official expressed concerns about sweat, and spit, and at least one mechanic said he had stopped sharing his tools.\n\nThe coronavirus-delayed Tour de France plans to start its serpentine, 2,156-mile journey around France on Saturday, two months later than its traditional July window but still uncomfortably in the middle of the ongoing pandemic. It will be the 107th edition of the cycling race, and unlike any before it.\n\nIn any year, the Tour is equal parts cycling race and traveling carnival, the open-air street fair of European sports where millions of fans converge on the route and pinch the course's narrow roads like fat molecules clogging a body's arteries.\n\nBut this is not any year. As France works to prevent new virus cases, riders, teams and fans who plan to be part of the race's 21 stages will be subject to new rules involving testing and contact tracing; about what constitutes an outbreak and who will be allowed to continue in the race if there is one; and about crowd sizes and guest limits in a race that is about community and connectivity, not isolation and social distancing.\n\n\"It will still be the Tour,\" said Beno\u00eet Cosnefroy, 24, a rider for AG2R La Mondiale who rode his first Tour last year, \"but without the euphoria that the public brings.\"\n\nThe first stage on Saturday will depart from the sunny southern city of Nice, where a rise in infections this month prompted the city's mayor to make mask wearing mandatory in all outdoor areas. The race is set to end in Paris on Sept. 20, though that, like everything else in the pandemic era, is subject to change.\n\nTo give the race its best chance of success, Amaury Sport Organisation, which runs the Tour, has instituted stringent protocols to the 22 teams. Every team member -- eight riders and a maximum of 22 support staff members -- first had to pass two coronavirus tests. Everyone will be tested again on both rest days, on Sept. 7 and 14.\n\nIn addition, team doctors will be required to complete a daily health checklist for every rider and staff member to identify any symptoms of possible infection, including fever, fatigue, shortness of breath or coughing.\n\nBut how can a sprawling, snaking race that carries the whole country along for the ride be contained in a bubble? The short answer is it can't.\n\nThroughout France, those who participate in or follow \"le Tour\" see it as a nationwide celebration, highlighting not only a beloved sport but also the country's landscapes and small towns for weeks before it arrives, with much fanfare, for a final sprint on France's most famous avenue, the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es.\n\nIn Europe, this year's Tour carries added significance because it is one of the few crown jewels left -- along with next month's French Open tennis championships -- on a sports calendar already stripped of many of its biggest moments.\n\nBut it is also because the Tour is distinctive in an era of globalized sports, a major event treasured and celebrated for its accessibility. It is a race where the public can approach their heroes, where they can see them every day for weeks if they wish to follow them, where they come close enough to touch them as they muscle their way up mountain passes.\n\nAnd unlike most other sports in France, fans don't come to the Tour. Often, it comes to them.\n\n\"There is something epic about the Tour, and accessible to all at the same time, which makes it so unique,\" said Philippe Gaboriau, a sociologist who has written a book about the race. \"Anyone can go.\"\n\nSome villages and cities wait years, if not decades, before seeing the peloton roll past.\n\n\"We will never host the Olympics, or the World Cup, but we are about to host the Tour de France, whether there's a pandemic or not,\" said Guy Saillard, the mayor of Champagnole, a village of fewer than 8,000 people where riders are scheduled to arrive for the 19th stage. Saillard said he had invested several hundred thousand euros in renovating the town's main road ahead of the race.\n\nMany mayors said they expected fewer visitors than if the Tour had held to its regular dates in July because children will be back in school, vacationers will be back at work and international travel is extremely difficult. Crowds at the departure and arrival areas have been limited this year to 5,000, a figure that will be reduced even more since the cap includes the riders, team staff members and guests of the Tour and the individual teams.\n\n\"We will still try to celebrate it, even though the resurgence of the pandemic remains a threat,\" said Eric Houlley, the mayor of Lure, the tiny eastern town where the race's penultimate stage -- if it gets that far -- will see riders depart from the main plaza, between the high school and the local movie theater.\n\n\"We are at the mercy of the authorities and we will do what we will be told to do,\" Houlley added.\n\nThe same will be true inside the race bubble. Christian Prudhomme, the Tour's general director, said the teams would remain isolated, along with some security officials and the organization's staff members, for the duration of the race. If a rider tests positive, he will have to drop out, Prudhomme said, and so will everyone who may be at risk after coming in close contact with him.\n\n\"It's a bit of a headache,\" said Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Grappe, the head of performance at the Groupama-FDJ team. \"If a rider has some symptoms and is tested in the morning but doesn't have the results right away, should he ride that day?\"\n\nBut Grappe warned of competitive concerns, too. A rider, or a team, in contention for the leader's yellow jersey would have a strong incentive to keep any virus concerns secret.\n\n\"If, two days before the end of the Tour, the yellow jersey is at risk, is he going to fill in the form in honesty and run the risk of being disqualified?\" Grappe asked.\n\nPrudhomme dismissed such concerns, arguing that it was \"everyone's responsibility\" to respect the protocols. \"I don't see how people wouldn't respect the rules,\" he said.\n\nTo mitigate infection risks, everyone inside the Tour bubble will be required to wear face masks before and after each stage, including while inside team vehicles and during news conferences, all of which will be held online.\n\nAaron Fairley, a team mechanic for Trek-Segafredo, said he worried that not being able to move freely would affect his ability to do his job. \"Borrowing a piece of equipment or asking for friendly advice can be critical in a race, and this is now impossible,\" he said in an email.\n\nYet an event that traverses more than 2,000 miles of public roads and passes by the homes of millions of fans simply cannot be held behind closed doors.\n\nNicolas Roche, a member of the Sunweb team, said, \"The stadium at the Tour de France is out your front door, so I think it is complicated to tell people not to go outside.\"\n\nRoche said he was worried that policing behavior outside the bubble will be impossible. At the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, a short Tour tuneup held this month, a local mandate had required fans to wear masks to be on the side of the road, but Roche said many people ignored it.\n\n\"But how can you control it?\" he said. \"You can't have a policeman in front of every house.\"\n\nSome saw victory in the fact that this year's Tour was taking place at all. More than 30,000 people in France have died after contracting the coronavirus, making the country one of the hardest-hit in Europe. A resurgence of cases in recent weeks has renewed fears that large gatherings like the ones expected at the Tour will lead to new outbreaks.\n\nThat was why, two weeks before the scheduled start of this year's race, the former champion Stephen Roche picked up the phone and called his son.\n\nRoche knows well the physical toll that cycling's supreme spectacle inflicts on its participants. In 1987, on his way to becoming Ireland's only Tour de France champion, he fell off his bike at the end of a grueling Stage 21 climb, temporarily lost movement in his arms and legs, and left the finish area in an ambulance.\n\nNicolas Roche is Stephen's son, and he is competing in his 10th Tour this year. He said his father owned a home in tourist-friendly Nice, where the race will begin, and had seen how quickly the virus can spread when outsiders converge in one place.\n\nStephen Roche worried what that could mean for the packs of riders and their teams as they flock together like migrating birds, and he told his son about the rugby players at a Paris club who developed lung damage after they were infected.\n\n\"The last thing he wants is for me to be sick because he also knows it could permanently damage your body,\" Nicolas Roche said.\n\nWhat is certain is there will not be a repeat of the 1987 trophy ceremony. That day, television footage captured a 3-year-old Nicolas being handed to his father in the middle of an interview after his victory. Still in the winner's yellow jersey, Stephen Roche kissed Nicolas on the cheek while his smiling son chewed on a finger.\n\nNo such scene will be possible this year. Family members have been excluded from the team bubbles. Nicolas Roche, the father of a young daughter, said he did not expect anyone to have any problem with the rule.",

        "body": "With Covid-related restrictions in place, massage therapists are reimagining ways to help their clients.\n\nAfter the coronavirus lockdowns took hold in March, Suzanne Kwasniewski, a licensed massage therapist in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., began calling her regular clients every week or two, at first just to see how they were doing. \"When I spoke with some of my regulars, particularly those I've known a long time, I picked things up in their voices,\" she said. Sometimes it was fear and frustration. Other times she sensed deep-seated emotional distress.\n\nAs the weeks rolled by, she realized she could help them remotely.\n\nShe had met with one client, a woman in her 90s, in an aromatic therapy room every other week for more than five years, a routine abruptly disrupted by the pandemic.\n\n\"When I spoke with her, I knew she was exhibiting symptoms that she has struggled with before, slipping back into a childhood trauma due to her current Covid-related isolation,\" Ms. Kwasniewski explained.\n\nShe considered what she would do if her client were able to lie on her massage table. \"I would do some polarity work, some first and second chakra work, and some acupressure around the lungs and heart, points that relate to self-love,\" she said, referring to ancient meditation practices and the seven chakras that are considered the main energy centers of the body.\n\nSans table, remotely, she taught her client how to do some acupressure herself -- walking her through finding and holding light pressure on a point that practitioners of energy work, including reiki healing, associate with grief.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-27T08:00:21.368Z Almost 500 million schoolchildren have been cut off from learning, a report finds.

If the area is sore, she explained, it is likely related to grief. \"Rub the area, and over time it should become less tender -- along with decreased feelings of sadness,\" she said.\n\nMany of Ms. Kwasniewski's clients have told her they won't be coming back for an actual touch massage any time soon. And while she has invested in a new ultraviolet lamp, HEPA filter and other antivirus gear, she says: \"Opening my physical practice seems further and further off.\"\n\nWhen the time is right, she envisions seeing fewer clients each day and probably offering a minimum of 75 minutes on the table, rather than the current 60 minutes, to help accommodate the time-consuming cleaning regimens she'll need to conduct between massages.\n\nJoyce Gauthier, a licensed massage therapist in New York and North Carolina who lives on the 32-foot Duchess, a sailing ketch she shares with her husband and Shih Tzu, Loki, said that she has seen \"everything across the board these past months\" among the 2,000 or so practitioners who are part of her online massage community. Known as the Sailing Massage Therapist, Ms. Gauthier offers webinars, instructional videos and social media posts for continuing education. Pre-pandemic, she also held in-person courses for empowerment, business growth and hands-on learning.\n\n\"Massage therapists are expanding their online offerings -- teaching clients self-massage and stretches, meditations, etc., utilizing distance healing over the phone or Zoom and other platforms,\" she said. Some are \"finding other jobs, going back to school, closing their businesses.\"\n\nShe also hears from many who miss the hands-on benefits of massage. \"Clients have realized how much they relied on massage therapy, not as a luxury 'beauty' service, but for pain relief, symptom management and mental health,\" Ms. Gauthier said.\n\nKaren Ciancetta, a licensed massage therapist in Schenectady N.Y., who has been in practice for more than two decades, recently began seeing clients again. \"Many people contacted me over these months asking that I call them first when I start working again,\" she said. \"I have another contingent, several very regular clients, telling me they won't be coming back for at least a year.\"\n\n\"While it feels great to be back at the work I truly love, I am planning to go slowly,\" Ms. Ciancetta said. She has spent the past several months keeping up with frequently changing Covid-related restrictions for reopening, including requirements from New York State and guidelines from the American Massage Therapy Association.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nFor current compliance, clients are asked to come only five minutes ahead of their appointment and leave immediately after to minimize wait room lingering in close quarters. Both she and her clients must wear masks throughout the session. She must do daily temperature checks and fill out symptom checklist questionnaires. She is also required to be tested for coronavirus every two weeks.\n\n\"Much is the same, at least for the client. And that is what I am working hard to achieve,\" she said. She is looking into televisits and phone consults for the clients she knows well who don't feel comfortable meeting in person.\n\n\"With someone whose body I have worked enough to really understand what they describe to me, I am comfortable without the additional information I get from my hands,\" she said. \"I could easily demonstrate a self-massage technique,\" for example, placing two tennis balls in a sock and strategically rolling or lying on them to relieve back pain.\n\nFor now, she is happy to be back at her table, with natural light beaming in from a small window, her new frequently changed table coverings and the quiet humming of a recently installed protective air filter. Along with others in her profession, she is reinventing her practice in ways she never would have thought about before the arrival of Covid-19.",

But the World Health Organization warned in May of a \"massive increase in mental health conditions in the coming months,\" fueled by anxiety and isolation as well as by the fear of contagion and the deaths of relatives and friends.\n\nA survey conducted in June by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that more than 30 percent of adults in the United States were reporting symptoms consistent with anxiety or depression since the coronavirus pandemic began.\n\nDepression is an illness that affects more than 264 million people worldwide, according to the W.H.O. Dr. Timothy Sullivan, the psychiatry and behavioral sciences chairman at Staten Island University Hospital, described it as a complicated mental state.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\n\"Depending on how it's defined, anyone, particularly at a time like this, could be experiencing some of the symptoms,\" Dr. Sullivan said, including trouble sleeping and low energy.\n\nDepression is a result of individual biological risk factors coupled with influences in the environment, Dr. Sullivan said. \"When someone experiences a loss, we know that it can make them sad,\" he said, citing one example. \"But if that loss also causes them to change fundamental routines that are important to their health, that's going to create an additional risk factor.\"\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, he said, \"we've learned that when people experience significant disruptions in their daily routines, those disruptions can predispose people to depression.\"\n\nAsked how the news could affect a person's mood or battle with depression, Dr. Sullivan said: \"I think the main risk with news events is that people tend to ruminate about them. We know that when people ruminate, it increases feelings of helplessness and, in some cases, hopelessness, and that mental state does worsen mood and increases risk of depression.\"\n\nDr. Sullivan said that if you think you may be experiencing symptoms of depression, you should review your daily routines and try to establish healthy patterns, including managing sleep, eating at regular times of the day, exercising and having meaningful social interactions early in the morning, if possible.",

        "body": "Residents were left ill and relying on bottled water. Health officials said the effects on children were most concerning.\n\nThe state of Michigan is expected to pay about $600 million to victims of the Flint water crisis, according to two people with knowledge of a major settlement that is set to be announced this week.\n\nThe money would largely be designated for children in Flint who were poisoned by lead-tainted tap water after officials changed the city's water supply six years ago, setting off a crisis that drew national attention and remains a worry for many residents.\n\nDetails of the settlement were not released and lawyers and public officials involved in the case declined to comment on Wednesday night. But tens of thousands of Flint residents were expected to be eligible to receive money under the settlement, which is subject to approval by a federal judge in Michigan.\n\nThe individual amounts received from the settlement would depend on Flint residents' degree of suffering and damage from drinking the water.\n\nThe settlement is the culmination of more than 18 months of negotiations, meant to answer a difficult question for the residents of a city battered by catastrophe: What are the victims of the Flint water crisis owed?\n\nIn 2014, as a cost-saving measure for a city in deep financial distress, officials in Flint, led by a state-appointed emergency manager, switched the city's water supply from Lake Huron to the notoriously foul Flint River. Officials failed to add corrosion controls to the tap water, investigations later found, allowing lead and other chemicals to leach from the old, worn pipes into the drinking supply.\n\nIt did not take long before Flint residents knew there was something terribly wrong with their water. It tasted metallic and often appeared to be green or light brown. Many people began feeling ill and experiencing skin rashes, hair loss and other mysterious symptoms.\n\nBut when they confronted elected officials and demonstrated outside City Hall, their pleas were dismissed.\n\nMonths later, testing showed increased and alarming levels of lead in the blood of some Flint children. Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, a local pediatrician, and other scientists and researchers raised warnings that were initially disregarded by state and local officials. In fall 2015, in the face of overwhelming evidence, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan acknowledged that the water was not fine.\n\n'Double Challenge Mode' in Flint, Where Virus Follows Water Crisis\n\nResidents of Flint, Mich., still reeling after the city's tainted-water crisis, are now tackling coronavirus worries. Some are still drinking bottled water.\n\nIn the years since, the city and the state have taken steps to help Flint residents recover.\n\nThe water source in Flint was switched back to Lake Huron water, which is treated in Detroit. But in Flint, it is still common to use bottled water for cooking, drinking and even bathing, since suspicion of government officials runs high.\n\nSome of the work to repair pipes in Flint remains unfinished. Last week, Mayor Sheldon Neeley announced that the multiyear project to replace lead service lines was in its final phase, with fewer than 2,500 Flint homes awaiting line replacement. The project, financed in an $87 million settlement with the state of Michigan, was originally promised to be completed by January 2020. It was paused again this spring because of the coronavirus pandemic and restarted in June.\n\nLast year, Attorney General Dana Nessel announced that her office was dropping pending criminal cases against government officials who were implicated in the scandal, but she pledged to continue investigating. Her office has not filed additional charges since.\n\nThousands of Flint residents have filed lawsuits against the state.\n\nTwo court-appointed mediators helped the parties reach an agreement: former Senator Carl Levin of Michigan and Judge Pamela Harwood, who is retired from the Wayne County Circuit Court.\n\nAnyone who was living in Flint between 2014 and 2016 could be eligible for a claim. The payments are expected to be distributed beginning in spring 2021.\n\nKathleen Gray contributed reporting.",

        "body": "LAKESIDE, Calif. -- This is America: a family crammed in a minivan driving mile after mile across San Diego County, first to one food giveaway and then to another and then to more.\n\nTo Mary's Donuts, in rustic downtown Lakeside, for day-old chocolate frosted, maple-and-bacon glazed and pastries the size of catcher's mitts.\n\nSixteen miles west to Jewish Family Service for big, fresh mangoes, boxes of hard-boiled eggs, cheese and lamb stew. Another 20 minutes south to the Ocean Discovery Institute for diapers and school supplies. To the Salvation Army for bottled water, oatmeal, a cake. All of it piled high into the back.\n\nSince the coronavirus pandemic upended her life and so many others', Alexis Frost Cazimero has spent most days this way, gathering food for her four children as well as neighbors in need. She pulls her packed silver Volkswagen van alongside the BMWs and Mercedeses as they edge their way through the long, snaking food lines. Where else but America can luxury and poverty get so close together that, in essence, they become one?\n\n\"I want people to understand, the face of the needy is different now,\" said Ms. Cazimero, who has joined a new class of Americans who never imagined they would have to take a spot in a modern-day bread line. \"Just because I have a car doesn't mean I have enough money to buy food.\"\n\nThe pandemic has exposed the fragile nature of success for millions of Americans: material markers of outward stability, if not prosperity, but next to nothing to fall back on when times get tough.\n\nIn long conversations around the country this August -- at kitchen tables, in living rooms and in cars during slow-moving food lines with rambunctious children in the back -- Americans reflected on their new reality. The shame and embarrassment. The loss of choice in something as basic as what to eat. The worry over how to make sure their children get a healthy diet. The fear that their lives will never get back on track.\n\nThere was the family in Jackson, Miss., that relied on a local food bank over the summer, even though before the pandemic they had been making almost six figures a year. That is a nice living in a place like Jackson, and it got them a house in the leafy Belhaven neighborhood, a Chevy Suburban and beach vacations to Florida.\n\nOr the single mother in Tennessee who had finally pushed her way into the middle class with a job that paid enough to send her oldest daughter to private school, only to find herself accepting food from charity.\n\nMs. Cazimero, 40, faced her new financial circumstances with as much equanimity as determination, even as it shook her sense of what it meant to have made it. Before the pandemic, she was a hair stylist at a salon owned by her mother-in-law that would shut down in accordance with California's coronavirus rules. She also ran her own events business, which had been \"rocking and rolling\" after a lucrative holiday season decking out car dealerships for Christmas. Her husband, Adam, saw far fewer people come into the local Ford dealership where he works, and his commissions have plummeted.\n\nThese days she has become an armchair therapist to friends who feel ashamed at not being able to afford enough food; a logistics specialist in how she navigates the schedules of all the pantries in San Diego County; and a food procurer and distributor to the needy, even as she is needy herself.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-03T07:54:49.941Z The University of South Carolina reports that more than 1,000 students currently have the virus. The C.D.C. tells health officials to be ready to distribute a vaccine by November, raising concerns over politicized timing. In Iowa, college students staged a sickout, and a football opener won't have fans after all. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"Before, I always helped out,\" she said. \"But I wasn't the one who needed it. Now I need it.\"\n\nAfter making her rounds, Ms. Cazimero returned to her modest house in a development studding a hillside, and separated out what will go to her family, and what she will give away to neighbors and others. Over Facebook and text message groups, informal barter networks have sprouted among needy families. \"You have toilet paper? Let's trade,\" she said.\n\nAnd then there are the private messages from friends saying they need help but are embarrassed at not being able to provide for their families anymore.\n\nShe reminds them they are not the only ones. \"Dude,\" she said, \"none of us can because we can't work.\"\n\n'The Great Depression\n\nWith Minivans'\n\nWhen historians look back on our pandemic-stricken times, there will perhaps be one indelible image that captures the attention of future generations: the endless lines of cars across the country filled with hungry Americans.\n\n\"I call it the Great Depression with minivans,\" said Terry McNamara, who on a recent morning was behind the wheel in a line of cars, their trunks opened as they wound through the parking lot of Parma Senior High School in a working-class suburb of Cleveland that was once America's fastest-growing city.\n\nWith his daughter, Laura Horsburgh, and five grandchildren along for the ride, Mr. McNamara, 74, drove his car through the procession as it moved along with military precision. At each station a coach or a teacher or even the principal loaded up the trunk with milk, or fresh produce from local farms -- sometimes plump tomatoes or corn on the cob -- or boxes of soup and lentils and cans of tuna. How much food one got depended on how many children were in the car. At the last stop, inside the school's auto repair shop, volunteers offered watermelons and storybooks -- Dr. Seuss and Berenstain Bears.\n\n\"The kids love to go and see what is new,\" Ms. Horsburgh said.\n\nThe numbers of Americans seeking help from food banks have swelled despite an unprecedented expansion of the federal government's food stamp program in the midst of the pandemic.\n\nJust one food bank in Memphis served more than 18,000 people between March and August, 10 times as many as over the same period last year.\n\n\"Folks who had really good jobs and were able to pay their bills and never knew how to find us,\" said Ephie Johnson, the president and chief executive of Neighborhood Christian Centers. \"A lot of people had finally landed that job, were helping their family, and able to do a little better, and then this takes you out.\" In her 30 years of charitable work in Memphis, she said, \"I have not seen it quite like this.\"\n\nIn one week in late July nearly 30 million Americans reported they did not have enough to eat, according to a government survey. Among households with children, one in three reported insufficient food, the highest level in the nearly two decades the government has tracked hunger in America, said Lauren Bauer, who studies food insecurity at the Brookings Institution.\n\n\"What's happening with children right now is unprecedented in modern times,\" Ms. Bauer said.\n\nAs painful as the summer was, as difficult as it became for so many families to afford decent food, the situation could get worse, especially with unemployment benefits drying up for many people and Washington unable to agree on a new stimulus package. Then there is the virus itself: It could surge back in the fall and shutter businesses again, putting more people out of work and into the food lines.\n\nFeeding America, which oversees the country's largest network of food banks and pantries, has projected that up to 54 million Americans could be food insecure before the end of the year, a 46 percent increase since the pandemic began. The group has reported a 60 percent increase in the number of people it serves, and said that four in 10 people are first-time recipients of food aid.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Feeding America's volunteers have surveyed recipients, sending dispatches back to headquarters that read like raw intelligence reports from a nation in need.\n\n\"It was obvious that several people who came through our drive-through mobile pantry had never been to a pantry before,\" reads one account from Terre Haute, Ind.\n\nIn Cleveland, a woman who had once been prosperous enough to be a donor to the local food bank found herself on the receiving end, collecting food and also flowers on Mother's Day.\n\nIn July, a report came back from New Orleans: \"We have met so many people who are seeking the assistance from a food bank for the first time. In a 'normal' year, it's not uncommon to hear someone say, 'Six months ago, I never dreamed I'd need to ask for help getting food.' But over the course of the pandemic response the number of people telling us has grown by magnitudes.\"\n\nWhat the numbers do not capture is the powerful emotions of shame or embarrassment that many say they feel, having fallen so suddenly into the lines of the desperate, and seeing so many hard-earned prizes of middle-class life -- the nice car, the vacations, the ability to buy what they want when they want -- fall away.\n\nCiara Jones, a single mother in Memphis, grew up poor but in recent years worked her way to economic stability. She was hired last year as a manager at Logan's Roadhouse, a restaurant chain in the South, earning $60,000 a year -- more money than she had ever made. She put her oldest daughter in a private Christian school, bought a new white Honda Accord and took her four children on vacation to Six Flags in St. Louis.\n\n\"I felt myself finally in the middle class,\" Ms. Jones, 33, said.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, and Logan's closed, but not before she was allowed to take home T-bone steaks and chicken wings and hamburger patties from the restaurant's freezer, which helped for a little while. And so did the extra $600 a week in unemployment she was receiving. But that has ran out, and now she is receiving $275 per week in benefits, barely enough to cover her monthly rent of $975. She said she was ashamed to get food from Neighborhood Christian Centers, and is embarrassed every time she pulls out her food stamp card at the grocery store.\n\n\"I've always been a strong woman, a strong mother,\" she said. \"I don't want my kids to see me struggle or stressed.\"\n\nThey Thought Poverty\n\nWas in the Rearview Mirror\n\nThe Belhaven neighborhood of Jackson, Miss., is filled with charming bungalows, stately old homes and canopied streets. Lily Victory lives in a small, white clapboard house on the edge of the neighborhood.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nAs a child, Ms. Victory was in foster care sometimes and grew up \"super-poor,\" she said. Food was always scarce. Her parents, she said, were too proud to apply for discounted lunches, so she never ate at school.\n\nBefore the pandemic, she worked as a contractor with the military. Her husband, Mike, is a machinist at a box factory, and together they earned a little less than $100,000 a year.\n\n\"We had nothing to worry about,\" she said. \"We had savings. We were saving up to put a down payment on a house. We took a couple vacations a year. The kids got whatever they wanted.\"\n\nAfter losing her job, and after her husband's hours were cut, they were soon staring at an eviction notice. They were unable to make the $1,100 rent payment. The Chevy Suburban was one of the first things to go. Every day she awoke to a feeling of \"impending doom.\"\n\nShe called around to social services organizations and churches searching for help paying the rent. She was instead directed to a food bank, the Good Samaritan Center. Save the money you would spend on food and put it toward rent, she was told.\n\n\"I thought about a food bank and I was like, I don't want to do that because if you are going to a food bank you really need it,\" she said as she barely touched her lunch at a Mediterranean restaurant in Jackson. \"I didn't want to take it away from someone.\"\n\nShe went anyway, as painful as it was.\n\n\"I lied to my children,\" she said, her eyes unblinking.\n\nTo explain why there were so many things she did not normally buy -- like cans of Coke and Sprite, or boxes of cupcakes -- she told them they were a special treat because they were cooped up in the house. And to explain why she was not buying usual items like Lunchables, she said the shelves at the grocery store were bare because of the pandemic.\n\nAmid Struggle,\n\nGratitude and Silver Linings\n\nAs she drove from one food pantry to another in eastern San Diego County, Ms. Cazimero pointed out some of the businesses that have closed permanently. She passed through the center of El Cajon, her hometown, where she used to put up Christmas decorations at the promenade.\n\nShe was on her way to pass out doughnuts at a trailer community in the shadow of a busy freeway. Helping others find food, she said, has brought her purpose. She may have less money now, but she also has less anxiety. That is because she no longer is driven to exhaustion managing the children and work. There is no work anymore.\n\n\"I can go with less, and we have spent so much more valuable time as a family,\" she said.\n\nAbout 2,500 miles and three time zones away, in Erie, Penn., Claire Hudson, a single mother, lost her customer service job. For the first time, she went to a food bank. Like millions of Americans, she suddenly had little choice in what to eat, forced to accept whatever is boxed up and loaded in the trunk.\n\nMany food banks offer fresh produce from local farms and prime cuts of meat. But giveaway boxes are often stuffed with bread and cakes and cookies.\n\n\"In the richest country in the world, and we are, we make it so easy to be unhealthy,\" Ms. Cazimero said.\n\nThe crisis of food insecurity has further exposed how an unhealthy diet contributes to conditions like obesity and diabetes that put people at higher risk for complications from the virus.\n\nWith little choice, Ms. Hudson picked out what she and her son could use and donated the rest to those even more in need. She noticed a growing homeless population so started stuffing what she called \"blessing bags\" with sugary cereals like Froot Loops, graham crackers and pudding.\n\nWhen she began handing them out to homeless people, she let them pick what they liked. \"I started giving them a choice,\" she said. \"Hey, this is what I have, does any of this interest you? The choice for me came from not having a choice in what we got.\"\n\nBack in Ohio, Ms. Horsburgh, a stay-at-home mother, and her husband, Chris, a house painter whose jobs dwindled when the pandemic hit, worry plenty about money. But the children look forward to the weekly outings to the high school parking lot to pick up food -- a routine in an uncertain time.\n\nAs the pandemic drags on, our understanding of the nature of the needy in the United States is changing, and with that change new questions abound: What is our responsibility to those who can barely hang on? Will we think differently about who has to ask for help and why?\n\nMs. Cazimero said she was trying to be optimistic: \"Something great is going to come of this.\"\n\nBut no one knows what the road back for so many families looks like -- or if they can even make it back.\n\n\"You could grit and grind as a 19-year-old, until you get to 25 or 30, and you're finally getting there,\" said Ms. Johnson, the head of the charity in Memphis. \"But at 30, 40 years old now you are trying to start over again? How are you going to do that? It's hard.\"",

        "body": "Can a post-vaccine return to travel be smarter and greener than it was before March 2020? Some in the tourism industry are betting on it.\n\nTourism, which grew faster than the global gross domestic product for the past nine years, has been decimated by the pandemic. Once accounting for 10 percent of employment worldwide, the sector is poised to shed 121 million jobs, with losses projected at a minimum of $3.4 trillion, according to the World Travel & Tourism Council.\n\nBut in the lull, some in the tourism industry are planning for a post-vaccine return to travel that's better than it was before March 2020 -- greener, smarter and less crowded. If sustainable tourism, which aims to counterbalance the social and environmental impacts associated with travel, was the aspirational outer limit of ecotourism before the pandemic, the new frontier is \"regenerative travel,\" or leaving a place better than you found it.\n\n\"Sustainable tourism is sort of a low bar. At the end of the day, it's just not making a mess of the place,\" said Jonathon Day, an associate professor focused on sustainable tourism at Purdue University. \"Regenerative tourism says, let's make it better for future generations.\"\n\nDefining regeneration\n\nRegenerative travel has its roots in regenerative development and design, which includes buildings that meet the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design or LEED standards. The concept has applications across many fields, including regenerative agriculture, which aims to restore soils and sequester carbon.\n\n\"Generally, sustainability, as practiced today, is about slowing down the degradation,\" said Bill Reed, an architect and principal of Regenesis Group, a design firm based in Massachusetts and New Mexico that has been practicing regenerative design, including tourism projects, since 1995. He described efforts like fuel efficiency and reduced energy use as \"a slower way to die.\"\n\n\"Regeneration is about restoring and then regenerating the capability to live in a new relationship in an ongoing way,\" he added.\n\nWith most travel suspended during the pandemic, regenerative travel remains at the starting gate. But in the lull, it's the new buzz. Six nonprofit organizations, including the Center for Responsible Travel and Sustainable Travel International, have joined together as the Future of Tourism coalition, which aims to \"build a better tomorrow.\"\n\nTwenty-two travel groups, including tour operators like G Adventures, destination marketers such as the Slovenian Tourist Board, and organizations like the Adventure Travel Trade Association, have signed on to the coalition's 13 guiding principles, including \"demand fair income distribution\" and \"choose quality over quantity.\"\n\nTourism New Zealand, the country's tourism organization, is talking about measuring its success not solely in economic terms, but against the well-being of the country, considering nature, human health and community identities. And travel leaders in Hawaii are discussing repositioning the state as a cultural destination in hopes of re-engaging islanders, many of whom are fed up with overtourism, in the vitality of tourism.\n\nTo flesh out these broad strokes, Mr. Day, the associate professor, points to the concept of a circular economy, which aims to design waste out of the system, keep materials in use through reuse, repair and upcycling, and regenerate natural systems.\n\n\"Tourism is just at the beginning of this process of how we can apply circular economy ideas to the system,\" he said.\n\nRegeneration in action\n\nHaving a truly regenerative travel experience may be a unicorn, but a few operators are pointing the way.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-27T09:19:24.433Z Education systems are failing to reach many children, resulting in a 'global education emergency.' As Hurricane Laura slams the U.S., evacuation shelters adjust for the virus. The Justice Department says it may investigate four Democratic-led states over nursing-home outbreaks. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nRegenesis worked on the development of Playa Viva, a small resort south of Zihuatanejo, Mexico, on the Pacific Coast, which opened in 2009. The firm's assessment of the more than 200-acre property took in the beaches, the bird-filled estuary and ancient ruins as well as the problems of turtle poaching and poor schools in the village. Ultimately, the small town of Juluchuca became the gateway to the property; an organic agricultural system benefited both the property and local residents; and a 2 percent fee added to any stay funds a trust that invests in community development.\n\n\"Rather than a resort helicoptering in and taking up land, they said, 'We are the village,'\" Mr. Reed said. \"It's a paradigm shift.\"\n\nPlaya Viva is one of 45 resorts belonging to Regenerative Travel, a booking agency that vets members based on metrics such as carbon usage, employee well-being, immersive guest activities and sourcing local food. To date, qualifications for membership have been handled internally, but in September the company plans to launch a benchmarking system to demonstrate their regenerative progress.\n\nOneSeed Expeditions, an adventure tour operator based in Denver, aims to couple travel with economic development. It uses 10 percent of its proceeds to provide zero-interest loans to local nongovernmental organizations where it operates in places like Nepal and Peru. The local groups then issue microloans to community entrepreneurs in businesses such as farming and retail.\n\n\"The areas of greatest need are not necessarily in areas of the greatest tourism attractions,\" said Chris Baker, the founder of OneSeed Expeditions. \"We want to use tourism to be able to benefit people outside of those areas.\"\n\nRegenerative tourism addresses impacts holistically, from destination and community perspectives as well as environmental. Intrepid Travel, the small-group tour company that, until the pandemic, ran more than 1,000 itineraries globally, has been carbon neutral since 2010. This year it extended its pledge to cover 125 percent of its carbon emissions.\n\n\"There's this notion that business success means you have to do harm to the world,\" said James Thornton, the chief executive of Intrepid Travel, which became a B Corporation, an entity dedicated to benefiting workers, customers, the community and environment, as well as shareholders, in 2018. \"When the new normality returns, it shouldn't come at the expense of sustainability.\"\n\nCorrecting overtourism\n\nImplicit in many discussions about regenerative tourism is the threat of returning to overtourism, which accounted for excessive numbers of visitors in places like Dubrovnik that ultimately had to cap the number of cruise ships allowed to dock daily in high season.\n\n\"For so long, tourism success was defined by growing the numbers -- numbers of visitors, numbers of cruise passengers,\" said Gregory Miller, the executive director of the Center for Responsible Travel, a nonprofit group that advocates for sustainable travel. \"Even before the pandemic, there was a need for rebalancing.\"\n\nFor example, the current recession may have bought Hawaii a few years before its tourism figures return to what they were in 2019, when 10 million travelers visited the islands -- and that was up from 6.5 million a decade earlier -- resulting in painfully long queues to climb Diamond Head at sunrise. In a 2018 survey by the Hawaiian Tourism Authority, two-thirds of respondents agreed that \"This island is being run for tourists at the expense of local people.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes.

It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"We have the curse of a strong brand,\" said Frank Haas, a former vice president with the Hawaiian Tourism Authority and an independent tourism consultant. \"We're so well known as a sun destination that people overlook the other aspects, the Hawaiian culture, the royal past, the interesting geological and natural attractions.\"\n\nHe thinks it will require more coordinated management -- currently, a variety of federal, state and local authorities regulate parks and facilities like airports -- as well as creative entrepreneurs to expand cultural tourism by appealing to travelers interested in food, art, history or music.\n\nWho defines 'better' tourism?\n\nDetermining what makes a place better and who makes that decision requires local involvement, according to regenerative tourism proponents.\n\nVisitFlanders, the tourism organization representing the Northern Belgium region, used local input to rethink its mission, repositioning its stance from growing travel for the sake of the economy to creating an \"economy of meaning,\" according to its master plan. That includes, among other initiatives, linking visitors with locals who share their passions for things like history or food and making storytelling central to sites like its World War I battlefields.\n\n\"We've managed to shift the thinking from having their primary objective be about growing the numbers, to creating flourishing destinations, flourishing communities and having them say what kind of tourism they want,\" said Anna Pollock, the founder of Conscious Travel, an education and consulting enterprise devoted to positioning travel as a force for good, who worked with VisitFlanders.\n\nA traveler's role in regeneration\n\nMs. Pollock believes regenerative travel is a supply-side concept that asks operators to do more for the environment and community than they take from them. But travelers play a key role in demand.\n\n\"Become mindful of the fact that your trip is going to have a set of costs associated with it, which needs to be paid by somebody,\" she said. \"In the same way you think, 'Should I buy that cheap T-shirt from the dime store down the road?,' knowing it's created by semi-slave labor. Now you're thinking consciously about who do I buy it from and is it quality.\"\n\nThe experience of the pandemic -- when many are discovering the power of their pocketbooks in supporting local businesses like bookstores and restaurants -- is, perhaps, the most instructive in demonstrating sustainability, even if the travel involved is within a few blocks of home.\n\n\"Travel is an important vote of your principles,\" said Mr. Baker of OneSeed. \"When you decide to put your time and resources into a trip, you're affirming that's the type of business you want out there.\"\n\nSustainable travel, let alone regenerative travel, will still have to find solutions to the carbon emissions produced by air travel. Until the economy recovers, there's likely to be less travel, more local travel, or slower travel by car, train, bike or foot. This moment of reflection, say proponents, is where regeneration begins.\n\n\"It's about how to regenerate our relationship with life,\" said Mr. Reed, the architect. \"That's a continual process. Our children will need that taught to them. Regeneration is a continual cycle of rebirth. That's how we sustain the planet. You cannot have a sustainable planet without regeneration.\"\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

As Hurricane Laura slams the U.S., evacuation shelters adjust for the virus. The Justice Department says it may investigate four Democratic-led states over nursing-home outbreaks. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThis was the first time I couldn't do that. I had to say: \"No, not all of us. But someone you know might. Be careful.\"\n\nIt took me a while to understand the threat. On Dec. 31 last year, I noticed an alert on ProMed-mail, an outbreak-tracking service, about a mysterious viral pneumonia possibly linked to a market in Wuhan, China.\n\nBut many such alerts are only false alarms, so I just tucked it away in my brain and went on to other things. Two weeks later, when the virus was spreading, I thought it would be like SARS: dangerous, but containable.\n\nI became really worried on the night of Jan. 30, when China's lab-confirmed case count went to 10,000 from 500 in a week, with 200 dead. That was different: Rapid spread and 2 percent mortality was the hallmark of the 1918 flu.\n\nIt took time to convince others. I came into the office the next day raving that this was The Big One. My editor asked me to call a dozen infectious diseases experts before I wrote anything. (The final score was eight \"yes,\" two \"no,\" and two undecided. One of the eight was Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious diseases specialist, which settled the issue.)\n\nThese days, I no longer feel like a lone crazy man whistling in the wind. Everyone -- even President Trump -- believes in The Big One. And everyone at The New York Times is covering it.\n\nNow the story is so complex that keeping up with it is nearly impossible. I feel as if I conduct interviews, read studies, and watch TV day and night, just trying to follow shutdowns, school openings, vaccines, treatments, mask battles and what's happening in Sweden, Hong Kong and New Zealand. You can't deduce what might happen here without knowing what has worked elsewhere and calculating whether we can do the same thing -- or if we're just too stubborn and too polarized.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nCovering the future, of course, can be a booby trap for a journalist. Remember Donald Rumsfeld's warning about \"unknown unknowns?\"\n\nMy editors found my early prognostications pretty bleak. I've been called everything from Mr. Doom 'n' Gloom to Cassandra to \"the Eeyore of the moment.\" And there's no way I can prove I have the facts right -- because they don't exist yet.\n\nWhen enough time has passed to put some facts on the ground, I have sometimes found that, when I have erred, it was because the scientists I interviewed weren't pessimistic enough. They were peering into the abyss through rose-colored glasses.\n\nFor example: At one point, I reported that the World Health Organization thought China's lockdown had bought the rest of the world an extra two or three weeks. Actually, the virus was already spreading in Seattle and New York.\n\nI reported that experts said we could contain clusters, trace contacts and stop transmission between cities. We couldn't.\n\nAnd I can't forget that in February, on \"The Daily,\" I said we might get lucky with hot weather and the virus wouldn't reach us until fall. Whoops.\n\nSo why do we do it? Because our readers are desperate to know.\n\nPrediction is an imperfect art. Viruses mutate, and people do the unexpected. But we're trying.",

        "body": "The app would have asked employees to report if they had a fever and any new symptoms each day. Some see it as an invasion of privacy.\n\nNew York City's largest municipal union on Tuesday filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the American Museum of Natural History over the institution's plan to require employees to record possible coronavirus symptoms on an app. The head of the union called it overly intrusive.\n\nUnder the museum's plan, each day before work, the app would have asked employees to report if they had a fever or symptoms like a cough or congestion. The app would have then told employees whether they were cleared to work or, if not, where they might get tested for the virus. The results would then be reported to their employer.\n\nBut according to the union, District Council 37, many of its members saw the app, called ProtectWell, as an invasion of their privacy and objected to the museum choosing a program whose data was not protected by Hipaa, the federal law on patient privacy.\n\nHenry Garrido, the union's executive director, said there were other tools that the museum could adopt that would not be so invasive. He said he was not able to provide a copy of the complaint, which it filed to the National Labor Relations Board, because it is considered confidential under lawyer-client privilege.\n\n\"It's not like they're reinventing the wheel here; there are other city agencies opening right now,\" Mr. Garrido said. \"They have other options.\"\n\nAs museums in New York City prepare to open after more than five months of pandemic shutdown, screening apps are among the tools that administrators are using to prevent their institutions from becoming hotbeds for the coronavirus. Months ago, employers in a variety of fields rushed to adopt these worker-screening tools, but experts warned that they are being introduced with minimal government oversight -- and with few details on how companies are using and safeguarding the health data, or how long they plan to keep it.\n\nFor businesses reopening in New York, the state mandates that they implement health screenings of staffers each day before they start work. Some employers are opting for online surveys or paper checklists rather than smartphone applications.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-26T18:48:38.284Z The C.D.C. was pressured to change guidance on testing asymptomatic people who had been exposed to the virus. N.Y.C.'s subway and bus service would be reduced by 40 percent without federal aid, M.T.A. warns. Jail time or a $569,000 fine: The price of breaking quarantine can be steep. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe standoff between the museum and the union could threaten to derail the museum's plans to open early next month. If the museum doesn't have a health screening process in place, it cannot bring back its employees.\n\nA spokeswoman for the museum did not immediately provide comment.\n\nThe app, developed by UnitedHealth Group and Microsoft in response to the pandemic, is offered to employers for free, which has made some union employees worry that their health data could be monetized. The app debuted in May, as many states were beginning to allow certain businesses to reopen.\n\nIn order to make sure every employee fills out the survey before work, the museum told the union that if staff members failed to do so, they would not be allowed in the museum and would be denied wages for the day.\n\nA unionized museum employee, who did not want his name to be published out of fear he might lose his job, said that for many employees, that rule came off as a threat.\n\nIn particular, the union local that represents museum guards, Local 1306, is unanimous in its opposition to mandating that employees download and use the app on their smartphones -- if they have these devices.\n\nWhen the museum introduced the policy to the union earlier this month, the negotiations quickly became adversarial. The union demanded more information on what happens to employees who don't have smartphones. A museum official said he needed to know how many employees that included before fleshing out an alternative for them.\n\nIn a letter dated Aug. 14, a union representative, Ben Totushek, wrote to the museum's associate director of labor and employee relations, Nilesh Patel. The letter was provided to The New York Times by an employee who did not wish to be named out of fear of retaliation. It outlined some of the union employees' concerns, including that the app would diminish their data privacy and the museum gave no clear alternatives to downloading it on their personal devices. They also pointed out that public health experts had doubts \"over whether such screenings may actually do more harm than good by creating a false sense of security.\"\n\nIn a response letter, dated Aug. 17, Mr. Patel defended the app, saying it was easy to use and would allow employees to complete their daily screenings in the privacy of their own homes. Opting to move the screening process to paper was \"untenable\" because it would increase the potential for inaccuracies, he wrote, and the app would make it easier for the museum to review the data daily.\n\nThis particular app \"provides the best possibility for us to protect the health and safety of our staff and our visitors and satisfy the state's mandate,\" Mr. Patel wrote.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all.

The company said the app isn't subject to Hipaa.\n\nIn a statement, the chief executive of ProtectWell, Adam Hjerpe, said the company is \"honored\" to be supporting the museum \"as they do everything they can to ensure the health and safety of their staff and visitors.\"\n\nLike many other cultural institutions, the pandemic has plunged the natural history museum into financial difficulty. In May, it announced that it would cut its full-time staff by about 200 people, including dozens of layoffs, and it projected a budget deficit of as much as $120 million for the remainder of that fiscal year, which ended in June.\n\nBefore the pandemic layoffs, about 300 of the museum's roughly 2,000 employees were members of DC37; some other employees are members of separate unions.\n\nThe union has pointed to other screening options that would fulfill the state's mandate without intruding on employees' privacy.\n\nIt has suggested another app that is Hipaa compliant, called HealthChampion. The union also pointed to the fact that New York City's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene is using a web-based survey to screen employees for symptoms -- not an app downloaded onto personal devices. The Metropolitan Museum of Art is using an online screening survey, too, but employees who forget or do not wish to use it are permitted to fill out a paper copy, a spokesman said.",

        "body": "Students are being asked to share the costs of testing and reconfiguring campus facilities. The fees range from $50 to $475 a semester.\n\nCollege students are used to seeing fees on their semester bills: activity fees, lab fees, athletic fees, technology fees, orientation fees and so on.\n\nThis year, some students are noticing a new item: coronavirus fees.\n\nFaced with extra expenses for screening and testing students for the virus, and for reconfiguring campus facilities for safety, some colleges and universities are asking students to pay a share of the cost.\n\nThe level of testing and protective steps, and the associated cost, vary widely by campus. Some colleges are testing all students at the start of the semester, while others will also test repeatedly throughout the academic term. Testing is mandatory at some campuses, voluntary at others. \"It really varies,\" said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the Association of American Colleges and Universities.\n\nThe University of Michigan is charging a $50-per-term coronavirus fee this year. Revenue from the fee will help cover the costs of testing and other pandemic-related health and safety services, a spokesman said. Details of the measures are still being worked out.\n\nMerrimack College, a private institution in North Andover, Mass., is charging a \"Covid mitigation\" fee of $475 per semester to all students taking in-person classes.\n\nThe college requires students to test negative for the coronavirus before moving into their dorms, and plans to conduct weekly surveillance testing throughout the semester -- with some 4,500 on-campus tests expected weekly, according to its website. Merrimack is participating in a college testing protocol offered by the Broad Institute, an initiative of Harvard and M.I.T. that developed a program to help campuses reopen safely.\n\nThe college didn't respond to requests for comment. But its website said that even with budget cuts, the \"extraordinary\" costs of testing and safety measures \"are difficult to absorb,\" so a temporary fee was necessary.\n\nOther colleges may still be calculating whether and how to charge fees, since plans for testing and safety protocols are changing daily as the start of the academic year approaches, health experts say. Students are already heading back to some campuses, but others won't show up until after Labor Day.\n\n\"This is all still emerging,\" said Elizabeth Marks, senior strategy consultant with Academic HealthPlans, which provides student health insurance plans at campuses across the country.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't currently recommend blanket \"entry testing\" of returning students, faculty and staff. The agency's website notes that such a step hasn't been systematically studied, and it is \"unknown\" if it would reduce transmission of the virus beyond what would be expected by using other prevention measures, like social distancing, masks and hand washing.\n\nBut many colleges that are inviting students back to campus are taking aggressive steps to avoid outbreaks. Large universities may have the infrastructure to conduct multiple tests rapidly on thousands of students, Ms. Pasquerella said, but smaller institutions may lack the facilities -- or the funds -- to handle a large volume of tests.\n\nBaylor University, which has an affiliated health care system, said it was sending home test kits to all students, and is requiring negative results before students arrive on the campus in Waco, Texas. The school will also conduct testing throughout the semester. Baylor is covering the costs, a spokeswoman said.\n\nElon University, a private institution in North Carolina with about 6,300 undergraduates, is also sending home testing kits to incoming students. The university will charge students $129, but is giving them time to seek reimbursement from their health insurer or apply for a fee waiver before billing them. Students can seek tests elsewhere, at a lower cost, as long as the test meets Elon's requirements. Random testing will occur throughout the fall, at the university's expense.\n\n\"We know testing is imperfect,\" said Jeff Stein, Elon's vice president for strategic initiatives. But the school hopes that the tests, combined with other protective steps, will help contain the virus's spread.\n\nSt. Michael's College in Vermont is charging all students a \"comprehensive\" testing fee of $150 for the fall semester, which includes testing at the start of the semester and repeat tests during the fall. \"We know that this is a particularly difficult time financially for many families and we wish we did not have to charge any fee,\" the college says on its website.\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakBack to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 13, 2020\n\nThe latest highlights as the first students return to U.S. schools.\n\nBy loudly pushing for schools to reopen classrooms, President Trump has actually helped drive them in the other direction.New Jersey will allow schools to remain entirely online when they reopen next month, after initially requiring at least some in-person instruction.With millions of American children unlikely to see the inside of a classroom this fall, our national K-12 reporter explains how we wound up here on today's episode of The Daily podcast.The Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences have said they won't play college football in the fall. In the South, they're biding for time.\n\nBrendan Williams, senior director of knowledge at uAspire, a nonprofit group that advocates college affordability, said in an email that the group applauded colleges that were being \"transparent\" about the extra charges, rather than quietly folding them into general fees. But, he said, \"we don't necessarily agree with passing the costs on to the student.\"\n\nSeveral colleges noted that if the federal government appropriated money to help colleges pay for testing programs, they would credit all or part of their virus fees back to students.\n\nHere are some questions and answers about the fees:\n\nWill my health insurance plan reimburse me for college-required coronavirus tests?\n\nMaybe. Many insurers, in general, cover tests for the virus only if they are deemed \"medically necessary,\" which typically means a patient has symptoms or an order from a physician. Screening tests for people who don't have symptoms -- which is what many colleges are doing -- may not be covered at no cost.\n\nSt. Michael's College acknowledged that possibility. \"The college can provide families with evidence of the payment and what it was for so that they can seek reimbursement from their insurance company,\" the website says. \"However, our understanding is that most insurance companies will not reimburse for asymptomatic testing, which is what the college will be doing in nearly all cases.\"\n\nBut Stephanie Cohen, an insurance broker near Washington, D.C., said major health insurers seemed \"likely\" to reimburse for tests required under formal college testing programs. She advised students to contact their health plans for clarification. Or students could visit their doctor to explain the situation, and request a prescription for the test.\n\nIf I get sick with the virus while attending college, will my campus health insurance plan cover my care?\n\nHealth insurance plans, including those created for and sold through colleges to students, cover coronavirus-related care and treatment in the same way they cover other illnesses, Ms. Marks said.\n\nEven if a student is sent home because the campus switches from in-person to remote classes, she said, the health plan generally would cover care and treatment as long as the student remained eligible, which typically means the student is enrolled for a minimum number of credit hours.\n\nMy college bill includes a \"student health\" fee. Does that mean I have health insurance?\n\nNo. Most colleges charge all students a mandatory health fee, which typically covers the cost of primary care, counseling and health education at a campus health center; a per-visit fee may also be charged. But the fee doesn't cover more extensive treatment. For that, you would need insurance coverage, whether through a plan offered on campus to students or through coverage you have on your own or through a parent's health plan. (You can remain on your parents' health plan until age 26.)",

        "body": "U.S. islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific have growing cases of the coronavirus, which can spike even in places far removed from urban centers when controls are relaxed.\n\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands is halting tourism for a month, hoping against hope to keep out new cases of the coronavirus. Puerto Rico's Senate is closed after several high-ranking officials came down with Covid-19. Hawaii is facing a surge in new infections. Guam is enduring its most restrictive lockdown since the pandemic began.\n\nFor months, United States islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific avoided much of the agony unleashed by the coronavirus across parts of the mainland, due in part to their early mitigation efforts and relative ease in sealing off borders.\n\nBut now the state of Hawaii and these territories are emerging as some of the most alarming virus hot spots in the United States, revealing how the coronavirus can spike and then rapidly spread in places with relaxed restrictions, sluggish contact tracing and widespread pressure to end the economic pain that comes with lockdowns.\n\n\"People are infecting each other in crowded apartments while hotels sit empty,\" Dr. Jonathan Dworkin, an infectious-diseases doctor who lives on Hawaii's Big Island, wrote in a scathing assessment of Hawaii's pandemic responses in The Honolulu Star-Advertiser.\n\nDr. Dworkin lit into the reluctance by health officials in Hawaii to ramp up testing in the early weeks of the pandemic and said it was the privately funded testing efforts that may have staved off an even more acute crisis. He also questioned why contact tracing operations remain inadequately staffed.\n\nHawaii, as well as other some islands that are U.S. territories, still have relatively fewer cases and Covid-19-related deaths than many parts of the mainland. But Hawaii now ranks among the states where new cases have grown fastest over the last 14 days.\n\nMeanwhile, confusion is emerging over some pandemic measures there, especially in Honolulu, where gyms remain open but hiking trails and parks are closed; restaurants in the city are also open but residents cannot receive visitors into their home from outside their household.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T21:58:17.779Z C.D.C. changes testing guidelines to exclude those exposed to virus who don't exhibit symptoms. The Trump administration ordered hospitals to report data to H.H.S. or risk losing funding. 'No second chances': Colleges are coming down hard on students who violate virus restrictions. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nGov. David Ige defended the state's contact tracing efforts, saying in a news briefing this month that Hawaii's operations were \"better than average and amongst the best in the country.\"\n\nAt the same time, sharp increases in cases are raising concerns on other American islands. The situation in Guam seems especially problematic, with cases emerging in several schools, at the territorial port authority and on its police force.\n\nThe U.S. Virgin Islands, which registered almost no cases in the early days of the pandemic, is now approaching 1,000 total cases, pushing its per capita infection numbers higher than those of several states.\n\nDr. Esther Ellis, the territorial epidemiologist for the U.S. Virgin Islands, said officials were reacting quickly and thoroughly to outbreaks in the territory, which includes the islands of St. Croix, St. John and St. Thomas.\n\nThe islands are requiring temperature checks with thermal scanners for all visitors upon deplaning, she said, and is also conducting aggressive testing. \"We're the only place giving test results back in 24 hours,\" she said.\n\nStill, authorities there are shutting nonessential businesses and imposing stay-at-home orders. The territory saw its cases surge to 224 per 100,000 residents over the past seven days, the highest per capita increase of any state or territory.\n\nThere are exceptions to the crisis unfolding on U.S. islands. American Samoa, an archipelago in the Pacific, remains the only territory or state without a single confirmed case of Covid-19, reflecting early moves to halt nearly all incoming flights, rapidly increase testing and seize on social distancing measures adopted in response to a measles outbreak in late 2019.\n\nBut the situation in the U.S. Virgin Islands shows how quickly things can change. The territory, which avoided the large outbreaks that were hitting parts of the mainland early in the pandemic, had reopened for leisure visitors on June 1 after an early lockdown -- then had to hit the brakes.\n\nGov. Albert Bryan Jr. announced this month that hotels and Airbnb operators would be prohibited from accepting new guests for 30 days. Mr. Bryan also ordered bars, nightclubs and cabarets to shut down until Aug. 31.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe territory, which has 103,000 residents, was already trying to bounce back after being hit in 2017 with Hurricanes Irma and Maria, two rare Category 5 storms. Tourism, which accounts for a third of the economy in the U.S. Virgin Islands, remains its largest source of employment.\n\nPuerto Rico, the most populous U.S. territory with about 3.2 million residents, showcases how the pandemic is accentuating pre-existing economic and political problems. Puerto Rico imposed the nation's first lockdown in March, before California became the first state to do so -- indeed, before the word \"lockdown\" started becoming part of the nation's vocabulary.\n\nThe stringent measures helped keep the virus under control and the island's underequipped hospitals from becoming overwhelmed. Scientists collaborated to expand the island's testing capacity amid shortages of chemicals and other materials, and promoted pooled testing long before most states.\n\nThe lockdown led to an unemployment crisis that forced hundreds of workers to line up for assistance before dawn, and sometimes overnight. Already, Puerto Ricans have endured 14 years of economic sluggishness, several devastating recent hurricanes and, in January, a flurry of earthquakes and aftershocks.\n\nWith cases trending upward, Gov. Wanda V\u00e1zquez held a televised address last week to announce a stay-at-home order that would apply for the next three Sundays, the latest in a series of escalating restrictions meant to keep people from socializing with friends or family. Violators of the island's mask order will be subject to a $100 fine, while a nightly curfew remains in effect.\n\nOn Thursday, a day after Ms. V\u00e1zquez imposed the latest restrictions, Puerto Rico's Senate closed after cases were identified among high-ranking elected officials, including several legislators, the speaker of the House of Representatives and two top aides to Pedro R. Pierluisi, the nominee for governor from the pro-statehood New Progressive Party. Representative Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, Puerto Rico's nonvoting member of Congress, also tested positive.\n\n\"One of the most critical areas remains contact tracing, and the testing that is done,\" said Lorenzo Gonz\u00e1lez, Puerto Rico's health secretary. He added that a shortage of testing materials was making it harder for authorities on the island to get the virus under control.\n\nGuam, which trails only the U.S. Virgin Islands among American states and territories where cases climbed fastest in the past week, is dealing not just with a surge in Covid-19 but with simmering criticism of a lockdown, ordered on Friday by Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero, that includes fines of $1,000 for violators.\n\nProtesters gathered on Monday to voice opposition to the measures in Tumon, the heart of Guam's tourism industry, and to urge a recall of Ms. Leon Guerrero. The governor warned that such protests could spread the coronavirus and harm the economy even more if restrictions now in place have to be prolonged.\n\nAlejandra Rosa and Mitch Smith contributed reporting.",

        "body": "SYDNEY, Australia -- As the week began, New Zealanders were celebrating 100 days without community spread of the coronavirus, drinking at pubs, packing stadiums and hugging friends.\n\nTwo days later, that suddenly changed: Four new cases, all related, emerged in Auckland. On Thursday, officials said the cluster had grown to 17, as they struggled to map out how the virus had returned to an isolated island nation championed for its pandemic response.\n\nOne theory is that it could have come through cargo. Some of the infected New Zealanders worked at a cold storage warehouse with imported food. Another focus is quarantine facilities for returning travelers, the source of an outbreak tearing through Melbourne, Australia.\n\nA mystery and a few cases -- that's all it took for New Zealand to say goodbye to normalcy. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern immediately announced a new lockdown for Auckland, a city of 1.7 million people, along with a huge testing, contact tracing and quarantine blitz that aims to quash Covid-19 for the second time.\n\n\"Going hard and early is still the best course of action,\" Ms. Ardern said on Thursday as she had relaunched her daily coronavirus news briefings. \"We have a plan.\"\n\nMany other places have faced a similar challenge -- Hong Kong, Australia and Vietnam have all confronted new waves after early triumphs. New Zealand, while disappointed by the abrupt resurgence, has reacted with an extraordinary level of urgency and action that it hopes will be a model for how to eliminate a burst of infection and rapidly get on with life.\n\n\"We were totally back to hugging, handshaking, restaurants, cinemas -- all the stuff apart from going on holiday overseas,\" said Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist at the University of Auckland. \"What we've had time to do in the meantime is massively ramp up our testing and contact tracing, so this is going to be a real test of how quickly you can stamp it out again.\"\n\n\"Everything about the time frame,\" she added, \"has been really compressed.\"\n\nMs. Ardern first heard about a potential positive case at 4 p.m. on Tuesday while traveling in a van a few hours outside the capital, Wellington, after visiting a factory that makes face masks. At 9:15 p.m., she and Dr. Ashley Bloomfield, the director-general of health, appeared at a news conference where they announced the new cases -- all four were from the same family; none had recently returned from overseas -- and a lockdown that would start the following day.\n\n\"We have come too far to go backwards,\" Ms. Ardern said. \"Be strong and be kind.\"\n\nThe lockdown was initially set for three days. Contact tracing had already begun.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-12T10:58:18.105Z Scores of restaurants in the U.S. have had to temporarily close after outbreaks. Britain's lockdown recession is the deepest in Europe and North America. Crisis in the nation, crickets on Capitol Hill. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nMichael Baker, an epidemiologist who was a leading proponent of New Zealand's forceful efforts to eliminate the virus during its initial outbreak months ago, said he heard about the new cases a few hours before the announcement. Like many others, he immediately started trying to work out what had gone wrong.\n\n\"The only way a virus can appear in the community in New Zealand is via the borders,\" he said. \"It's been eliminated in New Zealand. There is really no chance it was persisting for the last three months without it being detected.\"\n\nBut which border, how and when? No one yet knows.\n\nDr. Bloomfield said on Thursday that those infected in the new cluster first showed symptoms around the end of July, suggesting that the virus had been in the community for at least a week before that. Genetic sequencing found similarities with versions of the virus in Britain and Australia.\n\nTo investigate the novel idea of a spread through cargo, health officials have tested everyone at Americold, the cold storage company where some of the first cases appeared, with fast-tracked results identifying a total of seven workers with the virus. Scientists, aware of how the virus has thrived in cold storage at meatpacking plants in other countries, are also testing surfaces at the company's two facilities.\n\nIf the virus is found to have moved through freight, the consequences could be significant for global trade. It could mean deep cleaning and lengthier wait times between shipment and delivery, along with more monitoring on ships and in ports.\n\nBut epidemiologists said such transmission was improbable: human-to-human contact was the most likely source. \"Ninety percent of cases occur in houses and workplaces,\" Dr. Bloomfield said.\n\nThe cluster's growth so far points to a path through kitchens and break rooms. One of the new infections reported on Thursday involved a student related to a person identified on Tuesday. Another seven are family members of Americold employees.\n\nAll of those newly infected will be placed in quarantine, in an escalation over containment measures during New Zealand's first lockdown in March and April.\n\nNew Zealand has apparently learned what not to do from its neighbor and rival Australia, where 800 people who had tested positive in Melbourne were recently found not to be at home during random checks of self-isolation.\n\nAustralia's missteps have also led New Zealand to focus on quarantine facilities -- in Melbourne, the virus moved from travelers to hotel workers, who then carried it home.\n\nDr. Bloomfield said Thursday that workers at all 32 quarantine facilities that handle returning travelers would be tested for the virus this week, and once a week after that. Relatives of the workers may also be tested, along with every border official at New Zealand's airports and other ports -- between 6,000 and 7,000 federal employees.\n\n\"It will help us avoid any further and inadvertent spread into the community,\" Dr. Bloomfield said.\n\nThe lockdown aims to do the same, and it's being strongly enforced. In its first day and a half, the authorities stopped 17,000 vehicles at 10 checkpoints. Most were traveling for the right reasons -- for work, food or care-taking -- and only 312 were turned back for trying to leave Auckland or other violations of the rules.\n\nOn Ponsonby Road, a high-end and normally busy shopping strip, the city seemed to be shifting quickly back into a form of partial hibernation.\n\nRoscoe Thorby, 58, drank his to-go coffee in a deck chair he had set up on the sidewalk outside his regular cafe, just as he had done during the first lockdown.\n\nBut for some businesses, the sudden pivot from life as normal to near-total shutdown has been tough.\n\n\"It's pretty devastating, after having a taste of what it is like to return to normality, getting the ball rolling and getting in the swing of things,\" said Hugo Baird, 29, who owns a cafe, Honey Bones, and part of a restaurant called Lilian.\n\nServing to-go customers is financially feasible for the cafe, but not the restaurant. It has closed for this lockdown, however long it lasts, and the first casualty will be all the food that his staff had prepped for this week's service, as well as opened bottles of wine and beer kegs.\n\n\"It is the uncertainty that kills business,\" Mr. Baird said. He had finally gotten back to running at full capacity. \"Now, going into another lockdown, although some people said it was inevitable, it does damage confidence.\"\n\nJeremy Hutton, 28, who works in finance and was out for a walk and a take-away coffee on Thursday morning, asked what seemed to be on the minds of many: \"Are we just going to keep doing this every couple of months?\"\n\nStill, despite the new cases, many New Zealanders recognized their enviable position. John Coop, 48, an architect, said he had recently spoken to a friend in London, and \"there was a stark difference between his reality and what it is like here.\"\n\n\"We're incredibly grateful,\" he added.\n\nDr. Baker, the epidemiologist, said that New Zealand's prior success, and the sustained elimination of the virus in other places, such as Taiwan and Fiji, suggested room for optimism. He said the latest outbreak could be small and quickly brought under control.\n\n\"The government moved incredibly fast and decisively with the lockdown,\" he said. \"If there are any undetected chains of transmission, they will peter out.\"\n\nMr. Thorby, sitting with his coffee, said he and many others were just hoping that what had worked once would work again, but more quickly. While his \"heart dropped,\" he said, when the news of the new cases hit, he supports the government's aggressive response.\n\n\"I think we are sensible, and I think we trust the government,\" he said. \"We've had no reason not to trust our government.\"\n\nDamien Cave reported from Sydney, and Serena Solomon from Auckland, New Zealand.",

        "body": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Health authorities in New Zealand were scrambling Wednesday to trace the source of a new outbreak of the coronavirus as the nation's largest city went back into lockdown.\n\nAuthorities had confirmed four cases of the virus in one Auckland household from an unknown source and were awaiting the test results of four more people they suspect have infections -- two work colleagues and two relatives of those in the house.\n\nThe cases this week were the first known local transmission of the virus in New Zealand in 102 days.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said more than 200 people with connections to those in the house were contacted Wednesday.\n\n\"Our plan of mass testing, rapid contact tracing and, of course, our restrictions to stop the chain of transmission has been in full swing in Auckland today,\" Ardern said.\n\nDirector-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said one of the people who tested positive works at an Americold food cold-storage facility in Auckland, which was being swabbed to check if it was possible source of the infections.\n\n\"We do know from studies overseas that actually, the virus can survive in some refrigerated environments for quite some time,\" he said.\n\nThe cluster came as an unpleasant surprise to many and raised questions about whether the nation's general election would go ahead as planned next month.\n\nBloomfield said two of the people who had tested positive had traveled to the city of Rotorua while suffering symptoms over recent days and had visited several tourist attractions.\n\n\"People in Rotorua and indeed around the country should be vigilant about their health and seek advice if they have symptoms,\" he said.\n\nAuckland was moved to Alert Level 3 at midday Wednesday, a designation initially set to continue through midnight Friday. That means that non-essential workers are required to stay home, while bars, restaurants and most businesses will be closed.\n\nThe rest of the country was moved to Alert Level 2, meaning that mass gatherings are limited to 100 attendees and people are required to socially distance themselves.\n\nBloomfield said they would use genome sequencing as part of their effort to find the source of the new outbreak.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she had worked quickly to impose the Auckland lockdown measures after first learning about the cases Tuesday afternoon.\n\nShe said Aucklanders were also \"strongly encouraged\" but not mandated to wear masks, and that authorities were releasing 5 million masks from a central supply. New Zealanders have not widely worn masks before, although authorities have been urging people to buy them or fashion them from scarves or bandannas just in case.\n\nThe nation's parliament was due to be dissolved Wednesday ahead of a general election on Sept. 19 as lawmakers hit the campaign trail. But Ardern said she was delaying the dissolution until at least Monday in case lawmakers needed to meet at short notice. She said she was also seeking advice about options for the election.\n\nUnder New Zealand law, the government could delay the election for up to about two months. The main candidates have already cancelled most of their planned upcoming campaign events.\n\nThe outbreak was found after a man in his 50s went to his doctor Monday with symptoms and was swabbed twice, testing positive both times. Three more people in his household tested positive later.\n\nThe case has health authorities scratching their heads, as the man had not recently traveled overseas and had no immediately apparent connection with infections contained at the border.\n\nUntil Tuesday, the only known cases of the virus in New Zealand were 22 travelers held in quarantine after returning from abroad.\n\nNew Zealand has been praised globally for its virus response and had just celebrated reaching 100 days without any known community transmission.\n\nThe South Pacific nation of 5 million initially got rid of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease, stopping its spread.\n\nLife had returned to normal for many people as they attended rugby games at packed stadiums and sat down in bars and restaurants without fear of getting infected. But some had warned that the country had become complacent.",

Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Case 8\n\nTwo attempted calls.\n\nLeft voice message at 11:08 a.m. Attempted to contact case and able to conduct interview after lunch. Case is an elderly lady who lives alone. Tested positive prior to a medical procedure. Assured me that her family is doing the \"right thing\" to stop the spread by testing and \"cleaning everything.\" Case was very thankful for the phone call, and listened attentively, but was adamant about NOT providing contact information.\n\nCase 9\n\nTwo attempted calls.\n\nCalled case on 7/28 and left message at 11:17 a.m. Attempted to call patient at 2:10 p.m. Voice mail for case is in Spanish, more likely that case is fluent in Spanish. Indicated that we are able to provide translation, if needed, on second voice message at 2:10 p.m. Asked for assistance from Supervisor to reassign case to Spanish-speaking colleague.\n\nCase 10\n\nOne attempted call.\n\nCase is middled aged, lives with family. Case works as an independent construction worker. Last day of work was 7/17. One other family member and case is positive in household of 6. Case is more comfortable in Spanish, so assistance from other positive case was appreciated. Stated that family member who tested positive may have been exposed at work in warehouse. Four members of household are negative and self-quarantined separately. Negative members have not tested, nor have symptoms.\n\nCase 11\n\nOne attempted call.\n\nFamily member of case #11. May have been exposed at workplace. Able to add other household members who have not tested nor have symptoms. Was not comfortable to provide individual cell number, and preferred to have case #11 cell number since they live in same household. Case was gracious enough to help with some contact information, and able to gain essential information to and connect to positive cases.\n\nCase notes have been condensed and edited.",

        "body": "He's monitoring his health closely in the run up to the United States Open. He's not against all vaccines but wouldn't want to be forced to take one to play. And he says he had good intentions with his tour that became a coronavirus cluster.\n\nNegotiations and trans-Atlantic flight complete, Novak Djokovic was seated on the sofa of one of his hard-won concessions this week: a spacious rented home near New York City, nestled amid the trees and far from the commotion.\n\nDjokovic had just put on a shirt after sunbathing on the terrace.\n\n\"With the trees and serenity, being in this kind of environment is a blessing,\" Djokovic said on a Zoom call. \"And I'm grateful, because I've seen the hotel where the majority of players are staying. I don't want to sound arrogant or anything like that, and I know the U.S.T.A. did their best in order to provide accommodation and organize everything and organize these bubbles so the players can actually compete and come here, but it's tough for most of the players, not being able to open their window and being in a hotel in a small room.\"\n\nIt has been a bumpy and tortuous road to staging the United States Open amid the coronavirus pandemic. Djokovic's demands and complaints -- public and private -- did not make it any smoother for the United States Tennis Association to facilitate the tournament. But unlike many other leading international players, including Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, Djokovic is actually here after this long and unexpected break from the tennis tour.\n\nHe is still ranked No. 1 and remains a perfect 18-0 in 2020, just as he was when the pandemic-related hiatus began in March.\n\nBut he was hardly a big winner during the forced off-season. He generated concern and controversy by questioning vaccination and claiming that water could be affected by human emotions. And he dented his credibility and brand by organizing the Adria Tour, a charity exhibition series in Serbia and Croatia in June that seriously lacked in social distancing and decorum, leading to a cluster of coronavirus cases. It was canceled before the finish with several leading players and some support staff testing positive.\n\nDjokovic and his wife Jelena were among them, and they isolated for two weeks with their two young children in their native city of Belgrade, Serbia.\n\n\"We tried to do something with the right intentions,\" Djokovic said of the tour. \"Yes, there were some steps that could have been done differently, of course, but am I going to be then forever blamed for doing a mistake? I mean, OK, if this is the way, fine, I'll accept it, because that's the only thing I can do. Whether it's fair or not, you tell me, but I know that the intentions were right and correct, and if I had the chance to do the Adria Tour again, I would do it again.\"\n\nDjokovic was full of mixed emotions in this week's interview, ranging from apologetic to defiant, and said he had used the long break to deepen his connections with his family and his understanding of issues like ecology and health.\n\n\"I think this is a huge transformational phase for all of us on this planet, and I think maybe even the last wake-up call,\" he said.\n\nDjokovic said his coronavirus symptoms were mild, lasting four to five days. He said he had no fever but did have fatigue and some loss of smell and taste and sensed some loss of stamina when he initially returned to practice.\n\nBut with concern mounting about the long-term health effects of the virus, Djokovic, who favors a plant-based diet and natural healing when possible, said he was closely monitoring himself and looking into long-term effects.\n\n\"I've done a CT scan of my chest, and OK, everything is clear. I've done several tests since my negative test for the coronavirus as well before coming to New York,\" he said. \"I've done my blood tests, my urine tests, my stool tests, everything that I possibly can. I'm obviously doing that prevention anyway but of course now more than ever because we don't really know what we're dealing with.\"\n\nDjokovic, traveling without his family, arrived in New York on Saturday, to \"get acclimated\" to the unusual restrictions for the tournament and \"just to be able to be OK once it's go time.\"\n\nHe will first play in the Western & Southern Open, a combined men's and women's event that has been moved from its usual location outside Cincinnati to the U.S. Open site to create a two-tournament bubble. He will compete in singles and doubles, teaming up with his Serbian compatriot Filip Krajinovic, with his first match either Sunday or Monday.\n\nBoth tournaments will be played without spectators at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens, with players and their support staff required to be tested regularly and banned from traveling beyond their lodging and the tournament site without express permission from U.S. Open leadership.\n\n\"I was very close to not coming,\" said Djokovic, who said he decided to go to New York less than a week before he arrived and only after players were given guarantees by European governments that they would not be expected to quarantine when they traveled to Europe after the U.S. Open.\n\n\"There were a lot of uncertainties,\" he said. \"And there still are, yeah, a lot of things that are not really clear.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I want to play. I mean that's why I'm here. I am personally not afraid of being in a risky, dangerous health situation for myself. If I felt that way, I most likely would not be here. I am cautious of course, and I have to be responsible and of course respect the regulations and rules and restrictions as anybody else. But things are unpredictable. Anything can happen in the tennis court or off the tennis court.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakSports and the Virus\n\nUpdated Aug. 19, 2020\n\nHere's what's happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to life:\n\nThe Canadian Football League became the latest casualty of the pandemic, canceling its 2020 season after repeated efforts to play an abbreviated schedule fell through.The United States Open tennis tournament will have the weakest women's field in its history after second-ranked Simona Halep withdrew.Fans are critical extras in the backdrop of live sports. Without a capacity crowd cheering in person, professional sports lose some of their excitement, and maybe their meaning.\n\nDjokovic said his own experience with the coronavirus had not altered his views on vaccines. He has said that he would have a difficult decision to make if receiving a coronavirus vaccine became mandatory to compete on the tennis circuit.\n\n\"I see that the international media has taken that out of context a little bit, saying that I am completely against vaccines of any kind,\" he said. \"My issue here with vaccines is if someone is forcing me to put something in my body. That I don't want. For me that's unacceptable. I am not against vaccination of any kind, because who am I to speak about vaccines when there are people that have been in the field of medicine and saving lives around the world? I'm sure that there are vaccines that have little side effects that have helped people and helped stop the spread of some infections around the world.\"\n\nBut Djokovic did express concern about potential issues with a coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\"How are we expecting that to solve our problem when this coronavirus is mutating regularly from what I understand?\" he said.\n\nDjokovic said the U.S.T.A.'s leadership was initially reluctant to allow players to stay in rented homes during the U.S. Open. They relented but imposed strict conditions. Djokovic must pay not only the rent but also for round-the-clock security approved and monitored by the U.S.T.A, in part to help enforce the same protocols other players are following.\n\nThis is not simply the honor system.\n\n\"It's super important I made this investment because it's going to make me feel better,\" Djokovic said. \"I'm going to recover better and can actually have some outdoor time when I'm not on site.\"\n\nHe has come with the maximum three team members, another concession he worked to secure from the U.S.T.A., which originally planned to restrict players to just one team member. One of Djokovic's housemates isGoran Ivanisevic, the former Wimbledon champion who is one of his coaches and also contracted the coronavirus during the Adria Tour, along with other players and coaches.\n\nTo those watching from afar, that outcome seemed logical in light of the lack of safety measures. Fans were allowed in stadiums. Masks were recommended but not required. Players hugged, high-fived and even danced the limbo in close quarters in a Belgrade nightclub.\n\n\"I agree things could have been done differently with the nightclub,\" Djokovic said. \"The sponsors organized. They invited players. We felt comfortable. We had a successful event. Everybody was really happy and joyful.\"\n\nDjokovic said the tour, conceived with the idea of helping lower-ranked pro players in the former Yugoslavia during the hiatus, was organized in cooperation with national governments and tennis federations. At the time, coronavirus numbers were low in Serbia and Croatia with few societal restrictions.\n\n\"We've done everything they asked us to do, and we followed the rules from the Day 1,\" Djokovic said.\n\nBut Djokovic said he soon grasped that the view from abroad was very different.\n\n\"When someone from Australia or America looks at what was happening in Serbia, they're like, 'Oh my God, I mean are you crazy? What are these people doing?'\" Djokovic said. \"So I really understand.\"\n\nThere was also criticism in Croatia of the tour and the Croatian tennis federation's role in managing the event. But Djokovic, who also made sizable donations with his wife to coronavirus relief efforts in Serbia and Italy, maintains the tour was still worth organizing for the funds it generated for the region.\n\n\"I don't think I've done anything bad to be honest,\" he said. \"I do feel sorry for people that were infected. Do I feel guilty for anybody that was infected from that point onward in Serbia, Croatia and the region? Of course not. It's like a witch hunt, to be honest. How can you blame one individual for everything?\"\n\nDjokovic is 33, but this will be the first of the 61 Grand Slam tournaments he has played in his long and triumphant career in which his biggest rivals -- Nadal and Federer -- will both be absent.\n\nNadal, 34, the reigning U.S. Open men's champion, chose to prioritize the clay-court season that will closely follow the U.S. Open on the reconfigured tennis calendar. Federer, 39, does not plan to play again in 2020 after two knee surgeries this year.\n\nIn New York, the rightly named Big Three will be reduced to one.\n\n\"It is strange, because these two guys are the legends of our sport and with or without crowds, they are going to be missed a lot,\" Djokovic said.\n\nBut he insisted that their absence and the absence of eight other players in the men's top 100, including the 2016 U.S. Open champion Stan Wawrinka, did not diminish the significance of this tournament in his opinion because \"a super majority\" of top players will be there.\n\nFederer holds the men's record with 20 Grand Slam singles titles. Nadal has 19. Djokovic has 17, and he said the quest for 18 was \"of course\" a significant factor in his decision to cross the Atlantic.\n\n\"One of the reasons why I keep on playing professional tennis on this level is because I want to reach more heights in the tennis world,\" he said.\n\nHe said Federer's Grand Slam record and men's record of 310 weeks at No. 1 remained among his primary targets. Djokovic is at 282 weeks and he could surpass Federer by March.\n\nDjokovic said he feels ready after the longest break of his career, but he doesn't know for certain. And he would have welcomed discussion about playing best-of-three sets at the U.S. Open instead of the usual best-of-five.\n\n\"Maybe in the future we should have that conversation. Because these kind of circumstances are very unusual,\" he said.\n\nHis presence, however difficult to secure, is a major boost for both tournaments in New York. He has won three U.S. Opens and five of the last seven Grand Slam singles titles. The absence of the entire Big Three would have sent the asterisk debate into overdrive.\n\n\"I cannot say it's the main reason why I'm here, but it's one of the reasons,\" he said. \"First of all, I have to think about myself and my health and my fitness and whether my team is OK to be here. Once that was checked, then I of course also felt responsible as a top player to be here. It's important for our sport to keep going.\"",

        "body": "Less than 40 percent of the nation's schools had a full-time nurse before the pandemic, and there has been no national effort to hire more.\n\nAs the lone nurse for her school district in central Washington State, Janna Benzel will monitor 1,800 students for coronavirus symptoms when classrooms open this month, on top of her normal responsibilities like managing allergies, distributing medications and writing hundreds of immunization plans.\n\n\"I'll have to go to these schools and assess every sniffle and sneeze that could potentially be a positive case,\" she said. \"I just don't know if I can do it alone.\"\n\nSchool nurses are already in short supply, with less than 40 percent of schools employing one full time before the pandemic. Now those overburdened health care specialists are finding themselves on the front lines of a risky, high-stakes experiment in protecting public health as districts reopen their doors amid spiking caseloads in many parts of the country.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that every school have a nurse on site. But before the outbreak, according to the National Association of School Nurses, a quarter of American schools did not have one at all. And there has been no national effort to provide districts with new resources for hiring them, although some states have tapped federal relief funds.\n\nWashington State is one of the places where nurses are a rarity in school hallways, with 7 percent of schools employing one full time, and nearly 30 percent of districts having one available for no more than six hours per week. Like Ms. Benzel, many are being asked to do more than ever before, with little in the way of new resources, training or backup.\n\nIn some places, administrators have been scrambling to get more nurses into schools. New York City, the nation's largest district and one of the few big cities planning to physically reopen its schools on the first day back, went on a hiring spree after the city's powerful teachers' union said its members should not return to classrooms without a nurse in each of the city's roughly 1,300 school buildings.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said last week that the city had finally secured enough nurses to fulfill that demand, less than a month before the scheduled start of in-person instruction.\n\nThose nurses will be charged with evaluating children for coronavirus symptoms and determining whether they should report to an isolation room away from other students and staff members, and communicating with parents already anxious about dropping their children off at school.\n\n\"It's weird that it takes a pandemic for people to be like, 'Oh, look at that, what you do is useful,'\" said Tara Norvez, a school nurse in Queens. Ms. Norvez said she was looking forward to the start of the school year, as long as there was enough personal protective equipment and other safety measures in place.\n\n\"What we are going to do is just step up our game,\" she said.\n\nAcross the country, though, concerns are growing over the ability to prevent the spread of infections, with outbreaks already emerging in schools that have reopened, requiring mass quarantines and even shutdowns.\n\nNurses fear they may contract the virus, and worry whether specially designated isolation rooms and personal protective equipment will be enough to contain outbreaks.\n\n\"Most school nurses are the only health care experts in their school community able to understand infection control and do disease surveillance,\" said Linda Mendonca, president-elect of the National Association of School Nurses. \"But not every school has a nurse who's going to look after the children and staff. You need that expertise as a resource to safely reopen schools.\"\n\nIn Washington, some nurses have been actively involved in the planning process for reopening schools, but most have been called in only after the decisions were made, or were asked to review plans already in motion, said Amy Norton, an administrator with the state's school nurse corps, which helps provide smaller districts with nursing services.\n\n\"School districts are going, 'Oh yeah, our nurse can do that,' and just keep adding on these responsibilities,\" Ms. Norton said. \"They don't understand that we don't have a nurse in every building. We don't have the staffing to cover all of these new needs, like training staff on P.P.E. and educating families on how to check for symptoms.\"\n\nIn Enid, Okla., where schools reopened last week with five-day in-person instruction, Karry Easterly, the head nurse at an elementary school, said she was confident in the district's plan despite a growing number of positive virus cases in the community.\n\nTo prepare, she said, the district spent about $200,000 on protective equipment, installed plexiglass around the desks of school secretaries, ordered thermometers for teachers, and worked with nurses to create isolation rooms for sick students.\n\n\"We know things are going to happen, but the kids need to get back in school,\" she said. But Ms. Easterly voiced concern about schools in nearby districts where the health protocols were considerably more lenient, including the school that her son attends, which lacks a nurse.\n\n\"To me, it's unreasonable,\" she said.\n\nSchool nurses in Suffolk County on Long Island are better prepared for the new academic year than most. Every building has a nurse on site, and they have worked closely on reopening protocols, said Holly Giovi, an elementary school nurse in the Deer Park Union Free School District.\n\nGov. Andrew M. Cuomo has said schools across New York can reopen in the fall, and Ms. Giovi expects her district to offer in-person, remote and hybrid instruction models, with strict social distancing and face mask requirements. \"A plan is still coming together, even though we're at the 11th hour,\" she said.\n\nMs. Giovi has already divided her nurse's office into separate areas for triage, assessment and isolation. Her district appears to be on track to have enough protective equipment, and she supports the federal recommendations for children to be screened at home each morning before school, \"even though I know that parents can lie,\" she said.\n\nSchools Reopening \"Back to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 19, 2020\n\nThe latest on how schools are navigating the pandemic.\n\nGov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has likened reopening schools to a military operation, highlighting an undeniable truth: There will be virus casualties.Notre Dame and Michigan State became the latest major universities to move courses online as student outbreaks continue to mar college reopening plans.Alabama is betting that a robust student testing and technology program will be enough to hinder campus outbreaks.Our Parenting team offers an in-depth look at homeschooling, a decision made by some families that feels more relevant than ever.\n\nBut Ms. Giovi said she remained concerned about ventilation in older school buildings that lack air-conditioning, despite the district's promises to ensure sufficient filtration and fresh air through open windows.\n\n\"I'm worried I'm going to be taking care of teachers passing out from heat exhaustion as much as I am about them coming down with symptoms of Covid,\" she said.\n\nNot all school nurses are willing to wait and see how things play out.\n\nIn July, Amy Westmoreland resigned as an elementary school nurse in the Paulding County School District in Dallas, Ga., because of its decision to make masks optional, while requiring that she tend to both healthy and symptomatic students in a small clinic room.\n\n\"How could I do my job protecting children if I were to have been infected and made them or their family sick?\" she said. \"I would not be able to live with myself.\"\n\nThis month, widely shared photos showed students without masks in packed hallways in the district's North Paulding High School, and nine students and staff members tested positive for the virus, prompting the school to shift classes online.\n\n\"It's truly my worst fear that I knew would probably happen,\" Ms. Westmoreland said.\n\nIn some districts that are not planning to teach in-person classes, nurses are out of work for the time being. The Palm Beach County Health Care District in Florida furloughed about 140 school nurses and health technicians this month, after the county school district decided to teach online until further notice.\n\nBut some other large districts set to teach only online are continuing to provide health care. As the school nurse administrator for Columbus City Schools, Kate King is responsible for the health of 50,000 students and 10,000 staff members in Ohio's largest district.\n\nAided by more than 100 nurses, she has created immunization plans and developed online platforms for connecting with families so students, especially those with chronic illnesses like asthma and diabetes, can remain healthy while learning remotely.\n\n\"When school buildings are shut,\" she said, \"we're still reaching out to make sure their health care needs are met.\"\n\nEliza Shapiro contributed reporting.",

        "body": "Her family became a target of South Africa's security police, facing \"constant surveillance, death threats, phone bugging,\" but she fought on.\n\nNyameka Goniwe, an activist, politician and social worker who survived the death of her husband in one of apartheid-era South Africa's most brutal extrajudicial killings and went on to campaign in vain for his assassins to be brought to justice, died on Saturday in Cradock, South Africa. She was 69.\n\nShe was awaiting the results of a coronavirus test, which proved negative, and the cause of death was not known, a nephew, Mbulelo Goniwe, said.\n\nLocal authorities in Cradock, in the Eastern Cape region, said she had displayed symptoms such as headaches and shortness of breath and had been in self-isolation.\n\nMs. Goniwe was propelled to global prominence in 1985 as a 33-year-old mother of two when a hit squad abducted her husband, Matthew Goniwe, and three other men as they traveled by car from Port Elizabeth to Cradock, where Mr. Goniwe was a schoolteacher and political leader.\n\nThe men were taken to an area of dunes along the Indian Ocean coastline, and were repeatedly stabbed and then set on fire by their attackers -- all security police officials, both Black and white. The intention was apparently to silence the men, quash resistance and to present the murders as an example of Black vigilante violence.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-30T14:43:25.154Z California, as its infection rate declines, becomes the first state to top 700,000 known cases. European leaders weigh new lockdowns as alarming caseloads return. Universities are struggling to rein in their Greek systems, as fraternities and sororities foster outbreaks. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nOne of the assailants, Johan Martin Van Zyl, testified at South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1998 and offered a detailed account of the killings of the four men, Mr. Goniwe, Sparrow Mkhonto, Fort Calata and Sicelo Mhlauli, who came to be known as the Cradock Four.\n\nMr. Van Zyl was seeking amnesty in return for a confession of what he depicted as political acts in the struggle against foes of apartheid. His application was refused but, despite his admission, he was not brought to trial.\n\nThe funeral of the four men drew huge crowds and turned into a defiant statement of the anti-apartheid cause. But it also presented the newly widowed Ms. Goniwe with emotional challenges as she wrestled with her loss.\n\nShortly after the funeral at a dusty soccer stadium in Cradock's segregated Black township, where the Goniwes lived, the South African authorities declared the first of two states of emergency that served to deepen their country's international isolation and, paradoxically, to hasten the end of apartheid with the country's first democratic elections in 1994 after the release of Nelson Mandela in 1990.\n\nWhen he visited Cradock in the 1990s, Mr. Mandela called the slain activists \"the true heroes of the struggle.\"\n\nYet, Ms. Goniwe's own story offered a granular counterpoint to the big-screen moments in South Africa's modern history, tracing the hardship facing spouses of imprisoned activists; the brutality of their abrupt and often unexplained loss; and evoking one of the most tortured conundrums of the post-apartheid era: how could survivors come to terms with the actions of perpetrators?\n\n\"They have to show us remorse, that they're sorry for what they did,\" Ms. Goniwe told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1996, long before Mr. Van Zyl's testimony.\n\n\"I don't say that, I mean, it would immediately make us happy,\" she said in her statement to the commission. \"It's a challenge. We're going to be challenged in that kind of way and grapple with that, inside, and it will take a long time. Healing takes a long time.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nNyameka Puwani was born on June 3, 1951, in Cradock and trained as a social worker. Her parents were farm workers. She married Matthew Goniwe in 1975 and they had two children -- a daughter, Nobuzwe, and a son, Nyaniso. A year later, Mr. Goniwe was charged with political activism and was jailed until 1981 under the Suppression of Communism Act.\n\n\"My ordeal started then,\" Ms. Goniwe told the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1996, describing the strains of life divided between her studies in social work at the University of Fort Hare in Alice, South Africa; the needs of her youngest child who was cared for by Mr. Goniwe's family in Cradock; and her efforts to support Mr. Goniwe in prison.\n\nIn 1982, the family moved to Graaff-Reinet in the Eastern Cape before being transferred to Cradock, where in the years before Mr. Goniwe's death, the township became a crucible of unrest that threatened to embolden disaffected Black South Africans across the land.\n\nIn her account of those years, Ms. Goniwe focused on her husband's deepening involvement in marshaling Black dissatisfaction to the extent that the township effectively slipped beyond white administrative control. \"Running battles between the police and the youth became the order of the day,\" she said. Again her husband was detained only to be released as revolt deepened.\n\nHe was not the only target. \"The whole family bore the wrath of the security police which took the form of harassment, early morning house raids, constant surveillance, death threats, phone bugging, short term detentions for questioning, mysterious phone calls, tampering with cars etc.,\" Ms. Goniwe said.\n\nLater she discovered that their home had been bugged. \"That device could pick up the slightest sound, even the drop of a pin, everywhere in that house, in all rooms, so they could hear us sleeping in our bedrooms, everywhere, they could hear us argue, whatever, whatever happened in that family.\"\n\nAfter her husband's death, Ms. Goniwe was active in efforts to promote social change, particularly in rural areas of South Africa. She later became a mayor and speaker of the local municipality council in Cradock, a position she occupied at her death.\n\nLynsey Chutel contributed reporting.",

        "body": "Several states are trying to increase coronavirus testing with faster methods, undeterred by less accurate but quicker readouts.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, who last week tested positive for the coronavirus, then negative and then negative again, said on CNN on Sunday that his roller-coaster ride should not be reason for people to think \"that testing is not reliable or doesn't work.\"\n\nHis first test result was a positive, when he was screened with a rapid testing method on Thursday before President Trump arrived in Ohio for campaign appearances.\n\nThe Republican governor was given an antigen test made by Quidel, one of two companies that have received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration for coronavirus antigen tests.\n\nThese tests, while fast and convenient, are known to be less accurate than PCR tests, which were used to retest Mr. DeWine twice on Thursday and once more on Saturday. All three PCR tests turned up negative, confirming that Mr. DeWine was not infected with the virus.\n\n\"I don't think that DeWine's results were surprising, per se,\" said Andrea Prinzi, a clinical microbiologist and diagnostics researcher at the Anschutz Medical Campus in Colorado. \"We know that the performance of antigen testing is not as accurate as PCR testing.\"\n\nThe Ohio governor's experience, however, could raise concerns about how much states will rely on antigen tests as they seek to augment the forms of testing, like PCR, that are in short supply or that are mired in laboratory backlogs, unable to generate results in a timely fashion to help assess caseloads and dole out treatments.\n\nMr. DeWine is one of seven governors who announced last week that they were banding together to purchase 3.5 million rapid coronavirus tests, including antigen tests, to ramp up production.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-08T12:04:28.992Z As the U.S. relief talks falter again, Trump says he is prepared to act on his own. Cuomo says N.Y. schools can reopen in-person but leaves it up to districts to determine if, when and how. Thousands of cases went unreported in California when a computer server failed. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nDaniel Tierney, the press secretary for Mr. DeWine, noted in an email that the states involved were eyeing \"multiple companies and multiple testing types,\" but did not specify further.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. DeWine said he had already been in touch with Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland to talk about the states' agreement to use their collective \"purchasing power\" for testing and other supplies.\n\n\"If anyone needed a wake-up call with antigens, how careful you have to be, we certainly saw that with my test,\" Mr. DeWine said. \"And we're going to be very careful in how we use it.\"\n\nA spokesman for Mr. Hogan, Michael Ricci, echoed that sentiment: \"We are taking this one step at a time.\"\n\nAccurate test results are crucial for curbing the spread of disease. False positives, like the one Mr. DeWine received, can set off an unnecessary period of self-isolation, depriving people of access to the workplace or their own families. False negatives, on the other hand, can hasten the spread of disease from unwittingly infected people.\n\nPCR tests like the ones used to determine Mr. DeWine's health status are often the best bet for avoiding incorrect results. But these tests are in short supply nationwide as manufacturers and laboratories struggle to meet the spike in demand that has accompanied recent surges in infections. Turnaround times for results have stretched past two weeks in some parts of the country, rendering the information useless for anxious people who need to know their status immediately so they can self-isolate as needed and stop the virus from spreading further.\n\n\"Honestly, PCR tests were not designed for this type of mass screening/testing,\" Ms. Prinzi said. PCR tests, she added, function best in laboratory environments well-stocked with chemicals, high-tech machines and specially trained personnel. Their high-maintenance ingredient list, requirement for technical know-how and relatively hefty price tag aren't terribly compatible with quickly getting answers to large numbers of people.\n\nRapid tests, on the other hand, could catch a majority of active infections if administered frequently, even if they're less accurate, many experts have argued.\n\nCompared to PCR tests, antigen tests are more likely to return a false negative result, mistaking an infected person as virus-free. Quidel's test, for instance, can miss up to 20 percent of the cases that PCR detects.\n\nNotably, Mr. DeWine's antigen test produced the opposite error: a false positive that incorrectly indicated he had been infected.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection.

Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nBut Mr. DeWine might not have been have been the ideal candidate for an antigen test, said Karissa Culbreath, the scientific director of infectious disease, research and development at TriCore Reference Laboratories in New Mexico. Such tests usually perform better on samples that contain high levels of virus, which tend to come from sicker patients and people at higher risk of transmitting the infection. When given within the first five days after symptoms start, Quidel's false negative rate may drop below 5 percent, according to the company's intended use statement.\n\nMr. DeWine, however, had not experienced symptoms, apart from a headache.\n\n\"If we're testing outside of that intended use, we might expect false positives or false negatives,\" Dr. Culbreath said, referring to the five-day window that follows the onset of symptoms.\n\nAllocating tests to people who fit that criteria, she added, will also eliminate the need for scores of follow-up tests, especially while many suspected cases around the nation remain undiagnosed.\n\n\"Tests are not interchangeable in their usefulness,\" Dr. Culbreath said. \"We need to look at this as a tool belt and identify the right tool for the job.\"\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. DeWine did note that antigen tests function especially well as \"screening\" tests, expediently delivering information to people while their results are confirmed -- if necessary -- by the more accurate PCR tests.\n\nHe added that it was incumbent upon the companies developing the tests to demonstrate their accuracy, and that the experience would not deter him from expanding testing in his state.\n\n\"We could use additional money for testing. We have doubled our testing the last four weeks. We need to double it, and then double it again,\" the governor said.\n\nOhio was among the first states to reopen in May, but as cases ticked up in mid-June and July, Mr. DeWine signed a statewide mandatory mask mandate and asked several counties to limit gatherings of any size. There have been at least 99,969 cases and 3,668 deaths in Ohio since the beginning of the pandemic, according to a New York Times database.\n\nThe status of testing in the United States is far from ideal, Ms. Prinzi said. But for now, it's time to make do with the materials we have, she said. \"We can argue about diagnostic accuracy all day, but this is a huge public health crisis right now,\" she added.\n\nFlaws and all, antigen tests are \"a necessary part of our management of the pandemic,\" Dr. Culbreath said. \"But we have to be very intentional about how we use these tests.\"",

Spread across a large reservation in eastern Arizona, the Apaches have been infected at more than 10 times the rate of people in the state as a whole.\n\nYet their death rate from Covid-19 is far lower, just 1.3 percent, as compared with 2.1 percent in Arizona. Epidemiologists have a hopeful theory about what led to this startling result: Intensive contact tracing on the reservation likely enabled teams that included doctors to find and treat gravely ill people before it was too late to save them.\n\nA crucial tool has been a simple, inexpensive medical device: an oximeter that, clipped to a finger, detected dangerously low blood oxygen levels in people who often didn't even realize they were seriously ill.\n\nContact tracing is generally used to identify and isolate the infected, and thereby to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Elsewhere in the United States, the strategy mostly is failing; the virus has spread too widely, and tracers are struggling to keep up.\n\nBut on the reservation, contact tracers have discovered effective new tactics as they trek from home to faraway home. They may not have been able to stop the virus, but they have managed to prevent it from causing so many deaths.\n\n\"This is really not about contact tracing cutting down spread,\" said Dr. Arnold Monto, a professor of epidemiology and public health at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the project but reviewed the findings. \"Do it right, and the mortality will be lower.\"\n\n\"This could help with other hard-to-reach communities,\" he added. \"If we identify cases sooner, they won't come in half dead with horrible lungs.\"\n\nThis approach, which doctors at the Indian Health Service laid out recently in the New England Journal of Medicine, may offer a new strategy for reducing Covid-19 deaths in some of the hardest-hit communities, Dr. Monto and other experts suggested -- especially among people of color who more often live in housing where multiple generations share space.\n\nDr. Vincent Marconi, director of infectious diseases research at Emory University in Atlanta, said it was \"incredible\" that contact tracing could have such an effect on a population so disadvantaged and at such high risk.\n\nIf the reservation's methods have lowered death rates, he added, \"then absolutely, without a doubt, this needs to be replicated elsewhere.\"\n\nA Walk in the Yard\n\nWhen the virus came to the Fort Apache reservation in April, doctors at the Indian Health Service were prepared to deploy contact-tracing teams to track the spread of the virus -- and try to stop it.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-12T10:58:18.105Z Scores of restaurants in the U.S. have had to temporarily close after outbreaks. Britain's lockdown recession is the deepest in Europe and North America. Crisis in the nation, crickets on Capitol Hill. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"We were ready when it hit us,\" said Dr. James McAuley, clinical director of the Whiteriver Indian Hospital, which serves the Apache community.\n\nThe reservation's contact-tracing team includes 30 members. The day starts with a meeting at 8 a.m., in which each newly diagnosed case is assigned to a contact tracer and staff members review what they have learned about the people they are following.\n\nDr. Ryan Close, an Indian Health Service physician, writes the names of patients and contacts on four large whiteboards. Then the contact tracers -- garbed in masks, gloves and gowns -- set off in small teams to visit homes.\n\nEach team includes a doctor and, when possible, community members like Grant Real Bird, a senior at Arizona State University who speaks the Apache language. His grandfather is well known to tribe members.\n\nMany who are infected with the virus live in multifamily dwellings where isolation is impossible. Not only are members of the household exposed, but people with the virus often have also been out in the community for days with vague symptoms they did not realize signaled the start of an infection.\n\nWhen the doctors started visiting the homes of infected people, many of whom were at high risk of complications because of underlying conditions like diabetes or obesity, they focused on testing their blood oxygen levels.\n\nThe coronavirus can impair the lungs in quiet, almost unnoticeable ways. People may not be gasping for breath, one of the classic signs of low oxygen levels, but the contact tracers often found their levels were perilously low. Without supplemental oxygen, these people risked permanent organ damage and death.\n\nThat led to a new strategy, Dr. Close said: \"Contact tracing is a moderate end in itself, but the primary objective is to identify the high-risk individual\" -- those in grave danger from lack of oxygen. The team visits patients risking serious illness every day, and the moment their blood oxygen levels drop, they are taken to the hospital for oxygen therapy.\n\nAt the same time, the teams made another discovery. In the homes of coronavirus patients, the contact tracers noticed family members who did not look healthy. Often the signs were subtle, but the doctors, who know so many of the residents, recognized changes in complexion or energy levels.\n\nThe doctors asked family members who looked ill to take a brief walk around the room, or into the yard and back, with an oxygen monitor clipped to their fingers. Over and over, they saw the same thing -- people who had oxygen levels so low they should be gasping for air. Yet they showed none of the expected symptoms.\n\n\"It's a fairly common scenario,\" said Dr. Dominick Maggio, director of the emergency department at Whiteriver Indian Hospital. \"The team goes out looking for one person and finds someone else.\"\n\nOne day the team visited Rolland Armstrong, 55, an emergency medical service technician who got infected with the virus. He looked pretty well but was deemed high risk because he had additional medical conditions.\n\n\"Each day he looked marginally worse,\" Dr. McAuley recalled. \"On our third visit, he came outside and sat on a bench, visibly breathless. We walked with him to the bird feeder in his yard and back.\"\n\nMr. Armstrong's blood oxygen level fell to the 80 percent range, far below normal. He was hospitalized and given oxygen. After he was discharged, Dr. Close returned to Mr. Armstrong's home to check on him.\n\nHe was improving -- but his wife, Ramona, 54, looked terrible. \"I wasn't feeling good,\" she recalled. \"I had a headache and a fever and body aches.\"\n\nShe had tested negative for the coronavirus, but now Dr. Close did not believe the lab results.\n\n\"They asked me to walk in the yard,\" she said.\n\nHer oxygen level was lower than her husband's had been. She ended up staying nine days in the hospital as she recovered from Covid-19.\n\nDr. Close worried about what happens if patients without obvious symptoms stay at home with very low oxygen levels. \"Ramona was not on anyone's plan,\" he said.\n\nFinal Goodbyes\n\nSome researchers are now convinced that an expanded mandate for contact tracing, not genetics or some other hidden factor, explains the lower death rates on the reservation compared with the state.\n\nLike other groups living in crowded conditions, the Apaches would be expected to have an alarmingly high death rate, Dr. Monto said.\n\n\"The higher impact in minority populations is not based on increased susceptibility of these populations, but rather higher infection rates and poorer outcomes based on late detection and underlying conditions,\" he said.\n\nBut Dr. Douglas White, professor of critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, said another factor might partly explain the low observed death rate among the Apaches: that aggressive contact tracing is finding people with mild symptoms who otherwise would not have been found, adding to the case count and decreasing the observed fatality rate.\n\nDr. McAuley said that might partly contribute to the lower number but could not be the whole story. The hospitalization rate among the Apaches is about 25 percent, similar to the national average.\n\n\"This suggests that as a group our identified patients are about the same as elsewhere,\" he said.\n\nFew dispute that identifying patients heading into serious trouble has a powerful human benefit: It may give family members a chance to say goodbye.\n\nOn a recent Saturday morning, Dr. Maggio visited the home of his fourth patient that day, looking for a woman who was supposed to have been discharged from the hospital but who was not home yet.\n\nAdults were cooking breakfast, children were watching television. And in the back bedroom, Timothy Clawson Sr., 93, was lying in bed, feeling tired but not especially ill.\n\n\"I was chatting with him and put a pulse oximeter on his hand,\" Dr. Maggio said. \"It started blaring.\" Mr. Clawson's blood oxygen level was 65 percent, dangerously low.\n\nOrdinarily, someone with such a low oxygen level would look as if he or she were dying, Dr. Maggio said: \"They would be pale, breathing fast, leaning forward putting their hands on their knees, trying to get air.\"\n\nBut Mr. Clawson had no idea he was so sick. The family persuaded him to go to the hospital. He survived for just a few days.\n\nHis death was peaceful, said his granddaughter, Tamara Ivins. When she and her aunt visited, \"We reached out and held his hand,\" Ms. Ivins said.\n\n\"He told me: 'This is it. I am going to see Grandma. Be strong for me.'\"\n\n\"I told him, 'Grandpa, I am going to pray for you.'\"\n\nMr. Clawson's large family gathered outside the hospital and said goodbye on FaceTime.\n\nMs. Ivins approached the contact tracers afterward and told them how grateful she was for the time to be with her grandfather at the end.\n\n\"It was a formative moment for me,\" Dr. Close said. \"You can't save everybody, but there is still a tremendous value in giving people time.\"",

        "body": "A February meeting of biotech executives became a coronavirus \"superspreading\" event with a transmission chain across the globe.\n\nOn Feb. 26, 175 executives at the biotech company Biogen gathered at a Boston hotel for the first night of a conference. At the time, the coronavirus seemed a faraway problem, limited mostly to China.\n\nBut the virus was right there at the conference, spreading from person to person. A new study suggests that the meeting turned into a superspreading event, seeding infections that would affect tens of thousands of people across the United States and in countries as far as Singapore and Australia.\n\nThe study, which the authors posted online on Tuesday and has not yet been published in a scientific journal, gives an unprecedented look at how far the coronavirus can spread given the right opportunities.\n\n\"It's a really valuable study,\" said Dr. Joshua Schiffer, a physician and mathematical modeling expert who studies infectious diseases at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle and was not involved in the research.\n\nDr. Schiffer said that the new genetic evidence fit well with what epidemiologists and disease modelers have been learning about the coronavirus. The Biogen conference, he said, was just one of many similar events that amplified and spread the virus in its early months. \"I don't think it's a fluke at all,\" he said.\n\nThe results came out of a project that began in early March at the Broad Institute of Harvard and M.I.T., a research center specializing in large-scale genome sequencing. As a wave of Covid-19 patients crashed into Massachusetts General Hospital, the Broad researchers analyzed the genetic material of the viruses infecting the patients' cells. The scientists also looked at samples from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, which ran tests around Boston at homeless shelters and nursing homes. All told, the scientists analyzed the viral genomes of 772 people with Covid-19 between January and May.\n\nThe researchers then compared all of these genomes to trace where each virus came from. When a virus replicates, its descendants inherit its genetic material. If a random mutation pops up in one of its genes, it will also get passed down to later descendants. The vast majority of such mutations don't change how the virus behaves. But researchers can use them to track the spread of an epidemic.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-26T13:56:11.817Z In Germany, early results of school reopenings are hopeful, but it's 'messy and imperfect.' There have been more than 26,000 virus cases at hundreds of colleges and universities across the U.S. The 2021 World Economic Forum summit will be postponed, organizers say. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"It's kind of like a fingerprint we can use to follow viruses around,\" said Bronwyn MacInnis, a genomic epidemiologist at the Broad Institute.\n\nThe first confirmed case of the coronavirus in Boston turned up on Jan. 29. The patient had traveled from Wuhan, China, and his virus carried distinctive mutations found in Wuhan. But Dr. MacInnis and her colleagues didn't find any other viruses in Boston from later months with the same genetic fingerprint. It's likely that the patient's isolation prevented the virus from spreading.\n\nBut as February rolled on, the researchers determined, at least 80 other people arrived in Boston with the virus. Undiagnosed, they spread it to others.\n\nMost of the viral lineages in Boston have a genetic fingerprint linking them to earlier cases in Europe, the study found. Some travelers brought the virus directly from Europe in February and March, whereas others may have picked up the European lineage elsewhere in the northeastern United States.\n\nDr. MacInnis and her colleagues took a detailed look at a few key places to see how the virus swept through the city. At Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, they found that coronaviruses in patients did not share many of the same mutations. That was a relief, because it meant that the hospital was not a breeding ground where a single virus could spread quickly from patient to patient.\n\nBut that's exactly what happened in a skilled nursing home where 85 percent of patients and 37 percent of the staff were infected. The researchers identified three different virus lineages in the home, but one of them accounted for 90 percent of the infections.\n\nSuch superspreading events are a hallmark of the coronavirus. When an infected person shows up in the right place -- generally inside, with poor ventilation and close contact with other people -- the virus can infect a lot of people in very little time. These unfortunate events don't happen often, and so most people who get infected with the coronavirus don't pass it on to anyone else.\n\nThe virus that raged through the nursing home didn't spread beyond its walls, as far as Dr. MacInnis and her colleagues could tell. But when the virus showed up at the Biogen conference, the story turned out very differently.\n\nThe researchers were able to sequence 28 viral genomes from people at the meeting. All of them shared the same mutation, called C2416T. The only known samples with that mutation from before the Biogen event came from two people in France on Feb. 29.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIt's possible that a single person came to the meeting from Europe carrying the C2416T mutation. It's also possible that the virus carrying this mutation had already been in Boston for a week or two, and someone brought it into the meeting.\n\nAs the attendees spent hours together in close quarters, in poorly ventilated rooms, without wearing masks, the virus thrived. While replicating inside the cells of one meeting attendee, the virus gained a second mutation, called G26233T. Everyone who was subsequently infected by that person carried the double-mutant virus.\n\nFrom the meeting, the researchers concluded, this lineage spread into the surrounding community. In a Boston homeless shelter, for example, researchers found 51 viral samples with the C2416T mutation, and 54 with both mutations.\n\n\"We had no idea it would be associated with the conference,\" Dr. MacInnis said. \"It came as a complete surprise.\"\n\nThe researchers estimated that roughly 20,000 people in the Boston area could have acquired the conference virus.\n\nNew York saw a similar pattern, according to Matthew Maurano, a computational biologist at N.Y.U. Langone Health. After many viral strains arrived from Europe in February, a few came to dominate the city. \"A lot of lineages die off, and some spread enormously,\" Dr. Maurano said.\n\nThe Boston double-mutant spread particularly far. Researchers identified this lineage in samples collected later in Virginia, North Carolina and Michigan. Overseas, it turned up in Europe, Asia and Australia.\n\nDr. Jacob Lemieux, a co-author of the new study and an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, said it was impossible at the moment to determine how many people acquired the virus in the months after the Biogen conference. But it would be in the tens of thousands.\n\nSix months after the conference, Dr. MacInnis said that it should serve as a warning to anyone who thinks life can return to an unmasked version of normal before the virus is brought under control.\n\n\"One bad decision can affect a lot of people,\" she said. \"And the ones who suffer the most from that reality are the most vulnerable among us.\"",

        "body": "So why does the United States have 4 percent of the world's population and 22 percent of coronavirus deaths?\n\nWhat a relief!\n\nI'd worried about the coronavirus, but we're fine! I've been watching the Republican National Convention, and it turns out that while everyone else stood helpless before the pandemic, our national lodestar, President Trump, stepped up and saved millions of lives. Whew!\n\n\"From the very beginning, Democrats, the media and the World Health Organization got the coronavirus wrong,\" according to a G.O.P. propaganda film shown at the convention. Fortunately, \"one leader took decisive action to save lives: President Donald Trump.\"\n\n\"We did the exact right thing,\" Trump said in his speech on Monday. \"We saved millions.\" He has moved seamlessly from the fantasy that the virus would \"go away,\" as he has said some 31 times, to the fantasy that he has already dispatched it.\n\nI feel well equipped to cover the Republican convention, having covered personality cults in China, Iraq and North Korea. But this grotesque manipulation deserves a response, for it dishonors and erases the 180,000 Americans confirmed to have died from Covid-19.\n\n\"The Trump administration is responsible for the single worst public health failure in the last 100 years,\" Peter J. Hotez, a global health expert and dean at the Baylor College of Medicine, told me.\n\nDevi Sridhar, an American who is professor of global public health at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, said it had been \"astounding\" to watch the Trump narrative from afar. In Scotland, she noted, children are now back in school because the government there was committed to suppressing the virus.\n\n\"The biggest obstacle to an effective Covid-19 response is President Donald Trump,\" Sridhar told me. \"There is a path through this crisis, but it requires strong leadership, transparency and letting scientists lead the response.\"\n\nThat's the problem in America: Trump fought science, and the virus won -- so the public lost.\n\n(The hostility to scientific expertise is also evident in the Republican National Convention's obliviousness to climate change, even as California is in flames and a hurricane bears down on Texas and Louisiana.)\n\nThe consensus among health experts is that while local leaders and citizens sometimes messed up, and that luck matters along with other random factors we still don't fully understand, huge responsibility lies with that \"one leader.\"\n\nSome 40,000 confirmed infections are being reported each day in the United States, and another American still dies of the virus every 90 seconds. The University of Washington model projects that about 310,000 people will have died by Dec. 1 -- a figure greater than the number of American combat deaths during World War II.\n\nSo portraying this toll as a tribute to Trump's leadership takes real chutzpah.\n\nTrump initially dismissed the coronavirus as like the flu, scoffed that it was \"totally under control\" and insisted it would disappear \"like a miracle.\" He imposed some travel restrictions on China (with enormous exceptions), which may have helped modestly, but he fumbled testing, didn't ensure adequate protective equipment, and offered confused messaging.\n\nThe president resisted masks and embraced miracle cures -- some dangerous ones, like injecting household disinfectants. He encouraged followers to \"liberate\" states with lockdowns and his administration pressed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to revise testing guidelines to exclude those without symptoms. He has suggested that his aim is to \"slow the testing down,\" so that fewer people will test positive; that's like trying to reduce cancer fatalities by ending cancer screening.\n\nTrump still doesn't have a national Covid-19 strategy any more than he has a 2020 campaign platform.\n\nThe United States does not, as many Trump critics believe, have the highest death toll from the coronavirus on a per-capita basis; deaths per million have been higher in Belgium, Peru, Spain, Britain, Italy, Sweden, Chile and Brazil.\n\nYet while other countries made terrible mistakes -- especially initially -- they learned from them. China at first put more effort into suppressing warnings of the virus than into suppressing the virus itself. Italy delayed a lockdown. Britain at the beginning didn't take the risks seriously.\n\nYet those countries were able to self-correct and bring infections down, although imperfectly and with risks of a return. Italy brought infections and deaths down and currently has a death rate over the last seven days just one thirty-second that of the United States. In contrast, Trump never learned and still tackles the virus with magical thinking while resisting a coherent national strategy driven by science.\n\nPandemic control involves not a single tool but a broad set of skills, making it a measure of good governance. It's not surprising that Germany -- led by a disciplined scientist, Angela Merkel -- has done particularly well, with a death rate now only one forty-eighth that of the United States.\n\nIf Trump had managed the pandemic as well as Merkel, some 143,000 American lives could have been saved.\n\nThink about those people's lives when you see Trump try to rewrite history this week. The indisputable truth is this: The United States has 4 percent of the world's population and 22 percent of the world's confirmed coronavirus deaths.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "It started with a text. Or perhaps it was the phone call. Or perhaps its more accurate to say it really started the week before, when my husband mentioned that his cousin S., who lives far away, would be visiting the area and wanted to come over for dinner in our Hudson, N.Y., backyard, and I paused.\n\n\"Don't forget, my parents come next week,\" I said.\n\nBut by the time the day came for S.'s visit, the desire for normalcy had pushed past thoughts of safety, and she arrived wearing a mask. She spent the next couple of hours in our backyard eating takeout Thai and talking without a mask. Then she put it back on as she left.\n\nThat was on a Wednesday. My parents pulled into town on Sunday. We got the text on the following Tuesday that S., who asked that only her first initial be used, had tested positive for the coronavirus. Unbeknown to us, she had taken a test two days before she ate in our backyard, and now, more than a week later, the results had come back.\n\nIn that moment, all of the months of pandemic headlines converged into a single vanishing point. This was a moment that required strong, clear guidance.\n\nBut the two pillars of the Covid-19 response, testing and contact tracing, are a well-documented mess in the United States. It was left to us -- the 17 people whom S. had come into direct contact with between the date of the test and the result, and the many more who had come in contact with us and then with others -- to do it ourselves. That came to almost 70 people.\n\nIt's worth exploring our time as citizen contact tracers to get a sense of what is happening across the country, and what will continue to happen, and why it is likely to get worse, as schools and churches and bars and restaurants snap open and close while the virus continues to fester. My own family is white and privileged; we have access to doctors and sick days and smartphones. I can't imagine how much worse our situation would be without those things.\n\nWhen I first heard the news about S. testing positive on Tuesday afternoon, my mind immediately spun. Could we have transmitted the virus to others? Although my husband and I and probably our children had Covid-19 in the early days of the pandemic and may have immunity, the science is far from settled about how immunity works or if you can be infectious. And we had seen plenty of people since S.'s visit.\n\nWe have two babysitters, Alicia and Tami, who come into our house at different times during the day to watch our young children, and they both live with people who have compromised immune systems. Not only that, on Thursday, the day after we had seen S., a friend from Brooklyn had come up for lunch in our backyard. That evening, we had gone to a drive-in movie with two other friends, Antonia and Bradley. On Friday, the same couple had Alicia babysit for their 2-year-old.\n\nAnd then, of course, there were my parents, both in their 70s. My father has diabetes. They have been extremely careful, and in my mistaken idea that having dinner with my husband's cousin outside without masks was no big deal, I had jeopardized their health.\n\nBut not just theirs. My babysitter Alicia's mother, who also has diabetes, works as an assistant for a close friend of ours in her 80s. That friend lives with a partner who is in her 60s. They are all now quarantining themselves, as are a smattering of other people with whom they have been in close contact. Alicia and her mother immediately went to get tested, as did Antonia's family, but results wouldn't come back for five to seven days. But because symptoms typically appear within four to five days of exposure, we opted not to get tested because of the delays in getting results.\n\nAt the same time, my friend Antonia, doing the right thing, told her son's day care about his potential exposure, and he was promptly barred from returning to day care for 14 days or until he got a negative test result. \"I'm so sorry,\" I texted weakly, \"2020 is the worst.\"\n\nThe next day brought more confusion. First, S. took a second test, this time one that provides a rapid result, and it came up negative. Perhaps optimistically, she texted the group on Wednesday and said that based on the negative tests of her family and the opinion of her doctor, it was very possible that the first test was a false positive.\n\nThen our 8-month-old daughter came down with a fever and some diarrhea. These are the symptoms of most childhood illnesses. They are also symptoms of Covid-19. It seemed impossible to imagine that she had the disease -- she had gotten sick with the rest of our family in March -- but we were not able to get tested then, and she had not had an antibody test as my husband and I had later, though we assumed she had it because we did.\n\nSo again, we were back to circular conversations about potential odds of infection. My parents had been hugging and kissing her for the past four days, as had our babysitters and, by extension, everyone they came in contact with. My volley of text messages started again.\n\nIn the chaos of 2020 America, we are left to seek out wisdom wherever we can. And with conflicting messages -- the president saying one thing and most public health experts saying something quite different -- we have been left to follow our own internal compasses.\n\nAlicia got tested and stayed home. Tami, my other babysitter, didn't feel the need for a test; the risk of exposure seemed small to her. My physician father thought that if he had been exposed, well, nothing could change that. Our pediatrician sighed empathically as I told the rambling story and advised me to focus on treating my daughter. Without fast, accurate testing, she said, she was being forced to give advice blindfolded, with her hands tied behind her back.\n\nNow it's Thursday. More text messages, more questions. Should my parents leave immediately or has the die been cast? Both babysitters will be paid for the rest of the week -- but for how long after that?\n\nMy mother, as I type this, is taking our son on a walk down the block. She won't come in contact with anyone, but should we be strictly quarantining now, no outside activities at all? What is paranoid and what is reasonable behavior? I know that by revealing what we did and didn't do, I am opening myself up to criticism for not taking the safest route at all times. And that criticism is probably justified. Certainly, much of it is currently playing in a loop in my head.\n\nAt the same time, there is a vacuum that should have been filled months ago. We should have contact tracers, not just my husband's worried cousin and her phone. We should have clear protocols. We should have faster results from testing. We should have ... something.\n\nWe could live in President Trump's fantasy of out of sight, out of mind. If S. had not gotten tested, no one would be concerned. But because we have that one fact -- that her initial test came back positive -- I am left to try to comprehend the meaning behind another fact, that a week after we saw S., my baby has a fever and stomach trouble.\n\nThe next few days will be filled with uncertainty as we wait for the virus to appear -- or not -- in the most vulnerable of my family and friends. Until my parents and the 70 or so other people now joined by text stay healthy for 14 days, it won't be clear whether this was a false alarm or the beginning of another, worse narrative.\n\nAs texts and phone calls with news of other positive tests for the coronavirus go out again and again across America, others will be put in similar positions of anger, pain and doubt, and some percentage of those people will end up in a hospital. This spring, as the curtain dropped on New York City, we were alone and frightened in our apartment. It's hard to believe that five months or so later, we are all in roughly the same position.\n\nReyhan Harmanci is the deputy head of programming at Gimlet Media.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "Dr. Finn and Dr. Malley are physicians specializing in infectious diseases and vaccinology.\n\nNot long after the new coronavirus first surfaced last December, an ambitious prediction was made: A vaccine would be available within 12 to 18 months, and it would stop the pandemic.\n\nDespite serious challenges -- how to mass manufacture, supply and deliver a vaccine worldwide -- the first prong of that wish could well be fulfilled. Eight vaccine candidates are undergoing large-scale efficacy tests, so-called Phase 3 trials, and results are expected by the end of this year or early 2021.\n\nBut even if one, or more, of those efforts succeeds, a vaccine might not end the pandemic. This is partly because we seem to be focused at the moment on developing the kind of vaccine that may well prevent Covid-19, the disease, but that wouldn't do enough to stop the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.\n\nDoctors usually explain vaccines to patients and the parents of young children by describing how those protect us from a particular disease: An attenuated form of a pathogen, or just a bit of it, is inoculated into the human body in order to trigger its immune response; having learned to fight off that pathogen once, the body will remember how to fend off the disease should it be exposed to the same pathogen later.\n\nA vaccine's ability to forestall a disease is also how vaccine developers typically design -- and how regulators typically evaluate -- Phase 3 clinical trials for vaccine candidates.\n\nYet the best vaccines also serve another, critical, function: They block a pathogen's transmission from one person to another. And this result, often called an \"indirect\" effect of vaccination, is no less important than the direct effect of preventing the disease caused by that pathogen. In fact, during a pandemic, it probably is even more important.\n\nThat's what we should be focusing on right now. And yet we are not.\n\nStopping a virus's transmission reduces the entire population's overall exposure to the virus. It protects people who may be too frail to respond to a vaccine, who do not have access to the vaccine, who refuse to be immunized and whose immune response might wane over time.\n\nThe benefits of this approach have been demonstrated with other pathogens and other diseases.\n\nThe Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) conjugate vaccines were designed, and licensed in the early 1990s, to prevent young children from developing serious infections such as meningitis. Soon enough an unexpected and welcome side benefit became clear: The vaccine interrupted the bacterium's transmission; after its introduction, occurrences of the disease dropped also in groups that had not been vaccinated.\n\nThe human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines were developed to prevent cervical cancer and genital warts in women. They have proved immensely effective among the women to whom they are administered -- and up to 50 percent effective at preventing genital warts among unvaccinated men, according to a 2017 study of the health insurance records for 2005-10 of some nine million people in Germany.\n\nTo understand why this is the case, remember what it takes for you to become ill from a pathogen, be it a virus or a bacterium.\n\nFirst, you are exposed to it. Then it infects you. While you are infected, you may infect others. In some cases, the infection develops into a disease. In other cases, it doesn't: Though infected, you remain asymptomatic.\n\nOne way that vaccines can interrupt a pathogen's transmission cycle is by preventing the pathogen from causing an infection in the first place. This is how many common vaccines -- against measles, mumps, rubella and chickenpox -- operate.\n\nOther vaccines -- like the ones against meningococcal meningitis or pneumonia brought on by the pneumococcus bacterium -- can block the transmission of the pathogen by interfering with the infection or by decreasing either the quantity of pathogen that the infected patient sheds or the duration of the shedding period.\n\nSome recipients of the pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine simply don't get infected with the bacterium; others do get infected and carry the bacterium in their nose, but in smaller amounts and for shorter periods of time than if they had not been vaccinated.\n\nMuch still needs to be learned about precisely how such mechanisms work -- what part do antibodies play? T cells? -- but the upshot from these examples is this: Vaccines can block the transmission of viruses or bacteria, and they can do so in several ways.\n\nGiven the communitywide benefits of accomplishing that, especially in a pandemic, current vaccine-development efforts should prioritize finding vaccines that limit the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration has stated that preventing a SARS-CoV-2 infection is in itself a sufficient endpoint for the Phase 3 trials of vaccine candidates -- that it is an acceptable alternative goal to preventing the development of Covid-19. The World Health Organization has said that \"shedding/transmission\" is as well.\n\nThese guidelines are an important signal, especially considering that the F.D.A. has never approved a vaccine based on its effects on infection alone; instead, the agency has focused exclusively on the vaccine's effectiveness at disease prevention.\n\nAnd yet vaccine developers do not seem to be heeding this new call.\n\nBased on our review of the Phase 3 tests listed at ClinicalTrials.gov, a database of trials conducted around the world, the primary goal in each of these studies is to reduce the occurrence of Covid-19.\n\nFour of the six Covid-19 vaccine trials for which information is available say they will also evaluate the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections among subjects -- but only as an ancillary outcome.\n\nThis approach is shortsighted: One cannot assume that a vaccine that prevents the development of Covid-19 in a patient will necessarily also limit the risk that the patient will transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other people.\n\nFor example, a study of young Australian teenagers published in the New England Journal of Medicine early this year found that the vaccine used to prevent the diseases caused by the B strain of meningococcus in children and teenagers \"had no discernible effect\" on the presence of the relevant bacterium in the throats of vaccinated subjects displaying no symptoms.\n\nThe inactivated polio vaccine prevalent in many developed countries today, known as IPV, is highly effective at protecting individuals against polio. But it is far less effective at reducing viral shedding, at least in fecal excretions, than the oral vaccine, known as OPV, used more widely in other parts of the world.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the United States, like other wealthy countries, replaced with an acellular vaccine the killed-whole-cell pertussis vaccine it had previously used against whooping cough. A resurgence of whooping cough already was underway, but it accelerated then: Although the new vaccine was better than the previous one at protecting the inoculated from the disease, it was less good at blocking transmission of the bacterium that causes the cough.\n\nConversely, a vaccine that, let's say, offers older adults only modest protection against developing a disease might nonetheless be very effective, when administered to healthy adults or children, at curbing a pathogen's transmission in a population overall.\n\nThis is the case with the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. A 2015 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the vaccine reduced the occurrence of pneumonia in inoculated adults age 65 or older by only about 45 percent. Yet, according to a study last year by researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Stanford University, the immunization of infants and toddlers reduced ninefold the incidence of pneumococcal disease in the elderly.\n\nWith some vaccines, for some diseases, the indirect benefits of vaccination can be greater than the direct effects.\n\nBased on these precedents, it could be a grave mistake for vaccine developers now to hew only, or too closely, to the single-minded goal of preventing Covid-19, the disease.\n\nDoing so could mean privileging vaccines that don't block the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at all, or abandoning vaccines that block transmission well enough but that, by prevailing standards, are deemed to not forestall enough the development of Covid-19.\n\nThat, in turn, would essentially mean that the only way to ever get rid of SARS-CoV-2 would be near-universal immunization -- a herculean task.\n\nFocusing on how to block the coronavirus's transmission is a much more efficient approach.\n\nThis is why randomized controlled trials of the vaccines currently under consideration should include regular monitoring for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in study subjects. The goal should be to evaluate whether the subjects acquire the infection at all, and for how long, as well as how abundantly they shed and spread the virus, when and how.\n\nStudying these issues could also help cast a light on the role of so-called superspreading events in this pandemic.\n\nMore and more research suggests that a very small number of instances -- gatherings at restaurants or bars, choir rehearsal, funerals, church services -- might account for a vast majority of the cases of infection overall.\n\nBut the discussion about those instances has tended to focus on their settings and circumstances, such as the presence of crowds in confined spaces for extended periods of time.\n\nYet the question of whether some infected individuals, perhaps especially at certain stages of infection, are particularly infectious -- whether they, themselves, are superspreaders -- also needs to be studied head-on: When does contagiousness peak in whom and why? And can vaccines modify any of that?\n\nThe best vaccines don't just protect the inoculated from getting sick from a disease. They also protect everyone else from even contracting the pathogen that causes that disease.\n\nPreventing the very transmission of SARS-CoV-2, no less than stopping it from turning into Covid-19, should be a main priority of current efforts to develop the vaccines to end this pandemic.\n\nAdam Finn (@adamhfinn) is a senior clinician in the pediatric immunology and infectious diseases clinical service at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children and a professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol.

        "body": "Even if Trump loses, there's no guarantee we'll make it to the other side.\n\nMy wife, Helen, and I got into a quarrel the other day about how to plan for America's bleak future. Our family needs to replace an aging car, but I've been hesitant, wary of making any new financial commitments as the nation accelerates into the teeth of political chaos or cataclysm. What if, after the election, we need to make a run for it? Why squander spare cash on a new car?\n\nHelen thinks I'm being alarmist -- that I'm LARPing \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" nursing some revolutionary fantasy of escape from Gilead. But I think she -- like a lot of other white, Gen X native-born Americans who've known mostly domestic peace and stability -- is being entirely too blas\u00e9 about the approaching storm.\n\nAs an immigrant who escaped to America from apartheid-era South Africa, I feel that I've cultivated a sharper appreciation for political trouble. To me, the signs on the American horizon are flashing blood red.\n\nArmed political skirmishes are erupting on the streets, and scholars are tracking a rise in violence and instability as the election draws near. Gun sales keep shattering records. Mercifully, I suppose, there's a nationwide shortage of ammo. Then there is the pandemic, mass unemployment, natural disasters on every coast, intense racial and partisan polarization, and not a little bit of lockdown-induced collective stir craziness.\n\nThere's also this: Helen skipped the Republican convention. I watched it wall-to-wall, and it drove me to despair. In that four-night celebration of Trumpism, I caught a frightening glimpse of the ugly end of America, an authoritarian cult in full flower, and I am not keen to stick around much longer to see if my terrifying premonition pans out.\n\nI want you to know that I am straining, here, to resist partisan squabbling. There was a lot for a lefty like myself to dislike about the Republican confab, but what shook me was not any particular policy goal but instead the convention's Peronist aesthetics and the unembarrassed profligacy of lies.\n\nThe convention certainly intensified my worries about a Trump re-election. Unloosed from all checks, a two-term Trump would, I fear, usher in a reign by his clan for long into the future. (Trump has repeatedly \"joked\" about serving beyond a second term.)\n\nBut the Republican convention also quickened my worries about American democracy even in the event that he loses. If Trumpism has charmed a sizable minority of Americans, and if the Trump dynasty retains its mass appeal, will America ever move on? Even if the country can get as far as a peaceful transition of power, can we expect anything like a functioning federal government beyond the inauguration?\n\nIn a new book, \"Presidents, Populism and the Crisis of Democracy,\" the political scientists William G. Howell and Terry M. Moe argue that Trumpism is largely a symptom of growing populist disaffection with the American government's inability to solve people's problems. Even if Trump does lose, they argue, our democracy will still face serious questions about its viability. I asked Moe, a professor at Stanford, how America might recover from this damage.\n\n\"It's not clear that we can,\" he told me. \"I think the Republicans, for now, are an anti-democracy party.\" Their only chance of political survival is to continue to \"make the country as undemocratic as they can so that they can win elections.\"\n\nThe party's complete submission to Trump was on full display at the convention. It adopted a platform that was essentially no new platform other than to \"enthusiastically support the president's America-first agenda.\" There was no mention of Obamacare, the repeal of which was once a Republican policy obsession. There wasn't a single reference to the number of Americans who've died from the coronavirus, nor even a passing recognition of the threats of a changing climate.\n\nInstead, we saw a dynastic cult of personality: Of the six convention speakers who spoke for longer than 10 minutes, four were Trumps.\n\nThen there was the blizzard of lies. The convention represented a new low in collective artifice and delusion. These weren't lies about obscure details or matters of interpretation. These lies cut to the bone and marrow of reality -- the rendering in the past tense of a pandemic that is still killing about a thousand Americans a day, or the description of an economy that is in the worst downturn since the Great Depression as roaring on all cylinders. How did the party get low-income New Yorkers to praise Trump? They simply tricked them into participating.\n\nIt's not the lies themselves that worry me most, but the fact that millions of people might accept them. Can America endure such mendacity? When you don't have social trust, when you don't have a shared view of reality, do you even have a country?\n\nThis week, I asked my Twitter followers if they shared my growing alarm over the state of American democracy. Were they, like me, contemplating the coming unraveling of America?\n\nI was surprised and dismayed to find I was hardly alone. Dozens of people responded saying they worried about the outright rigging of the race, the potential for violence over a disputed election, and the abandonment of democratic norms.\n\nNancy Bermeo, an emeritus professor of politics at Princeton who studies the erosion of democracies -- what scholars call \"democratic backsliding\" -- told me that she sees some reasons for optimism that American democratic norms may survive Trump. Recent polls show the military is increasingly critical of Trump -- a positive sign if you're worried about extra-democratic power grabs. The United States also still has a free press, and there remains widespread support of the basic ideals of democracy.\n\nStill, there is more than enough reason for alarm. \"There's no doubt that there's serious democratic backsliding going on,\" she told me. \"He's doing things that are reminiscent of authoritarians in much less-developed countries with much shorter histories of competitive politics.\"\n\nIn looking for reasons for consolation, she added, \"I'm grasping for hope.\"\n\nOffice Hours With Farhad Manjoo\n\nFarhad wants to chat with readers on the phone.

But at universities across the country, while scores of professors, staff and students start the academic year remotely to curb the spread of the coronavirus, another class of worker will be asked to strap on protective gear to do their job -- without the face coverings: college football players.\n\nNever has the inaccuracy of the term \"student-athlete\" been put in starker relief than in the misguided and dangerous attempt by the Big 12, Atlantic Coast Conference and Southeastern Conference to press forward with a nearly full season of football games beginning next month -- as nonathlete classmates are sent home for their safety. For many college competitors, but for football in particular, the demands of practice and travel can exceed those of a full-time job. The players do it all, however, for no pay -- while schools, coaches, television networks and the conferences profit.\n\nSaturday afternoon college football is a way of life for millions of Americans. But the players -- and make no mistake, the young people who play for these teams are workers, helping to generate billions in revenue collectively for their universities -- are not essential in the middle of a pandemic that has already taken nearly 200,000 lives in the United States. The health and future of college players deserve far more consideration than they've gotten thus far from their coaches, their fans and the presidents of their universities.\n\nThe Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences, whose members include powerhouses like the University of Michigan and the University of Southern California, this month decided to suspend their coming football seasons until it is prudent for players to return to a sport that is impossible to play while staying six feet apart.\n\nUntil there is such a thing as a socially distanced quarterback sack, the other three so-called Power 5 conferences ought to follow suit. The National Collegiate Athletic Association's own physicians raised concerns about the potential for the virus to spread in a contact sport like football. Putting affected players under quarantine for two weeks doesn't account for the potential lingering effects of the virus to the heart and brain well after symptoms have abated. One survey by an Ohio State cardiologist, for instance, found a high rate of myocarditis among athletes who had otherwise recovered from the virus.\n\nSchools are also devising their own testing schedules, which could further put players at risk. While some campuses are testing athletes for the coronavirus multiple times per week, others are testing only players who exhibit symptoms. The University of Alabama, the national champion in two of the past five years, tests once a week, but under SEC protocol it will move to three times a week once the season starts -- similar to the Big 12 and the ACC.\n\nPlayers aren't going to catch the virus \"on the football field,\" the Alabama head coach, Nick Saban, told ESPN. \"They're going to catch it on campus. The argument then should probably be, 'We shouldn't be having school.'\"\n\nGreg Sankey, the SEC commissioner, told this editorial board that the conference's move to delay the season start by three weeks would give schools additional time to evaluate athletes' safety and testing protocols, and noted that a number of athletes had opted out of the season in exchange for an additional year of eligibility.\n\n\"There aren't absolutes; we're working to provide a healthy environment,\" he said. \"There's no group of college students that's known more about a virus at any point in history than our college students know right now.\"\n\nThe governors of Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Texas and other states that are home to the three conferences rushed to reopen their economies and universities even as coronavirus cases have spiked in their states. Among colleges and universities with the largest coronavirus outbreaks, schools from those conferences account for eight of the top 10, according to New York Times data.\n\nPresident Trump and a number of lawmakers, including Senators Marco Rubio and Ben Sasse and Representative Jim Jordan, have called for college football to return in the face of overwhelming evidence that doing so is a bad idea. The SEC's University of Alabama, for example, sent more than 500 students home for testing positive just days into the semester's start.\n\n\"The clear advice from our medical professionals made the choice obvious to us that we couldn't hold a football season,\" Larry Scott, the Pac-12 commissioner, said. \"We have a responsibility to protect our players, and given what we still don't know about the spread of the virus, we simply couldn't play football and look parents in the eye and say, 'We've got your kids' best interests in mind.'\"\n\nA different scene has played out at schools like the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where administrators quickly reversed course on in-person instruction after hundreds of students and staff contracted the virus. While many of the university's 30,000 students were sent home, athletes were instructed to remain on campus if they wanted to play, despite the risks. North Carolina's head coach, Mack Brown, compared the move to professional basketball's enforced safety bubbles. \"We've got three months here where we cannot go outside for social reasons or to eat or anything else if we want to have our season,\" he said. Student-athletes indeed.\n\nCanceling or suspending the college football season and other fall sports is no small decision. Billions of dollars in television and ticket sales are at stake, not to mention alumni donations, merchandise sales, athlete eligibility and even next year's applicant pool. But it is a far more dangerous game to invite the virus's spread among vulnerable athletes during what the Big 12 commissioner, Bob Bowlsby, called the \"petri dish\" of the first few months of school, while advocating for a football season.\n\nCharging forward, heads down, some schools have sought waivers from football players who might contract the coronavirus during the season -- an absurd demand. Fortunately, the N.C.A.A. has offered to extend by a year scholarships and eligibility to play for athletes who opt out of the season over coronavirus concerns.\n\n\"It's not complicated; you can't socially distance in football. We're not going to put students in a bubble,\" said Michael Schill, president of the University of Oregon, in an interview. Teams would also have to give players regular MRIs to ensure they don't have heart issues brought about by symptomatic or asymptomatic coronavirus, he said.\n\nThe excitement of the football season (not to mention countless other aspects of pre-pandemic American life) would be welcome after months of shelter-in-place orders. But with the U.S. death toll continuing to rise and infections exceeding 5.7 million, players and other students contracting the virus as a result of an ill-advised college football season is not a likelihood -- it's a certainty.\n\nAs the nation faces a reckoning over longstanding racial inequities, administrators shouldn't turn a blind eye to how the coronavirus has disproportionately impacted Black and other minority communities. Black and Latino players make up about 60 percent of college football rosters, more than double their representation among the entire United States.\n\nBefore the Pac-12 pulled the plug on all fall sports, a group of athletes threatened to sit out the season, citing, among other things, Black and other minorities' marginalization. Their list of demands included some long overdue measures -- such as profit-sharing and rights to their own likenesses -- that would help ease the racial disparities of college sports.\n\nAs Jevon Holland, a University of Oregon football player, told Sports Illustrated, \"We're not your entertainment, we're human beings.\"\n\nThe governing N.C.A.A.'s mission statement states, \"The educational experience of the student-athlete is paramount.\" What message does it send to athletes and their families that they must stay on campus if they want to play football -- and bring in dollars for their school -- while other students can more safely attend classes via their home computers?\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "Emerging data show that some of the coronavirus's most potent damage is inflicted on the heart.\n\nSARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, was initially thought to primarily impact the lungs -- SARS stands for \"severe acute respiratory syndrome.\" Now we know there is barely a part of the body this infection spares. And emerging data show that some of the virus's most potent damage is inflicted on the heart.\n\nEduardo Rodriguez was poised to start as the No. 1 pitcher for the Boston Red Sox this season. But in July the 27-year-old tested positive for Covid-19. Feeling \"100 years old,\" he told reporters: \"I've never been that sick in my life, and I don't want to get that sick again.\" His symptoms abated, but a few weeks later he felt so tired after throwing about 20 pitches during practice that his team told him to stop and rest.\n\nFurther investigation revealed that he had a condition many are still struggling to understand: Covid-19-associated myocarditis. Mr. Rodriguez won't be playing baseball this season.\n\nMyocarditis means inflammation of the heart muscle. Some patients are never bothered by it, but for others it can have serious implications. And Mr. Rodriguez isn't the only athlete to suffer from it: Multiple college football players have possibly developed myocarditis from Covid-19, putting the entire college football landscape in jeopardy.\n\nI recently treated one Covid-19 patient in his early 50s. He had been in perfect shape with no history of serious illness. When the fevers and body aches started, he locked himself in his room. But instead of getting better, his condition deteriorated and he eventually accumulated gallons of fluid in his legs. When he came to the hospital unable to catch a breath, it wasn't his lungs that had pushed him to the brink -- it was his heart. Now we are evaluating him to see if he needs a heart transplant.\n\nAn intriguing new study from Germany offers a glimpse into how SARS-CoV-2 affects the heart. Researchers studied 100 individuals, with a median age of just 49, who had recovered from Covid-19. Most were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms.\n\nAn average of two months after they received the diagnosis, the researchers performed M.R.I. scans of their hearts and made some alarming discoveries: Nearly 80 percent had persistent abnormalities and 60 percent had evidence of myocarditis. The degree of myocarditis was not explained by the severity of the initial illness.\n\nThough the study has some flaws, and the generalizability and significance of its findings not fully known, it makes clear that in young patients who had seemingly overcome SARS-CoV-2 it's fairly common for the heart to be affected. We may be seeing only the beginning of the damage.\n\nResearchers are still figuring out how SARS-CoV-2 causes myocarditis -- whether it's through the virus directly injuring the heart or whether it's from the virulent immune reaction that it stimulates. It's possible that part of the success of immunosuppressant medications such as the steroid dexamethasone in treating sick Covid-19 patients comes from their preventing inflammatory damage to the heart. Such steroids are commonly used to treat cases of myocarditis. Despite treatment, more severe forms of Covid-19-associated myocarditis can lead to permanent damage of the heart -- which, in turn, can lead to heart failure.\n\nBut myocarditis is not the only way Covid-19 can cause more people to die of heart disease. When I analyzed data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, I found that since February nearly 25,000 more Americans have died of heart disease compared with the same period in previous years. Some of these deaths could be put down to Covid-19, but the majority are likely to be because patients deferred care for their hearts. That could lead to a wave of untreated heart disease in the wake of the pandemic.\n\nMany patients are understandably apprehensive about coming back to the clinic or hospital. The American Heart Association has started a campaign called \"Don't Die of Doubt\" to address the alarming reduction in people calling 911 or seeking medical care after a heart attack or stroke.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, it's been clear that people with heart disease or related conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure are at increased risk for severe Covid-19 illness. The C.D.C. recommends that the more than 30 million Americans living with heart disease practice extra precautions to avoid infection. Hospitals and clinics should work overtime both to ensure they are safe for patients and to bolster telemedicine services so that patients can be cared for without having to leave their homes.\n\nDoctors and researchers should no longer think of Covid-19 as a disease of the lungs but as one that can affect any part of the body, especially the heart. The only way to prevent more people dying of heart disease, both from damage caused by the virus as well as from deferred care of heart disease, is to control the pandemic.\n\nHaider Warraich (@haiderwarraich), the author of \"State of the Heart: Exploring the History, Science, and Future of Cardiac Disease,\" is a cardiologist and researcher at the Veterans Affairs Boston Healthcare System, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "When I met the woman who would become my wife, it was 2001, we were in college, and she already knew that she wanted to join the military. The Navy would pay for her medical school, freeing her of debt. Military service was not a part of my plans, but love makes fools of us all. Since my wooing was already on shaky ground, I smiled and said, \"That sounds great.\" I knew then that if we started dating, I would be beginning a relationship with the military as well.\n\nWe've been married 15 years. The first seven years of our marriage were taken up with active duty service. About 16 percent of Naval officers are women, and about half of them are married. That has made me something of an anomaly: the male spouse of an officer. I remember showing up at the first \"moms and tots\" meeting with my son and thinking, \"Well, this is awkward.\"\n\nStill, we were lucky: My wife never deployed during her years of active duty. Despite three moves, our marriage remained strong. She then transitioned to the reserves, which took her away from me and our four children for a manageable one weekend per month and two weeks every summer.\n\nIt took a pandemic for our luck to run out. A month ago, my wife came home from her time in the field with the dreaded news. As a part of dealing with the unexpected complexities of Covid-19, she, like many other reservist doctors, had been called up to active duty. She would soon have to depart for seven months. In a moment, our anniversary, the start of school, Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Eve were all transformed.\n\nMilitary families all over the world get this news every day. Deployments are always difficult, but preparing for one in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, when everything else feels so unsteady, is a particular challenge. My wife and I prayed a lot about this -- why us, and why now? We concluded that our sacrifice is small compared to the sacrifices of others, and that we need not understand what God is doing in order to trust him. Nonetheless, we mourned the separation.\n\nTwo of our children were at camp when we got the news. I was supposed to leave town to teach a weeklong intensive course. This spring and summer had been a difficult one for the children, with online classes, online church, extended isolation and racial upheaval. How would they handle the added stress of an absent parent? How would I handle teaching at a college with its own combination of in-person and remote teaching while helping the kids, who would not be in school full time? Beyond that, my wife and I have been a team and have worked through life together the past decade and a half. How would I manage so long without her?\n\nAs unsettling as this deployment is for our family, we are not alone: Among those in active duty, about 15 percent are deployed at any given time. In the military community, there is always someone who is going through or who has been through what is happening to you. When I called one of my good friends, who is a reservist, to tell him the news, he told me that he, too, had been called up active duty and would be gone for even longer than my wife.\n\nThe community knows how to rally around families during a deployment, offering meals, babysitting and emotional support. The community came through for us as we prepared for my wife's deployment: They provided welcome insights, prayer and counsel.\n\nThey reminded us that my wife has a \"good deployment.\" It is not dangerous or overly long by military standards. But her job is complicated. Being a doctor in the military is always about balancing the health of your patients with the needs of the military. It is the job of the doctor to advocate for the emotional and physical well-being of servicemen and servicewomen, even when they deeply desire to get back to duty.\n\nThis is all the more true in the midst of a pandemic. Many of the symptoms of Covid-19 could also be the common cold, allergies, or fatigue. My wife and other doctors are figuring out who to test and when, as they work with a population that must live and work in close quarters. They must balance mission readiness with proper caution.\n\nWhen we think of essential workers, our minds turn to grocery stores and medical offices and hospitals here in the United States. We talk about the important roles played by teachers and members of the clergy. But the military is another part of our society that cannot be shut down because of a virus.\n\nAlthough I will miss my wife, I am proud of the role that she will play in helping others. She is a part of something bigger than herself, offering her skills to a community of people who sacrifice for our country. She is not na\u00efve or unaware of the troubling things that have occurred in this country's past. She's dedicated not merely to a set of abstract ideals, but to the people she serves.\n\nShe is deploying in the middle of a pandemic, but there are also young men and women who signed up to serve in the middle of that same pandemic. Some will be newly minted high school graduates making their first forays into adulthood. They deserve the best medical care that their country can provide.\n\nWhen our two oldest children returned home from camp, we ordered their favorite pizza. We sat them down and told them that their mother would be leaving soon. We thought that if we told them about the return date instead of the length of the absence it would be better. But despite all the planning, we couldn't protect them from a profound sense of loss and sadness. The younger two, who are 4 and 6 years old, don't have a good grasp of time; they don't understand how long she will be gone. The older two got it. They hugged her tight and fought back tears.\n\nI thought back to that dorm conversation all those years ago. I remembered that I signed up for all of this, the good and the bad. My wife isn't the only one who serves. We all do.\n\nEsau McCaulley (@esaumccaulley) is a contributing opinion writer and an assistant professor of New Testament at Wheaton College.

        "body": "This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nPresident Trump has never been a picture of legal rectitude -- this is, after all, a man who boasted during his campaign that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue without losing voters -- but the Republican National Convention last week struck many viewers as an especially spectacular display of lawlessness.\n\n\"Mr. Trump's aides said he enjoyed the frustration and anger he caused by holding a political event on the South Lawn of the White House, shattering conventional norms and raising questions about ethics law violations,\" my colleagues reported. \"He relished the fact that no one could do anything to stop him.\"\n\nOne need not be a capital-d Democrat to discern a problem here: When a president no longer feels obliged to obey the rule of law, it suggests the office itself has outgrown existing mechanisms of accountability. If the presidency is too powerful, what can be done to rein it in? Could the answer actually be to vest it with more power? Or should we just do away with it entirely?\n\nThe rise of 'the imperial presidency'\n\nIn 1973, when the Watergate scandal was enveloping Washington, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. famously declared that executive power had spiraled out of control. \"The imperial presidency, created by wars abroad, has made a bold bid for power at home,\" he wrote in The Atlantic. \"If this transformation is carried through, the President, instead of being accountable every day to Congress and public opinion, will be accountable every four years to the electorate. Between elections, the President will be accountable only through impeachment and will govern, as much as he can, by decree.\"\n\nMisgivings about executive overreach hit a high-water mark during Richard Nixon's presidency, but they did not begin with him. As Tina Dupuy has documented in USA Today, they had also flared during Andrew Johnson's impeachment. After his acquittal, a group of concerned citizens drafted a petition arguing that the framers of the Constitution had erred in designing the presidency, which they condemned as an elected kingship. In the wake of Mr. Nixon's resignation more than a century later, Congress enacted a slate of reforms meant to constrain the chief executive, the historians Kevin M. Kruse and Julian E. Zelizer wrote in The Times last year.\n\nNonetheless, new powers continued to accrue to the office under threat of national security crises, both real and imagined. In response to the Sept. 11 attacks, for example, Congress authorized a vast expansion of the national security system under George W. Bush that his successors would inherit. Some of the president's powers we know about; others remain almost entirely secret from the public.\n\nAs executive power has grown, political polarization has increased and intensified partisan gridlock in Congress. That, in turn, has put more pressure on the president to circumvent Congress through what is known as constitutional hardball: uses of the law that fall within the bounds of the Constitution but are nonetheless felt to violate its spirit. \"The main dynamic for Democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional Republicans oppose,\" Dr. Kruse and Dr. Zelizer explained, and \"Republicans have done much in the same vein.\" Both the DACA program and the Iran nuclear deal, as well as the Trump administration's efforts to abrogate them, were products of this dynamic.\n\nWhat's to stop the president from going beyond constitutional hardball and actually violating the law? As Mr. Trump has shown, less than you might expect. Insulating the office from accountability are forces both structural and contingent, among them the Senate's high threshold for impeachment, increasing overrepresentation of white rural areas and a longstanding norm against indicting a sitting president.\n\nHow to weaken the presidency\n\nIf Congress members wanted to strip the presidency of some of its powers, they could begin by finding out and making public what they are. In 1975, the Senate created the temporary Church Committee to investigate American intelligence agencies for engaging in unethical activities, including attempts to assassinate foreign leaders and spy on Martin Luther King Jr. \"No matter who occupies the office, the American people have a right to know what extraordinary powers presidents believe they have,\" writes Gary Hart, one of the Church Committee's last surviving members, in The Times. \"It is time for a new select committee to study these powers and their potential for abuse, and advise Congress on the ways in which it might, at a minimum, establish stringent oversight.\"\n\nWhen it comes to war-making, though, many of the president's powers are used in plain view of the American people. In 2014, the Times editorial board wrote about the abuses of the Authorization for Use of Military Force, which Congress enacted in 2001. Under that law, President Bush was able to justify the invasion of Iraq, warrantless surveillance of American citizens, and the secret kidnapping, imprisonment and torture of hundreds of people without trial, much as President Barack Obama was able to justify the use of drone strikes against suspected terrorists, including American citizens, without judicial review. And of course, since 1945, the president has retained absolute authority to destroy human civilization via nuclear war.\n\nYet even within the existing legal structure, some checks on the presidency lie unused. The Times columnist Michelle Goldberg has noted that nothing but convention has stopped the House of Representatives from responding to the Trump administration's defiance of congressional subpoenas with \"inherent contempt,\" a power last exercised in the 1930s that allows the body to enforce its own orders through fines and arrests. Many legal scholars have argued that the same is true of the entrenched aversion to indicting the president for ordinary crimes.\n\nThe case for strengthening the presidency\n\nWhat if the problem with the presidency isn't that it's too powerful, but that it's too weak? In Boston Review, the political scientists William Howell and Terry M. Moe interpret the success of Mr. Trump's anti-establishment, populist campaign as a symptom of profound dysfunctions rooted in the Constitution itself. Congress, they argue, is wired to be ineffective; over the past 50 years, it has proved incapable of addressing the socioeconomic disruption caused by globalization, technological innovation, immigration and the precipitous decline in worker power.\n\nIn this view, the reflexive desire among Democrats to limit President Trump's power is shortsighted: If his predecessors had wielded enough power to solve the nation's problems, they argue, he might never have been elected in the first place. Even with unified control of both the presidency and Congress through 2019, Republicans were unable to deliver on many of the Trump campaign's promises. \"Elections are supposed to matter -- whether the losers happen to like the outcomes or not,\" Dr. Howell and Dr. Moe write. \"An effective government won't always do what we want. But it will facilitate problem solving. And in so doing, it will protect our democracy. A presidency that is selectively more powerful is the key to making that happen.\"\n\nSince the Reagan administration, the idea that the president should have broad, independent power over the executive branch has been championed most forcefully by conservatives, including Attorney General William Barr. But unlike the staunchest proponents of \"unitary executive\" theory, Dr. Howell and Dr. Moe argue that expansions to executive power would need to be balanced by anti-corruption reforms, limitations of presidential authority over law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and the elimination of the pardon power.\n\nThe case for abolishing the presidency\n\nSeveral months before Mr. Schlesinger warned of the imperial presidency, his fellow historian Barbara Tuchman took to the pages of The Times to call for the office's radical transformation. The job, she argued, had simply become too powerful and too difficult for one person to manage. She proposed instead a \"true cabinet government\" by a directorate of six people, to be nominated by each party and elected as a slate for a single six\u2010year term with a rotating, yearlong chairmanship.\n\n[Related: \"America's Broken Presidency\"]\n\nMr. Schlesinger, for his part, found the solution unsatisfying: Dispersing presidential powers would blur accountability, he argued, not enforce it. Better yet, he suggested, why not do away with the presidential system entirely in favor of a parliamentary one?\n\nParliamentary democracies are generally less prone to gridlock because the executive and legislative branches are fused, as Diane Francis explains in The American Interest. The prime minister is simply another member of parliament who has the backing of a majority; if the prime minister loses the majority, the prime minister is replaced by another member who has it, and if no one has it, the public elects a new parliament.\n\nMost democracies use such a system, including Ms. Francis's native Canada. \"The American model is rooted in conflict and division whereas the Canadian one, due to the need to hold a majority together in order to govern, leads to consensus and compromise,\" she writes. \"Canada's transparency, efficiency and the ability to rid itself of dysfunctional leaders through snap elections is preferable to Washington's endless, chronic gridlock.\"\n\nOur presidential system is one reason Matthew Yglesias predicted five years ago that American democracy might be doomed to break down. As of 1990, no other presidential democracy in the world had managed a century and a half of functional government besides Chile -- until it collapsed in the 1970s, with American help.\n\n\"If we seem to be unsustainably lurching from crisis to crisis, it's because we are unsustainably lurching from crisis to crisis,\" he wrote. \"The best we can hope for is that when the crisis does come, Americans will have the wisdom to do for ourselves what we did in the past for Germany and Japan and put a better system in place.\"\n\nDo you have a point of view we missed?

        "body": "Dr. Dean is an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida.\n\nCoronavirus vaccines are rapidly advancing through the development pipeline. The University of Oxford's vaccine is in large trials in Britain, Brazil and South Africa. In the United States, researchers just began enrolling around 30,000 volunteers to test Moderna's vaccine, and more trials are starting every day. Operation Warp Speed has set an ambitious goal of delivering 300 million doses of a safe, effective vaccine by January.\n\nBut the concept of developing a vaccine at \"warp speed\" makes many people uncomfortable. In a May survey, 49 percent of the Americans polled said they plan to get a coronavirus vaccine when one is available, 20 percent do not, and 31 percent indicated that they were not sure. The World Health Organization considers \"vaccine hesitancy\" a major threat to global health, and poor uptake would jeopardize the impact of a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThis hesitancy isn't surprising. Why should we expect Americans to agree to a vaccine before one is even available? \"I think it's reasonable to be skeptical about a vaccine that doesn't exist yet,\" Dr. Paul Offit, the director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told Today.\n\nI'm a vaccine researcher, and even I would place myself in the \"not sure\" bucket. What we have right now is a collection of animal data, immune response data and safety data based on early trials and from similar vaccines for other diseases. The evidence that would convince me to get a Covid-19 vaccine, or to recommend that my loved ones get vaccinated, does not yet exist.\n\nThat data can be generated by the large trials that are just beginning, known as Phase III or efficacy trials. Some have argued that we already have enough safety and immune response data to start vaccinating people now. But this would be a big mistake.\n\nThis is how Phase III trials work: Thousands of healthy adult volunteers are randomized to receive either a new Covid-19 vaccine or a control -- a placebo or an already licensed vaccine for another disease. Then they go about their normal lives. They do not know what they have received (known as \"blinding\") so the two groups behave similarly in terms of risk taking.\n\nParticipants are monitored for side effects and contacted regularly to ask about symptoms and to be tested for infection. The goal is to compare the rates of disease or infection across the two groups to measure how well the vaccine prevents Covid-19 \"in the field.\"\n\nIt is possible that some Covid-19 vaccines may not prevent infection entirely, but they could still prepare a person's immune system so that, if infected, they would experience milder symptoms, or even none at all. That's similar to the flu vaccine: It's not perfect, but we advise people to get it because it reduces intensive care admissions and deaths.\n\nHow many people need to be protected by a vaccine before it's recommended for widespread use? Ideally, rates of disease will be 70 percent lower in vaccinated people than in unvaccinated people. The World Health Organization says a vaccine should be at minimum 50 percent effective, averaged across age groups. (We know from influenza that vaccines don't always work as well on older adults whose immune systems have declined.)\n\nThis benchmark is crucial because a weak vaccine might be worse than no vaccine at all. We do not want people who are only slightly protected to behave as if they are invulnerable, which could exacerbate transmission. It is also costly to roll out a vaccine, diverting attention away from other efforts that we know work, like mask-wearing, and from testing better vaccines.\n\nThe last thing Phase III trials do is examine safety. Earlier trials do this, too, but larger trials allow us to detect rarer side effects. One of those rare effects researchers are paying attention to is a paradoxical phenomenon known as immune enhancement, in which a vaccinated person's immune system overreacts to infection. Researchers can test for this by comparing the rates of disease severe enough to require hospitalization across the two groups. A clear signal that hospitalization is higher among vaccinated participants would mark the end of a vaccine.\n\nThe speed of the trials depends on how quickly we can detect a difference between the two groups. If two vaccinated people became sick versus 10 who got a placebo, it could be because of chance. But if it were 20 compared to 100, we would feel much more confident that the vaccine was working.\n\nKey to getting a quick result is placing the trial in outbreak hot spots where people are most likely to be infected. We can even target the highest-risk people within those areas, using mobile teams to travel to neighborhoods, bringing the trial directly to the people. Some trials explicitly prioritize essential workers like health care workers or grocery employees. Others are simply focused on enrolling large numbers of participants as fast as possible.\n\nCombining those efforts, it could take as little as three to six months to generate enough convincing safety and efficacy data for companies to apply for expedited review by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThere are ways for vaccines to be approved without definitive efficacy data, based on animal or immune response data instead, but the bar is extremely high, and for good reason. A precondition is that efficacy trials are not possible, typically because the disease is so rare or sporadic that it would require hundreds of thousands of participants to be followed for many years to tell if the vaccine is effective (rabies, for example). That is not the situation here.\n\nWhile there is promising data from smaller trials that measured the antibody response in people who got a vaccine, it's not enough to approve a vaccine. We don't know the level of antibodies needed to prevent infection from this virus. There is a history of vaccines with promising immune response data that did not pan out in the field.\n\nWith this in mind, the F.D.A. has committed to the need for traditional efficacy trial data to approve Covid-19 vaccines. And it follows the W.H.O.'s recommendation, stating that vaccines must be at least 50 percent effective to be approved.\n\nI worry nonetheless that public pressure may mount to approve a product that doesn't meet our standards. Other countries may decide to approve vaccines based on weaker evidence. Russia, for example, claims to be on track to approve a vaccine in just a few weeks.\n\nWe must resist the desire to rush out a product. Creating vaccines is hard, and we should be prepared for the reality that some promising ones will not meet the F.D.A.'s criteria. Researchers and the government should also commit to transparency so that people can see the results for themselves to understand the regulatory decisions.\n\nWaiting for a better vaccine to come along may feel like torture, but it is the right move. With so many potential shots on goal, scientists are optimistic that a safe and effective vaccine is out there. We can't afford to jeopardize the public's health and hard-earned trust by approving anything short of that.\n\nNatalie Dean is an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "Harold Varmus is a former director of the National Institutes of Health. Rajiv Shah is the president of the Rockefeller Foundation.\n\nWe were startled and dismayed last week to learn that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in a perplexing series of statements, had altered its testing guidelines to reduce the testing of asymptomatic people for the coronavirus.\n\nThese changes by the C.D.C. will undermine efforts to end the pandemic, slow the return to normal economic, educational and social activities, and increase the loss of lives.\n\nLike other scientists and public health experts, we have argued that more asymptomatic people, not fewer, need to be tested to bring the pandemic under control. Now, in the face of a dysfunctional C.D.C., it's up to states, other institutions and individuals to act.\n\nUnderstanding what needs to be done requires understanding the different purposes of testing. Much of the current testing is diagnostic. People should get tested if they have symptoms -- respiratory distress, loss of smell, fever. There is no argument about this testing, and the altered C.D.C. guidelines do not affect it.\n\nBut under its revised guidelines, the C.D.C. seeks to dissuade people who are asymptomatic from being tested. Yet this group poses both the greatest threat to pandemic control and the greatest opportunity to bring the pandemic to an end. It is with this group that our country has failed most miserably.\n\nConsider the logic. Without tests or a highly effective vaccine, the only certain way to prevent further spread of the virus would be to isolate everyone from everyone else. In theory, this would work, but it is untenable -- if not impossible -- because of the economic and social consequences of shutdowns.\n\nTests, however, can reduce the number of people who need to be isolated -- and only for as long as they are shown to be infected. If those tests were to be performed frequently (even daily) and widely (even universally), it is almost certain that the pandemic would evaporate in just a few weeks.\n\nThat much diagnostic testing is not feasible, given the costs and logistics, as well as the likelihood that some would refuse to comply.\n\nSo it makes sense to modulate the strategy by testing those who are at greatest risk of infection, and those who are most likely to spread the virus if they become infected.\n\nWe can make well-informed predictions about those who should be given priority. Most obviously, testing is essential for those who are known to have been significantly exposed to an infected person, as determined by \"contact tracing.\" But testing is also important for those who have been or will soon be mixing with large groups in close quarters at work; entering the schools and colleges that are now reopening; and attending public events like concerts and sports matches.\n\nThe financial and other practical demands of widespread testing can be lowered by making rational decisions about the optimal times for performing the tests -- a few days after being in contact with an infected person, for instance, or just before congregating with many others.\n\nThe logistics and costs can be further reduced by simplifying the tests -- using saliva samples collected at home, rather than uncomfortable nasal swabs that require trained personnel at specific locations; or by using so-called antigen tests, a cheap and rapid method to look for viral proteins, rather than expensive laboratory machines to find viral RNA. Even if these tests are a bit less accurate, their lower cost, higher speed and more frequent use make up for it.\n\nSome of these new methods have already been authorized for use by the Food and Drug Administration. And the Department of Health and Human Services has also committed to purchasing large quantities of antigen tests.\n\nThese are practical and essential actions that need to be taken now. In the absence of sensible guidance from the C.D.C., what can the country do to control the pandemic? We urge at least three actions.\n\nState and local leaders should be emboldened to act independently of the federal government and do more testing. Some governors and local public health officials, from both parties, are already doing so and are ignoring the C.D.C.'s revisions. This position is legally sound, since the C.D.C. is an advisory agency, not a regulatory one. Still, such discord undermines confidence in public health directives.\n\nInsurance companies, city and state governments, and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services should recognize the economic and health benefits of testing prioritized, asymptomatic populations and provide reasonable reimbursement for these tests. A major impediment to more widespread testing has been the lack of coverage in the absence of symptoms or known contacts with infected individuals. The costs of testing are decreasing as new methods, like antigen testing, are introduced, and may be further reduced as the pooling of samples makes testing more efficient.\n\nWhile more widespread testing for the virus is an essential factor in pandemic control, we need to make it part of a broad program that helps prevent transmission -- mask-wearing, hand-washing, quarantining and use of personal protective equipment.\n\nThe C.D.C., the federal agency that should be crushing the pandemic, is promoting policies that prolong it. That means that local, state and organizational leaders will have to do what the federal government won't.\n\nHarold Varmus, a professor at Weill Cornell Medicine and a former director of the National Institutes of Health, was a co-chair of President Barack Obama's Council of Advisers on Science and Technology.

        "body": "We shouldn't pathologize normal unpleasant emotions -- which doesn't mean we shouldn't do something about them.\n\nThere has been a lot of talk recently about how the coronavirus pandemic has unleashed a mental health epidemic of depression and anxiety.\n\nThat the pandemic has amped up our stress levels is certainly true. Indeed, there have been a few highly publicized surveys showing that levels of general psychological distress are on the rise. But I worry that calling this a wave of clinically significant depression or anxiety might be premature. What if we're just bored out of our minds?\n\nMany of my patients who have struggled with depression and anxiety have, surprisingly, not experienced flare-ups of their psychiatric illnesses over the course of the past few months. They do, however, say that they feel bored and frustrated. Lots of friends and colleagues, too, say that life has taken on a stultifying quality of sameness.\n\nThe truth is that we don't know yet whether what we're seeing in these surveys will bloom into a full-fledged mental health epidemic. The surveys are, after all, quick snapshots of how we feel during a relatively brief period in time. Their results need to be corroborated by follow-up studies.\n\nAnd to be sure, little of what we're experiencing now is pleasant. But it's worth remembering that boredom is a normal emotional state that we shouldn't conflate with a serious illness like depression. That doesn't mean, however, that we shouldn't address it.\n\nClinical depression is characterized by an inability to experience pleasure, insomnia, loss of self-esteem and suicidal thinking and behavior, among other symptoms. In boredom, the capacity for pleasure is totally intact, but it is thwarted by an internal or external obstacle -- like being quarantined. (Boredom also produces none of the other symptoms of depression.)\n\nWhile boredom isn't depression, the mass experience of boredom isn't something frivolous. In fact, boredom is an aversive and nearly universal psychological experience that can lead to trouble, which makes it worthy of our attention.\n\nIf you wanted to design an experiment to bring about boredom, you couldn't do better than the pandemic. Cooped up in our homes and apartments, we've been stripped of our everyday routine and structure. And without distractions, we are left feeling understimulated. It is this state of restless desire to do something -- anything! -- without a way of achieving our goal (if we even know what it is) that is the essence of boredom.\n\nPeople will go to remarkable lengths to escape these feelings. Consider the following experiment: Researchers asked a group of people to spend just 15 minutes in a room and instructed them to entertain themselves with their own thoughts. They were also given the opportunity to self-administer a negative stimulus in the form of a small electric shock. Strikingly, 67 percent of men and 25 percent of women found being alone with their own thoughts so unpleasant that they chose negative stimulation over no stimulation.\n\nThis suggests that self-reflection can be intrinsically aversive and that we have a near hysterical dread of boredom. Is it any surprise that we structure our lives to avoid it?\n\nApparently, this wasn't always so. The very concept of boredom seems to be a modern invention. As Luke Fernandez and Susan J. Matt wrote recently in Salon, the word boredom did not enter the lexicon until the mid-19th century. Before that, tedium was an expected part of life. It was only with the rise of consumer culture in the 20th century that people were promised nearly continuous excitement; boredom was the inevitable consequence of such unrealistic expectations.\n\nMr. Fernandez and Ms. Matt posit that our modern intolerance of boredom might even be fueling the spread of the coronavirus, as novelty seekers who have had enough of the lockdown head to bars, beaches and amusement parks.\n\nThe fact is that humans crave, to a varying degree, stimulation, and a quarantine effectively prevents us from getting very much of it. Those who are more novelty and sensation seeking, like teenagers, are particularly prone to boredom. So are people who use lots of recreational drugs, because at baseline, they are walking around in an understimulated state in which the everyday world feels uninteresting.\n\nBeing bored might feel intolerable, but, unlike clinical depression, it will never seriously impair your function or kill you. While depression calls for treatment, boredom is a normal state. It doesn't need medical treatment any more than everyday unhappiness requires an antidepressant.\n\nBut we can still do something about it. We can, perhaps, even take advantage of it. Sure, boredom is a signal that we're underaroused, but if we sit long enough with our uncomfortable thoughts and feelings, boredom could provide us with an opportunity to rethink whether we are spending our lives in a way that is rewarding and meaningful to us. What things might we change to make life -- and ourselves -- more interesting?\n\nI do not mean to suggest that the pandemic might not cause an increase in serious mental illness; that's certainly possible. I'm simply saying that it's premature to make that judgment. In the meantime, however, let's not medicalize everyday stress. And let's not dread boredom, but try to use it to our good.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "New data show that Americans are suffering from record levels of mental distress.\n\nI am trying to think of when I first realized we'd all run smack into a wall.\n\nWas it two weeks ago, when a friend, ordinarily a paragon of wifely discretion, started a phone conversation with a boffo rant about her husband?\n\nWas it when I looked at my own spouse -- one week later, this probably was -- and calmly told him that each and every one of my problems was his fault?\n\n(They were not.)\n\nOr maybe it was when I was scrolling through Twitter and saw a tweet from the author Amanda Stern, single and living in Brooklyn, who noted it had been 137 days since she'd given or received a hug? \"Hello, I am depressed\" were its last four words.\n\nWhatever this is, it is real -- and quantifiable, and extends far beyond my own meager solar system of colleagues and pals and dearly beloveds. Call it pandemic fatigue; call it the summer poop-out; call it whatever you wish. Any label, at this point, would probably be too trivializing, belying what is in fact a far deeper problem. We are not, as a nation, all right.\n\nLet's start with the numbers. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, roughly one in 12 American adults reported symptoms of an anxiety disorder at this time last year; now it's more than one in three. Last week, the Kaiser Family Foundation released a tracking poll showing that for the first time, a majority of American adults -- 53 percent -- believes that the pandemic is taking a toll on their mental health.\n\nThis number climbs to 68 percent if you look solely at African-Americans. The disproportionate toll the pandemic has taken on Black lives and livelihoods -- made possible by centuries of structural disparities, compounded by the corrosive psychological effect of everyday racism -- is appearing, starkly, in our mental health data.\n\n\"Even during so-called better times, Black adults are more likely to report persistent symptoms of emotional distress,\" Hope Hill, a clinical psychologist and associate professor in the psychology department at Howard University, told me. \"So when I hear about that fifteen-point difference, it's upsetting, but it's not surprising, given the impact of long-term, race-based trauma and inequality.\"\n\nBut even the luckiest among us haven't been spared. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 36 percent of Americans report that coronavirus-related worry is interfering with their sleep. Eighteen percent say they're more easily losing their tempers. Thirty-two percent say it has made them over- or under-eat.\n\nI'm solidly in the former category. Turns out the extra ten extra pounds around my middle have moved in and unpacked, though I'd initially hoped they were on a month-to-month lease.\n\nSo. How to account for this national slide into a sulfurous pit of distress?\n\nThe most obvious answer is that the coronavirus is still claiming hundreds of lives a day in the United States, whipping its way through the South and heaving to the surface once again in the West. This is true, and on its face is awful enough. But I suspect it's more than that.\n\nAmerica's prodigious infection rates are also a testament to our own national failure -- and therefore a source of existential ghastliness, of sheer perversity: Why on earth were so many of us sacrificing so much in these past four and a half months -- our livelihoods, our social connections, our safety, our children's schooling, our attendance at birthdays and anniversaries and funerals -- if it all came to naught? At this point, weren't we expecting some form of relief, a resumption of something like life?\n\n\"People often think of trauma as a discrete event -- a fire, getting mugged,\" said Daphne de Marneffe, author of an excellent book about marriage called \"The Rough Patch\" and one of the most astute psychologists I know. \"But what it's really about is helplessness, about being on the receiving end of forces you can't control. Which is what we have now. It's like we're in an endless car ride with a drunk at the wheel. No one knows when the pain will stop.\"\n\nNor, I would add, do any of us know what life will look like once this pandemic has truly subsided. Will the economy remain in tatters? (One word for you: inflation.) Will our city centers be whistling, broken conch shells, gritty and empty at their cores? (Lord, I hope not.) Will President Trump be re-elected, transforming democracy as we've known it into an eerie photonegative of itself?\n\nIn her own therapeutic practice, de Marneffe has noticed that families with pre-existing tensions and frailties are doing much worse: The pandemic has only provided more opportunities for struggling couples to communicate poorly, roll their eyes and project rotten motives onto one another. (\"And marriage is already a hotbed of scapegoating,\" she noted.) Parents who were barely limping along, praying for school to start, are now brimming with despair and ruing their lack of imagination: How are they supposed to make it through another semester of remote schooling?\n\n\"Those of us who are average parents rely on structure,\" she told me. \"We need school.\"\n\nI recently thumbed through \"The Plague,\" to see if Albert Camus had intuited anything about the rhythms of human suffering in conditions of fear, disease and constraint. Naturally, he had. It was on April 16 that Dr. Rieux first felt the squish of a dead rat beneath his feet on his landing; it was in mid-August that the plague \"had swallowed up everything and everyone,\" with the prevailing emotion being \"the sense of exile and of deprivation, with all the crosscurrents of revolt and fear set up by these.\" Those returning from quarantine started setting fire to their homes, convinced the plague had settled into their walls.\n\nCamus sensed, in other words, that the four-month mark got pretty freaky in Oran. That's more or less what happened here. If only we knew how it ended.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "The world of coronavirus testing is complicated and confusing. There are lab tests and home tests, spit tests, swab tests and blood tests. But there are still, somehow, not enough tests. On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised guidelines for who should get tested. But those revisions did little to resolve the thorny questions many people are grappling with.\n\nWhether you need a test, or can even get one, still depends on where you live, where you work and which testing facility you visit. Unfortunately, without a national testing strategy focused on substantially scaling up the nation's testing capacity, none of this is likely to change anytime soon.\n\nIn an editorial earlier this month, we asked readers to submit their questions about coronavirus testing. A selection follows, edited for clarity and length, with some answers to keep in mind as you continue to navigate the morass.\n\nThe different types of coronavirus tests\n\nWhat, exactly, is a test? People get swabbed, then what? Does the swab go to a lab, evaluated then and there? What distinguishes a rapid test from a regular one? -- John Langmaid, Glastonbury, Conn.\n\nBroadly speaking, there are three different kinds of tests for the novel coronavirus.\n\nMolecular tests (mostly what are called PCR tests) diagnose active infection by detecting the virus's genetic material, usually in swabs taken from the nose or throat. Because these tests require laboratory analysis, it can take at least one to two days to get results back -- and often much longer, because of supply chain bottlenecks and backlogs at many of the nation's labs. Still, the vast majority of tests being done in the United States right now fall into this category.\n\nAntigen tests are also meant to detect active infection -- and are also usually done via nose or throat swab -- but they are better for screening populations than diagnosing individuals, because they tend to be faster, cheaper and less accurate than molecular tests. Most antigen tests can be done in minutes to hours because they don't have to be analyzed at a laboratory -- this is what doctors refer to as \"rapid\" or \"point-of-care\" testing. So far, the Food and Drug Administration has granted three antigen tests emergency-use authorization. These tests are still difficult to come by -- not all clinics have them -- but they are increasingly being used in nursing homes and other nonclinical settings.\n\nAntibody tests cannot tell whether you are actively infected with coronavirus -- only if you have been infected at some point in the past. These tests are meant to detect specific antibodies (special proteins your immune system produces to fight the virus) in your blood. There are more than 100 of them on the market right now, and they are available in many if not most clinical settings. As with antigen tests, most experts think antibody tests are only really useful for screening populations -- not individuals.\n\nWhat about accuracy?\n\nHow accurate is each type of test? -- Maria Morancy Talbott, Portland, Ore.\n\nIn my own extended family, we saw 10 family members suffer Covid symptoms after my grandmother's funeral. Only five tested positive. I had two tests (as suggested in the opinion piece) -- and both were negative with 11 days of symptoms all in line with Covid. What use are tests if they are false negative? -- Michelle Kelly, Plainfield, Ill.\n\nLab-based molecular tests are the most accurate way to determine whether you have an active coronavirus infection. But they can still be tricky. A positive result almost certainly means you are infected. A negative result almost certainly means that you don't have an active infection -- but you could still have the virus, if it has not yet replicated enough to be detected. Several companies now offer at-home molecular tests, where you mail your own sample in for analysis. Most of them boast a high accuracy rate, but keep in mind that they are being sold through emergency authorization and so have not been fully vetted by the F.D.A.\n\nAntigen tests tend to be good at confirming that you are infected and only so-so at confirming that you are not. Antibody tests are notoriously unreliable. Even the best ones are known to produce many false positives and false negatives. And even if you get an accurate antibody test, that won't tell you for sure if you're immune to the coronavirus. However, both test types can still be useful for gauging where and how far the virus is spreading in a given community. At the population level, repeated testing can compensate for false results and can give a good estimate of how many people are or have been infected.\n\nI have no symptoms. Should I get tested?\n\nI am 71 years old, live alone and am trying to stay in as much as possible, but I live in an area where cases are rising dramatically. I am confused about getting tested. I don't want to take up a valuable test more needed by someone else. I am thankfully so far asymptomatic. -- Lin Kaatz Chary, Gary, Ind.\n\nWhich tests should we take if we have no symptoms? My wife and I may have been exposed to Covid early in January. My wife had a bad dry cough and lost her sense of taste for a long time. -- Steven Davidson, Georgetown, Tex.\n\nOnly an antibody test can detect a past infection, but those tests are fairly useless more than a few weeks after the infection passes (something that's impossible to time if you never had symptoms to begin with). With few exceptions, the Infectious Disease Society of America does not recommend antibody tests for individuals, owing to low accuracy rates.\n\nWhen or whether to get a diagnostic test is still a tricky question. On one hand, even if you have no symptoms, you may still be infected and contagious. On the other, testing backlogs mean that one person's \"just for peace of mind\" test may delay another person's \"urgently need to know\" test. You may want to skip the clinic-based molecular test if you have no clear reason to be worried about exposure (meaning you were not in a crowded room, and none of your close contacts have recently tested positive); if you don't live with someone who is elderly or immune compromised; or if you have concerns but can easily quarantine yourself until the threat of contagion passes (meaning you don't need to leave home for work).\n\nAs they become more available, antigen tests and any other rapid, point-of-care tests that are easy to use in nonclinical settings will become a better option for regularly screening lots of people. But again, those tests need to be taken regularly to compensate for false results.\n\nTiming your test\n\nIf you've been exposed, but have no active infection yet (thus would test negative), can you infect others? How soon after exposure are you contagious to others? Immediately or only after you could test positive (regardless of display of symptoms)? -- Robin Lacey, Winchester, Mass.\n\nIn general, if you are shedding enough virus to make you contagious, a molecular test will detect it. So far, the evidence suggests that people can become contagious anywhere from two days to two weeks after they are first infected -- even if they have no symptoms -- and can remain so for as long as two weeks. Because this window -- during which a molecular test can accurately detect the virus -- varies and can be very short, most doctors say you should have two of these tests, a week or so apart.\n\nIf you're planning to have an antigen test to determine whether you are infected or contagious before a particular event, you should be tested a few times over the space of a week or so, to compensate for the possibility that any one result could be inaccurate. Getting one test right before a cocktail party will not suffice.\n\nIf you decide to get an antibody test to try and determine if you were infected in the past, you should take it between two and eight weeks after your symptoms go away. Again, antibody test results are unreliable, and having antibodies does not necessarily mean that you are immune -- but that time period will give you the best chance of getting a useful result.\n\nNew tests in the works\n\nWhat are the chances of developing a home testing kit, showing results in a few hours, akin to a home pregnancy test? -- Don Brophy, New York City\n\nThe chances are good, but it will take a bit more time. Scores of tests -- both molecular and antigen-based -- are currently being developed. The most promising ones can give results in as little as five to 15 minutes, at home or in a doctor's office -- no lab needed. In theory, at least, some of these tests could be produced easily enough to make widespread use possible. But it will most likely take a few more months before the F.D.A. authorizes or outright approves many of them. (That's not necessarily a bad thing -- we want to know that they work reasonably well before we start relying on them.)\n\nThe agency made some progress this month when it granted emergency use authorization to a third antigen test and to one of the fastest and potentially cheapest molecular tests yet. The new rapid test, which detects viral genetic material in your saliva, is already in use by the N.B.A. (which funded its development) and could be widely available as early as this fall.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

The vaccinated will become a new vector, getting sick themselves and spreading the disease.\n\nDeluded that they are immunized against Covid, too many people will dismiss symptoms as resulting from less devastating diseases. They will not self-quarantine, and public health agencies will not be able to persuade exposed people to limit contact with other, susceptible people.\n\nThere are other reasons not to bow to the political pressure and rush a premature vaccine to market. Wearing masks and distancing work reliably well.\n\nTo prevent the added deaths from an unready vaccine, we need a national mandate for masks and physical distancing until adequate vaccine testing is complete.\n\nCarl Selkin\n\nPasadena, Calif.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI believe in science. I respect scientists. I have a vaccination record as long as my arm. And yet I now find myself in the dubious company of the anti-vaccine crowd as I ponder the safety of anything espoused by the Trump administration.\n\nAnd I do not believe that I am alone. Sadly, this is what an administration built on lies has wrought.\n\nHelen Ogden\n\nPacific Grove, Calif.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nMajor sports teams have essentially unlimited resources for frequent Covid testing, isolation and tracing, as well as strict protocols. If they are taking all these precautions but still having problems with outbreaks, how do you think that opening public schools will work out?\n\nHoping for the best is not a science-based strategy. It's immoral.\n\nGary Price\n\nAustin, Texas\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nFront-line workers in emergency rooms wear a face shield on top of a mask. This protects their eyes from getting infected by coronavirus droplets and provides added protection if their mask is ill fitting. My wife and I wear an N95 or KN95 mask and a face shield whenever we leave our apartment.\n\nAs a physician I strongly advise everybody who can acquire a face shield to wear both a mask and a face shield when in public.

        "body": "Ms. Williams runs the Center for WorkLife Law at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law.\n\nEmployers are using the pandemic to get rid of mothers, and our attempts to protect them are failing.\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act was enacted this spring for the express purpose of providing workers with expanded family and sick leaves for reasons related to Covid-19 and its accompanying school and child care closings. But between April and June, caregiver-related calls to our hotline at the Center for WorkLife Law, which provides legal resources to help workers claim workplace accommodations and family leaves, increased 250 percent compared to the same time last year. We've heard from lots and lots of workers, many of them mothers. And the stories they're sharing make it clear that Families First is falling short.\n\nOne single mom is ineligible for Families First, which excludes health care workers, emergency responders and those who work for companies with over 500 employees. She has no child care options for her 6-year-old and 8-month-old. She exhausted all of her paid leave options while on maternity leave. \"I have been given two options: either resign or get fired,\" she told us. She resigned. She's one of an estimated 106 million people not guaranteed coverage under the act.\n\nEven those who appear to be covered by Families First often end up losing their jobs. A single mom wanted to begin to work part time, taking Families First leave for a few days each week. She felt this worked well, but at the time, taking leave in chunks was allowed only if the employer agreed to it. Hers ultimately didn't -- and she was fired. (On Monday, a federal judge in New York ruled it illegal for employers to refuse intermittent leaves; the Trump administration will likely appeal that decision.)\n\nOne grocery worker was able to return to work -- provided it was on the same part-time schedule she had always worked. But when she asked for that, her employer cut her to zero hours and ghosted her, refusing to respond to queries about why those hours had been reduced, whether she was laid off, what was happening. She's out of luck unless she can prove her termination was discriminatory, which is often hard and sometimes impossible.\n\nWe heard from another single mother whose daughter has a disability that makes her especially vulnerable to Covid, and who had successfully worked from home since near the beginning of the pandemic. She was fired because her employer insisted she return to the office, which she couldn't do without putting her daughter at risk. If a worker has an underlying medical condition, sometimes we can get them telecommuting as an accommodation under the Americans With Disabilities Act. But if they need to telecommute to protect the health of a relative, typically they're out of luck.\n\nWe know that Covid-related job loss has disproportionately affected women. We also know that the women we're hearing from aren't quitting because they don't want to work; they're being driven out by a combination of family care requirements and employer rigidity. And when workers try to push back, they face a labyrinth of laws that are often ineffectual.\n\nFiguring out whether you're eligible for Families First is so complicated that a chart explaining the program looks like a game of Chutes and Ladders. It seems clear that many states understand neither Families First nor a companion program known as Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.\n\nTraditionally, workers have been denied unemployment when they leave a job because of a lack of child care; Pandemic Unemployment Assistance explicitly reversed this until the end of the year. If calls to our hotline are any indication, many employers don't know that, and some states have set up Byzantine systems that ask workers to apply for standard unemployment and get rejected before they apply for Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. (To add to the chaos, Virginia announced a policy of denying unemployment insurance to workers whose kids' camps are closed -- a clear violation of the act, as the Department of Labor recently reiterated.) The end result is that many mothers find that once they have been pushed out, employers derail their unemployment claims on the grounds that they left their jobs for personal reasons.\n\nOne single mother of two found herself without day care and had no income for two months while the state twice deemed her ineligible for unemployment benefits. Another couldn't even appeal her state's decision because of a faulty internet connection. We hear from low-income women who have to return to work, leaving small children home alone. Now they worry someone will call Child Protective Services and they will lose their children.\n\nRecently, we're hearing a lot from mothers whose 12-week Families First leaves are running out, and who still have no option for child care. If schools aren't given the resources to open safely this fall, there's going to be a blood bath. As it is, we may well be facing a generational wipeout of mothers' careers: research shows that when mothers leave the labor force it hurts their economic prospects for decades, often permanently. A society that pushes mothers out of their jobs is a society that impoverishes both mothers and children.\n\nWe're in this mess because, even before coronavirus, the legal protections for working mothers consisted of a convoluted matrix of federal, state and local laws. Mothers who want time and space for pumping breast milk turn to not-very-enforceable provisions of the Affordable Care Act. Mothers who need pregnancy accommodations often turn to the Americans With Disabilities Act. Mothers fired when a disabled child's health care costs cause their employer's insurance costs to skyrocket turn to a tax law. The lack of straightforward legal protections is just one of many ways that public policy fails mothers; the haphazard nature of Families First is merely one symptom of a broader problem.\n\nThis crisis should help us finally recognize that mothers are raising the next generation of citizens; motherhood is not a private frolic like hang gliding. In June, Senator Cory Booker introduced legislation that would, in a simple and straightforward way, protect all mothers -- and fathers, and other family caregivers -- from employment discrimination. That's long overdue but we need much more. If, God and Wisconsin willing, Democrats win in November, we also need nationwide paid family leave and what many other advanced industrial countries also have: neighborhood-based, nationally financed child care to replace the patched-together Rube Goldberg machine that just broke.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "Ms. Rosenberg is an author and a former editorial writer for The New York Times.\n\nCovid-19 has made life much harder for people with opioid addiction. But the response to the virus has also revealed a way forward that could radically expand effective treatment and reduce overdose deaths.\n\nUntil now, getting effective treatment depended on where you lived. Forty percent of American counties -- much of Appalachia, for example -- have no providers licensed to prescribe buprenorphine, the most successful treatment so far.\n\nBut the pandemic has made it possible to see a licensed provider from home, and that could make buprenorphine treatment available anywhere.\n\nMichelle (she asked me to not use her family name) is 57, lives near Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and works from home as a customer service representative. Her computer allows her to live a good life -- after eight years on heroin that followed many years on other drugs.\n\nOver the internet, she sees a psychiatric nurse practitioner, Roseanna Melle, who offers light counseling and prescribes the widely used drug Suboxone -- a combination of buprenorphine and the overdose reversal drug naloxone. It blocks her cravings and prevents withdrawal symptoms, but doesn't get her high. She feels ... normal.\n\nBefore starting telemedicine in April, Michelle got Suboxone at a local addiction medicine clinic. \"It was a revolving door -- sometimes standing room only,\" she said. \"Who wouldn't want to just do your appointment in the comfort and privacy of your own home?\"\n\nRobert, 30, another of Ms. Melle's patients, from nearby Scranton, said: \"Home treatment lessens the shame for me. I don't have to worry what doctors around here think. My Suboxone -- it's just a medication. I don't think about it. I just take it and go about my day.\"\n\nMs. Melle is one of two -- soon to be four -- providers at a new telemedicine company in Pennsylvania called Ophelia. It's one of several companies started in the last few years that prescribe Suboxone: Bicycle Health, Bright Heart Health, Workit Health, PursueCare, Boulder Care. Each is slightly different and they operate in different states.\n\nThe science is unequivocal: The only effective treatment for opioid use disorder is what is called \"medication-assisted treatment.\" Medication makes patients far more successful in treatment and less likely to overdose.\n\nBut at least 80 percent of people who could benefit from it don't receive it. Some are deterred by the stigma still attached to taking Suboxone. But likely more important is the shortage of local providers. In 2016, the Obama administration increased the number of providers and allowed them to treat more patients. It's still far from enough.\n\nSo people buy Suboxone from their drug dealer. \"I bought it on the black market -- a lot of people do,\" Michelle said. \"They sometimes try it because they can't get their drug of choice. Or they're thinking about getting clean, and they don't have insurance and don't want to go through the red tape.\"\n\nOphelia's medical director, Arthur Robin Williams, an addiction psychiatrist and assistant professor at Columbia University said, \"It is easier for people to get the dangerous drugs than to get the treatment for addiction.\"\n\nSome clinics have been using telemedicine for the last few years, but patients still faced many barriers to treatment. The first visit had to be in person -- which meant that access to treatment still depended on where you lived. Doctors were paid a pittance for telehealth appointments, so few doctors offered them. A patient could get only a week's supply of buprenorphine at a time.\n\nAdvocates for treatment have campaigned to remove these barriers -- unsuccessfully until Covid-19.\n\nThe pandemic has led to regulatory changes: Treatment can now be entirely virtual, including the first appointment. Medicare now pays providers the same for a video appointment as a conventional one -- many insurers and Medicaid programs have followed. Patients can get a month's prescription for buprenorphine instead of just a week's.\n\nThese changes are temporary, but everyone I talked to wanted them made permanent.\n\n\"This has just catapulted through this crisis,\" said Allegra Schorr, a Manhattan doctor and the president of Compa, a New York State coalition of medication-assisted treatment providers and advocates. \"Now everybody's doing it,\" she said. \"Within this environment, it certainly seems to be working.\"\n\nPrevention Point Philadelphia is among the largest harm reduction centers in the country. It offers syringe exchange, medical care, social services -- and now, food. The majority of its patients are without homes, and most suffer from multiple mental and physical illnesses.\n\nPrevention Point has offered medication-assisted treatment for 12 years and now treats 268 patients -- many out of a mobile van. \"We try to wipe out any barriers,\" said Silvana Mazzella, associate executive director.\n\nIn mid-March, Prevention Point started prescribing Suboxone through telemedicine. But many of its patients can't do the \"tele\" part. They don't have phones or have no-data phones and can't afford the airtime for an appointment. Prevention Point has given patients some donated phones with data and minutes of usage included, and is seeking more.\n\nMs. Mazzella said telemedicine has helped the patients who can use it. \"It's a reduction of the hassle, wait times, anxiety and fear of withdrawal in a waiting room,\" she said. But the switch has also changed the foundations of treatment,\" she added. \"We have moved to more of a harm reduction model. We have taken away drug screens and things that feel punitive, things patients must do to prove they're a good patient. We've removed the stigma and the power dynamic that typically exists in a clinic. We are putting the same level of trust in patients as you would with diabetes or hypertension.\"\n\nShe said telemedicine patients have proven more likely to fill their prescriptions than patients who had appeared in person in the past.\n\nAlthough Prevention Point doesn't do video drug tests, other practices do. Ophelia sends Robert a kit. On camera, he unseals the box, which has test strips built in to identify buprenorphine and 11 other drugs. Then he fills a tube with saliva to be tested for the presence of opioids, fits the tube into the box so that the test strips can work and shows Ms. Melle the result.\n\nOphelia markets to consumers. It has 90 patients, all self-pay while the company waits to be accepted by insurance plans and Medicaid.\n\nSome other telehealth companies offer therapy. Ophelia doesn't, but neither do most doctors who prescribe Suboxone. Zack Gray, Ophelia's founder, explained: \"We want to make the barrier as low as possible for people to opt into treatment -- then give them the choice to opt into therapy.\"\n\nDr. Williams, the medical director, said: \"When I first heard about Ophelia, I was terrified. I thought the idea was ludicrous.\" He worried about doing proper clinical management over video.\n\nBoth Robert and Michelle, by contrast, said that their previous doctors had left them feeling rushed and judged, and that Ms. Melle knows them far better.\n\n\"Bringing this into the home may not be quite as robust and nuanced as in-person care,\" but it is necessary, Dr. Williams said. \"The U.S. has 40,000 to 45,000 people dying from opioid overdoses every year,\" he continued. \"We haven't done anything at the level needed, and it's been 20 years.\"\n\nTo receive alerts for Fixes columns, sign up here.\n\nTina Rosenberg is a co-founder of the Solutions Journalism Network, which supports rigorous reporting about responses to social problems.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Readers are shocked by the recommendation that asymptomatic people should not be tested.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nRe \"Questions Swirl Around C.D.C.'s Shift on Testing\" (front page, Aug. 27):\n\nAs an infectious diseases specialist and former Centers for Disease Control and Prevention medical epidemiologist, I feel compelled to speak up in response to the recent change in C.D.C. guidelines on testing for coronavirus infection to exclude asymptomatic people. \"If you see something, say something.\"\n\nUntil recently, the C.D.C. was highly respected, driven by science in the best interests of public health. The Trump administration forced the C.D.C. to make these changes for two reasons: to minimize the utter failure of Mr. Trump's response to testing and to make the case counts go down artificially, making them look better than they really are. This action follows the Food and Drug Administration's emergency use authorization of convalescent plasma.\n\nHow will anyone be able to trust these agencies in the future? Their directors should resign in protest rather than follow these politically motivated directives from the White House.\n\nNow we will never know the truth of the magnitude and trends of this epidemic. Just imagine what Mr. Trump will do with vaccine development and research. Shortly before the election he will force emergency use authorization of one or more vaccines before they are proven to be safe and effective (following the lead of his idol, Vladimir Putin).\n\nJust imagine what this will do for the anti-vaxxer movement. The public at large will now feel justified buying into skepticism about the safety and efficacy not only of coronavirus vaccines, but also other vaccines approved by agencies that have now been corrupted by political pressures.\n\nPeter Cegielski\n\nAtlanta\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI am confused. Why does the C.D.C. now say that close contacts of Covid-19 patients need not be tested unless they are symptomatic? Common sense tells us that asymptomatic contacts are the most important group to test if we hope to prevent spread within the community.\n\nIn fact it is more important to test asymptomatic contacts than to test people who have already developed Covid-19 symptoms. Symptomatic individuals will be presumed to be infected, even in the absence of a positive test, whereas asymptomatic carriers will unknowingly transmit the virus to others who will in turn further spread the infection.\n\nI hope a persuasive reason emerges if and when the C.D.C. explains the basis for this new advisory. Until then it would be advisable for state public health authorities to ignore this advice.\n\nLawrence Rothfield\n\nBloomfield, Conn.\n\nThe writer is professor emeritus of molecular biology at the University of Connecticut.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nWhy would the C.D.C. make such an ignorant statement? My daughter shares a house in Santa Barbara, Calif., with six other people. One of her housemates visited a friend in Los Angeles who seemed healthy. Three days later, the friend called to say she had tested positive for coronavirus. The returning housemate had no symptoms.\n\nWithin two days all seven housemates in Santa Barbara tested positive -- three asymptomatic, four with serious cases, including my daughter. If none of them had been tested, they would have gone about their lives infecting others at the grocery, pharmacy, restaurants where they worked, etc.\n\nThis new guidance seems insane at best, politically motivated to suppress numbers at worst. Countries that have controlled the virus have extensive, comprehensive testing on a regular basis. We can't send kids to school, people to work or have any hope of an economic recovery without wide testing. I'm shocked and saddened by this change in message.\n\nBeth Friel\n\nPittsburgh\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nSo the C.D.C. has decided that people not exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19 need not be tested. May we assume, therefore, that asymptomatic people in the White House will no longer be tested? Even those in contact with the president? Yes, I'm sure that will be the case.\n\nJesse Allen\n\nSanta Fe, N.M.",

        "body": "For parents like me, the pandemic has come with a revelation: For our children, school was torture.\n\nIn the early morning hours of Monday, March 9, I was locked in battle with my oldest son, Izac, then a freshman in high school, over what felt like his one-billionth request to skip his 7 a.m. physical education class. He said he was tired and anxious and begged for a break. I told him that when you commit to something, you show up. End of story. And so off he went to school, bleary-eyed and resentful.\n\nFour days later, all of my kids were home, with schools closed \"out of an abundance of caution\" to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Before long, the morning rush to get to class on time felt like a distant memory. The pandemic changed everything.\n\nOne difference that became clear within a few weeks of lockdown: My son was happy.\n\nIzac, my lanky, serious-faced 15-year-old who runs cross-country and listens to Kendrick Lamar, has A.D.H.D. He's never been disruptive -- he's more the dreamy, nose-in-a-book type who likes a calm environment and a limited schedule. Sadly, he's rarely had that. But while my husband and I knew the pressure of a traditional school day could be challenging for him, we didn't realize exactly how miserable he was.\n\nIt felt like he started breathing again the day in-person school was canceled. He started smiling again. This happiness was profound.\n\nWe are not the only family experiencing this. Yes, students across the country are complaining that they miss seeing their friends, and many parents are struggling with the unsustainable arrangement that is working from home while supervising virtual learning. But amid all this, there's also a group of kids who, whether because of bullying, mental health issues or simple overscheduling and pressure, struggled at school in a way that's been made undeniable by the way they're thriving at home amid the pandemic. Parents like me are having to contemplate whether traditional school -- a staple of American childhood -- in fact hurts our children.\n\nJen Foreman, a mother of four children from 1 to 19, saw an immediate change in her 13-year-old daughter after Michigan's classroom closings kept her home. \"Piper was thrilled to be in charge of her own schedule, get the sleep she needed and choose which friends to communicate with,\" Ms. Foreman told me. Piper has been noticeably less anxious. Her acne has even cleared up since she started distance learning.\n\nOne couple I spoke to, who chose to withhold their son's name to protect him from further bullying, told me he said his arm was broken when a classmate shoved him into a wall last fall. They weren't surprised to see his depression lift when he transitioned to virtual learning and no longer had to face his tormentors.\n\nOlivia Hinebaugh told me she never quite realized the extent to which her 9-year-old daughter, who is transgender, was stressed by things like the implications of using the bathroom of her choice and unwanted questions and comments from classmates. But she would often come home from school withdrawn.\n\n\"When we first started doing at-home schooling, I noticed her sort of take a breath,\" Ms. Hinebaugh told me. \"She slept a little longer, seemed more engaged in her interests and wanted to talk to me more. I don't know if we'll ever want to go back to six- to eight-hour school days.\"\n\nWhat is behind all this quiet misery that we are now realizing was part of daily life for some children? Rosalind Wiseman, the author of \"Queen Bees & Wannabees\" and \"Masterminds & Wingmen,\" books based on years of research into the social and emotional lives of school-age kids, said a contributing factor might be the intense pressures that come with schooling in 2020. Just one example: The brutal world of youth athletics. \"We didn't grow up with travel sports that separate wealthier families from poorer ones and parents who, during games, scream at each other, coaches and kids and then brag about their child's 'D-1' opportunities with other parents,\" Ms. Wiseman said.\n\nShe said dynamics like this have turned school-based programs into competition with adult-level pressure on children who are often not mature enough to handle it in a healthy way. As soon as Covid-19 lockdowns were in place, all of that pressure instantly lifted.\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakBack to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 10, 2020\n\nThe latest highlights as the first students return to U.S. schools.\n\nAdmissions tests for many graduate schools have gone online. But not the MCAT, the exam for aspiring doctors, which must still be taken in person, pandemic or not.Republicans and Democrats agree that schools need billions of dollars to reopen, but policy fights have Congress at loggerheads, with educators growing desperate.Focused on trying to reopen classrooms, many schools didn't do all they could this summer to fix remote learning. Here's how families can help fill in the gaps.A high school freshman tested positive after two days in class. A yearbook editor worries about access to sporting events. We spoke to students about what school is like in the age of Covid-19.\n\nBecause of budget cuts, many public schools find themselves jamming 27 or more kids into classrooms and teachers are forced to \"teach to the test,\" which severely limits creativity and often goes against how they were taught to inspire students.\n\nThere are some children for whom this kind of environment is more stifling than enriching. Perhaps this is what explains why Izac's school-related anxiety didn't return as I thought it might when teachers started assigning online work. Sure, we had some standard ninth-grade late work and panicked last-minute projects, but nothing at home has rattled him the way an average day at school did.\n\nHe's told his dad and me that even though the medication he takes greatly reduces the symptoms of his A.D.H.D., he would still struggle to concentrate when a classroom got loud.\n\n\"Teachers at my school,\" he said, \"don't see it as a problem because the kids are doing something positive, laughing or singing, but it does not have a positive effect on me, because I can't concentrate, and it makes me very stressed.\"\n\nOn top of the boredom and frustration, social media create an ever-present fear of doing something \"wrong\" or embarrassing in school that may be caught on video and plastered across classmates' accounts. This is particularly true if they are, in any way, social outliers because of their race, disability, gender identity, sexual orientation or neurodivergence.\n\nLisa Kaplin, a psychologist, told me the kind of anxiety caused by this level of social pressure can be debilitating for children, seriously impairing their ability to learn. \"It would be like trying to memorize something in the middle of a construction zone,\" she said.\n\nDuring quarantine, Izac hasn't just finished schoolwork with more ease -- he's dived into hobbies and subjects he's actually interested in: mountain biking, cooking and practicing archery at the local outdoor range. He even makes his own pizza crusts and sauces from scratch.\n\nIt's been painful for my husband and me to realize that in the years leading up to this pandemic, he was driven to exhaustion every day. But, we thought, doesn't everyone hate school from time to time? Isn't every teenager tired? So we nudged him back onto the hamster wheel, assuming that was the alternative to becoming \"helicopter parents\" who cushion and coddle their kids into lifelong dependency.\n\nWe never questioned whether we were pushing him into suffering. Now we have to ask: Will we do it again when his school reopens?\n\nOf course, the ability to explore this question is itself a privilege. Home-schooling is off the table for many working parents, single parents and those whose children have disabilities. Adiba Nelson's 11-year-old daughter, Emory, who has cerebral palsy, uses a wheelchair and relies on a specialized tablet for communication.\n\nMs. Nelson knows that Emory is missing out on social and academic skills that can be particularly hard to replicate outside of the classroom. When I asked Emory if she liked being out of school for so long, she gave me an emphatic thumbs down.\n\nBut those of us whose children are thriving outside the classroom and who are lucky enough to have the time and resources to contemplate home-schooling have difficult decisions to make.\n\nWhen there's a vaccine or herd immunity, things will eventually return to \"normal.\" But for our children, was normal wrong all along?\n\nJoanna Schroeder is an editor at YourTango, a website about relationships.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "Lessons for coronavirus long-haulers from my own experience with chronic illness.\n\nAmong the many things that nobody knows about the disease that has overturned our lives is how long its effects last. I don't just mean the possibility of coronavirus damage lurking invisibly in the heart or lungs or brain. I mean the simpler question of what it takes, and how long, for some uncertain percentage of the sick to actually feel better.\n\nTwo months ago Ed Yong of The Atlantic reported on Covid's \"long-haulers\" -- people who are sick for months rather than the two or three weeks that's supposed to be the norm. They don't just have persistent coughs: Instead their disease is a systemic experience, with brain fog, internal organ pain, bowel problems, tremors, relapsing fevers, more.\n\nOne of Yong's subjects, a New Yorker named Hannah Davis, was on Day 71 when his story appeared. When she passed the four-month mark, in late July, she tweeted a list of symptoms that included everything from \"phantom smells (like someone BBQing bad meat)\" to \"sensitivity to noise and light\" to \"extreme back/kidney/rib pain\" to \"a feeling like my body has forgotten to breathe.\"\n\nThat same week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a survey of Covid patients who were never sick enough to be hospitalized. One in three reported still feeling sick three weeks into the disease.\n\nI was probably a long-hauler, under this definition. My whole family was sick in March with Covid-like symptoms, and though the one test we obtained was negative, I'm pretty sure we had the thing itself -- and my own symptoms took months rather than weeks to disappear.\n\nBut unlike many of the afflicted, I didn't find the experience particularly shocking, because I have a prior long-haul experience of my own. In the spring of 2015, I was bitten by a deer tick, and the effects of the subsequent illness -- a combination of Lyme disease and a more obscure tick-borne infection, Bartonella -- have been with me ever since.\n\nLyme disease in its chronic form -- or, per official medical parlance, \"post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome\" -- is a fiendishly complicated and controversial subject, and what I learned from the experience would (and will, at some point) fill a book.\n\nBut there are a few lessons that are worth passing along to anyone whose encounter with the pandemic of 2020 has left them feeling permanently transformed for the worse.\n\nImpatience is your friend.\n\nWith most illnesses, get some rest and drink fluids and you'll probably feel better is excellent advice, which is why doctors offer it so consistently. But if you don't feel better after a reasonable duration, then you shouldn't just try to endure stoically while hoping that maybe you're making microscopic progress. (I lost months to my own illness taking that approach.) If you feel like you need something else to get better, some outside intervention, something more than just your own beleaguered body's resources, be impatient -- and find a way to go in search of it.\n\nIf your doctor struggles to help you, you'll need to help yourself.\n\nModern medicine works marvels, but it's built to treat acute conditions and well-known diseases. A completely novel virus that seems to hang around for months is neither. Add in all the other burdens on the medical system at the moment, and the understandable focus on the most life-threatening Covid cases, and it may be extremely difficult to find a doctor who can guide and support a labyrinthine recovery process. So to some uncertain extent, you may need to become your own doctor -- or if you're too sick for that, to find someone who can help you on your journey, notwithstanding the absence of an M.D. beside their name.\n\nTrust your own experience of your body.\n\nYong's Atlantic piece notes that many Covid long-haulers \"have been frustrated by their friends' and families' inability to process a prolonged illness\" and have dealt with skepticism from doctors as well. In such circumstances, it's natural to doubt yourself as well, and to think maybe it really is all in my head.\n\nIn some cases, presumably, it is: Hypochondria certainly exists, and the combination of high anxiety and pandemic headlines no doubt inspires some phantom illnesses. But for a field officially grounded in hard materialism, contemporary medicine is far too quick to retreat to a kind of mysterianism, a hand-waving about mind-body connections, when it comes to chronic illnesses that we can't yet treat. If you don't have a history of imagined illness, if you were generally healthy up until a few months ago, if your body felt normal and now it feels invaded, you should have a reasonable level of trust that it isn't just \"in your head\" -- that you're dealing with a real infection or immune response, not some miasma in your subconscious.\n\nExperiment, experiment, experiment.\n\nThere is no treatment yet for \"long haul\" Covid that meets the standard of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, which means that the F.D.A.-stamped medical consensus can't be your only guide if you're trying to break a systemic, debilitating curse. The realm beyond that consensus has, yes, plenty of quacks, perils and overpriced placebos. But it also includes treatments that may help you -- starting with the most basic herbs and vitamins, and expanding into things that, well, let's just say I wouldn't have ever imagined myself trying before I become ill myself.\n\nSo please don't drink bleach, or believe everything you read on Goop.com. But if you find yourself decanting Chinese tinctures, or lying on a chiropractor's table with magnets placed strategically around your body, or listening to an \"Anti-Coronavirus Frequency\" on Spotify, and you think, how did I end up here?, know that you aren't alone, and you aren't being irrational. The irrational thing is to be sick, to have no official treatment available, and to fear the outr\u00e9 or strange more than you fear the permanence of your disease.\n\nThe internet is your friend.\n\nFor experimental purposes, that is. My profession is obsessed, understandably, with the dangers of online Covid misinformation. But the internet also creates communities of shared medical experience, where you can sift testimonies from fellow sufferers who have tried different approaches, different doctors, different regimens. For now, that kind of collective offers a crowdsourced empiricism, an imperfect but still evidence-based guide to treatment possibilities. Use it carefully, but use it.\n\nAsk God to help you. And keep asking when He doesn't seem to answer.\n\nI mean this very seriously.\n\nYou can get better.\n\nI said earlier that my own illness is still with me five years later. But not in anything like the same way. I was wrecked, destroyed, despairing. Now I'm better, substantially better -- and I believe that with enough time and experimentation, I will actually be well.\n\nThat belief is essential. Hold on to it. In the long haul, it may see you through.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

        "body": "The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nSix months into the global coronavirus pandemic, Americans trying to navigate daily life remain trapped between a clear ideal -- the country needs to test as many people as possible for the virus, as regularly as possible, for as long as possible -- and the reality that there are nowhere near enough tests in the United States to do that.\n\nWidespread testing is the key to opening schools and businesses safely. It's the only way to get a handle on where the coronavirus is spreading, whether efforts to control it are working and what precautions are needed in any given community at any given moment. But funding shortfalls and bottlenecks mean that nearly every entity in the country is falling far short of that goal.\n\nBy most estimates, the United States is conducting fewer than five million tests per week on average, a far cry from the 30 million per week that experts were hoping to achieve by this fall. In some communities it remains difficult to find a test at all. In others, results take a week or longer to come back, making them all but useless.\n\nThese shortcomings have left institutions and individuals with a string of intractable questions: When should people without symptoms get tested? Who should be granted priority when supplies are limited? Which kinds of coronavirus tests should be used under which circumstances?\n\nThere does not seem to be any consensus on these questions. Some schools are requiring entry testing for returning faculty and students, even in places where tests are difficult to come by. Others are not, even where transmission rates are high. The N.B.A. is testing everyone; the meatpacking industry is not. And while the Trump administration is reportedly working to supply the nation's nursing homes with rapid point-of-care tests -- as is urgently needed -- it has neglected to do the same for other congregant living facilities, like prisons, where outbreaks have devastated populations.\n\nMuch of this discord could have been prevented if America had developed a national testing strategy early in the pandemic -- with local, state and federal officials coordinating to clear supply chain bottlenecks and public and private entities working together to develop rapid point-of-care tests.\n\nThere is no shortage of road maps for correcting course. The administration could dust off the national testing plan its own advisers created. Or it could look to the roster of organizations -- including the Rockefeller Foundation -- that have developed similar proposals. But even at this stage in the pandemic, with many thousands of lives and livelihoods lost, federal leaders are acting too slowly.\n\nAmid this void in leadership -- and the abundant confusion over testing across America at the moment -- here's what state and local leaders, parents, business owners and individuals should keep in mind.\n\nWhat should the federal government be doing? A joint report from Duke University and the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health calls for a $75 billion investment in a national testing strategy. That's a lot of money, but it's a small price to pay for getting the U.S. coronavirus epidemic under control.\n\nEven if federal leaders don't invest that much, they at least ought to consider giving companies a stronger incentive to test people quickly. As Bill Gates and others have suggested, companies should be reimbursed by insurers, or paid by the federal government, based on how quickly they can deliver test results: Mr. Gates suggests paying extra for results that arrive in 24 hours, less for those that take 48 hours, and nothing for those that take longer (because by then, those results are useless).\n\nWhat can state and local governments do in the meantime? As frustrating as it sounds, some testing companies have been reluctant to increase production of rapid point-of-care tests because they haven't been assured that those additional tests will be purchased. State leaders can allay some of that hesitancy if they band together to make purchase guarantees with the companies -- as some have already begun to do.\n\nState and local leaders also should consider broader surveillance strategies for detecting coronavirus outbreaks, such as waste water testing. And they should make any data they have on case counts, positivity rates and so on as publicly available and usable as possible.\n\nWhat about individual institutions? Until testing capacity is vastly expanded, it will be nearly impossible to devise a meaningful testing strategy for schools, offices and other institutions -- not only because results need to come in quickly to be actionable, but also because any successful strategy will require repeated testing over many months.\n\nOne thing individual entities should consider given these shortages is a targeted surveillance strategy, where a proportion of asymptomatic people (students, staff members, residents) are systematically tested. That would require stocking up on rapid point-of-care tests (it's likely you'd be getting what are known as antigen tests) and training people to administer them -- hurdles, to be sure. But doing so would help officials detect potential outbreaks.\n\nShould schools require testing? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently advised that universities don't need to consider entry testing -- that is, testing staff and students before they're allowed on campus. The C.D.C.'s argument is that such testing hasn't been specifically studied for this coronavirus. \"That's akin to observing that seatbelts save lives in Cleveland but refusing to recommend them in Cincinnati because that's a different city,\" says Carl T. Bergstrom, a biology professor at the University of Washington. \"It makes much more sense to say, 'Entry testing is a best practice. We understand it's not feasible in a lot of places, but we still think everyone should try.'\"\n\nSchools should be mindful of local testing availability when they set their testing requirements, and should consider implementing their own targeted surveillance programs when possible -- perhaps deciding grade by grade, or classroom by classroom, to determine what level of reopening is safe. Schools in communities where the virus is spreading unchecked should not open.\n\nGiven the shortages and delays, when should people seek testing? Ideally, every person in America would get tested every few days -- because we know that at least one-third of people who are infected and contagious have no symptoms.\n\nBut there is simply not enough capacity to do that many tests. Because results that take more than two days to arrive are effectively useless, it only makes sense to get tested in certain circumstances. If you think you were exposed to the coronavirus, and you can't easily quarantine until the threat of contagion passes, you'll want to get what's known as a PCR test -- that's the most common type of test right now, available at most testing sites -- to know whether you have an active infection and pose a risk to others. Ideally you would get tested twice -- once soon after exposure, and again about a week later. (It often takes several days to develop an active infection.)\n\nGetting tested when you have no symptoms or clear exposure is, at this point, of limited value because it can't be done routinely. But it might make sense to get screened if you are planning to visit elderly or immunocompromised friends or loved ones. In this scenario, ideally you'd get two PCR tests, a week or so apart, and quarantine while you wait for your results.\n\nUnfortunately, both of these scenarios assume you live in an area without long testing delays -- which is a big assumption at the moment. Yes, this is extremely frustrating.\n\nWhat's the point of investing in testing if a vaccine is on its way? A vaccine will not necessarily eliminate the need for rigorous testing. Not only will it take time to deploy, but if a vaccine is less than 100 percent effective, testing will still be needed to monitor the spread of the virus in communities.\n\nIn other words, the coronavirus is not going away anytime soon. If leaders -- at any level -- want to keep schools open, restart the economy and eventually return to normal life, they'll have to start resolving these issues.\n\nWhat are your questions about coronavirus testing?\n\nJeneen Interlandi, a member of the Editorial Board who writes about health, science and education, will be answering questions about this editorial in a future article. What would you like to know about testing strategies and funding?\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "LONDON -- Britain, having moved aggressively to reopen its economy after three months of coronavirus lockdown, now faces what some experts cast as a binary trade-off for a land that loves a good book as much as a cold pint: schools or pubs?\n\nOn Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson came down on the side of schools. Visiting an empty classroom in East London, Mr. Johnson declared that fully opening Britain's schools next month was a \"moral duty,\" and that in event of a resurgence of the virus, \"the last thing we want to do is to close schools.\"\n\nTo avoid that scenario, medical experts said, the government will have to be ready to sacrifice another hallowed British institution -- pubs, as well as restaurants, which reopened a few weeks ago under social distancing guidelines but are increasingly viewed as among the greatest risks for spreading the virus.\n\nMr. Johnson's drive to reopen schools has put him at odds with teachers' unions and local governments, which generally accept that schools should reopen but argue that Britain's system for testing and contact tracing is not robust enough to cope with the outbreaks that are almost certain to follow.\n\nThe government, they said, had not developed plans for how teachers should handle sick students or communicate with parents if there is an outbreak. Mr. Johnson's back-to-school campaign, some said, smacked of a government that had emphasized other priorities, like eating out in restaurants, and was playing catch-up.\n\n\"That doesn't play particularly well with school leaders, who don't need a lecture about moral duty,\" said Geoff Barton, the general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, which represents school administrators.\n\nBritain's schools debate echoes that in the United States and has swept in the same welter of thorny issues: economics, social justice, race and the role of government. And as in other countries, it has ignited often heated disputes over the science, with claims and counterclaims.\n\nThe education minister, Gavin Williamson, said on Monday that there was little evidence that the virus could be spread widely in classrooms. In making this assertion he was apparently referring to the findings of a yet-to-be released government study that looked at 20,000 students and teachers in 100 schools during the summer term. British schools closed on March 20 but reopened on a limited basis on June 1 for first and sixth-year pupils.\n\n\"We have always been and will continue to be guided by the best scientific and medical advice,\" Mr. Williamson said. The findings, he said, should contribute to \"growing confidence among parents about their children returning.\"\n\nBut it is often difficult to pin down \"the science,\" and Mr. Williamson's claims were challenged by several experts.\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakBack to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 10, 2020\n\nThe latest highlights as the first students return to U.S. schools.\n\nAdmissions tests for many graduate schools have gone online. But not the MCAT, the exam for aspiring doctors, which must still be taken in person, pandemic or not.Republicans and Democrats agree that schools need billions of dollars to reopen, but policy fights have Congress at loggerheads, with educators growing desperate.Focused on trying to reopen classrooms, many schools didn't do all they could this summer to fix remote learning. Here's how families can help fill in the gaps.A high school freshman tested positive after two days in class. A yearbook editor worries about access to sporting events. We spoke to students about what school is like in the age of Covid-19.\n\nPrimary schools have not been incubators for the virus in countries that enforced social distancing and mask-wearing, but there have been outbreaks at secondary schools in Australia and Israel.\n\nYounger children are less likely to spread the virus, but the risk is far from zero, and those ages 10 and older are just as likely as adults to pass it on, according to a major, recent study from South Korea. And it is not clear, experts say, whether younger children are any less infectious or simply have fewer opportunities to transmit the virus.\n\n\"Although children have very light symptoms and certainly don't suffer as much as adults, they are spreaders, and children aged over 10 are significant spreaders,\" said David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government who has emerged as an outspoken critic of Britain's pandemic response.\n\nProfessor King pointed to a new study by Neil Ferguson, a prominent epidemiologist at Imperial College London, predicting that a full reopening of schools would drive up the reproduction, or R, number of the virus by as much 0.5. The reproduction number is currently hovering close to 1 in much of the country, and may be slightly above that in London, according to Professor King.\n\nReproduction numbers above 1 mean an outbreak is growing, and the daily number of new cases in Britain has been rising since falling below 600 in early July. On Sunday, it topped 1,000.\n\nGiven the limitations in the country's testing, tracing and isolation system, some question how it will cope with outbreaks in schools when they inevitably happen. The government has already had to reimpose restrictions in Leicester and Greater Manchester, after they reported spikes in the number of infections.\n\n\"The big question is, if you open schools, how long can you keep them open?\" said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. \"If there's spreading, do you shut down the whole school? Do you shut down a single class? How do you define a bubble?\"\n\nProfessor Sridhar said the safest way to open schools was to drive down the transmission rate -- and the way to do that, she said, was to close \"the nighttime economy.\" In the Scottish city of Aberdeen, she noted, nearly 800 people were forced into isolation because of an outbreak that authorities traced to a handful of pubs.\n\n\"My message is, you have to choose,\" she said. \"Which part of the economy do you have to sacrifice? Something's got to give.\"\n\nMr. Johnson cannot order schools to open or close; those decisions are made by the local health authorities. But some teachers say they are eager to return to the classroom, viewing the health risks as manageable. Schools in Scotland plan to reopen this week, with England's opening on Sept. 1.\n\nThe prime minister struck a conciliatory tone on Monday, even if his choice of the empty St. Joseph's Catholic Primary School for his message seemed curious. The trouble is, he has shown more enthusiasm in championing other parts of the economy.\n\nAll this month, for example, the government is giving diners a 50 percent discount on their restaurant bills to encourage them to eat out. Early in the pandemic, Mr. Johnson was loath to shut down the pubs, leaving it up to the owners to decide before he finally imposed a lockdown on March 23.\n\nEven now, Dr. King noted, Mr. Johnson has not actually committed to shutting them down if that proves necessary. \"He's going to wait to see what we do after we open the schools,\" he said. \"That's just a lack of strategy.\"",

        "body": "For Connecticut, the call to pull the plug on the college football season was clear. The Power 5 schools have been far less decisive.\n\nConnecticut football coach Randy Edsall's moment of clarity came when he was recently walking up the hill to his team's practice field.\n\nIn the month since they had been back on campus, his players had assiduously adhered to safety protocols, which included daily screenings, and after more than 200 tests, none were positive for the coronavirus. They were also in a state that has kept a relative lid on the virus -- Connecticut's cases per capita is less than one tenth of that in hot spots like Louisiana, Georgia, Alabama, Florida and Texas.\n\nYet what gnawed at Edsall was how disruptive the virus had still been.\n\nTen players were absent from that day's workout because one player had come forward with symptoms, which might have been as mild as sniffles, and others who had been in contact with him were isolated until a virus test came back. Only eight offensive linemen could participate in the workout. It had been like that throughout July, with only a third of the players attending every workout.\n\nAs he walked, Edsall began to think about what lay ahead. By mid-August, UConn's campus would be open and somewhere between 5,000 and 8,000 students would be returning. He wondered what game days would look like: Would his team dress at their hotel and then bus to the stadium? Would players wear masks on the sideline until they went into the game? Could they retreat to a locker room at halftime?\n\nAnd would the players be required to isolate themselves for 14 days, under Gov. Ned Lamont's orders, after returning from games in places where the virus was not under control, like California, Tennessee and Virginia?\n\nThe next day, Edsall spoke with some of his players.\n\n\"They say to me: Coach, there's no way that we can play a season,\" Edsall said.\n\nEdsall convened a meeting with his team's leadership council, which represents every position group, along with Athletic Director David Benedict, the team doctor and the trainer before conveying their reluctance about playing to the board of trustees and President Thomas Katsouleas.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, Connecticut became the first Football Bowl Subdivision team to cancel its season because of the pandemic. On Saturday, the Mid-American Athletic Conference became the first F.B.S. league to announce it would not play in the fall.\n\nTo be sure, there were other reasons for Connecticut to pull the plug. The football program is swimming in red ink -- it had a $13 million deficit last year -- and it may well be less costly for the Huskies not to play this season. And as an independent, they had already lost six games from the schedule because opponents had moved to conference-only games.\n\nBut the decision, Katsouleas said, was largely driven by the players.\n\n\"I know our student-athletes love to compete and there's a very strong sense of team,\" the UConn president said in an interview. \"When there's a protocol that separates out a portion of the team, you're really divided from your teammates. It causes you to rethink, why are you here?\"\n\nThat question is being asked with increasing frequency by college players around the country at the moment, particularly in the Pac-12, Big Ten and Mountain West conferences, where players have organized to call for greater health protections, among other demands.\n\nAs such, they are the ones giving the most scrutiny to a return -- as the N.C.A.A. stands by, unwilling so far to throw itself in the way of the Power 5 conferences as they push toward football. Playing games would allow the top football universities to salvage hundreds of millions of dollars in television rights fees for this season, even at schools where students are not returning to the classroom.\n\nThe Big Ten announced Saturday that its teams would not practice in pads until further notice, which at least gives teams the chance to practice social distancing, but it raises questions about how physically prepared they would be if their seasons open as scheduled on Labor Day weekend.\n\nShortly after UConn announced its decision on Wednesday, the N.C.A.A. Board of Governors punted a decision on fall sports championships back to each division, who were all given two more weeks, until Aug. 21, to make their calls. Divisions II and III needed only hours to cancel all fall sports championships.\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakSports and the Virus\n\nUpdated Aug. 7, 2020\n\nHere's what's happening as the world of sports slowly comes back to life:\n\nBaseball tightened its virus protocols again: Players and staff members must wear masks in more places and cannot visit \"bars, lounges or malls\" when they are home.With no live crowd noise as a buffer at baseball games, on-field sounds are easy to hear on broadcasts -- and it's not all rated PG.The University of Connecticut canceled its football season, and Divisions II and III scrapped all of their fall championships.\n\nAlong with the board's announcement came a list of measures that might be best described as looking good only on paper: a hotline to report schools not following protocols, mandating testing at least once a week and within 72 hours of a game, and requiring that scholarships for athletes who opt out be honored.\n\nThe measures will certainly do little to comfort players at Colorado State, which is investigating a report that said Coach Steve Addazio pressured players to avoid testing. Or at Washington State, where two players who were opting out for health reasons -- but were questioned by Coach Nick Rolovich about their involvement in a player protest movement -- were removed from the team. Or in the Pac-12, where 18 players who pushed for the same uniform testing protocols as the N.F.L. said Commissioner Larry Scott was dismissive of their concerns.\n\nAs of Sunday, at least 30 players had opted out of Power 5 programs, with some of them saying they would instead prepare for the N.F.L. draft. And the Big Sky became the seventh Football Championship Subdivision conference (out of 13) to say it would not play football this fall.\n\nGretchen Snoeyenbos Newman, an infectious disease fellow at the University of Washington, said, \"The rapidity with which Division II and Division III came back with their answer is a guide to the N.C.A.A. that schools that don't have large financial stakes in continuing to have their fall sports programs have decided it's not in the athletes' best interest to play.\"\n\nBut even the Division III decision is an example of how the N.C.A.A., even in a moment of crisis, can be hindered by process.\n\nThe division's management council (mostly administrators), which advises its governing board (mostly school presidents), voted nearly unanimously to cancel fall sports championships when they met on July 21. It took more than two weeks for the governing board to act on it.\n\nIn that time, Heather Benning, the commissioner of the Midwest Conference and the chairwoman of the Division III management council, said that when her board made its recommendation, 20 of the 43 conferences had already canceled some sports. By Wednesday, she said 42 of the 43 had done so.\n\n\"The health and safety piece doesn't change,\" she said when asked why Division II and III have canceled fall championships while Division I has not. \"Because Division I hasn't publicly announced a decision, I don't think it means they're looking at different standards. A lot of it comes down to resources. For Division III, a big factor for us has been access to testing.\"\n\nThe lack of authoritative guidance from the N.C.A.A. echoes what has happened around the country: The federal government has largely left state and local governments to interpret health recommendations as they see fit.\n\nThe N.C.A.A. has given no standards for how to respond based on transmission rates, so a school like Northwestern shut down workouts after a lone positive test (which it later said was false) and Clemson has continued despite having at least 37 players test positive -- including defensive end Xavier Thomas, who will redshirt while recovering from Covid-19 and strep throat.\n\n\"We haven't defined and stuck by what we mean by low levels of transmission,\" said Newman, the infectious disease doctor. \"Because we don't have an objective number -- if we hit this number, we feel OK; if not, we don't feel OK -- we're stuck in this qualitative world of low, medium and high. It's very difficult to make decisions that way.\"\n\nAt Connecticut, the number of cases was moot. It just became apparent that keeping them low was too onerous.\n\nStill, Katsouleas, the university's president, was loath to suggest that other schools follow his lead, saying he appreciated the autonomy to put in effect a rigorous protocol for reopening that will allow students and faculty to largely decide whether they will attend in-person or remotely.\n\nEdsall, too, said the decision was merely right for UConn.\n\nBut he did explain why he was so adamant that it was the right decision, his voice catching with emotion when he said he would be making the same decision if he were at a Power 5 school: \"These young men's lives are more important than money.\"\n\nHe recalled from his first tour as the school's coach, when one of his players -- Jasper Howard -- was stabbed to death in a fight after a game in 2009. Edsall identified Howard's body at the hospital and notified his family.\n\n\"Some of those things stick with you,\" Edsall said.\n\nHe added: \"Knowing these young kids -- you're their teachers, you're their coaches, you're their mentors. You become the parent away from home and the No. 1 thing is you have to make decisions that keep their health and safety and welfare at the highest level because of the commitment that you have to them and their parents.\"\n\nToo often, though, that pledge -- which seems to be included in every school, conference and N.C.A.A. statement -- comes with a caveat.",

In past years it has drawn some 100,000 people, of a wide variety of ages, over its three days.\n\nThe event is a major source of income for the Communist Party, which has 10 seats in Portugal's 230-seat parliament.\n\nThe General Directorate for Health announced Monday that 16,563 people can be inside the festival at any one time, even though \"there is a real risk that, during the event, infected people with or without symptoms may be moving around.\" The Communist Party had wanted to sell 33,000 tickets per day this year.\n\nAuthorities say people at the festival must remain at least two meters apart, unless they share a household; concerts can take place only with distanced seating for the audience; no alcohol can be sold after 8 p.m.; and everyone over age 10 must wear a mask, among other measures.\n\nHealth Minister Marta Temido that \"the rules are well though-out.\"\n\n\"We hope the organizers are able to implement them and ensure people abide by them,\" she told a news conference.\n\nThe calculation of how many people can be at the festival was based on criteria used for how many can be on beaches, officials said.",

Court documents state the man's meals were sent to his room three times a day, he was not able to see his family or friends, and had to clean his room himself.\n\nAfter the lower court's ruling, prosecutors asked the Constitutional Court for clarification of the legal framework.\n\nSince the lower court's ruling in mid-May, those travelling to the Azores must now either take a COVID-19 test before their trip or on arrival if they wish to be admitted.\n\nVasco Cordeiro, president of Azores' regional government, told reporters authorities had complied with both court decisions, but it had become apparent that the legal framework was not sufficient for dealing with the completely unexpected situation of the pandemic.\n\n(Reporting by Catarina Demony and Patricia Vicente Rua, Additional reporting by Victoria Waldersee, Editing by Andrei Khalip and Alexandra Hudson)",

        "body": "A journalist turned politician, he was India's president from 2012 to 2017 and wore many hats during a career that spanned political generations.\n\nPranab Mukherjee, an Indian politician who rose to high office alongside one of India's longest-serving prime ministers, Indira Gandhi, has died. He was 84.\n\nHis death was confirmed on Monday by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Twitter.\n\nBefore undergoing brain surgery in recent weeks, he announced on Twitter that he had also tested positive for the coronavirus. He was later put on a ventilator and slipped into a coma, according to doctors who were treating him at a military hospital.\n\nThough Mr. Mukherjee never became prime minister, the top post in India's government, his ability to build consensus on contentious issues earned him the title of the indispensable man of India's coalition-era politics. And he played a major role in the government of Mrs. Gandhi and the political career of her daughter-in-law, Sonia Gandhi.\n\nIn 2012, Sonia Gandhi, the head of the Indian National Congress party, cleared the way for Mr. Mukherjee to become president, a largely ceremonial job, while passing him over for the chance to be prime minister.\n\nThe party's history of refusing to let anyone other than a member of the Gandhi family be its face has been at the core of bitter infighting in the past few months.\n\nMany Indians see the Congress party as a protector of the nation's founding secular values, a feeling that has become more prominent since the rise of Mr. Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party. But the party remains tied to the Gandhis, who are often perceived as a symbol of India's Anglicized upper class.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-31T13:06:59.687Z The U.S. has more than 6 million cases as President Trump retweets fringe theories on the virus. With testing disrupted, storm-hit Louisiana watches other measures of the virus and sees trouble. India now has the third-highest death toll from the virus. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nMr. Mukherjee, who was born on Dec. 11, 1935, in the small village of Mirati in India's West Bengal state, fit right in. He was a college teacher and a journalist, and his father, Kamada Kinkar Mukherjee, was a Congress leader himself. His mother, who went by the single name Rajlakshmi, was also involved in politics.\n\nMr. Mukherjee quickly rose through the ranks to become one of the closest lieutenants of Indira Gandhi. He was criticized for being a loyal supporter of Mrs. Gandhi and playing his own small part in her government's decision to send dozens of political dissidents to prison.\n\nDecades later, Mr. Mukherjee wrote in his memoir about those tumultuous years, acknowledging that he did not understand \"its deep and far-reaching impact\" as a junior minister then and that the party ultimately paid \"a heavy price\" for it.\n\nIn 1980, Mrs. Gandhi picked Mr. Mukherjee as her finance minister. That would define his long political career, cementing his position as an important party leader for decades to come.\n\nAfter Mrs. Gandhi was assassinated in 1984, he viewed himself as her rightful successor. Mrs. Gandhi, however, had chosen her son Rajiv Gandhi to become the next prime minister.\n\nAfter being sidelined by Mr. Gandhi, Mr. Mukherjee left to form his own party, the Rashtriya Samajwadi Congress. But in 1989 he folded it into the Congress party after it failed to garner much support in his home state of West Bengal.\n\nThe party welcomed him back and in the next few years, Mr. Mukherjee became the chief architect who piloted Sonia Gandhi's ascent to power. From then on, he held several cabinet posts, from foreign affairs and defense to finance, and he served on numerous key committees. He was called upon routinely to break political logjams or defuse controversies.\n\nUnder the Constitution, the president holds some meaningful powers, including the right to grant clemency to prisoners. During his five-year term, from 2012 to 2017, Mr. Mukherjee rejected 42 mercy pleas from prisoners on death row, out of a total of 49.\n\nIn 2019, he was awarded India's highest civilian honor, the Bharat Ratna, for his public service over five decades.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIn his final address as president, Mr. Mukherjee said that he had received \"much more\" from the country than he had given and that its foundations as a pluralistic society was what made it the world's largest democracy. \"The soul of India resides in pluralism and tolerance,\" he said.\n\nHe is survived by his daughter, Sharmistha, and two sons, Abhijit and Indrajit.\n\nAfter stepping down as president, Mr. Mukherjee continued to play an active role in public life, often delivering speeches where he liberally quoted Mohandas Gandhi.\n\n\"I have no hesitation in stating that the ideas of truth, openness, dialogue and nonviolence espoused by Gandhiji provide the best way forward for a world confronted with intolerance, bigotry, terrorism and xenophobic politics,\" he said in a lecture in 2019.\n\nIn one of his last speeches, in December 2019, he spoke about the importance of press freedom. \"Democracy without a free press is like a blank piece of paper,\" he said.\n\n\"We ought to remember that democracy will be the loser when and if we cease to hear voices other than our own.\"",

        "body": "Determined to proceed with parties and events this summer, hosts are adding screenings at the door. But such measures are hardly a guarantee of safety, medical experts warn.\n\nDr. Asma Rashid, who runs a members-only medical concierge service in the Hamptons, has received some of the most sought-after party invitations this summer.\n\n\"We've gone to these private, private, private events, where they have me sign a 'nothing you see in this house can be leaked' document,\" she said. \"This is still a party town.\"\n\nDr. Rashid is there to administer rapid or real-time tests for coronavirus. She performs the procedure -- either a finger prick or a nose swab -- in the car, and then lets guests into the house only if their tests come back negative. The entire procedure takes less than 30 minutes. Consider it a pandemic pregame.\n\nSuffolk County still lacks rapid testing infrastructure, and the private service is expensive: up to $500 per test, and not all insurance companies will cover the cost. Most doctors don't even have kits to do the tests; patients willing to pay can wait up to a week for an appointment at the offices that have them in New York City.\n\nFor that reason many clients book Dr. Rashid in advance when they anticipate hosting guests for a sleepover, a barbecue or a wedding. But some summon her at 2 a.m. for a last-minute test or stop by her office in a panic after attending a crowded gathering.\n\n\"Every time there is an event, a protest or Fourth of July celebration, there is higher demand,\" she said. A busy day came after a drive-in \"Safe & Sound\" concert, where the chief executive of Goldman Sachs performed, at the end of July. Concertgoers, who paid $1,250 per car to attend, were supposed to stay in their cars, but social media showed crowds dancing by the stage. \"I can't even tell you how many requests we got after that,\" Dr. Rashid said.\n\nThe event is currently under investigation.\n\nDr. Rashid has tripled her staff to keep up with demand for coronavirus testing this summer. The last Saturday in July she even opened a new office in Bridgehampton. \"The way I would describe our growth is exponential,\" she said.\n\nNo House Parties Before Grandma\n\nWhile most of the country waits seven to 14 days for coronavirus test results, a privileged few have access to rapid tests. There are a few types -- some detect antibodies, others antigens or viral genetic material -- but they all provide an answer in under 30 minutes.\n\nHosts are hiring doctors to screen guests before they attend their gatherings, or children coming in from out of town for sleepovers. Other people are getting tests to provide peace of mind after a particularly wild night. Event companies are offering rapid testing as a service to clients alongside catering and music. Instagram influencers are even touting the service.\n\nStill, these rapid tests aren't totally reliable, said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, New York City's deputy commissioner of disease control. \"Negatives are not definitive,\" he said. (And there certainly have been false positives.)\n\n\"No test is 100 percent,\" Dr. Rashid said. \"A negative test does not preclude one to not be carrying the virus.\"\n\nIndeed, one reason rapid tests aren't in widespread use is that they require additional testing to confirm. \"We have to retest all of our negatives, so you're doing two tests for everyone who is negative,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"It's a resource issue.\"\n\nHe also warned that the virus can take some time to show up in a test result; though some test positive 48 hours after exposure, the two-week possible incubation period that has dictated quarantine is generally accepted. So if you were exposed to the virus even 10 days before your test, the outcome is still uncertain. \"You can't go to a house party the week before you see Grandma,\" Dr. Daskalakis said. \"That test doesn't matter.\"\n\nRyan Choura, the founder of Choura, an event and experience production company in Torrance, Calif., that arranges the tenting and furniture for the U.S. Open golf tournament and the BeachLife Festival, believes so strongly that all events should incorporate rapid testing that he created an arm of his company to do it.\n\n\"There is no question that you now have to have rapid testing as a component to every event no matter what,\" Mr. Choura said.\n\nIt's not an easy feat to pull off. \"Temperature is a major issue. You have to keep tests under 80 degrees,\" he said. \"You need to put up some kind of tent, like a catering tent.\" He added, \"We have a 100-point checklist for anything we want to build.\"\n\nStill, on July 23, the company staged its first event for 90 attendees (and 30 vendors) using the Rapid Quidel Corporation Sofia SARS Antigen Test. The good news: Not a single vendor or attendee tested positive. The bad news: It was a bit of a buzz kill.\n\nJoie Shettler, 51, a singer and co-owner of Rebel Music Entertainment who lives in Redondo Beach, Calif., attended the event, which included bottled cocktails and panels on the future of the events industry, after learning about it on Facebook. She ended up having fun, but the beginning felt clinical.\n\n\"We had to fill out a form beforehand, so that they would be ready for us when we arrived. We also had to book a time frame of when to arrive,\" Ms. Shettler said. \"We had instructions to drive up in our cars, where we would be tested. From there we were instructed to stay in our car, and they would text us our results within 20 minutes.\"\n\n\"I was a little worried while waiting for the results,\" she added. \"Both Alysha, my friend, and I were squealing when the results came in. We were both negative! And we were excited to finally enter the event.\"\n\nMr. Choura said he is planning a 1,000-person live music event, \"most likely in another state,\" for which every person will be rapid-tested in the next 30 to 60 days. He is still figuring out the details, but promises it won't be a drive-in. \"Right now people are bragging about doing live music, and people are sitting in their cars,\" he said. \"I don't want to sit in my car and listen to live music. And by the way, just because you are sitting in your car doesn't mean it's safe.\"\n\nHumblebragging, Hugging and Hashtagging\n\nOne of the easier places to get a rapid coronavirus test is the Surf Lodge, a hotel and restaurant in Montauk, N.Y., known for hosting and entertaining celebrities including John Legend and Bon Jovi.\n\nJayma Cardoso, one of the hotel's owners, pays Dr. Seth Gordon, her son's pediatrician, to test all of her employees weekly. \"He has his own Sofia 2 machine by Quidel so he can do the test\" -- an antigen test -- \"and get the results very quickly, in 15 minutes,\" she said.\n\nOnce a week, the doctor sets up a testing site on the sand-filled deck overlooking Fort Pond. Raya O'Neal, 24, the hotel's director of communications, who lives in East Hampton, says while she hates the test, which takes about 10 seconds, she understands it's an exclusive perk. \"I have some friends and family members who think I'm too fancy for them now,\" she said.\n\nMs. O'Neal feels safer living with her parents knowing she regularly tests negative for the virus. But it also emboldens her socially. \"I don't feel as worried as I do about eating or going to public places,\" she said. \"Once I saw my closest friends after not seeing them for months, and I did the humblebrag about being tested weekly and being negative, and I just had to hug them.\"\n\nBut as any public-health expert will tell you, individual test results are not an all-access pass to Life as It Was Before. \"There is a false confidence you get when you use a test for social decisions,\" Dr. Daskalakis said. \"This is one of those things I lose sleep over.\"\n\nNonetheless. receiving rapid testing for the virus has become a mark of status and, ergo, a trending topic on social media.\n\nTasha Todd, 40, is a medical assistant in Dallas. When her former office, a concierge medical group, first received the rapid testing kit, she posted about it on Instagram, where she has nearly 28,000 followers, to hype up the service. \"I wanted to try to bring more business into the company,\" Ms. Todd said. \"Not that we could have handled much more volume. We were seeing 30 people a day, 25 of which were in for Covid testing.\"\n\n\"I got a lot of feedback,\" she said. \"A lot of people were messaging about the prices, where the office was, what the difference was between that and a regular test, and how quickly the results come in.\" Her office charges $150 for a test, but she knows of other clinics in Dallas that charge $500 or more.\n\nMs. Todd said she felt frustrated that many of her followers wouldn't be able to afford one. \"I would say rapid testing right now is for the rich. It's too expensive,\" she said. \"Who has 150 to 500 dollars just lying around in the middle of the recession?\"\n\nTemperature Checks and Colored Leis\n\nSome bars and restaurants have tried offering rapid testing to their customers, an act that brings in publicity. This practice can backfire, however.\n\nFor its reopening weekend at the end of June, Ravel Hotel in the Long Island City neighborhood of New York worked with an outside doctor to give all arrivals a test before enter (charging $35 for those with insurance and $50 for those without.) Photos emerged on social media and then in Gothamist of people who had all tested negative, partying and mingling closely without masks, producing the inevitable tsks.\n\nNicole Milazzo, a spokeswoman for the hotel, said that it is no longer testing guests, after concerns expressed by the mayor's office of nightlife about \"creating a false sense of security,\" but is \"continuing to follow all rules and regulations put forward by the C.D.C. and New York City,\" including distancing tables and cabanas by more than six feet, and providing masks and sanitizer.\n\nOther gatekeepers, unable to get their hands on rapid testing to begin with, or unwilling to shoulder the cost, have implemented alternate screening methods.\n\nThuyen Nguyen, a facialist who has worked with celebrities including the actress Michelle Williams, is reopening his salon in East Hampton later this summer. Every person who walks in will get body-scanned by an Antlia System, which checks for a temperature in under a second. A little box positioned at reception does all the screening without touching the person. (Such screens have been criticized by medical experts because infections can occur without symptoms, including fevers, and people's baseline temperatures vary.)\n\nReports on social media have also surfaced of colored bracelets or leis to moderate contact at weddings, like the spotlight parties from college where you wore green if you were single, red if you were taken, and yellow if you weren't sure. Now the idea is green if you are OK with hugs and high fives, yellow if you are fine with talking but not touching, and red if you are totally keeping your distance from everybody. (\"Scares me to my core,\" tweeted one bride-to-be, of the illusory confidence such accessories might impart.)\n\nAs private citizens improvise at their peril, local governments continue to try and make rapid testing more accessible. New York City's Department of Health, for example, put a pop-up site in the Bronx and now Brooklyn's Sunset Park neighborhood, where Mayor Bill de Blasio recently warned of an uptick in coronavirus cases. The idea is to identify as many positives early on so the city can help offer isolation guidance.\n\n\"There is the ability of the folks who have and the folks who don't,\" said Dr. Daskalakis. \"We are very consciously pushing the rapid test in environments where people aren't resource-rich.\" The city plans to bring the technology to nine clinics that previously focused on sexual health, transforming then into coronavirus testing sites.\n\nEven New Yorkers from more affluent neighborhoods are flocking to these free testing sites to get quick results.\n\nThe first weekend in August Mary Ann Mackey, 31, who lives in Park Slope and works for the Manhattan Borough President's Office, went to Brooklyn on a Sunday afternoon to get a rapid test before visiting her parents for the first time since the pandemic started.\n\nMs. Mackey arrived at 12:30 and was there all afternoon. She was surprised by the line. \"By the time I had been through the line it had been three hours, and the whole block was still full of people,\" she said. \"Everyone was remarkably patient and calm. People had books and magazines out. Some people were chatting. I overheard a few people talk about how they had waited in a long time elsewhere and were excited to get it over with and know their results.\"\n\nThis experience felt like a luxury. \"This feels like a weird thing to say, but it was kind of a cool experience,\" Ms. Mackey said. \"It felt kind of like a privilege to have results.\"",

        "body": "On a humid Saturday night, under a segment of the Kosciuszko Bridge, which connects Brooklyn and Queens, hundreds of people at an illicit gathering danced and swayed to the thumps of hip hop and electronic music. Some wore masks. Many did not.\n\nMany were attending their first party in months, since the pandemic had forced many venues to close.\n\n\"People were just enjoying themselves,\" said one of the attendees, Jimmy Escobar, 30, of Brooklyn. \"People got locked up for so long, and they finally got to go out.\"\n\nNew Yorkers, by and large, have adhered to rules mandating social distancing and mask wearing. The diligence has helped keep the coronavirus under control in the city even as outbreaks have raged across the country, primarily in the South and the West.\n\nAs the summer wears on, however, mounting reports of parties, concerts and other social events, like the rave attended by Mr. Escobar, are raising fears that New York's hard-earned stability may be tenuous.\n\nOver the last few weeks, videos and photos posted on social media -- at bars, at beaches, at warehouses, at pools, at hotels -- show densely packed, mask-free crowds, similar to the Memorial Day weekend gatherings at Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri and in states like California and Florida that are now reeling from virus outbreaks.\n\nThe images contrast sharply with the memories of a brutal spring in New York that left tens of thousands dead, disproportionately ravaging low-income communities and neighborhoods with high numbers of Black and Latino people.\n\n\"It's disrespectful,\" Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said at a recent news conference about the partying. \"It's illegal. It not only violates public health, but it violates human decency.\"\n\nMany of the images show how a segment of the nightlife industry, a crucial piece of New York City's culture, is desperately trying to revive itself after having been shut down when the pandemic hit.\n\nBut other events, which charge for tickets, drinks or other amenities, perhaps illustrate how some people are looking to capitalize on the public's restlessness.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-08T07:02:16.850Z As the U.S. relief talks falter again, Trump says he is prepared to act on his own. Cuomo says N.Y. schools can reopen in-person but leaves it up to districts to determine if, when and how. Thousands of cases went unreported in California when a computer server failed. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nOsvaldo Chance Jimenez, 44, who has helped organize underground parties in New York City in the past, said the growing number of events risked seeding future outbreaks, which would likely disproportionately affect communities of color, particularly in Brooklyn and Queens where many of the gatherings are taking place.\n\nMr. Jimenez has used his Instagram account, @hilovenewyork, to draw attention to what he sees as reckless behavior. He pointed to yacht parties where organizers are selling tickets for up to $100, and a requirement at a day club at the Ravel Hotel in Long Island City, Queens, that guests pay between $35 and $50 to take a rapid coronavirus test on site, as examples of what he called \"vulture capitalism.\"\n\n\"It is the arrogance of money,\" he said. \"These people do not care.\"\n\nLauren Flax, a D.J., producer and artist based in Brooklyn, said people should not be partying yet. Ms. Flax has lost work and is living off unemployment checks and other government assistance. But she said that even thinking about holding a dance party would be irresponsible before there was a better understanding of the virus and better testing technology.\n\n\"I don't think any of us should be thinking about our career right now,\" she said.\n\nAsked this week about the rave under the Kosciuszko Bridge, and an illegal boat party with more than 170 guests that was held over the weekend, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the authorities had moved quickly to address a few cases of wrongdoing and that most people were following the rules.\n\n\"But where we see something wrong, we got to go in and stop it immediately,\" the mayor said.\n\nThe New York City Sheriff's Office, one of the city agencies tasked with enforcing the social distancing rules during the pandemic, has responded to several reports of illegal parties since the pandemic began, including the boat party, Sheriff Joseph Fucito said.\n\nHe said the office was trying to take a more proactive approach to stop the parties before they take place.\n\nDr. Jay Varma, Mr. de Blasio's senior adviser for public health, said the city had not \"seen any large clusters specifically associated with any of these events.\" But about 15 percent of people who test positive in the city, and are interviewed by contact tracers, reported being at some sort of gathering outside of their home, city officials said.\n\nCity data indicates that while the parties and other gatherings are on the rise, the outbreak does not appear to be worsening. The number of new hospitalizations in a day has not reached 50 in weeks -- in March and April, it was routinely higher than 1,000 per day, according to city data.\n\nAn uptick in cases also did not materialize after thousands of protesters, many of them wearing masks, gathered for weeks during Black Lives Matter demonstrations across the city.\n\nBut the fear, Mr. Jimenez and others say, is that younger people who get infected while attending a party, and who may be less likely to be severely affected by the virus, will spread it to more vulnerable people.\n\n\"Things are only going to get worse,\" he said. \"I feel for my city. I pray that I'm wrong.\"\n\nAndrew Rigie, the executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, said the parties should not come as a surprise.\n\n\"People will socialize in nightlife spaces, whether you like it or not,\" Mr. Rigie said. \"You could have unsafe, unregulated nightlife. Or you can do everything you can to have safe, regulated nightlife. But we can't act as if it's not going to exist.\"\n\nMr. Rigie said that local, state and federal governments should be providing financial assistance, like rent support, to these businesses and others affected by the nightlife shutdown, and that there should be better guidance and research on how to operate safely.\n\nSome businesses, like the Ravel Hotel, have tried to figure that out themselves, with mixed results. The hotel's day club, Profundo, which has an outdoor rooftop pool, re-opened in late June at 50 percent capacity and required guests to be tested for the virus on site.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nThe rapid tests used by the hotel were made by Abbott Laboratories, according to Gothamist. The tests, authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use, were designed to provide results within minutes.\n\nBut the F.D.A. had said in May that the tests might be delivering false negative results, raising questions about safety at Profundo.\n\nThen, on July 4, videos and photos posted on social media showed several poolside guests at the hotel not wearing masks, and standing and dancing close together. In a statement, the hotel acknowledged that those guests were \"not following directions,\" but said that it had \"retrained security and staff on how to handle these situations moving forward\" with the help of the city.\n\nAn F.D.A. spokeswoman said this week that the agency had since worked with Abbott to improve the test. A spokeswoman for the hotel said this week that the tests were no longer being administered, but would not answer questions about why.\n\nSeth Levine, an owner of the Ravel Hotel, said in a separate statement that the site also provides guests with hand sanitizer, masks and printed rules about social distancing. A security team makes sure guests wear masks when moving around the property, he said.\n\nSome guests said they believed that the tests and other measures had adequately lowered the risk of infection or transmission. Joey Sutera, who works in marketing, said he went to the rooftop pool on July 4 with 30 friends.\n\n\"We look at New York and there's zero deaths,\" he said, referencing a day last month in which the city did not initially report any coronavirus-related fatalities. \"And it's like, New York has it under control. So, is the reward greater than the risk when we're young and been locked up for so long in solitary confinement? I think people are willing to take that risk.\"\n\nA D.J. performed at Profundo on Monday, and the venue was beckoning guests to gather there this weekend. One of its posts on Instagram offered a free bottle of ros\u00e9 to some guests who missed celebrating their birthday because of the pandemic. A poolside table was listed at $500 on the hotel's website.\n\nMr. Escobar, who attended the party under the bridge, said he was not worried about contracting or transmitting the virus. He did not have symptoms, he said, and a sign at the party told people to wear a face covering. He saw people handing out hand sanitizer and masks.\n\n\"If people want to go out and enjoy themselves, regardless of risk, let them do it,\" he said.\n\nBut Kristina Alaniesse, 36, who has worked as an event promoter and now posts images on Instagram of reckless behavior at parties, said the danger was not only for the partygoers, but the people they interact with later.\n\n\"It's not a time to celebrate,\" she said. \"We're not out of the woods.\"",

        "body": "To keep tourism afloat during the pandemic, some countries formed travel alliances with their neighbors. At summer's end, the experiment has had mixed results.\n\nOne of the strategies for keeping international travel afloat during the pandemic was the creation of \"travel bubbles\": alliances between neighboring nations with low infection rates that would allow travelers from those countries to freely visit.\n\nBut as the summer draws to a close and infections continue to pop up, it appears that, in many places, the travel bubble has burst.\n\nThere was a lot riding on the alliances. The pause on international tourism doesn't just spoil family vacations; it affects the global economy in profound ways, too. The World Travel and Tourism Council estimates that about one in 10 jobs are related to tourism and travel. For popular destinations like Greece, where the tourism sector is responsible for about 40 percent of jobs, the effect is even more significant.\n\nWhere have the bubbles burst?\n\nIn May, New Zealand and Australia garnered attention when they announced a plan to create one of the first travel partnerships during the pandemic. The \"Trans-Tasman bubble\" would allow citizens of each country to travel to the other without a quarantine or a test. The hope was to enact it by early September, but in early August, a coronavirus outbreak in the Australian state of Victoria put those plans on hold.\n\nFor a while, Europe seemed to represent the best hope for getting tourism going, and it began with the bubble concept. On May 15, the Baltic States of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania created the first travel bubble in Europe; later that month, Hungary and Slovenia agreed that their citizens could continue to travel between the two countries.\n\nSoon, much of Europe became a giant bubble. The European Commission created \"Re-open EU,\" a site listing travel rules within European countries. Each member country began easing restrictions at its own pace. Italy and Germany for example, opened quickly to travelers arriving from inside the European Union or the border-free Schengen zone. Britain also began opening up to its neighbors.\n\nThe welcome mat wasn't rolled out long, though. Flare-ups of the virus caused borders to shut on short notice, disrupting travelers' plans. In late July, Britain abruptly announced that travelers returning from Spain would have to self-quarantine for 14 days, just a few weeks after it had opened restriction-free travel to the country. In mid-August, British vacationers in France had to either rush home to beat newly announced restrictions, or face two weeks of quarantine when they returned.\n\nAsia, too, has had its burst travel bubbles. Thailand had hoped to invite travelers from nearby countries with low virus rates, such as Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea, to visit without requiring self-quarantines on arrival. New waves of the virus canceled those plans.\n\nWhile some countries jointly announced agreed-upon travel bubbles with neighbors, others created de facto ones by publishing lists of which nearby countries' residents were allowed in and under what circumstances.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T09:04:43.454Z The White House announces a major virus test-kit deal, just days after the C.D.C. moved to discourage testing. Trump promises a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, and boasts of his pandemic response. Hurricane Laura and the virus collide in Louisiana and Texas. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nIn the United States, which accounts for about 25 percent of the world's cases, some states like New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have created their own de facto bubbles, stipulating that travelers coming from a long list of states with a seven-day rolling average of positive tests greater than 10 percent, or number of positive cases over 10 per 100,000 residents, self-isolate on arrival for 14 days.\n\nFrom bubble to corridor\n\nThe idea of bubbles created between neighboring countries has given way in recent months to \"travel corridors\" and safe lists, sets of countries and territories around the world whose residents, depending on their destinations, don't have to self-isolate, unless they are showing symptoms of the virus or have recently been exposed. These travel regulations are posted on government websites, such as Re-Open EU and the Centers for Disease Control website, and change as new information is received.\n\nFor example, as of Aug. 21 at midnight, travelers arriving in Norway from newly named \"red\" status places, including Austria, Greece, Ireland and Britain, were required to go into quarantine. Britain's website, which lists more than 60 countries and territories from which travelers can visit without self-isolating, removed Croatia and Austria from that list last week and added Portugal. Belgium's foreign affairs website updates the list of restrictions for travelers from various countries each day at 4 p.m.\n\nThe sites also list countries' virus-testing requirements for travelers. Some nations recommend arriving with evidence of a negative result and offer tests at the airport or 14-day self-quarantines as an alternative. Others, like the United States, which recently dropped its advice that newly arrived travelers quarantine for two weeks, don't require testing to enter the country.\n\nRather than prohibit all travelers from higher risk countries, Greece recently began requiring that people entering from a specified list of locations arrive with a negative test result for Covid-19, performed within three days of their entry.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nThe risk is high both for travelers and the countries they are visiting, said Dr. Brad Connor, the New York City site director for the GeoSentinel emerging infectious disease surveillance network of the C.D.C. and a longtime travel medicine and infectious disease specialist.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nAsymptomatic and pre-symptomatic travelers carrying the virus can inadvertently bring it into an area undetected and cause an outbreak for which there is no vaccine and no reliable treatment, Dr. Connor said. \"We all want to travel again in a safe way,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, the approaches so far have not worked.\"\n\nRegional approaches\n\nInfection waves can be local and some countries' restrictions get down to regional specifications. Belgium's list recommends testing and quarantine for travelers arriving from certain areas within other European Union countries, like the southwest regions of Bulgaria. Norway declared that the region of Norrbotten in Sweden, which has fewer Covid cases than most other areas in the country, will be changed on its list from \"red\" to \"yellow,\" and anyone entering Norway from there will not be required to go into quarantine.\n\nCordoning off an area of the country for international tourists is the latest idea aimed at preserving a portion of this year's tourism revenues. Thailand is considering a new program where international travelers who are willing to stay for 30 days are allowed into Phuket, where they will quarantine in specified resorts and undergo two Covid-19 tests.\n\nThe island of Anguilla in the Caribbean, which said it had no current virus cases, recently announced it would begin welcoming travelers who must apply to visit, giving preference to those from countries with lower infection rates and those who plan an extended stay. Travelers must arrive with evidence of a recent test showing they do not carry the virus. They will also need to quarantine for 10 to 14 days when they arrive, undergo two more virus tests and pay a fee for these services. The web portal states that \"Anguilla is open for approved visitors from certain countries.\"\n\nWhat's next?\n\nMost countries now realize that they can't plan too far in advance. The government website of Norway advises citizens that it \"is not possible for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to say when the travel advice for countries outside Europe will be changed.\"\n\nTravelers can continue to minimize risk to themselves and others with masks, hand-washing and social distancing -- \"but at this point we can't completely eliminate the risk,\" Dr. Connor said. \"And therein lies the problem.\"\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

        "body": "Parents who get shingles can experience debilitating symptoms and pass the chickenpox virus to their children. So why can't they access the vaccine?\n\nThe death of a 30-year-old Texas man made headlines in July when he got infected with the coronavirus after attending a \"Covid-19 party.\" According to the chief medical officer at Methodist Hospital in San Antonio, the man said he attended a gathering with an infected person to test whether the coronavirus was real and to gain immunity from it.\n\nThis isn't the first time Americans have signed up for intentional virus exposure in the hopes of achieving immunity. Before the chickenpox vaccine became available in 1995, many parents hosted \"chickenpox parties\" with similar infection and immunity goals for their children.\n\nBut at the time, parents may not have known that the same virus that causes chickenpox can re-emerge later in life as shingles -- or herpes zoster. In addition to acute pain, fever and fatigue, more severe complications of shingles can include pneumonia, brain swelling (encephalitis), facial paralysis, hearing problems, permanent nerve damage or vision damage if the rash appears near the eye. Shingles can also reoccur.\n\nI was 35 in the spring of 2019 when I noticed a shingles rash developing on my neck. The fiery pain soon became impossible to ignore, spreading across my shoulders and arms and into my fingertips. My doctor gave me an eight-day dose of antivirals and oxycodone for pain.\n\nThe chickenpox vaccine wasn't available when I was a kid, so I asked whether a different vaccine could have prevented me from getting shingles in the first place. My doctor said yes, but that the vaccine for shingles, called Shingrix, was only approved by the Food and Drug Administration for adults over 50. Meanwhile, my son -- who at the time had received one dose of the chickenpox vaccine but was too young to receive his 4-year-old booster shot -- was at risk for developing chickenpox because he touched my shingles rash.\n\nAs I recovered from a monthlong battle with shingles, I began to research how the virus that causes it can affect adults. The more I learned, the more questions I had. Chickenpox and shingles vaccines are both highly effective, so why is the latter only available to older adults? How many young adults get shingles in the first place, and does the F.D.A. age recommendation for the Shingrix vaccine prevent them from getting it? And most importantly, do parents realize that unvaccinated kids -- either because they are too young or by parental choice -- might be at risk for chickenpox if they're exposed to a shingles rash?\n\nI spoke with experts to find some answers as well as some best practices.\n\nVaccinate your child early\n\nAccording to a global survey of about 8,700 adults, only three percent reported knowing that the virus that causes chickenpox can also cause shingles.\n\nChickenpox -- which typically causes a rash that turns into itchy, fluid-filled blisters and later fever, fatigue, headache and loss of appetite -- typically resolves for most children within a week. But rarely and in high risk groups, it can lead to serious complications such as streptococcal infections, encephalitis, meningitis, stroke and death.\n\nBefore the vaccine, about four million people contracted the virus each year in the U.S.; more than 10,500 of those were hospitalized, and about 100 to 150 died.\n\nAll 50 states and the District of Columbia required children to receive two doses of the chickenpox vaccine before starting school; the first dose given around 12 months old, and the second between ages 4 and 6. That said, some parents may opt to vaccinate their children earlier, especially if a parent is experiencing a shingles episode.\n\n\"If the child has no immunization and is healthy, get their first shot right away,\" said Dr. Anne Gershon, M.D., a pediatric infectious disease specialist and researcher at Columbia University's Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons. There is also no need to wait until age 4 for a booster dose. \"Give them the second shot early,\" she said. \"You could give it at 18 months.\"\n\nDr. Gershon led the U.S. clinical trials in the early 1970s that first tested the chickenpox vaccine on 575 children with underlying leukemia. Researchers braced for potential side effects, but there were none. \"After those data were published, people began to be interested in vaccinating healthy children,\" she said.\n\nConsider your risk factors for getting shingles\n\nMore than 95 percent of adults in the U.S. had chickenpox before age 18, and about one in three will develop shingles in their lifetime, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Unfortunately, shingles cases in the U.S. have more than quadrupled between 1945 and 2007, even in younger adults.\n\n\"It does seem to be continuing to increase in a linear kind of way, without accelerating or decelerating, just a steady increase over time,\" said Dr. Rafael Harpaz, M.D., a medical epidemiologist with the C.D.C.'s Division of Viral Diseases. The cause of the increase isn't clear, but Dr. Harpaz noted that shingles is more prevalent in older adults and estimated that cases will likely continue to increase 2.5 percent per year for all ages, especially if they have a chronic illness that leads to a weakened immune system or a family history of shingles.\n\nDr. Harpaz said that while adults under 50 are getting shingles at a higher rate than previously reported, studying and tracking it is challenging because those who have milder symptoms might mistake them as symptoms of another ailment. Younger patients may never seek a shingles diagnosis or treatment, or (as in my case) not realize they are exposing their own child to the virus that causes it.\n\nOne thing is certain: If you had chickenpox as a child, you can get shingles as an adult. If you're a parent and notice a painful rash, cover it with a bandage to prevent contact with your children and make an appointment with your doctor. Early treatment, Dr. Harpaz said, can lessen the side effects and the degree of contagiousness.\n\nConsider the \"off label\" option\n\nAs with the 5 to 20 percent of people in the U.S. with shingles, I still experience burning nerve pain in my neck where the rash first appeared. And, like millions of other parents, I'm struggling to live a normal life while physical distancing and teaching my son remotely. My son needs a healthy mom now more than ever. As coronavirus cases rise, I worry about how I would fare against the disease and shingles. I also worry that coming down with Covid-19 might lead to a re-emergence of shingles.\n\nThere are some, albeit limited, hints that my concerns may be warranted. One article published in May by researchers in Egypt detailed the cases of two patients who suffered shingles episodes shortly before developing Covid-19 symptoms. A separate case observed by doctors from the University of Massachusetts's Department of Emergency Medicine described a Covid-19 patient with coexisting shingles symptoms who developed meningitis-like symptoms, suggesting that these could be initial symptoms of Covid-19 in some patients that are \"not the classic respiratory symptoms and fever.\" But more work would be needed to confirm this.\n\nRequesting the Shingrix vaccine outside of the F.D.A.'s age recommendations is an option for adults, according to Dr. Kathleen Dooling, M.D., a medical officer and liason to the C.D.C. advisory panel, Herpes Zoster Work Group. \"It's reasonable to talk to your physician about it, and together you can discuss whether you would want to take the next step to get the vaccine,\" she said. \"It's what we would call 'off label.'\"\n\n2020 has been a medical no-man's land -- a surreal landscape that has forced our culture to evaluate the importance of personal safety and self-advocacy like never before. I have an appointment to receive the Shingrix vaccine in a few weeks, which is covered (to my surprise) by my medical insurance. Given my age, it's a choice the F.D.A. considers unnecessary. It's also a choice that prioritizes my family's health in an already uncertain future.\n\nSarah Szczypinski is a freelance journalist who writes about health, personal finance and parenting.",

        "body": "New research indicates that human immune system cells are storing information about the coronavirus so they can fight it off again.\n\nTo the immune system, not all germs are equally memorable. But our body's cells seem to be seriously studying up on the coronavirus.\n\nScientists who have been monitoring immune responses to the virus are now starting to see encouraging signs of strong, lasting immunity, even in people who developed only mild symptoms of Covid-19, a flurry of new studies suggests. Disease-fighting antibodies, as well as immune cells called B cells and T cells that are capable of recognizing the virus, appear to persist months after infections have resolved -- an encouraging echo of the body's enduring response to other viruses.\n\n\"Things are really working as they're supposed to,\" said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona and an author on one of the new studies, which has not yet been peer-reviewed.\n\nAlthough researchers cannot forecast how long these immune responses will last, many experts consider the data a welcome indication that the body's most studious cells are doing their job -- and will have a good chance of fending off the coronavirus, faster and more fervently than before, if exposed to it again.\n\n\"This is exactly what you would hope for,\" said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington and an author on another of the new studies, which is currently under review at the journal Nature. \"All the pieces are there to have a totally protective immune response.\"\n\nProtection against reinfection cannot be fully confirmed until there is proof that most people who encounter the virus a second time are actually able to keep it at bay, Dr. Pepper said. But the findings could help quell recent concerns over the virus's ability to dupe the immune system into amnesia, leaving people vulnerable to repeat bouts of disease.\n\nResearchers have yet to find unambiguous evidence that coronavirus reinfections are occurring, especially within the few months that the virus has been rippling through the human population. The prospect of immune memory \"helps to explain that,\" Dr. Pepper said.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-16T12:02:59.293Z A teachers' strike closes down a school district in Arizona that was set to begin classes on Monday. The F.D.A. gives emergency approval for a new spit test as U.S. testing stalls. South Korea warns of another outbreak tied to a church. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nIn discussions about immune responses to the coronavirus, much of the conversation has focused on antibodies -- Y-shaped proteins that can latch onto the surfaces of pathogens and block them from infecting cells. But antibodies represent just one wing of a complex and coordinated squadron of immune soldiers, each with their own unique modes of attack. Viruses that have already invaded cells, for instance, are cloaked from antibodies, but are still vulnerable to killer T cells, which force infected cells to self-destruct. Another set of T cells, nicknamed \"helpers,\" can coax B cells to mature into antibody-making machines.\n\n(Yet another sector of the immune system assails pathogens within minutes of their arrival, while sending out signals called cytokines to mobilize forces from elsewhere in the body. Some evidence suggests that severe cases of Covid-19 may stem from this early process going awry.)\n\nAntibodies also come with an expiration date: Because they are inanimate proteins and not living cells, they can't replenish themselves, and so disappear from the blood just weeks or months after they are produced. Hoards of antibodies appear shortly after a virus has breached the body's barriers, then wane as the threat dissipates. Most of the B cells that produce these early antibodies die off as well.\n\nBut even when not under siege, the body retains a battalion of longer-lived B cells that can churn out virus-fighting antibodies en masse, should they prove useful again. Some patrol the bloodstream, waiting to be triggered anew; others retreat into the bone marrow, generating small amounts of antibodies that are detectable years, sometimes decades, after an infection is over. Several studies, including those led by Dr. Bhattacharya and Dr. Pepper, have found antibodies capable of incapacitating the coronavirus lingering at low levels in the blood months after people have recovered from Covid-19.\n\n\"The antibodies decline, but they settle in what looks like a stable nadir,\" which is observable about three months after symptoms start, Dr. Bhattacharya said. \"The response looks perfectly durable.\"\n\nSeeing antibodies this long after infection is a strong indication that B cells are still chugging away in the bone marrow, Dr. Pepper said. She and her team were also able to pluck B cells that recognize the coronavirus from the blood of people who have recovered from mild cases of Covid-19 and grow them in the lab.\n\nMultiple studies, including one published on Friday in the journal Cell, have also managed to isolate coronavirus-attacking T cells from the blood of recovered individuals -- long after symptoms have disappeared. When provoked with bits of the coronavirus in the lab, these T cells pumped out virus-fighting signals, and cloned themselves into fresh armies ready to confront a familiar foe. Some reports have noted that analyses of T cells could give researchers a glimpse into the immune response to the coronavirus, even in patients whose antibody levels have declined to a point where they are difficult to detect.\n\n\"This is very promising,\" said Smita Iyer, an immunologist at the University of California, Davis, who is studying immune responses to the coronavirus in rhesus macaques but was not involved in the new studies. \"This calls for some optimism about herd immunity, and potentially a vaccine.\"\n\nNotably, several of the new studies are finding these powerful responses in people who did not develop severe cases of Covid-19, Dr. Iyer added. Some researchers have worried that infections that take a smaller toll on the body are less memorable to the immune system's studious cells, which may prefer to invest their resources in more serious assaults. In some cases, the body could even jettison the viruses so quickly that it fails to catalog them. \"This paper suggests this is not true,\" Dr. Iyer said. \"You can still get durable immunity without suffering the consequences of infection.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 12, 2020\n\nCan I travel within the United States?Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine for 14 days. Here's an ever-updating list of statewide restrictions. In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own \"pod.\" \"Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,\" the C.D.C. says. If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nWhat has been observed in people who fought off mild cases of Covid-19 might not hold true for hospitalized patients, whose bodies struggle to marshal a balanced immune response to the virus, or those who were infected but had no symptoms at all. Research groups around the world are continuing to study the entire range of responses. But \"the vast majority of the cases are these mild infections,\" said Jason Netland, an immunologist at the University of Washington and an author on the paper under review at Nature. \"If those people are going to be protected, that's still good.\"\n\nThis new spate of studies could also further assuage fears about how and when the pandemic will end. On Friday, updated guidance released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was misinterpreted by several news reports that suggested immunity against the coronavirus might last only a few months. Experts quickly responded, noting the dangers of propagating such statements and pointing to the wealth of evidence that people who previously had the virus are probably at least partly protected from reinfection for at least three months, if not much longer.\n\nConsidered with other recent reports, the new data reinforce the idea that, \"Yes, you do develop immunity to this virus, and good immunity to this virus,\" said Dr. Eun-Hyung Lee, an immunologist at Emory University who was not involved in the studies. \"That's the message we want to get out there.\"\n\nSome illnesses, like the flu, can plague populations repeatedly. But that is at least partly attributable to the high mutation rates of influenza viruses, which can quickly make the pathogens unrecognizable to the immune system. Coronaviruses, in contrast, tend to change their appearance less readily from year to year.\n\nStill, much remains unknown. Although these studies hint at the potential for protectiveness, they do not demonstrate protection in action, said Cheong-Hee Chang, an immunologist at the University of Michigan who was not involved in the new studies. \"It's hard to predict what's going to happen,\" Dr. Chang said. \"Humans are so heterogeneous. There are so many factors coming into play.\"\n\nResearch in animals could help fill a few gaps. Small studies have shown that one bout of the coronavirus seems to protect rhesus macaques from contracting it again.\n\nBut tracking long-term human responses will take time, Dr. Pepper said. Good immune memory, she added, requires molecules and cells to be abundant, effective and durable -- and scientists cannot yet say that all three conditions have been definitively met.\n\nAs people's bodies settle into their post-coronavirus state, \"we're just now hitting the point of relevance\" to take the long view on immunity, Dr. Bhattacharya said. Things may change a few months or years down the line. Or they may not.\n\n\"There's no shortcuts here,\" Dr. Bhattacharya said. \"We just have to follow it out.\"",

        "body": "Studies of patients with severe cases of Covid-19 show the immune system lacks its usual coordinated response.\n\nScientists are beginning to untangle one of the most complex biological mysteries of the coronavirus pandemic: Why do some people get severely sick, whereas others quickly recover?\n\nIn certain patients, according to a flurry of recent studies, the virus appears to make the immune system go haywire.\n\nUnable to marshal the right cells and molecules to fight off the invader, the bodies of the infected instead launch an entire arsenal of weapons -- a misguided barrage that can wreak havoc on healthy tissues, experts said.\n\n\"We are seeing some crazy things coming up at various stages of infection,\" said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who led one of the new studies.\n\nResearchers studying these unusual responses are finding patterns that distinguish patients on the path to recovery from those who fare far worse. Insights gleaned from the data might help tailor treatments to individuals, easing symptoms or perhaps even vanquishing the virus before it has a chance to push the immune system too far.\n\n\"A lot of these data are telling us that we need to be acting pretty early in this process,\" said John Wherry, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania who recently published a study of these telltale immune signatures. As more findings come out, researchers may be able to begin testing the idea that \"we can change the trajectory of disease,\" he said.\n\nCoronavirus Drug and Treatment Tracker\n\nAn updated list of potential treatments for Covid-19.\n\nWhen a more familiar respiratory infection, like a flu virus, tries to gain a foothold in the body, the immune response launches a defense in two orchestrated acts. First, a cavalry of fast-acting fighters flocks to the site of infection and tries to corral the invader, buying the rest of the immune system time to mount a more tailored attack.\n\nMuch of the early response depends on signaling molecules called cytokines that are produced in response to a virus. Like microscopic alarms, cytokines can mobilize reinforcements from elsewhere in the body, triggering a round of inflammation.\n\nEventually, these cells and molecules leading the initial charge will stand down, making way for antibodies and T cells -- specialized assassins built to home in on the virus and the cells it has infected.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-04T16:15:16.376Z N.Y.C.'s health commissioner resigns after clashing with the mayor over the virus. 'Long days, long nights': Washington prepares for a prolonged fight over virus relief. Israel's rocky reopening of its schools may be a lesson for the U.S. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nBut this coordinated handoff seems to break down in people with severe Covid-19.\n\nRather than bowing out gracefully, the cytokines that drive the first surge never stop sounding the alarm, even after antibodies and T cells arrive on the scene. That means the wildfire response of inflammation may never get snuffed out, even when it's no longer needed.\n\n\"It's normal to develop inflammation during a viral infection,\" said Catherine Blish, a viral immunologist at Stanford University. \"The problem comes when you can't resolve it.\"\n\nThis sustained signaling may result in part from the body's inability to keep the virus in check, Dr. Iwasaki said. Many who struggle to recover from their illness seem to harbor the pathogen long after other patients have purged it, perhaps goading the immune system into prolonging its frantic inflammatory siege.\n\nPlenty of other viruses, including those that cause AIDS and herpes, have evolved tricks to elude the immune system. Recent evidence hints that the new coronavirus might have a way of delaying or muffling interferon, one of the earliest cytokine defenses the body mounts.\n\nThe failure of this first line of defense may dupe the immune system into sounding its alarm bells even louder, dragging out the response into something destructive. \"It's an enigma,\" said Avery August, an immunologist at Cornell University. \"You have this raging immune response, but the virus continues to replicate.\"\n\nAnd the quality of these cytokines may matter as much as the quantity. In a paper published last week in Nature Medicine, Dr. Iwasaki and her colleagues showed that patients with severe Covid-19 appear to be churning out signals that are better suited to subduing pathogens that aren't viruses.\n\nAlthough the delineations aren't always clear-cut, the immune system's responses to pathogens can be roughly grouped into three categories: type 1, which is directed against viruses and certain bacteria that infiltrate our cells; type 2, which fights parasites like worms that don't invade cells; and type 3, which goes after fungi and bacteria that can survive outside of cells. Each branch uses different cytokines to rouse different subsets of molecular fighters.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 3, 2020\n\nI'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Is the coronavirus airborne?The coronavirus can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. It's unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization.\n\nPeople with moderate cases of Covid-19 take what seems like the most sensible approach, concentrating on type 1 responses, Dr. Iwasaki's team found. Patients struggling to recover, on the other hand, seem to be pouring an unusual number of resources into type 2 and type 3 responses, which is kind of \"wacky,\" Dr. Iwasaki said. \"As far as we know, there is no parasite involved.\"\n\nIt's almost as if the immune system is struggling to \"pick a lane,\" Dr. Wherry said.\n\nThis disorientation also seems to extend into the realm of B cells and T cells -- two types of immune fighters that usually need to stay in conversation to coordinate their attacks. Certain types of T cells, for instance, are crucial for coaxing B cells into manufacturing disease-fighting antibodies.\n\nLast month, Dr. Wherry and his colleagues published a paper in Science finding that, in many patients with severe Covid-19, the virus had somehow driven a wedge between these two close-knit cellular communities. It's too soon to tell for sure, but perhaps something about the coronavirus is preventing B and T cells from \"talking to each other,\" he said.\n\nThese studies suggest that treating bad cases of Covid-19 might require an immunological reset -- drugs that could, in theory, restore the balance in the body and resurrect lines of communication between bamboozled cells. Such therapies could even be focused on specific subsets of patients whose bodies are responding bizarrely to the virus, Dr. Blish said: \"the ones who have deranged cytokines from the beginning.\"\n\nBut that's easier said than done. \"The challenge here is trying to blunt the response, without completely suppressing it, and getting the right types of responses,\" Dr. August said. \"It's hard to fine-tune that.\"\n\nTiming is also crucial. Dose a patient too early with a drug that tempers immune signaling, and they may not respond strongly enough; give it too late, and the worst of the damage may have already been done. The same goes for treatments intended to shore up the initial immune response against the coronavirus, like interferon-based therapies, Dr. Blish said. These could stamp out the pathogen if given shortly after infection -- or run roughshod over the body if administered after too long of a delay.\n\nSo far, treatments that block the effects of one cytokine at a time have yielded mixed or lackluster results -- perhaps because researchers haven't yet identified the right combinations of signals that drive disease, said Donna Farber, an immunologist at Columbia University.\n\nSteroids like dexamethasone, on the other hand, are like \"big hammers\" that can curb the activity of multiple cytokines at once, Dr. Farber said. Early clinical trials have hinted at dexamethasone's benefits against severe cases of the coronavirus, and more are underway. Such broad-acting treatments have their downsides. But, she added, \"it seems that's a good strategy, until we know more.\"",

        "body": "LONDON -- Children and young people are far less likely than adults to get severe cases of COVID-19 infection, and death from the pandemic disease among children is exceptionally rare, according to UK research published on Thursday.\n\nA study of COVID-19 patients admitted to 138 hospitals in Britain found that less than 1% were children, and of those fewer than 1% - or six in total - died, all of whom were already suffering serious illness or underlying health disorders.\n\n\"We can be quite sure that COVID in itself is not causing harm to children on a significant scale,\" said Malcolm Semple, a professor of outbreak medicine and child health at Britain's University of Liverpool, who co-led the work.\n\n\"The highest level message really has to be that (in children with COVID-19) severe disease is rare, and death is vanishingly rare - and that (parents) should be comforted that their children are not at direct harm by going back into school,\" he told a briefing.\n\nGlobal data on the spread of the coronavirus pandemic shows that children and young people make up only 1-2% of cases of COVID-19 worldwide. The vast majority of reported infections in children are mild or asymptomatic, with few recorded deaths.\n\nFor this study, published in the BMJ medical journal, Semple's team looked at data from 651 babies and children under 19 who were hospitalised with COVID-19 between Jan. 17 and July 3.\n\nThe six children who died all had \"profound comorbidity\", the researchers said, and this was a \"strikingly low\" fatality rate compared with a 27% across all age groups - from 0-106 years - of COVID-19 patients hospitalised in the same period.\n\nWhile the overall risk of children getting severe COVID is \"tiny\", the researchers said, children of Black ethnicity and those with obesity are disproportionately affected, as previous studies in adults have found.\n\nThe study also showed that children can have a cluster of symptoms including sore throat, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea and rash alongside already-recognised COVID-19 symptoms of fever, breathlessness and cough.\n\n(Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Giles Elgood)",

        "body": "There's a large partisan divide in parents' views on whether it's safe for students and teachers to return to school, several new surveys find.\n\nParents in the United States are anxious and unsure about how to keep their children safe and able to learn during the pandemic school year. But there is a large political divide in how they think about these issues, several new surveys show.\n\nDemocrats are more reluctant than Republicans to send their children to school, and are more worried that their families will become infected. Republicans are more likely to believe teachers and children should be back in classrooms this school year, according to a Morning Consult survey for The New York Times of a nationally representative group of 1,081 parents.\n\nOther recent surveys have found similar patterns. Many factors are at play in parents' approach to the school year, including their jobs; the risk level in their families and communities; and their children's individual needs. Parents of color and low-income parents say they're less comfortable with returning children and teachers to school. But over all, political leanings play a large role in parents' views.\n\nEducation wasn't always such a powerful national political issue. Jeffrey Henig, director of the politics and education program at Teachers College at Columbia, traces the shift back to 1983 and the publication of \"A Nation at Risk,\" a report calling for education reform, which immediately became a political flash point. The intense polarization of the Trump era has made this worse, he said.\n\n\"Increasingly, education has been absorbed into general-purpose politics,\" Professor Henig said. \"And on this particular issue, and under this particular administration and in a presidential election year, it's pretty clear that the orientation toward Trump is more powerful than the contextual information about actual levels of risk in your community.\"\n\nIn July, President Trump placed school reopening squarely in the center of the partisan debate when he called for schools to open in the fall, even without significant federal funding to help them with the added expenses of providing sanitation and physical distancing, and even as Covid-19 cases were rising in many regions.\n\nHis stance alienated many teachers and parents, who said he wasn't doing what was necessary to reopen safely. This seemed to change the political calculus, pushing many school administrators and policymakers to conclude that reopening was unsafe. But it rallied his loyal supporters to the cause, the new data suggests.\n\nIn the survey from The Times and Morning Consult, when parents were asked whether they had considered keeping their child home for health and safety reasons, even with the prospect that a school would reopen, just 29 percent of those who approved of the president's job performance said they had. Nearly half of parents who disapproved of Mr. Trump had considered keeping their children home in such a case.\n\nThere was a similar divide when parents were asked whether teachers should be expected to return to school in person -- a question that has catalyzed teachers' unions and in some cases divided teachers, administrators and parents. Over all, one-quarter of parents said teachers should be strongly encouraged to return; two-thirds said they should be able to do their jobs virtually; and the rest weren't sure.\n\nRepublican parents were nearly three times as likely as Democratic ones to say teachers should be considered essential workers who needed to return to school. Thirty-six percent of Republicans said that -- Republican men were more likely to express this than women -- as did 13 percent of Democrats.\n\nA Brookings analysis found something similar: that politics, more than public health, was driving school districts' reopening plans. Jon Valant, a senior Brookings fellow studying education policy, analyzed data on district reopening plans from Education Week, as well as data on 2016 election results and Covid-19 infection rates by county. He found no relationship between school districts' plans and their counties' infection rates. Instead, there was a strong correlation between a district's plans and a county's support for Mr. Trump in 2016.\n\nThe data was from July; some schools have since changed plans, and the Education Week database is not comprehensive. Still, the patterns are so strong that politics are clearly playing a role, Mr. Valant wrote.\n\nSchools Reopening \"Back to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 25, 2020\n\nThe latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.\n\nForget backpacks and binders. Here are the essentials teenagers will need for their emotional wellbeing in this strange school year.In a new government survey on mental health during the pandemic, 18- to 24-year-olds reported the highest levels of symptoms of anxiety and depression.When traditional college jobs suddenly went away, these students used their ingenuity to find new ways to pay the bills.Some schools won't reveal information about confirmed coronavirus cases in their classrooms, to the dismay of parents and teachers.\n\nThe Pew Research Center found this month that 36 percent of Republicans and those who lean Republican -- but just 6 percent of Democrats and Democratic leaners -- thought schools in their area should be open for in-person teaching five days a week. People in counties that had been hit hard by the virus were more likely to say school should be online only -- but large partisan differences persisted even in these counties, Pew found.\n\nDemocrats were more worried that students and teachers could contract the virus, according to Pew. Republicans were more worried about parents' inability to work and the risk that students could fall behind academically and socially.\n\nFinally, a survey by Kaiser Family Foundation also found that Democrats were much more likely than Republicans to worry that children or school staff would become infected. Nearly all parents of color said they were worried their child would get sick if they returned to school in the fall, compared with just half of white parents.\n\nWhen asked if their schools had enough resources to open safely, more than half of Republicans and Republican leaners said yes, but just 12 percent of Democrats did. Two-thirds of Democrats but just one-fifth of Republicans said they were very worried that their schools would not be able to comply with public health guidance. These views are most likely informed by what parents hear from party leaders, but also by differences in where Democrats and Republicans live and what types of schools their children attend, said Liz Hamel, director of public opinion and survey research at Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nUnlike many countries, the United States has not been able to get the virus under control before the new school year. Further complicating parents' decision-making is that the science on the risks to children and the adults they're in contact with is not definitive. Also, many parents feel they are faced with no good choices in terms of caring for and educating their children this year, and not all districts are being transparent about the virus's spread in schools.\n\nAll these factors, Mr. Henig said, make it easier for people to fall back on their political affiliations -- but that, in turn, makes it tougher to arrive at solutions.\n\n\"When these things become partisan, they become hard to solve,\" he said. \"One reason education was broadly consensual was the debate was over things like how much do you spend on schools, and money can be negotiated -- you can find a middle ground. When you get a highly polarized issue where deep ideological beliefs are at stake, there is no middle ground.\"",

        "body": "Friday: What you can do to protect yourself if you are traveling. Also: The Supreme Court sided with officials at a California jail.\n\nGood morning. Like many other U.S. states, California currently has no travel restrictions in place. That leaves a lot of travelers wondering about what precautions they should take after returning from a trip.\n\nThe question came to us from Abel Cruz, a reader in El Paso, who asked: \"If I drive to California from Texas, will I have to quarantine once I get there?\"\n\nMr. Cruz wants to visit family members in San Diego and the Victor Valley. \"I have been thinking of driving out to California but am not sure whether I should plan to quarantine once I get there, before I see family,\" he said.\n\n[Track coronavirus cases by California county.]\n\nWhile California does not have restrictions in place, Gov. Gavin Newsom urged people coming to the state to act responsibly. \"The key is when you do come into the state, that you abide by all the rules and regulations that our health officers have put forth,\" he said during a briefing on Monday.\n\nThe question of traveling across state lines during the pandemic can be tricky, since nearly half of the country currently has restrictions in place. Hawaii, for instance, requires visitors to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival, or risk being fined $5,000 or up to a year in prison.\n\n[See which states currently have travel restrictions in place.]\n\nFor some additional guidance, I talked to Dr. Jeanne A. Noble, an emergency medicine doctor and the director of the Covid-19 response at U.C.S.F. Medical Center's emergency department, about how people can stay safe while traveling. Here are the takeaways from our conversation.\n\nArrange for testing ahead of time. Dr. Noble recommends getting a Covid-19 test a week before departing on a trip, to allow time for the results to come in. \"Be extra vigilant with your social distancing and face mask use during your 'pre-travel' week so that you can remain confident that your negative test is meaningful,\" she said.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-07T11:22:34.886Z There is little to suggest a compromise is in sight for pandemic relief. Africa reaches one million confirmed cases, although the true toll may be higher. China's offer to help with virus testing alarms Hong Kong. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"Since airline travel itself also puts you at risk for infection, you will need to quarantine and be retested once you have arrived at your destination,\" Dr. Noble said. It's best to wait at least four days after arriving in order to leave time for the virus, if present, to get to detectable levels.\n\nIf traveling by car, simply getting tested before you leave is probably adequate, but you should still quarantine if you have accidentally exposed yourself to potential risks.\n\nWhen in doubt, quarantine. Although not required in California, it's always safer to quarantine yourself if you can't get tested. This is to reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others. You can shorten your time in isolation, however, if you get a negative test.\n\nAnd as always, if you begin to show flulike symptoms, \"assume that you are infected and seek repeat testing while you continue to self-isolate,\" Dr. Noble said.\n\n[Could your symptoms be Covid-19?]\n\nWipe down high-touch surfaces. Traveling by car is generally safer because your car can be easily wiped down and sterilized. Dr. Noble recommends that people sanitize their hands and wipe down their steering wheel with disinfectants every time they get into the car.\n\nIt's best to travel with an ample supply of hand sanitizer and bleach or hydrogen peroxide wipes, Dr. Noble said.\n\nIf you have to stay overnight in a hotel, wipe down all high-touch surfaces, like doorknobs, faucets and phones, when you arrive.\n\nWear a mask and social distance. Face masks are one of the best protections we have against Covid-19, Dr. Noble said, so make sure you pack enough to last. Wear masks in public places, like hotel lobbies or food establishments. If you are in a setting where people are not wearing masks or practicing safe distancing, Dr. Noble recommends that you leave that place immediately.\n\nPay attention to local regulations. California residents visiting other states should check the specific restrictions at their destination before leaving. Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Connecticut require visitors from California to quarantine themselves for 14 days upon arrival.\n\nVisitors to California should abide by California's safe and responsible travel code and follow all public health rules, including a statewide mandate to wear a mask in public places.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nHave a question about how the pandemic is changing daily life in California?

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- By a 5-to-4 vote, the Supreme Court on Wednesday sided with officials at a California jail in a dispute over the adequacy of its response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe court's brief order was unsigned and gave no reasons, which is typical when it acts on emergency applications. The four more liberal justices noted their dissents, and Justice Sonia Sotomayor, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, filed an eight-page dissent that accused the majority of failing to safeguard the health of thousands of detainees.\n\nThe order temporarily stayed an injunction issued by Judge Jesus G. Bernal of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California that required officials at the Orange County Jail to allow detainees to maintain social distancing, be tested if they show symptoms and have access to cleaning supplies. (Judge Bernal denied a request to release all medically vulnerable and disabled individuals.)\n\nIn an emergency application asking the Supreme Court to lift the injunction while appeals moved forward, the officials said Judge Bernal had engaged in unwarranted judicial meddling in the internal affairs of the jail, which currently houses about 3,000 detainees. The officials said they had already released more than half of the jail's population and had taken adequate steps to address the pandemic.\n\n\"The district court's injunction,\" the officials told the justices, \"seizes the role of administration of the jail, prevents nimble responses to the virus in an ever-changing landscape and puts focus on compliance with the order and avoiding contempt, rather than squarely on combating the contagion.\"\n\nIn response, the detainees, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, told the justices that more than 300 residents had tested positive for the virus. They said detainees were \"packed into day rooms sharing the same air and bathrooms without social distancing\" and were given \"watered-down disinfectant and makeshift masks made from bloodstained sheets.\"\n\nIn her dissent, Justice Sotomayor said the officials had misled Judge Bernal. \"The jail claimed that it had already achieved proper social distancing, provided inmates enough soap for frequent hand washing, and isolated and tested all symptomatic individuals,\" she wrote, adding that sworn statements from dozens of detainees told a different story.\n\n\"Inmates described being transported back and forth to the jail in crammed buses, socializing in day rooms with no space to distance physically, lining up next to each other to wait for the phone, sleeping in bunk beds two to three feet apart, and even being ordered to stand closer than six feet apart when inmates tried to socially distance,\" Justice Sotomayor wrote.\n\n\"This court normally does not reward bad behavior,\" she wrote, referring to the officials' litigation tactics.\n\nJustice Sotomayor said the officials deserved no solicitude from the Supreme Court, and she faulted the majority for acting before an appeals court had ruled.\n\n\"The district court found that, despite knowing the severe threat posed by Covid-19 and contrary to its own apparent policies, the jail exposed its inmates to significant risks from a highly contagious and potentially deadly disease,\" she wrote. \"Yet this court now intervenes, leaving to its own devices a jail that has misrepresented its actions to the district court and failed to safeguard the health of the inmates in its care.\"",

        "body": "Standard care for coronavirus patients is expected to change as the World Health Organization alters treatment guidelines.\n\nInternational clinical trials published on Wednesday confirm the hope that cheap, widely available steroid drugs can help seriously ill patients survive Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus.\n\nThe new studies include an analysis that pooled data from seven randomized clinical trials evaluating three steroids in over 1,700 patients. The study concluded that each of the three drugs reduced the risk of death.\n\nThat paper and three related studies were published in the journal JAMA, along with an editorial describing the research as an \"important step forward in the treatment of patients with Covid-19.\"\n\nCorticosteroids should now be the first-line treatment for critically ill patients, the authors added. The only other drug shown to be effective in seriously ill patients, and only modestly at that, is remdesivir.\n\nOn Wednesday, the World Health Organization is expected to release new guidelines encouraging the use of steroid drugs in critically ill patients.\n\nSteroids like dexamethasone, hydrocortisone and methylprednisolone are often used by doctors to tamp down the body's immune system, alleviating inflammation, swelling and pain. Many Covid-19 patients die not of the virus, but of the body's overreaction to the infection.\n\nIn June, researchers at Oxford University discovered that dexamethasone seemed to improve survival rates in severely ill patients. Researchers had hoped that other inexpensive steroids might help these patients.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T14:04:55.777Z New studies show inexpensive steroid drugs can help critically sick people survive Covid-19. Trump's new coronavirus adviser has questioned masks and alarmed government scientists. Biden plans a speech faulting Trump over reopening schools. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe evidence had been lacking: After the Oxford researchers made their announcement, some clinical trials of steroids were halted, as doctors were loathe to withhold what appeared to be an effective treatment from study participants.\n\nSteroids can have harmful side effects, especially in elderly patients, who make up the majority of very ill coronavirus patients. The drugs may leave patients vulnerable to other infections, may raise blood glucose levels, and may cause confusion and delirium.\n\nIn the clinical trials, only the sickest patients were treated with steroids, and it is not certain that those who are less ill will benefit or be harmed. The optimal doses and duration of treatment also need to be identified.\n\nBut over all, the scientists said, the new studies appeared to confirm the promise of this class of drugs for patients severely ill with Covid-19.\n\nThe studies \"are like the second punch of a one-two punch,\" said Dr. Derek C. Angus, chair of the department of critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, who co-authored one of the new studies and the analysis.\n\n\"I had a big smile on my face when I saw the results,\" Dr. Angus added. \"This is a case of, 'A question asked, a question answered,' and that's so rare.\"\n\nThe analysis of pooled data found that steroids were linked with a one-third reduction in deaths among Covid-19 patients. Dexamethasone produced the strongest results: a 36 percent drop in deaths in 1,282 patients treated in three separate trials.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nHydrocortisone, tested in 374 patients in three trials, appeared to reduce deaths by 31 percent, and a small trial of methylprednisolone in 47 patients resulted in a 9 percent drop in deaths. The analysis was carried out by a W.H.O. working group that is making efforts to rapidly evaluate Covid-19 therapies.\n\nTaken together, the new studies will bolster confidence in the use of steroids and address any lingering hesitancy on the part of some physicians, said Dr. Todd Rice, an associate professor of medicine and critical care physician at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine.\n\nAmong the other studies published Wednesday was a Brazilian trial of 299 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome that compared dexamethasone treatment with regular care. The steroid significantly improved outcomes, increasing the number of days patients were alive and free of mechanical ventilation.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nAnother study in France evaluated low doses of another steroid, hydrocortisone, in 148 patients. Those receiving the drug were more likely to survive, but the results were not statistically significant because the trial was stopped early.\n\nA third study tested varying hydrocortisone regimens in 400 seriously ill Covid-19 patients in eight countries. It was also stopped prematurely, but the researchers concluded there was a strong probability that the treatment improved outcomes.\n\nWhen the Oxford results were announced in June, physicians worldwide started using dexamethasone. \"I think there was some uncertainty about whether the effect was real,\" said Dr. Rice, who co-authored an editorial accompanying the new papers in JAMA.\n\n\"This shows us steroids are clearly beneficial in this population and should clearly be given, unless you absolutely can't for some reason, which needs to be a pretty rare occasion.\"\n\nThe drug remdesivir modestly shortens time to recovery in critically ill Covid-19 patients, he noted, but has not been shown to reduce fatalities. \"People are dying from this disease, and we want treatment that we are confident will decrease mortality and save people's lives,\" Dr. Rice said.",

        "body": "Coronavirus outbreaks at colleges reopening for fall classes underscore the difficulties of policing student behavior.\n\nAt Cornell University, students started arriving over the past week hoping for a safe and socially distanced fall semester. Jason Chang already has doubts.\n\nA 24-year-old doctoral student, Mr. Chang oversees undergraduates in the dorm where he lives. As the first wave of residents checked in, he caught one student out wandering the halls three times when she was supposed to be quarantining.\n\nAnother student worker got a phone call from an undergraduate who, from the background noise, appeared to be at an unauthorized party. Another caught two students in supposed isolation hanging out together in a single dorm room.\n\n\"Constant insanity and madness,\" said Mr. Chang, who this fall will share supervision of up to 300 dorm residents with seven other graduate and undergraduate students, all while working on his own Ph.D. in biomedical engineering. \"That's been my life this week.\"\n\nStruggling to salvage some normalcy -- and revenue -- from a crippling pandemic, many colleges and universities are inviting students into dorms and classrooms. The limited openings, being tried by more than a third of the country's 5,000 campuses, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education, have come with strict rules: No parties. Mandated coronavirus tests or routine self-checks for symptoms. No setting foot into public spaces without masks.\n\nBut early outbreaks at dozens of colleges have underscored the yawning gap between policy and enforcement -- and the limitations of any college to control the behavior of young people who are paying for the privilege to attend classes.\n\nOn-campus restrictions are being undermined by off-campus partying. Student codes of conduct are being signed and promptly forgotten. Day-to-day policing is often falling to teaching assistants and residential advisers who have mixed feelings about confronting scofflaw undergraduates sitting in the front row or living in the next dorm room.\n\nRecent videos from several campuses -- such as the University of North Georgia -- have shown scores or hundreds of students gathering without masks or social distance. On Thursday, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill moved undergraduates to remote instruction when at least 177 students tested positive, largely in clusters linked to dormitories, sororities and fraternities.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame suspended in-person classes after positive tests by 147 students, most of them seniors living off campus who were infected at gatherings where masks were not worn and social distancing recommendations were not followed. On Tuesday, the school issued a strongly worded statement, urging students to \"call one another to accountability.\"\n\n\"University authorities cannot be in all spaces at all times,\" the email from student affairs and campus safety officers said.\n\nPaul J. Browne, a spokesman for Notre Dame, said the first sign that the outbreak might be contained appeared after classes were temporarily moved online and students living on campus were told not to mix with those living off campus. Students had been surprisingly helpful with contact tracing. \"If anything,\" he said, \"they want the university to be more aggressive.\"\n\nIndeed, many university officials seem to be relying on students to report one another to enforce coronavirus restrictions. Some colleges are advertising hotlines where students can anonymously report unsafe behavior. (The University of Kentucky's line is 859-218-SAFE.) A recent TikTok video that has more than 3.4 million views captured the spirit of self-enforcement.\n\nIn the video, two young men warn that they would rather tell on their classmates than be sent home from their unnamed college. \"I will rat you out,\" one emphatically warns, adding: \"I'm not doing Khan Academy from home. I refuse. And I hate the cops.\"\n\nA few schools have begun imposing tough penalties to send a message. Purdue University's president, Mitch Daniels, suspended 36 students in the past week after a cooperative house was caught partying less than 24 hours after he had specifically outlawed off-campus parties. At the University of Connecticut, a mask-free dorm bash got several students evicted from campus housing.\n\nAt least 14 Drake University students were banned from the Des Moines campus for two weeks for allegedly flouting the school's no-party edict. \"I want to be crystal clear: We are serious and we will not hesitate to take the necessary actions to mitigate the potential spread of Covid-19, jeopardizing the health and safety of others,\" the dean of students, Jerry Parker, wrote in a campus email.\n\nBut education officials say it is generally not in the nature of colleges and universities to function like police states. More common is the approach being taken at Iowa State University, where hundreds of students gathered to kick off the semester in violation of social distancing rules. Rather than a crackdown, university officials sent students a letter explaining that gathering without masks jeopardized the university's ability to complete the semester in November.\n\nThe preferred message is, \"We're all in this together,\" said Kirsten Turner, associate provost for academic and student affairs at the University of Kentucky, where more than 6,000 students, out of 31,000, moved into residence halls from Aug. 8 to Aug. 16.\n\nThat message has frayed into outright shaming as rogue gatherings have sent infections soaring.\n\n\"Do you want to be the person responsible for sending everyone home?\" the president of Pennsylvania State University, Eric Barron, demanded in a message to students after suspending a fraternity for partying and dispersing an unmasked crowd outside some dormitories. Syracuse University threatened to shut down the campus and publicly denounced a large group of first-year students as \"selfish and reckless\" after they roamed the campus on Wednesday night. The university temporarily suspended 23 students while their conduct cases were pending.\n\nEnforcement of campus health rules is not only important for faculty, staff and students: Surrounding communities may also be at risk. Boone County, Mo., home to the University of Missouri-Columbia; Story County, Iowa, home to Iowa State; and Harvey County, Kan., home to Bethel College, all have seen cases surge in August, according to a New York Times analysis.\n\nMany cities and campuses are trying to coordinate enforcement. The City Council in Columbia, S.C., is amending its zoning code to penalize landlords for off-campus parties held by University of South Carolina students. And the University of California, Berkeley, has banned in-person gatherings by student organizations both on and off campus, aiming at fraternities.\n\nAt the University of Kentucky, where classes began for undergraduates on Monday, Ms. Turner, the associate provost, said officials were in the process of working with the Christian Student Fellowship because its off-campus pre-orientation party was flagged for violations of the campus code of conduct.\n\nBut Ms. Turner said the university tried to approach discipline through \"a restorative justice perspective, so we see it as a learning experience, how you take these types of situations and grow from them.\" On Friday, the university said it was retesting students in fraternities and sororities because they had a higher positive rate, 3 percent, than the general student population at 1 percent, and two fraternity houses account for 30 of the 49 students in isolation.\n\nAt some schools, social media is being monitored for potential violations. Since most students began returning to West Virginia University's flagship campus on Aug. 15, postings have documented large parties and students sitting maskless on front porches without social distancing, G. Corey Farris, the dean of students, said.\n\nSome are complaints, he said, and others are \"hey, look at me, I'm having a great time.\" Campus officials often see the posts before the police do, and use them to track down potential problems. Surrounding Monongalia County had a surge of cases in July that has mostly tapered off.\n\nSchools Reopening \"Back to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 21, 2020\n\nThe latest on how schools are reopening amid the pandemic.\n\nWith courses moved online but football games still on, the University of North Carolina is a test case for college sports.The federal government has announced measures intended to boost childhood vaccination rates, which are sagging during the pandemic.Much more will be expected of America's school nurses this year, but the reality is: Many schools don't have one.We want to hear from teachers making difficult choices. How are you thinking about the start of the school year? Tell us here.\n\nMr. Farris said the university had received two or three reports of social gatherings of more than 25 people, which are barred by the governor's executive order. But he acknowledged that parties are hard to police because by the time the authorities arrive, the guests have scattered, and investigators are left looking at leases and deeds for the tenants or owners.\n\n\"As a society, we're struggling with it all over the place, whether on a college campus, or going to the grocery store or people going to their churches and synagogues,\" Mr. Farris said. \"It's not just students who are struggling with it.\"\n\nThat is cold comfort for the teaching assistants and residence hall advisers who at many institutions have become the first line of campus pandemic defense. Desirae Embree, a graduate student at Texas A&M University who teaches two undergraduate classes -- one online, the other in person -- said that if students come to her class without face masks, \"right now the recommendation is that we tell them to leave.\"\n\nStudents working at residence halls say policing public health adds to their usual workload, which already can range from organizing group outings to handling sexual assault reports and suicide threats.\n\nAt Cornell, where Mr. Chang studies and works, \"behavior compact monitors\" are expected to be deployed to spot and address health violations. An online tool to report violations is scheduled to start when classes do on Sept. 2, according to a university spokeswoman. Complaints will be adjudicated by a special compliance team.\n\nBut right now, Mr. Chang said, student staff members like him seem to be the ones catching and correcting the pandemic no-nos: \"Who else is there?\"\n\nAs undergraduates have checked into his building, he said, he and other student workers have reminded them of the new rules. The majority comply, he said, but some advisers worry that even gentle reminders might escalate into conflict.\n\nSo far there has been little if any pushback to campus coronavirus rules on ideological grounds, but there are qualms from civil libertarians about how policies are being carried out. At Iowa State, Ryan Hurley, president of the College Republicans, said he was dismayed by students partying, but also by the administration's confusing directives, like a series of emails about swimming pools.\n\nNorman Siegel, a civil liberties lawyer, raised a concern that having invited students back to campus, it was unfair of colleges to punish nonconforming behavior too harshly. The schools have a responsibility to persuade students to put public health above their impulse to have a good time, Mr. Siegel said.\n\n\"If they don't set that up, they can't transfer the problem to teenagers,\" he said.\n\nBut can they transfer it to adults? Resident advisers elsewhere on campus are demanding hazard pay, additional protective equipment and shorter hours. Mr. Chang is not part of their action. But like them, he said, he worries.\n\nOn Monday night, he said, he helped a student get back to her room, reminding her that she was supposed to be quarantining. But when he saw her wandering twice more in the next hour as he was posting health signage, he just stood and stared, speechless.\n\n\"I hated it,\" he said, \"but after that first time, my thought was, 'What are you doing? Why are you out?' And then, 'Is your mask on? Am I sufficiently distanced?' The third time? I just rerouted. I told myself it would be better to just post those rules.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Jesse James Deconto, Timothy Facciola, Danielle Ivory and Allyson Waller.",

        "body": "STURGIS, S.D. -- And just like that, the roar of the motorcycles was gone.\n\nTen days after Sturgis, S.D., drew hundreds of thousands of bikers from all over the country to its signature motorcycle rally despite concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, the parties ended and most of the crowds headed home on Sunday.\n\nUncertain still was what effect, if any, the event will have on the spread of the virus. Because of the time it can take for symptoms to appear and the way coronavirus cases are tracked in the United States, officials may never know whether the annual rally was a place where the virus was widely passed along.\n\nThere were no immediate signs that the rally had led to a significant uptick: The county that includes Sturgis has reported 104 coronavirus cases during the pandemic, 33 of them since the start of August. On Monday, state health officials said they knew of one case of the virus in someone who had attended the motorcycle rally, according to The Rapid City Journal. And Mark Schulte, president of Monument Health Sturgis Hospital, confirmed that some people in Sturgis for the rally had tested positive for the virus, though he would not say how many.\n\nBut if a flurry of new cases were to emerge -- days from now or even longer -- they would likely be reported by attendees back in their hometowns, and would not necessarily ever be tied to the rally.\n\nIt is a challenge that public health officials have faced repeatedly as they try to understand how the coronavirus is making its way through the country: When people gather for a large event and then return to states with different health departments, it is difficult to be sure whether the event was part of an outbreak.\n\nThe issue has stymied certainty about how the virus's spread has been affected by events like a rally for President Trump in Oklahoma, protests in Minneapolis after the death of George Floyd, holiday weekend visits to the Lake of the Ozarks in Missouri, Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans and spring break trips to Florida.\n\nThe rally in Sturgis, one of the biggest regional events to proceed amid the pandemic, drew attention from all over. More than 350,000 vehicles had flocked into the small town during the first week of the event, according to the South Dakota Department of Transportation.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-18T01:31:21.260Z U.S. college campuses grapple with coronavirus fears, outbreaks and protests. For primary and secondary students and staff, it's been a difficult back-to-school season. Data reporting problems are causing confusion in Iowa and elsewhere. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"It's more than we anticipated by far,\" said Dan Ainslie, the city manager of Sturgis.\n\nLocal officials had set up precautions -- hand sanitizing stations and capacity limits inside some buildings. But many people went without masks, and some supporters suggested that a mostly-outdoor event did not require face coverings.\n\n\"You have to be careful, but at the same time, you have to live,\" said Mike Petrocco, a Sturgis resident who has long offered his lawn as a campsite during rallies. Mr. Petrocco, 64, said that at one point this year he was hosting 16 people, and that he offered hand sanitizer, did laundry and cleaned every day.\n\nBut tracking virus outbreaks, if they were to emerge, is complex and might involve multiple health departments in different states. Cases discovered in other states might never be known to South Dakota officials unless close contacts were carefully traced back.\n\nIn this city that ordinarily is home to fewer than 7,000 people, some residents seemed relieved that it was over. \"There was no stopping it. People had plans to come, whether we were going to have it or not,\" said Lisa Logan, 60, who left town for Iowa for much of the 10 days.\n\nSixty percent of residents favored postponing the event, according to a city survey, and hospital officials said they intend later this week to administer coronavirus tests to any Sturgis resident who wants one.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 17, 2020\n\nWhy does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\n\"It bothers me that they are so inconsiderate of their own health, the health of the folks who hosted them and for their families back home,\" said Melissa Two Crow, 65.\n\nNative American tribes in western South Dakota turned away motorcyclists who attempted to travel through the reservations to Sturgis. Rides through the reservations in South Dakota feature the rocky hill formations of the Badlands, views of the Missouri River and green hilly plains with small creeks cutting through.\n\n\"If they've come from out of state or from hot spots, we turn them away and ask them to seek an alternate route to their destinations,\" said Remi Bald Eagle, the intergovernmental affairs coordinator for the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe.\n\nBy the time the motorcycle rally was winding down, South Dakota had been added to New York's list of states from which travelers are required to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nImages of the motorcyclists in Sturgis led New Hampshire leaders to issue a mask mandate ahead of Laconia Motorcycle Week, which is scheduled for late August.\n\n\"Sturgis was a real clear warning sign to us,\" Gov. Chris Sununu said during a news conference. \"I don't think anyone saw the photos out of Sturgis and said, 'That looks safe.'\"",

Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nWith much of the world, and especially New York City, reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, they had no idea where or when the Open might take place, or if anyone would bother to show up for an event held in the city for more than 100 years, one of its biggest and most economically important festivals.\n\nSo Mike Dowse, the newly installed chief executive of the United States Tennis Association, set up a team to determine how to carry out the event, setting in motion a grand experiment that could show what international sports, as well as New York, might be capable of while navigating the public health threat.\n\n[Will the U.S. Open show that big events can return to New York?]\n\nPlayers, who began arriving in mid-August for a smaller tournament held before the U.S. Open begins today, are mostly cloistered in a Long Island hotel, preparing to play in cavernous stadiums without spectators at the U.S.T.A. Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens.\n\nAnd at the tennis center, where some 50,000 people usually pack the stadiums each day, there are few hints of the usual food, merchandising and corporate entertainment.\n\nDr. Bernard Camins, an infectious-diseases specialist at Mount Sinai Health Systems who advised the U.S.T.A. on its protocols, said that having athletes arrive from all over the world made staging the tournament especially complicated. Officials quickly determined that if they required a two-week quarantine period ahead of the tournament, no one would come. They decided instead to administer two tests within the first 48 hours and follow up on testing every four days.\n\n\"A living experiment, that is exactly how our eyes are viewing this,\" said Dr. Andrew Wallach, chief medical officer for ambulatory care for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corp. \"What we are going to learn from the tournaments is a little different than a football game, but we are going to learn about preparedness and testing protocols and tracing in a sporting event.\"\n\nIt's Monday -- keep moving.\n\nMetropolitan Diary: Same sweater\n\nDear Diary:\n\nI was at the butcher waiting for the two sweet Italian sausages I had ordered.

        "body": "The agency told public health agencies that two unidentified vaccines might be ready by October or November. We explain how vaccine trials work, when one might be ready, and who may get them first.\n\nIn planning documents sent last week to public health agencies around the country, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention described preparations for two coronavirus vaccines they refer to simply as Vaccine A and Vaccine B. The technical details of the vaccines, including the time between doses and their storage temperatures, match well with the two vaccines furthest along in clinical tests in the United States, made by Moderna and Pfizer.\n\nHere's what you need to know about how the vaccines work, how they're being tested and how they might be rolled out to the public -- if, and it's still a big if, they are proven to work.\n\nHow do these vaccines work?\n\nVaccines can take many different forms. The most common in use today contain inactivated viruses, weakened live viruses, or pieces of proteins. Moderna and Pfizer are testing a new kind of vaccine that has never before been approved for use by people. It contains genetic molecules called messenger RNA. The messenger RNA is injected into muscle cells, which treat it like instructions for building a protein -- a protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. If all goes well, the proteins stimulate the immune system and result in long-lasting protection against the virus.\n\nWhat do we know about how well these vaccines work?\n\nBoth vaccines have gone through extensive early tests, but we still don't know for sure if they're safe and effective.\n\nOnce vaccines are designed, they go through four stages of testing. In the preclinical stage, researchers test them on animals. For Covid-19, these animals include hamsters and genetically modified mice, both of which can experience some of the same symptoms as humans.\n\nIf these tests yield promising results, then the vaccines go into three phases of clinical trials in people.\n\nIn Phase 1, doctors give the vaccine to a small number of volunteers. They keep an eye on them to make sure they don't have any immediate negative reactions. It's not uncommon for people to feel achiness in their muscles or even a mild fever, but these mild symptoms typically don't last long.\n\nIn Phase 2 trials, scientists give the vaccine to hundreds of people split into groups, like children and older adults, to determine whether the vaccine acts differently in them. In both Phases 1 and 2, researchers analyze the blood of volunteers to see if their immune systems are learning to fight the virus with antibodies and immune cells that can kill infected cells.\n\nFinally, in Phase 3 trials, scientists give the vaccine to tens of thousands of people and a placebo to tens of thousands of others.\n\nModerna and Pfizer are currently testing their candidates in Phase 3 trials. In their earlier human studies, neither vaccine produced serious side effects. Both vaccines provoked people's immune systems to make antibodies that can neutralize the coronavirus.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T22:46:12.789Z The University of South Carolina reports that more than 1,000 students currently have the virus. The C.D.C. tells health officials to be ready to distribute a vaccine by November, raising concerns over politicized timing. Virus fallout from the Sturgis motorcycle rally: A death in Minnesota, cases in South Dakota and more. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThat's encouraging. But that alone does not reveal whether a vaccine works or not.\n\nWhy is a Phase 3 trial important?\n\nOnly a Phase 3 trial can establish whether a vaccine is safe and effective enough to be approved for widespread use.\n\nIn such a trial, volunteers are randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine or the placebo. They don't know which they one they are given, nor do their doctors. By \"blinding\" the trial, researchers ensure that no bias creeps into the study.\n\nA Phase 3 trial collects data about the symptoms volunteers experience after their injection, and whether they become infected with the coronavirus. After \"unblinding\" the data, researchers compare the rates of infection and adverse side effects between people who receive the vaccine and those who receive the placebo.\n\nIf significantly more people get Covid-19 on the placebo than the vaccine, that is evidence that the vaccine is effective. The F.D.A. has indicated that vaccine makers should aim for 50 percent protection in order to be considered effective.\n\nIf significantly more people who receive the vaccine suffer serious side effects, that may indicate that the vaccine isn't safe -- or may be safe only for certain groups, like people under the age of 65.\n\nCoronavirus Vaccine Tracker\n\nA look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans.\n\nCould a vaccine be approved before clinical trials are completed?\n\nIn recent days, some federal health officials have said a vaccine could be made available to at least some groups before clinical trials have been completed. An independent body called a Data and Safety Monitoring Board is charged with checking in on clinical trials at certain points to ensure there are no serious safety issues. If the vaccine is harming participants, the trial may be ended early. But if it appeared to be working incredibly well -- a scenario that the government's top infectious disease expert, Anthony S. Fauci, floated in an interview with Kaiser Health News this week -- the board could also decide it would no longer be ethical to continue giving some participants a placebo and could end the trial early.\n\nWhat have companies said about when their vaccines may be ready?\n\nCompanies have given varying estimates. Pfizer recently said it was \"on track\" for seeking government review \"as early as October 2020.\" Moderna has said it expects to complete enrollment in its Phase 3 trial in September, but has not provided an estimate about when the vaccine might be ready for the public.\n\nFederal officials said in May that the first doses of a vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca, in partnership with the University of Oxford, could be delivered by October. But AstraZeneca, which recently began Phase 3 trials of the vaccine in the United States, is now saying it could supply the first doses of the vaccine in the United States by the end of 2020.\n\nIn a recent statement, Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, said the company was \"putting science and the interest of society at the heart of our work,\" adding, \"we are moving quickly but without cutting corners.\"\n\nHow would a vaccine reach the public?\n\nThe pandemic has prompted a drastic change in how vaccines are developed. Normally, vaccine makers would wait for clinical trials to yield definitive results before moving forward with plans to manufacture a vaccine. This time, many manufacturers have begun preparing in advance for production, getting money from governments to buffer the risk.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe C.D.C.'s planning documents give an indication of the extraordinary complexity of distributing vaccines to hundreds of millions of people in a country with a fragmented health care system. Past experiences serve as a warning about how this undertaking can go awry.\n\nIn March 2009, a pandemic strain of influenza known as H1N1 emerged, raising the prospect that huge numbers of people might die. Scientists worked hard to create and test a vaccine for the new flu strain as fast as possible. But large deliveries of the vaccine didn't start until December, and only 24 percent of Americans received it by April 2010. Fortunately, the new flu strain turned out to be much milder than expected.\n\nThat's not the case with Covid-19. So far, over 25.7 million people have been infected worldwide and 857,920 have died. With the prospect of many more infections ahead, the rapid deployment of a safe and effective vaccine is all the more urgent.\n\nWhen might the first vaccines be distributed?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told public health agencies last week that limited doses of a vaccine may be available beginning in late October or November, although that would only be if a vaccine is shown to be safe and effective. According to the documents the agency sent to the public health offices, two million doses of what the C.D.C. labeled Vaccine A -- most likely the Pfizer vaccine -- may be available by the end of October, with 10 to 20 million doses possibly available by November, and 20 to 30 million by the end of December.\n\nThe C.D.C. said the other potential vaccine, Vaccine B -- which matches the details of the Moderna vaccine -- could have about 1 million doses available by October, 10 million by November, and 15 million by December. Each of the vaccines would require two doses to be effective.\n\nPfizer and Moderna did not respond to questions about the C.D.C.'s recent guidelines.\n\nWho will get it first?\n\nIn the documents sent to public health agencies, the C.D.C. said certain groups would have priority, beginning with health care workers, essential workers (like police officers or those who work in critical industries like food production), \"national security populations,\" and workers and residents of long-term care facilities like nursing homes.\n\nThose priority groups include millions of people. At a meeting last week of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the C.D.C., an agency official presented a slide showing that in the United States, there are about 17 to 20 million health care workers, 60 to 80 million essential workers and about 53 million people older than 65.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine unveiled a 114-page plan, sponsored by the C.D.C. and the National Institutes of Health, that proposed a complicated four-phase system for priority.\n\nWill these two Covid-19 vaccines be the only ones available?\n\nProbably not. Aside from Moderna and Pfizer, there are 34 other vaccines in clinical trials worldwide. There are over 90 more vaccines confirmed to be in active preclinical testing. Over the next year, 69 of them are slated to go into clinical trials.\n\nAmong all of these other vaccines, some may prove more potent than the first ones that are approved. Some may be better in particular for children or older people. Some may turn out to provide a valuable booster to immunity.\n\nModerna and Pfizer's vaccines also require a lot of care in their handling. For example, Moderna's vaccine requires storage at minus 20 degrees Celsius; Pfizer's has to stay at minus 70. Some of the other vaccines now being developed may be kept at much warmer temperatures, making them easier to distribute in places that don't have advanced medical facilities.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

Together, we contributed $59 billion to the region's 2019 gross domestic product -- accounting for a whopping 50 to 90 percent of the G.D.P. for most of the countries, according to the International Monetary Fund.\n\nI admit that in moments of pandemic weariness I have been one of those people eyeing cheap tickets to the Caribbean, wondering when I might feel ready to jump on a flight.\n\nNow, though, our business comes with a mortal threat -- that for the sake of a vacation we will bring the coronavirus to islands that are ill-prepared to handle a major outbreak. But staying home could be equally ruinous. The Covid-19 lockdown -- and the severity of the epidemic in the United States -- has been a disaster beyond any hurricane for the Caribbean economy. The pandemic has closed airports and cruise ship docks, shut down restaurants and dive shops and deprived the Caribbean of tens of billions of dollars.\n\n\"To not have visitors arriving for any period of time, but particularly for an extended period of time, has brought immense hardship to a number of people throughout the Caribbean,\" said Hugh Riley, the former head of the Caribbean Tourism Office, and a partner with Portfolio Marketing Group, which represents some islands. \"Caribbean countries face an important dilemma: Try to hermetically seal their borders from visitors until there's an effective vaccine, or tackle the risks of restarting tourism now. It is the classic risk/reward decision,\" he said.\n\nAs of August 3, 23 islands in the region have reopened to tourism, with 15 allowing visitors from the United States -- with negative Covid-19 tests and, usually, periods of quarantine. It has not always gone smoothly: The Bahamas allowed Americans to visit beginning in July, slammed the door shut as coronavirus cases surged in that nation, then reopened again, indicative of the efforts to manage a moving crisis. Puerto Rico opened to Americans from the mainland on July 15, but pushed that date back to August 15 after a weekend of viral videos showing incoming visitors ignoring mask and social distancing rules. On the other end of the spectrum, Barbados is offering a 12-month visa to any American interested in moving a work-from-home office to the island.\n\nTourists looking to escape to a coronavirus-free tropical island have a responsibility to weigh the risks and take precautions.\n\nSo does the airline industry, says Allen Chastanet, the prime minister of St. Lucia and a former airline executive nominated by CARICOM, the 20-nation Caribbean consortium, and the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States to develop recommendations for reopening the region. Mr. Chastanet has been urging the airlines to push for the development and implementation of rapid preboarding airport testing for all passengers.\n\n\"You have to have testing sites, the way you have a Dunkin' Donuts kiosk in every airport,\" he said. \"The airlines in many ways acted like they had ostrich syndrome, and said it is somebody else's problem, but ultimately it is their problem. They have to use their advocacy strength to make it happen.\"\n\nTourism has always been a two-edged sword for the region. It brought money for some, but also brought corruption, environmental degradation and unchecked development. No tourist who steps outside an \"inclusive\" resort can fail to notice the incredible disparity of wealth on the islands: palatial walled estates are often a stone's throw from cement block shacks. Crime is such a problem on some Caribbean islands that websites are devoted to statistics to help worried travelers shop for the safest destinations. (I can attest to this problem, having been burglarized in Tobago and Vieques.) The BBC once called Jamaica \"the murder capital of the world,\" to howls of outrage from the Jamaicans.\n\nAs Caribbean tourism exploded and got cheaper, local tour operators raked in money, but faced unexpected problems. Tropical infrastructure, local police and medical systems were overwhelmed on some islands even before the virus. One island friend, a divemaster at a major site, who asked that his name not be used for fear of losing his job, told me he has seen increasingly obese, relatively unhealthy American tourists who feel entitled to be squished into neoprene suits and taken to the depths as cruise lines and cheap tours market scuba diving -- once reserved for scientists, Navy SEALs and the ultrawealthy and sporty -- to all.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-04T07:33:06.428Z Fauci defends Birx after she is criticized by Trump. Trump derides Democrats as lawmakers and administration officials try to break stimulus impasse. The deadline for 2020 census counting has been moved up by a month. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe Caribbean is the biggest source of business for the global cruise industry, which is notoriously callous about the environment. Cruise lines were the first global heralds of the coronavirus disaster and will likely be the last travel industry to come back once the virus is under control.\n\nThe cruise industry always had the upper hand on the islands. When a cruise ship docks and thousands of people are disgorged, the impression of prosperity is illusory. Most of the islands pay a per head fee to the cruise lines for each passenger who disembarks, the cruise ships are notoriously bad for reefs, and they have a stranglehold on the discretionary dollars their passengers are spending.\n\n\"Everything that can be sold on board is already sold, and anyplace on the island that could benefit has already made arrangements with the cruise company,\" said Noel Mignott, a former deputy director of tourism for Jamaica and a founding partner of Portfolio Marketing Group. \"If one good thing could come of Covid, I would be encouraged to see governments take this opportunity to renegotiate the relationship with the cruise lines. And if I was a cruise line, I would wave that green flag and try to be as good as I can to the environment -- if only to say we are not dumping our garbage in the ocean two miles off Ocho Rios.\"\n\nThe Dutch island of Bonaire is one of the ports of call for behemoth and often super-discounted cruise ships plying the Caribbean. In the last few years, two building-size ships have daily disgorged up to 4,000 passengers at a time during the cruising season. The ships have sometimes sparked food shortages by taking up dock space needed for cargo.\n\nNow, in the pandemic lull, tour providers, officials and some citizens have been quietly discussing what to do about the ships when they return. Facebook groups like Bonaire Future Forum: Opportunity From Crisis are debating whether the island should limit access to specific ships that cost more and are therefore more selective in their choice of passenger.\n\nThe island has one of the most pristine reefs in the Caribbean, and animal behavior has changed since the number of daily human divers dropped from thousands to the single digits. Local divers are noticing animals come closer, and the elusive seahorse has been a common sight these last months.\n\nThe pandemic has already changed life by necessity. The Caribbean has a \"ridiculously high\" food import bill because of an assumption that tourists don't want to eat local food, Mr. Riley said. The pandemic may change that. \"We have been laboring under the misconception that tourists want something other than what we have. We think people want hamburgers and hot dogs. Now that we are consuming what we have, I think this will lead to an increased variety in what we produce locally,\" he said.\n\nSven Olof Lindblad, the chief executive of Lindblad Expeditions, which offers high-end, small-ship, environmentally conscious cruises around the world, sees the pandemic as a moment in which destinations can seize control of the downside of overtourism and demand changes. \"This clearly is a time to rethink -- but it won't be led by businesses who are, by and large, too fat and happy with the way it is. Create working groups to totally rethink the relationship of tourism focused on value -- and not just financial value.\"\n\nSelling \"sun, sand and sea\"\n\nStepping out of an aluminum tube in the dead of winter and into a blanket of tropical humidity is, in my view, one of life's singular pleasures. And I've endured many a discount middle seat to get some \"last-minute\" sun and sand in the Caribbean.\n\nBut these jaunts have sometimes come with a measure of self-loathing. Quaffing wintertime margaritas poolside at an inclusive Jamaican resort next to my fellow pasty North Americans while our sunburned kids went sugar-mad refilling plastic cups at a Willy Wonka-style eternal soda fountain is not a look I'm proud of.\n\nMore, I can never fully repress the awareness that these trips are not ecologically friendly. Even before flight-shaming, the rampant construction of resorts, the ribbons of new roads and the abomination of air conditioning all struck me as a blight on the natural beauty of the islands.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 3, 2020\n\nI'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Is the coronavirus airborne?The coronavirus can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. It's unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization.\n\nEveryone I talked to about a post-Covid Caribbean mentioned one thing: a hope that the pandemic might result in a different kind of tourist: a traveler, not necessarily richer in money, but more conscious, more of an explorer and less of a sybarite. It is a hope shared by many overtouristed spots around the globe, from Venice to the beaches of southern Thailand. For the Caribbean, a long history of being seen as a playground for visitors from the mainland United States might make things harder.\n\nThe tourist industry itself trained Americans to think of the Caribbean as \"sun, sand and sea,\" and to think of the diverse islands as interchangeable, Mr. Mignott said. Other than the sea they share, the islands are different, each with a unique geological and human history. The older islands to the west, including Cuba, are formed of limestone and billions of shells and skeletons of ancient marine life, while the black cliffs and crags of the younger islands along the eastern edge -- where the Caribbean and the Atlantic tectonic plates grind against each other -- are relics of violent prehistoric volcanic events.\n\nIn my years exploring the Caribbean, I've visited Guadeloupe, Bonaire, St. John, Vieques, Jamaica and Tobago, and met people who have in common that they were born with the sound of the sea in their ears, but otherwise possess unique traditions, history, language and culture, that reward visitors with a little curiosity.\n\nThe Caribbean tourism industry could take this opportunity to differentiate the islands, and maybe even put responsibility on travelers to go beyond the resort walls or cruise ship all-inclusives and explore local food and culture.\n\nCan it happen? As airlines and cruise ships reduce capacity, and the tourist industry consolidates, the islands need to act deliberately, said Mr. Riley. \"Are we going to leave it to happenstance or are we going to plan for more socially responsible tourism and put policies in place that redress and undo damage to the environment?\" he asked.\n\nThe premier of the island of Nevis, Mark Brantley, said the pandemic has taught the Caribbean that overreliance on tourism is not the best model and that Covid-19 could mark the end of the era of cheap tourism and mega cruises. \"Jurisdictions are going to pivot to more tourism pitched at the luxury market, with smaller numbers of people and arguably a better yield,\" he said. Additionally, he predicted that local industries, especially agriculture and agri-processing, will become more important sectors of the Caribbean economies. \"Countries will be trying to diversify, where tourism continues to be important, but not the only game in town anymore.\"\n\nMr. Chastanet said that when the pandemic struck, St. Lucia was already midway into a national program to promote what he called \"village tourism,\" sprucing up hamlets with new infrastructure and training and providing seed money for resort workers and hotel chefs to open up their own small-scale, boutique operations. \"The things we were doing just got reinforced by Covid,\" he said.\n\n\"We really hope if one good thing happens from the pandemic, it will be that travel is more thoughtful, and travelers are more conscious about the environment,\" said Mr. Mignott, the former deputy tourism director for Jamaica. \"We don't think people are just going to go back like Covid never happened. We really think it will be different.\"\n\nA different kind of tourism\n\nI will regret the end of cheap, mass Caribbean tourism, if it comes, but I understood its downside long before the coronavirus. I have also been another kind of island traveler -- a temporary resident. I spent most of my seventh month of one pregnancy floating like a turtle in the sea outside an old-time resort called Arnos Vale in Tobago, traditionally known as a destination for birders. We couldn't afford to lodge there, but we swam on the beach and spent time under the slow flapping porch fan where a talking parrot held court.\n\nA year later, we moved our family into a Tobago rental for six weeks. We lived simply on peanut butter sandwiches, the daily fish catch and Betty Crocker box cakes. Every day I rode my bike past a ruined pink plantation and through a hilltop hamlet impossibly named \"Whim.\"\n\nIn Whim, Tobagoans lived in simple wood shacks perched on cliffs overlooking crashing surf, poor in money, but the owners of stupendous, million-dollar views.\n\nWhen we returned to the island a few years later we found newly paved roads, traffic jams, and a new mood -- the hum and honk of progress drowning out the hummingbirds and the cackle of the national bird, the cocrico, at dawn. I know Whim is still on the map, but I wonder who owns those little shacks.\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

        "body": "Some people carry immune cells called T cells that can capitalize on the virus's resemblance to other members of its family tree.\n\nEight months ago, the new coronavirus was unknown. But to some of our immune cells, the virus was already something of a familiar foe.\n\nA flurry of recent studies has revealed that a large proportion of the population -- 20 to 50 percent of people in some places -- might harbor immunity assassins called T cells that recognize the new coronavirus despite having never encountered it before.\n\nThese T cells, which lurked in the bloodstreams of people long before the pandemic began, are most likely stragglers from past scuffles with other, related coronaviruses, including four that frequently cause common colds. It's a case of family resemblance: In the eyes of the immune system, germs with common roots can look alike, such that when a cousin comes to call, the body may already have an inkling of its intentions.\n\nThe presence of these T cells has intrigued experts, who said it was too soon to tell whether the cells would play a helpful, harmful or entirely negligible role in the world's fight against the current coronavirus. But should these so-called cross-reactive T cells exert even a modest influence on the body's immune response to the new coronavirus, they might make the disease milder -- and perhaps partly explain why some people who catch the germ become very sick, while others are dealt only a glancing blow.\n\n\"If you have a population of T cells that are armed and ready to protect you, you could control the infection better than someone who doesn't have those cross-reactive cells,\" said Marion Pepper, an immunologist at the University of Washington who is studying the immune responses of Covid-19 patients. \"That's what we're all hoping for.\"\n\nT cells are an exceptionally picky bunch. Each spends the entirety of its life waiting for a very specific trigger, like a hunk of a dangerous virus. Once that switch is flipped, the T cell will clone itself into an army of specialized soldiers, all with their sights set on the same target. Some T cells are microscopic assassins, tailor-made to home in on and destroy infected cells; others coax immune cells called B cells into producing virus-attacking antibodies.\n\nThe first time a virus infects the body, this response is sluggish; it takes several days for the immune system to sort out which T cells are best suited for the job at hand. But subsequent encounters typically prompt a response that is stronger and faster, thanks to a reserve force of T cells, called memory T cells, that lingers after the initial threat has passed and can quickly be called into action again.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-06T21:21:16.061Z Negotiators are meeting to try and break the stimulus stalemate after Trump again threatens to act on his own. Ohio's governor tests positive before a planned Trump meeting. Two days ago, he offered a stark virus warning. Trump signs an executive order to encourage American manufacturing of critical health care supplies. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nUsually, this process operates best when T cells must battle the same pathogen again and again. But these recruits are more flexible than they are often given credit for, said Laura Su, an immunologist and T cell expert at the University of Pennsylvania. Should these cells chance upon something that bears a strong resemblance to their germ of choice, they can still be roused to fight, even if the invader is a total newcomer.\n\nIn theory, cross-reactive T cells can \"protect almost like a vaccine,\" said Smita Iyer, an immunologist at the University of California, Davis, who is studying immune responses to the new coronavirus in primates. Previous studies have shown that cross-reactive T cells may guard people against different strains of the flu virus, and perhaps confer a trace of immunity against dengue and Zika viruses, which share a family tree.\n\nThe case for coronaviruses is less clear cut, said Alessandro Sette, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology who has led several studies examining cross-reactive T cells to the new coronavirus. Researchers have found people in the United States, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore and the United Kingdom who have never been exposed to the new coronavirus but who carry T cells that react to it in the lab.\n\nResearchers are eager to understand the history of these T cells, because that might help reveal who is more likely to have them. A growing body of evidence, including data published this week in Science by Dr. Sette and his colleagues, points to common-cold coronaviruses as a potential source. But even unrelated viruses can share similar features, and researchers may never know for sure what originally \"drove their development,\" said Avery August, an immunologist and T cell expert at Cornell University.\n\nWhatever the origin of T cells, their mere existence could be encouraging news. There is much more to the immune system than T cells, but even a semblance of pre-existing immunity could mean that people who have recently grappled with the common cold may have an easier time fighting off a nastier member of the coronavirus clan.\n\nCross-reactive T cells alone probably would not be enough to completely stave off infection or disease. But they might alleviate symptoms of the coronavirus in people who happen to carry these cells, or extend the protection provided by a vaccine.\n\n\"That would be awesome,\" Dr. Iyer said.\n\nChildren, who share lots of germs with their peers, might be good candidates for this hypothetical scenario.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue.

For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nBut cross-reactive T cells are not necessarily a benevolent force. They could instead be ineffectual souvenirs of infections past, with \"absolutely no relevance\" to how well people fare against the new coronavirus, Dr. Sette said.\n\nThere is even a small chance that pre-existing T cells could raise the risk for serious symptoms of Covid-19, although experts consider this possibility unlikely. T cells that are primed to recognize common-cold coronaviruses might marshal only a lackluster response to the current coronavirus, potentially sapping resources from other populations of immune cells that have a better shot at defeating the new invader. \"Now you have your immune system distracted,\" Dr. Iyer said.\n\nT cells are also expert orchestrators. Depending on the signals they send out, they can synchronize cells and molecules from disparate parts of the immune system into a tag-teamed attack, or quell these assaults to return the body to baseline. If it turns out that cross-reactive T cells tend toward quieting the response, they could suppress a person's immune defense before it has a chance to kick into gear, Dr. August said.\n\nThen again, many types of T cells exist, and all operate as part of a complex immune system. \"It's almost like some people are trying to say this is 'good' or 'bad,'\" Dr. Su said. \"It's probably more nuanced than that.\"\n\nTeasing it all apart will not be easy. Unlike antibodies, which are inanimate proteins that often circulate in the blood, T cells are living cells that often hole up in hard-to-reach tissues. That makes them much more difficult to extract, maintain and analyze, Dr. Pepper said.\n\nResearchers could learn more by testing whether cross-reactive T cells are more abundant in patients who have had mild or serious cases of Covid-19, although such studies cannot prove cause and effect. A more laborious effort might involve measuring cross-reactive T cell levels in large groups of healthy people, then waiting to see if they became infected or sick from the current coronavirus, Dr. Sette said.\n\nStrong evidence could also come from an animal model, like the rhesus macaques that Dr. Iyer studies in her lab. Researchers could dose primates with common-cold coronaviruses, and then see how their immune responses stack up against the new coronavirus.\n\nLess than a year into this pandemic, plenty of questions remain unanswered, Dr. Pepper said. Immunologists cannot fully forecast how the human immune system will respond to this new virus; even with science at its speediest, that interaction must be studied in real time.\n\nIt's a frustrating reality, Dr. Pepper said: \"Until we see it in real life, we just don't know.\"",

In May, Shor tweeted a summary of a new academic paper about the 1968 election by Omar Wasow of Princeton. The paper found that nonviolent protests tended to increase the Democratic vote share in surrounding areas that year, while riots tended to decrease it.\n\nSome other progressives accused Shor of insensitively focusing on the wrong problem: the political reaction to riots, rather than the underlying racism and socioeconomic problems that helped cause those riots. His employer -- Civis Analytics, a liberal research firm -- quickly fired him. (For a longer summary, see The Times's Michelle Goldberg or Vox's Matthew Yglesias.)\n\nThe episode was essentially a struggle over whether progressives should worry about political strategy or almost always side with the victims of injustice, regardless of tactics. Shor's detractors thought he was blaming the victims -- and \"concern trolling,\" by undermining the more important debate, as the podcast host Benjamin Dixon wrote. Shor's defenders thought his detractors cared more about looking virtuous than defeating racism.\n\nIt is a debate with obvious relevance to the 2020 campaign.\n\nNo one can know for sure, but there is evidence suggesting that violent protests -- like the ones this week in Kenosha, Wis., in response to the police shooting of a Black man in the back -- help the politician whom many protesters most despise: President Trump.\n\nTrump himself clearly believes this, having organized much of his campaign around highlighting (and sometimes lying about) riots. Polling has shown that most voters support nonviolent protest while most oppose violent protest.\n\nCriticizing any protest of police misconduct is fraught for progressives today. That's especially true when the conduct is as brutal as it appears to have been in Kenosha.\n\nBut the reality is that nights like the last two -- when an American city has been on fire -- seem to be precisely what Trump wants to campaign on. And there is another option available to people outraged by what happened in Kenosha. After all, nonviolent protest -- as the overwhelming majority of recent protests have been -- has a long record of political effectiveness.\n\nIn other Kenosha developments:\n\nJacob Blake -- the man shot by police -- is partially paralyzed from a bullet that severed his spinal cord, his family said Tuesday. His mother, Julia Jackson, said she opposed the destruction of the recent protests: \"It doesn't reflect my son or my family.\"\n\nProtesters threw water bottles, rocks and fireworks at the police last night, and the police responded with tear gas and rubber bullets. In a confrontation near a gas station -- the details of which are not yet clear -- three people were shot, two of them fatally, police said.\n\nKenosha is the fourth-largest city in the state that may be the single most likely to determine the election. Both Joe Biden and Trump will struggle to win the Electoral College without Wisconsin.\n\nTWO MORE BIG STORIES1. R.N.C. softens Trump's image\n\nThe Republican National Convention found a softer tone on its second night, presenting Trump as a champion of women and criminal justice reform. The message seemed aimed at suburban voters, a group Trump won in 2016 but is in danger of losing this year, The Times's Lisa Lerer and Sydney Ember write.\n\nUnlike past conventions, this one is using the trappings of presidential power -- like the White House -- as a backdrop. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo delivered an address from Jerusalem, breaking a longstanding norm that State Department officials don't involve themselves in electoral politics.\n\nHere's a five-minute video summarizing last night. And here are fact checks, from The Times and from FactCheck.org.\n\nWhat political analysts are saying:\n\n\"I found Night Two to be more tonally consistent and accessible for people [who] haven't fully gulped the kool-aid. More creating a permission structure to support the ticket and less of the audience of one stuff,\" tweeted Liam Donovan, a Republican strategist.\n\n\"We got about maybe 15% of voters watching this stuff. Most of whom are hardcore partisans in one of the most stable races ever,\" CNN's Harry Enten wrote.\n\nWhat happens in the next 69 days will matter more than anything done/said these last 2 weeks,\" Amy Walter of the Cook Political Report predicted.\n\nThe convention is \"conjuring an entirely different\" version of Trump from the real one, the Times columnist Frank Bruni wrote. And other Times Opinion writers covered the night's best and worst moments.\n\nIsland outbreaks\n\nU.S. islands in the Caribbean and the Pacific -- which largely avoided early coronavirus outbreaks -- are emerging as new hot spots. Hawaii now ranks among the states where new cases are growing fastest, and the U.S. Virgin Islands is halting tourism for a month.\n\nIn other virus developments:\n\nThe Gaza Strip recorded its first known cases of community transmission. Many worry the pandemic could spread quickly in the densely populated area.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has quietly modified its testing guidelines saying that people without symptoms do not need to be tested. Experts challenged the revision, noting that many people are most contagious before the onset of symptoms.\n\nHere are the latest maps and tables tracking the virus in every U.S. state.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nTwo retired players sued the N.F.L., claiming the league \"explicitly and deliberately\" discriminated against Black players when making payments related to head injuries.\n\nHurricane Laura is strengthening as it nears the Gulf Coast. Powerful winds and rain could begin in Texas and Louisiana as early as this afternoon.\n\nAmerican Airlines said it would cut up to 19,000 workers on Oct. 1 amid an ongoing slump in air travel.\n\nJerry Falwell Jr. is officially out as president and chancellor of Liberty University, the influential evangelical institution, after a chaotic 48 hours in which Falwell resigned amid a sex scandal but later changed his mind. Many students expressed relief.\n\nFlash floods in northern Afghanistan killed scores of people, and officials expect the death toll to rise.\n\nLives Lived: Hee Sook Lee spent long nights developing her secret recipe for Korean soondubu, a steaming bowl of soft tofu in a spicy broth. It helped her restaurant, BCD Tofu House in Los Angeles, become a chain with 13 restaurants in 12 cities. She died at 61.\n\nIDEA OF THE DAY: Baby bonds\n\nNew Jersey may be on the verge of enacting a policy that some experts believe should be the future of anti-poverty policy: baby bonds.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy has proposed giving babies from roughly the bottom 70 percent of the income distribution a $1,000 nest egg, payable with interest when the child turns 18. The money could then be used to help pay for college or a home. The proposal requires approval by New Jersey's legislature, which Democrats control.\n\nMurphy's plan is a scaled-down version of a federal plan that Senator Cory Booker put at the center of his presidential campaign last year. Booker has argued that baby bonds have the political advantage of being race-neutral -- while also significantly closing the country's racial wealth gap. Many young Black adults today have few assets.\n\nIn a recent Times essay, Jason DeParle -- a reporter who has been covering poverty for decades -- explained why many experts believe that cash grants are the most promising tool for fighting poverty: \"Subsidizing the incomes of poor families leads their children on average to better health, more schooling and higher earnings as adults.\" Joe Biden has yet to take a position on the idea, Jason noted.\n\nPLAY, WATCH, EAT, READA deal on dinner\n\nThe British government has an audacious plan to bring people back to restaurants and help the limping economy: Half-off meals. Her Majesty's Government has stepped in to cover 50 percent of any diner's bill, up to 10 pounds (or about $13), on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.\n\nIt seems to be working. Restaurant sales have surged. The government has now helped pay for almost as many meals (64 million) as Britain has people (67 million).\n\nIn honor of this bit of policy creativity, we suggest you cook some modern British food at home. A one-pot chicken braised with potatoes and pine nuts is an easy weeknight jet-set to Rochelle Canteen, a hip garden restaurant in London's Shoreditch neighborhood. For dessert, try Lime, Mint and Rum Tarts from Yotam Ottolenghi, a pastry homage to a mojito.\n\nThe latest in nonfiction\n\nSeveral big nonfiction books are out this week, as The Times Book Review notes:\n\n\"His Truth Is Marching On,\" by Jon Meacham, is an examination of the life of John Lewis and a \"welcome reminder of the heroic sacrifices\" made by young civil rights activists in the 1960s.\n\n\"El Jefe,\" by Alan Feuer, a reporter on The Times's Metro desk, is a \"lively, clear and endlessly fascinating\" tale of the effort to capture the drug kingpin known as El Chapo.\n\n\"Hoax,\" by the CNN journalist Brian Stelter, is a \"thorough and damning exploration of the incestuous relationship\" between Trump and Fox News.\n\nThe Met is back -- with some changes\n\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art will reopen to the public on Saturday, five months after the coronavirus forced its closure. But visiting the Met will look a bit different than it used to.\n\nVisitors will need timed tickets and will have their temperatures taken before they're allowed inside. Occupancy and hours will be reduced. Exhibits too small to allow social distancing will stay closed. And, in a museum first, valet parking for bicycles will be available, to help people who choose to avoid mass transit.\n\nDiversions\n\nAn illustrated guide to a lesser-known part of the suffragists' legacy: redefining what a woman \"should\" look like.\n\nThe late-night comedy hosts continued to follow the Republican convention, focusing on its revisionist history.\n\nGames\n\nHere's today's Mini Crossword, and a clue: Punctuation mark on which a 2008 Supreme Court case about the Second Amendment hinged (five letters).\n\nYou can find all of our puzzles here.\n\nThanks for spending part of your morning with The Times. See you tomorrow. -- David\n\nP.S. I described Reason magazine as a conservative publication in yesterday's newsletter. Libertarian is a better description, as a few readers pointed out.\n\nYou can see today's print front page here.\n\nToday's episode of \"The Daily\" is about Trump's law-and-order campaign strategy.\n\nMelina Delkic, Amelia Nierenberg and Ian Prasad Philbrick contributed to The Morning.

        "body": "Much of this summer, an influencer named Emily Gellis Lande has been on a campaign, posting on Instagram dozens of times a day about the dangers of a diet called F-Factor.\n\nMs. Gellis, 34, has never been on the diet. She relays anonymous stories from women who say that after beginning the diet they experience long-lasting rashes, intense cramps, even indications of metal poisoning, and that the diet encourages disordered eating.\n\nThe stories are anonymous, she said, because the women are afraid to criticize Tanya Zuckerbrot, the Instagram-famous registered dietitian who created the diet.\n\nMs. Zuckerbrot, 48, has built a substantial business around the diet, with clients who have paid as much as $25,000 for her help in getting on the high-fiber diet. She has a product line of powders and bars and books that lay out her systems.\n\nAnd she has extreme wealth that she puts on ample display. She has a $22 million Park Avenue apartment and an Instagram account loaded with bikini beach-bod photos taken in luxurious spots like Dubai and the Seychelles.\n\nBut now, since Ms. Gellis's campaign began, Ms. Zuckerbrot and her husband, Anthony Westreich, a corporate real estate investor, have been harassed and defamed, she said. She has brought in lawyers. On Sunday afternoon, she hired Lanny Davis, once the White House special counsel to former President Bill Clinton; his client list more recently includes Michael Cohen.\n\nMs. Zuckerbrot said that, with 176,000 purchase orders since she began selling the powders and bars two years ago, she has received just 50 complaints about gastric distress or rashes.\n\nMs. Zuckerbrot said her diet and products are safe; she questioned Ms. Gellis's authority.\n\n\"I believe in her mind she thinks she's helping people and that the lifestyle I lead is poisoning everyone and giving them anorexia,\" Ms. Zuckerbrot said of her online antagonist. \"But she's a fashion blogger. She doesn't work for the World Health Organization. If this was Barbara Walters or John Stossel, maybe I would have paid attention sooner. But this is a young woman who has no credential in health and wellness or any medical or clinical experience. The girl sells clothing for a living.\"\n\nMs. Zuckerbrot's success has come from making the diet more than a weight loss rule book. It's a lifestyle -- she said she has worked with Megyn Kelly and Katie Couric and is the official dietitian to the Miss Universe Organization -- with the attendant merch.\n\nAmong the half-shirts and sweatshirts sold on the diet's website, there is an F-Factor \"intentions bracelet,\" to be worn on the \"hand that will either undermine your intentions or honor them\" as it \"holds the fork, reaches for the bread basket or dips into the candy dish.\" It costs $18.\n\nMs. Gellis said that she did not anticipate that her posts would spiral. \"Never in my life did I imagine I would be wrapped up in the story line I am right now,\" she said. But in receiving messages from hundreds of women, and speaking on the phone with many of them about their physical and emotional pain, \"I realized I simply could not let them down,\" she said.\n\n\"I wish the F-Factor team would acknowledge that pain,\" she said. \"But that's simply not how this story goes.\"\n\nAnonymous Sources\n\nMs. Gellis, who posts about easygoing, moderately priced outfits and cosmetics, was inspired to action by an anonymous Instagram post from someone who said she was a former client of Ms. Zuckerbrot's. That client said she had been told she should consider going off antidepressants because they could be contributing to weight retention or gain.\n\n\"This is a lie, this never happened and it never would happen,\" Ms. Zuckerbrot said.\n\nAfter seeing the Instagram post, Ms. Gellis flipped on her camera to make videos about the importance of mental health care and doctor-prescribed antidepressants. Soon, she found that the more she posted about F-Factor, the more dieters she heard from -- women who agreed that Ms. Gellis could share their experiences if she just kept their names private. \"I got this onslaught of messages from people,\" she said.\n\nSome women who fed Ms. Gellis tips recounted their stories to The New York Times. One said she was 32 when she went on the diet and within a month developed abdominal pain so severe that she went to the doctor and to the emergency room and underwent two CT scans. (She shared her F-Factor receipts and medical records with The Times.)\n\nAnother woman, who said she was underweight, paid $20,000 to become Ms. Zuckerbrot's client. (She also shared her receipts.) The regimented nature of the program exacerbated her issues with food, she said, and after eight months of drinking shakes made with the F-Factor powder, the woman developed excruciating red spots that required a biopsy.\n\nBoth these women said these symptoms disappeared when they stopped the diet.\n\nMs. Zuckerbrot said she rarely accepts underweight clients. Via her lawyer Mr. Davis, she named two previous clients who matched the description of the underweight woman, and provided their weight and health details, saying that in both cases she helped the women gain, not lose, weight.\n\n\"I don't understand why people would not come forward publicly if they believe my product has hurt them,\" Ms. Zuckerbrot said.\n\nProbably the two most distressing charges received by Ms. Gellis was that the diet and its products caused women to miscarry. This accusation was also published by The New York Post, Refinery 29 and PerezHilton.com.\n\nBut one of those tips, at least, was a sting.\n\nAfter Ms. Gellis and others published about miscarriage, Ms. Zuckerbrot and Eva Chen, an Instagram executive, received an email saying the story was fake and taking credit for the trick, from the address crazycancelculture@gmail.com.\n\n\"It is a FULL OUT LIE,\" the email said. \"I have never used Tanya's products.\" The writer included a video documenting her exchange with Ms. Gellis.\n\nThe miscarriage story and confession email was sent by Alison Brettschneider, 44, a former Instagram influencer herself and the daughter of the civil rights lawyer Alan Hirshman, who died of complications of Covid-19 in April. As her email address indicates, she sees herself as a soldier in a culture war over publishing on social media the stories of anonymous sources -- describing the \"trend\" as \"irresponsible and dangerous,\" her email said.\n\nShe is no stranger to Instagram strife. Back in the summer of 2018, Rachel Cargle, a public academic, asked her followers to tag their favorite white feminists who hadn't made note of the death of Nia Wilson, a young Black woman who was stabbed to death in a BART station in California.\n\nMs. Brettschneider was tagged and then became the subject of the conversation by making it a \"circus,\" Ms. Cargle wrote, turning \"the post into many many things including white savior complex, white tears, exceptionalism, performance activism, guilt projection and all over white privilege.\"\n\nMs. Brettschneider is still fuming about it. \"I'm the last person who is racist,\" she said on the phone, while driving her children in the Hamptons. \"I'm like AOC. My whole Instagram was known for speaking up.\" Early this year, she said, she'd spent a month in Alabama trying to prevent the execution of Nathaniel Woods.\n\nBut last fall, Ms. Brettschneider said, her Instagram account was disabled without notice. She immediately reached out to higher-ups at Instagram and was told it was because of three posts that had violated their guidelines. \"They said my language was bullying,\" she said.\n\nShe is now suing Instagram. Her lawyer is Lauren Faraino, who represented Mr. Woods. (Instagram declined to comment on the specifics.)\n\nWhy did she send the email? Ms. Brettschneider said she couldn't stand by silently and watch Ms. Zuckerbrot be attacked by anonymous sources, even knowing she may be attacked herself when her trick was revealed. \"Someone has to sacrifice themselves,\" she said.\n\nAs it happens, she is also no stranger to Ms. Zuckerbrot. Her cousin, Amanda Karp, is F-Factor's head dietitian.\n\n\"If someone makes up a lie in order to discredit the voices of thousands of women who have suffered, in order to be a part of an Upper East Side 'cool moms' clique, I think that speaks to exactly what that person stands for,\" Ms. Gellis said. \"This isn't 'Mean Girls.' This isn't high school. There are women's lives on the line.\"\n\nThe Crackers\n\nThe diet begins with a maximum of 1,200 calories and a lot of fiber. Dieters are allowed a handful of GG crackers daily -- the Scandinavian bran crispbread that identifies F-Factor enthusiasts. Dieters graduate to additional steps that add more carbohydrates -- and adhere to the \"Three Bite Rule.\" (You may have three bites of any indulgence.)\n\nElizabeth Savetsky, an influencer, has been doing F-Factor since becoming a client of Ms. Zuckerbrot's in 2018. \"I had heard amazing things about it from my fellow mamas on the Upper East Side,\" Ms. Savetsky, 34, wrote in an email. She said she'd experienced a second pregnancy loss and was suffering with other health issues. On the diet, she said, her \"lifelong issues around food went out the window.\"\n\nMs. Savetsky's fees were waived by F-Factor in exchange for sharing her \"journey on social media,\" said Mr. Davis, an arrangement that ended in June, 2019.\n\nMedical professionals have had concerns about the diet for years, said Dr. Tom Hildebrandt, the chief of the Center of Excellence in Eating and Weight Disorders at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai.\n\n\"Our patient population is particularly vulnerable to diets with highly branded promises,\" he said. The messaging is particularly concerning \"when you match it with a diet like this one that requires you to eat very little nutrition and to approach food in a very regimented, controlled way.\"\n\nMs. Zuckerbrot questioned the doctor's sincerity and concern. \"Why hasn't he reached out to me and said, 'Tanya, your program is harming people? If he has such altruistic motivations, why hasn't he reached out to me?\"\n\nShe also pointed out that the back cover of her diet book is heaped with praise from doctors. (\"Tanya's scholarly approach is a gift that gives forever,\" said Dr. Jerome Zacks, a cardiologist and associate clinical professor at the Mount Sinai Health System, in one blurb. \"Her contribution to preventive health care is immeasurable.\")\n\nTwo former staff members of her clinic spoke about their time with Ms. Zuckerbrot. Alix Turoff, now a registered dietitian, worked as an intern in 2009. She credits Ms. Zuckerbrot as an inspiration, but also said that the culture inside the office, where she said dressing up in heels and form-fitting clothes was encouraged and eating a lot was not, created the foundation for the work the dietitians did with clients.\n\n\"The culture was a pursuit of thinness at any cost,\" she said.\n\nIn her own practice now, Ms. Turoff said, she sees many patients wanting help to create normal eating habits after trying, sometimes for years, to live the F-Factor way. \"They often are in patterns of bingeing.\"\n\nMs. Zuckerbrot shared a Dropbox folder with 53 social media videos and screenshots of text message exchanges between her and Ms. Turoff that document Ms. Turoff's appreciation of opportunities offered by Ms. Zuckerbrot and detailed Ms. Turoff's recommendation to her own clients to try a high-fiber diet.\n\nLisa Moskovitz, a registered dietitian, also worked for Ms. Zuckerbrot, about 10 years ago. \"I learned a lot from her,\" Ms. Moskovitz said. \"She is an incredible businesswoman.\"\n\nShe said the values around glamorized wealth and extreme thinness have only been proselytized wider as Ms. Zuckerbrot's renown has grown.\n\n\"With any type of diet or nutritional advice on social media, it is so easy to get caught up in the idea of the life it can give you,\" Ms. Moskovitz said.\n\n\"You have to understand, she and anyone you see on social media and in the broader media, if they look a certain way, it is not because they're eating fiber,\" she said. \"It's genetics and various other things that can be bought and Photoshopped.\"\n\nMs. Zuckerbrot said she had fired Ms. Moskovitz.\n\n\"We did not share the same philosophy,\" Ms. Moskovitz said.\n\nAwaiting the Lab Results\n\nCritics of the F-Factor, including Ms. Gellis and her supporters, have asked Ms. Zuckerbrot to release a certificate of analysis -- a statement from a third-party lab confirming a product has been tested for contaminants like microbes, pesticides and heavy metals.\n\nMs. Zuckerbrot had repeatedly declined, saying the information is proprietary, but now says she will release the information \"in days, not weeks.\"\n\n\"Because of all the misinformation and accusations of high levels of lead,\" she said, \"our true customers are now concerned.\"\n\nShe also said -- via Mr. Davis -- that this experience has led her to believe she should be \"more thoughtful about the images I have showed about myself and my lifestyle\" and she planned to be more mindful in the future. \"The goal of my message is to always look and feel your personal best regardless of weight because you are so much more than a number on a scale,\" she said.\n\nFor her part, Ms. Gellis is asking her followers to mail her samples of Ms. Zuckerbrot's products bought before the public scrutiny on their safety began, and plans to have those products tested.\n\nMs. Gellis was on vacation in August in Montauk, N.Y. with her husband, Michael Lande, but didn't take a break from her Instagram campaign. \"Trust me, I haven't even scraped the surface of how much this person sucks,\" Ms. Gellis said on Instagram this week (adding a profanity). She promised there was more to come. \"Honestly it's gossip but like I'm pretty sure a lot of it is true.\"\n\nShe is inflamed by what she sees as Ms. Zuckerbrot's refusal to acknowledge that perhaps the women registering complaints, anonymously or not, are credible.\n\n\"At first I was like, 'What the hell is she doing?\" Mr. Lande said of his wife's avocation. \"'Why is she getting involved?' Then I started reading these stories from these poor girls with body dysphoria and all sorts of physical problems, and I changed my mind. There needs to be some discourse on this diet. Ultimately, I feel like my wife has become a modern-era Erin Brockovich.\"",

        "body": "Want to get The Morning by email? Here's the sign-up.\n\nGood morning. Pro athletes stage a boycott. The R.N.C. focuses on chaos. And Hurricane Laura makes landfall.\n\nHurricane Laura shares something in common with both Hurricane Florence, a 2018 storm that killed 52 Americans, and Hurricane Katrina, which struck Louisiana 15 years ago this week. All three changed from more typical hurricanes into severe ones in just a day or two.\n\nThat kind of rapid intensification -- to use the scientific term for it -- used to be rare. In recent years, it has become more common.\n\nAnd that change is a useful summary of the how climate change is, and is not, affecting hurricanes.\n\nThe warming of the planet doesn't seem to have increased the frequency of hurricanes. But it has increased their severity, scientists say. Storms draw their energy from the ocean, and warmer water provides more energy. Warmer air, in turn, can carry more water, increasing rainfall and flooding.\n\nSince the 1990s, the frequency of extreme hurricanes -- either Category 4 or 5 -- has roughly doubled in the Atlantic Ocean. No single storm is solely a result of climate change, of course. Yet climate change is leading to more storms like Laura.\n\nThe scariest part of the trend is that it isn't over. Climate change acts slowly. The destruction sweeping across Louisiana and Texas this morning will probably be even more common in the future than it is today.\n\nMore on the storm:\n\nLaura made landfall as a Category 4 storm early this morning near the Louisiana-Texas border. The National Hurricane Center called the expected storm surge \"unsurvivable,\" and said that it could push 40 miles inland.\n\nIn a broader policy move, the federal government has begun giving up on protecting some flood-prone communities. It will instead use tax dollars to relocate those communities -- a policy once dismissed as too radical.\n\nSaturday will be the 15th anniversary of Katrina making landfall in Louisiana. In an essay, Talmon Joseph Smith, a Times editor and New Orleans native, has reflected on the storm and calls its lessons \"unlearned.\"\n\nTHREE MORE BIG STORIES1. More Kenosha fallout\n\nProfessional sports seasons seemed in doubt, as athletes staged walkouts to protest the shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man who was partly paralyzed after a white police officer shot him in Kenosha, Wis., this week.\n\nThe N.B.A.'s Milwaukee Bucks boycotted their playoff game yesterday, which quickly led to the cancellation of other N.B.A. games, as well as events in the W.N.B.A. and professional baseball, soccer and tennis. Players on the N.B.A.'s two Los Angeles teams have voted to cancel the rest of the season, according to The Athletic, and the league's players and owners will meet separately today to make decisions, according to ESPN.\n\nMurder charges: Wisconsin authorities arrested Kyle Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old white Illinois resident, and charged him with first-degree intentional homicide in the shooting of two protesters on Tuesday. Rittenhouse had often posted on social media in support of the police and considered himself a militia member, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.\n\nThe Times's visual investigations team analyzed hours of footage to follow Rittenhouse's movements in the moments leading up to the shootings.\n\nHere are the latest Kenosha developments.\n\n2. Night 3 of the R.N.C.\n\nRepublicans used the third night of their convention to continue warning about violence and lawlessness, trying to capitalize on the unrest in Wisconsin. \"The hard truth is, you won't be safe in Joe Biden's America,\" Vice President Mike Pence said in the keynote speech.\n\nPence also defended the Trump's administration's handling of the coronavirus, often in misleading ways.\n\nHere's a five-minute video summarizing last night.\n\nWhat political analysts are saying:\n\n\"America right now has: deadly pandemic, massive unemployment and recession, schools unable to open, protests over racial injustice, a killer hurricane bearing down on the South... And I am watching Mike Pence talk about how bad things would be in Joe Biden's America,\" The New Yorker's Susan Glasser wrote.\n\nRamesh Ponnuru of National Review: \"The most consistent message of tonight is that Trump is warm and caring, despite what you may think. I can see his aides looking at the polls and saying, We've got to improve his numbers on this.\"\n\nTimes Opinion writers covered the night's best and worst moments.\n\n3. Behind the C.D.C. change\n\nOfficials in the Trump administration told the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to begin discouraging people without symptoms from being tested, two federal health officials said Wednesday. President Trump has long complained that the U.S. does too much testing, returning high numbers of infections that make the country look bad.\n\nScientists say the revision is a dangerous step back for a country still struggling to contain the virus -- and hoping to reopen schools.\n\nIn other virus developments:\n\nThe Times surveyed more than 1,500 U.S. colleges and universities to build a database of campus outbreaks.\n\nOlder men are up to twice as likely to become severely sick and die from Covid-19 as women of the same age.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nBrenton Tarrant, an Australian who last year murdered 51 Muslims at two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, was sentenced to life in prison without any chance of parole. It's the first time a New Zealand court has imposed such a sentence.\n\nKevin Mayer said he would resign as the chief executive of TikTok, less than four months after joining the video app. The Trump administration has ordered the Chinese-owned company to sell its U.S. operations.\n\nThe Navy is investigating a sailor for arson in the fire that engulfed the warship U.S.S. Bonhomme Richard in July.\n\nThe Justice Department executed Lezmond Mitchell, the only Native American man on federal death row, against the wishes of Navajo leaders. He was the fourth person to be executed since the Trump administration resumed federal capital punishment last year.\n\nLives Lived: Angela Buxton was a white, Jewish Englishwoman. Her doubles partner in tennis, Althea Gibson, was a Black American. In the elite, segregated world of 1950s tennis, they forged a remarkable, Wimbledon-winning friendship. Buxton died at 85.\n\nIDEA OF THE DAY: Ethnic studies\n\nSeveral universities have recently required students to take at least one class in ethnic studies -- the academic discipline that studies race and racism, focusing on the experiences of people of color. The list includes Emory, Pittsburgh and California State, which is the country's largest public system.\n\nSome students at other universities are agitating for similar requirements, while others are criticizing the move. Here's an overview of the debate.\n\nWhat's the case for requiring it? In short, empathy. Students who study a different culture's accomplishments, traditions and struggles are more likely to understand them -- and to understand racism and prejudice, too. That's a crucial part of the broad knowledge that a bachelor's degree should provide, advocates say.\n\n\"History is not just about memorizing facts. It's about developing character,\" Shirley Weber, the California Assembly member who proposed the legislative change, has said.\n\nWhat's the case against? Bias, basically. Skeptics argue that the current definition of ethnic studies excludes some minority groups -- Jewish, Hindu and Korean organizations have lodged a complaint about California's curriculum -- and is closer to jargon-filled left-wing propaganda than a rigorous academic field.\n\nCourse materials can be \"progressive to the point of self-parody,\" Kevin Kiley, a Republican member of the California Assembly, has said.\n\nThe history: Code Switch, an NPR podcast, explored the long and bloody student strike to establish the first ethnic studies department in the country, at a San Francisco commuter college 50 years ago.\n\nPLAY, WATCH, EAT, LAUGHMake your own chile oil\n\nIn May, we told you where to buy chile oil. Now, we're here to tell you how to make it. Tonight, mix together J. Kenji L\u00f3pez-Alt's Sichuan Chile Oil, a vermilion slick that's as much tingle as taste. Tomorrow, after it has infused, serve it over ramen with charred scallions and green beans for a quick and aromatic vegan meal.\n\nHollywood's new generation\n\nWhen the pandemic forced celebrities off the streets of Los Angeles, the paparazzi struggled to snap photos of A-listers running even the most mundane of errands. So Fletcher Greene decided to focus his camera on one Hollywood group still venturing out and throwing wild parties: the influencers of TikTok and YouTube.\n\nComedy moves outdoors\n\nNew York City's comedy clubs remain closed, but comedy hasn't stopped: Stand-ups are performing in gardens, parks and on rooftops, and hundreds of people are coming out to watch.\n\n\"Performing live comedy in New York right now is like selling beer during Prohibition,\" writes The Times's Jason Zinoman. \"It's outlawed and everyone's doing it.\"\n\nDiversions\n\nRemember \"MTV Cribs\"? Take a nostalgic look back at early seasons of the show that took us into the gaudy homes of celebrities.\n\nThe late-night comedy hosts (with the exception of Stephen Colbert) again watched the Republican convention.\n\nGames\n\nHere's today's Mini Crossword, and a clue: Mars is the Roman god of it (three letters).\n\nYou can find all of our puzzles here.\n\nThanks for spending part of your morning with The Times. See you tomorrow. -- David\n\nP.S.

        "body": "TOKYO -- Japan's economy shrank at annual rate of 27.8% in April-June, the worst contraction on record, as the coronavirus pandemic slammed consumption and trade, according to government data released Monday.\n\nThe Cabinet Office reported that Japan's preliminary seasonally adjusted real gross domestic product, or GDP, the sum of a nation's goods and services, fell 7.8% quarter on quarter.\n\nThe annual rate shows what the number would have been if continued for a year.\n\nJapanese media reported the latest drop was the worst since World War II. But the Cabinet Office said comparable records began in 1980. The previous worst contraction was during the global financial crisis of 2009.\n\nThe world's third largest economy was already ailing when the virus outbreak struck late last year. The fallout has since gradually worsened both in COVID-19 cases and social distancing restrictions.\n\n___\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\n-- The first Mediterranean cruise sets sail after virus tests.\n\n-- High schools are facing tough choices about football season.\n\n-- The coronavirus doesn't appear to have devastated homeless people as initially feared.\n\n-- Workers returning to offices after months will see lots of changes, including masks, staggered shifts, spaced-apart desks and daily health questions.\n\n-- AP PHOTOS: Masks hold images of pandemic, Hong Kong protests.\n\n___\n\n-- Follow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\n___\n\nHERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING:\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 197 newly confirmed cases of the coronavirus, the fourth straight day of triple-digit daily increases, as health workers scramble to slow transmissions in the greater capital area where churches have emerged as major sources of infections.\n\nThe figures announced by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Monday brought the national caseload to 15,515, including 305 deaths. The country reported 279 new COVID-19 cases on Sunday, its biggest single-day jump since early May, as government officials expressed concerns about a massive outbreak in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.\n\n___\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Monday chose to delay New Zealand's national elections by four weeks as the country deals with a new coronavirus outbreak in its largest city, Auckland. The election had been scheduled for Sept. 19 but will now be held on Oct. 17. Under New Zealand law, Ardern had the option of delaying the election for up to about two months. Opposition parties had been requesting a delay after the virus outbreak in Auckland last week prompted the government to put the city into a two-week lockdown and halted election campaigning. Ardern said she wouldn't consider delaying the election again, no matter what was happening with any virus outbreaks. Opinion polling indicates Ardern's liberal Labour Party is favored to win a second term in office.\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia: Australia's hard-hit Victoria state on Monday recorded its deadliest day of the pandemic with 25 coronavirus fatalities.\n\nThe death toll surpasses the previous 24-hour record of 21 set on Wednesday last week.\n\nVictoria's Health Department recorded 282 new cases, slightly more than 279 new infections posted on Sunday but maintaining a downward trend over the past week.\n\nVictoria posted a record 725 new COVID-19 cases in a day on Aug. 5.\n\n___\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon, still grappling with the aftermath of the Aug. 4 blast that killed 180 people and wounded thousands, has registered a record daily number of coronavirus infections, with 439 people contracting the virus and six fatalities.\n\nThe new infections bring to 8,881 the total number of people reported infected in the small country of just over 5 million. Some 103 have died because of COVID-19.\n\nThe explosion at Beirut's port was set off when thousands of tons of ammonium nitrate ignited, injuring about 6,000 people and causing widespread damage across the city. Daily coronavirus cases had already been on the rise, and the explosion made social distancing more difficult for many.\n\nLebanon's health sector has been challenged by the pandemic that hit amid a deepening economic crisis. The blast that hit in Beirut's center knocked out at least three hospitals in the capital and greatly increased pressure on those still operating.\n\n___\n\nROME -- Vacationers arriving in Rome from four Mediterranean countries lined up with their suitcases at Leonardo da Vinci airport to be immediately tested for the new coronavirus on Sunday.\n\nLast week, Italy's health minister issued an ordinance requiring the tests for all travelers arriving in Italy from Croatia, Greece, Malta or Spain.\n\nTravelers have the option of being tested instead within 48 hours of arrival at local public health offices closer to their home or destination in Italy.\n\nVacationers coming from abroad are fueling an increase in new coronavirus infections in Italy in recent weeks. On Saturday, the daily caseload of new infections topped 600 for the first time since May.\n\nAlessio D'Amato, health commissioner for Lazio, the region including Rome, said at the airport that concern was mounting about the rising number of infections, especially since school resumes in Italy on Sept. 14, for the first time since the pandemic began.\n\n___\n\nLA PAZ, Bolivia -- Esther Morales, the 70-year-old sister of former Bolivian President Evo Morales, has died of COVID-19, the ex-leader said Sunday.\n\n\"She was like my mother,\" tweeted Morales, who was forced to resign last year after an election marred by irregularities.\n\nMorales, who is in Argentina, faces sedition and other charges if he returns to Bolivia. He blamed \"racism and political persecution\" for preventing him from visiting his sister in a hospital in Oruro, southeast of La Paz.\n\nIn the last two weeks, supporters of Morales' party set up nationwide blockades to protest the recent postponement of elections as Bolivia struggles with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhile doctors had warned that oxygen and other medical supplies were not reaching some hospitals because of the protests, police said Saturday that most roads had been cleared.\n\n___\n\nBRASILIA, Brazil -- Michelle Bolsonaro, the wife of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, said Sunday that she had tested negative for the new coronavirus following a July 30 announcement that she had tested positive.\n\n\"Negative exam. Thanks for the prayers and for all the expressions of affection,\" 38-year-old Michelle Bolsonaro said on Instagram. She published an image of what she said was her laboratory exam. \"Undetected,\" it read.\n\nOn Wednesday, Michelle Bolsonaro's grandmother died of COVID-19.\n\nBolsonaro's youngest son, 22-year-old Jair Renan, has also tested positive for the virus. On Saturday, he released a video in which he takes pills that he says are hydroxychloroquine. The drug has no proven efficacy against the new coronavirus but has been widely publicized by the Brazilian president as a treatment for COVID-19.\n\nPresident Bolsonaro had said he tested positive for the coronavirus on July 7, suffered mild symptoms and was free of the virus in late July. He has downplayed the devastating impact of COVID-19, often appearing in public without a mask and meeting supporters in close proximity despite social distancing recommendations.\n\n___\n\nBERLIN -- Bavarian authorities said Sunday they're still haven't been able to contact 46 of more than 900 people who tested positive for the new coronavirus upon entering Germany recently, but didn't receive the results.\n\nThe southern German state admitted last week that tens of thousands of travelers returning back home had to wait for weeks to receive their test results -- among them the more than 900 who had tested positive but were not aware of it because of the missing results.\n\nThe bureaucratic breakdown led to an uproar in Germany over concerns that those who tested positive but were not aware of it could spread the virus to others.\n\nThe Bavarian state government said the long delays in getting the results were linked to problems with the software and an unexpectedly high number of people wanting to be tested at newly established test centers, primarily at highway rest stops near the country's southern borders.\n\nOn Saturday, authorities in the state of Rhineland-Palatinate said there had been delays in informing people of their test results in the southwestern state. However, the authorities there were at least able to contact all those who tested positive immediately, the German news agency dpa reported.\n\n___\n\nPARIS -- After France recorded its highest one-day rise in virus infections since May, the government is pushing for wider mask use and tighter protections for migrant workers and in slaughterhouses.\n\nBut France still plans to reopen schools nationwide in two weeks, and the labor minister says the government is determined to avoid a new nationwide lockdown that would further hobble the economy and threaten jobs.\n\nFrance's infection count has resurged in recent weeks, blamed in part on people criss-crossing the country for weddings, family gatherings or annual summer vacations with friends. Britain re-imposed quarantine measures Saturday for vacationers returning from France as a result.\n\nFrance reported 3,310 new infections in a single day Saturday, and the rate of positive tests has been growing and is now at 2.6%. The daily case count was down to several hundred a day for two months, but started rising again in July. Overall France has reported more than 30,400 virus-related deaths, among the world's highest tolls.\n\nLabor Minister Elisabeth Borne said in an interview published Sunday with the Journal du Dimanche newspaper that the government wants to expand mask use in workplaces.\n\n\"We must avoid new confinement at any cost,\" she said.",

        "body": "For a Texas nurse, the first sign that something was wrong happened while brushing her teeth -- she couldn't taste her toothpaste. For a Georgia attorney, it was hitting a wall of fatigue on a normally easy run. When a Wisconsin professor fell ill in June, he thought a bad meal had upset his stomach.\n\nBut eventually, all of these people discovered that their manifold symptoms were all signs of Covid-19. Some of the common symptoms -- a dry cough, a headache -- can start so mildly they are at first mistaken for allergies or a cold. In other cases, the symptoms are so unusual -- strange leg pain, a rash or dizziness -- that patients and even their doctors don't think Covid-19 could be the culprit.\n\nWith more than 18 million cases of coronavirus worldwide, one thing is clear: The symptoms are varied and strange, they can be mild or debilitating, and the disease can progress, from head to toe, in unpredictable ways.\n\nCould My Symptoms Be Covid-19?\n\nThese days, every cough, sneeze or headache makes you wonder: Could it be Covid-19? Here's a guide to help you understand the symptoms.\n\nDespite hundreds of published studies on Covid-19 symptoms, just how common any given symptom is depends on the patient group studied. Patients in hospitals typically have more severe symptoms. Older patients are more likely to have cognitive problems. Younger patients are more likely to have mild disease and odd rashes.\n\n\"The problem is that it depends on who you are and how healthy you are,\" said Dr. Mark A. Perazella, a kidney specialist and professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. \"It's so heterogeneous, it's hard to say. If you're healthy, most likely you'll get fever, achiness, nasal symptoms, dry cough and you'll feel crappy. But there are going to be the oddballs that are challenging and come in with some symptoms and nothing else, and you don't suspect Covid.\"\n\nThe Texas nurse who couldn't taste her toothpaste said she developed fever, \"horrible\" body aches and coughing the next day. Her symptoms lasted for five days. (She and many others interviewed asked that their names not be used to protect their medical privacy or to protect their families from the stigma of Covid-19.)\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-05T07:58:24.076Z As talks drag on, McConnell signals openness to jobless aid extension, and negotiators agree on a deadline. Novavax sees encouraging results from two studies of its experimental vaccine. Mississippians must now wear masks in public, governor says. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nAnosmia, the loss of sense of smell that is also often accompanied by a loss of taste, is viewed as a defining symptom. In a study of 961 health care workers who were tested for Covid-19, anosmia was the most predictive symptom, but it wasn't foolproof. Only half the people who reported losing their sense of smell or taste tested positive, said Dr. Brian Clemency, the study's lead author and an associate professor in the department of emergency medicine at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo.\n\nEven a symptom as common as fever can be tricky when trying to predict if a patient might have Covid-19. Although many businesses are doing fever checks to screen for Covid-19, many Covid-19 patients never have a fever. In a European study of 2,000 Covid-19 patients with mild to moderate illness, 60 percent never had a fever. In the University at Buffalo study, fewer than one in three patients with fever also tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nRob Gregson, 52, of South Orange, N.J., went to bed feeling under the weather and woke up with chest tightness, a \"weird\" cough, difficulty breathing and \"crazy fatigue.\" It was March 11, just before lockdowns were imposed, and he immediately suspected Covid-19. But because he never had a fever, it took him more than a week to find a doctor to help and get a swab test. He tested positive.\n\n\"It's been the fatigue that is the most debilitating,\" said Mr. Gregson, executive director of a faith-based nonprofit, adding that he's still struggling to regain his stamina nearly five months later. \"I've been on the coronavirus roller coaster, feeling better and thinking I'll be OK, then it comes roaring back.\"\n\nWhen Erin, a 30-year-old who works for a nonprofit in Washington, D.C., first developed a cough and headache in May, she wasn't worried. \"I did not have a fever, and I'd been very diligent about wearing a mask and washing my hands, so I figured it was allergies or a cold at the beginning,\" she said.\n\nAbout four days after the cough began, Erin was hit with severe fatigue, sore throat, congestion, chills, body aches and a slight loss of sense of smell -- but still no fever. She also had one unusual symptom: severe pain in her hip muscles, which she described as \"really weird.\"\n\nAlthough body aches are a common symptom of Covid-19, some patients are reporting severe joint and body pain, particularly in large muscles. Although it's rare, Covid-19 can cause painful inflammation in the joints or lead to rhabdomyolysis, a serious and potentially life-threatening illness that can cause excruciating muscle pain in the shoulders, thighs or lower back.\n\nA New York cyclist who developed severe leg pain in May was initially diagnosed via telemedicine with a bulging disc. She sought a second telemedicine opinion with Dr. Jordan Metzl, a sports medicine specialist at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, who asked her to move, twist and put pressure on her legs as he watched her on video.\n\n\"Down to her calf she said, 'Ouch, that really hurts,'\" said Dr. Metzl, who grew worried. \"I'm not an alarmist doctor in the least, but I looked for the closest emergency room to her, which was 16 miles away. I said, 'I want you to get in the car and drive yourself to the E.R. right now.'\"\n\nAn ultrasound showed she had no pulse in her legs and severe clotting in both legs, putting her at risk of amputation. She was transferred to another hospital and underwent nine hours of emergency surgery. Dr. Metzl said it was fortunate that he had just had a conference call with colleagues about blood clots and Covid.\n\n\"It's a terrifying story, which is why we need awareness around these weird presentations,\" Dr. Metzl said. \"Covid infection can affect different body parts differently. Some people get this hypercoagulable state and end up getting blood clots. We don't always know who those people are.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 4, 2020\n\nI have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nIn June, John, a 55-year-old professor in Oshkosh, Wis., woke up one morning feeling like something he had eaten disagreed with him. The next day he was hit with debilitating fatigue and nausea, cramping and other gastrointestinal symptoms. He didn't suspect Covid-19 because he had been wearing a mask and social distancing.\n\n\"By the second day I was just wanting to sleep all the time. I was probably sleeping 20 hours a day,\" he said. \"I even remember during that time my mind set changed. I could not imagine how my wife and son were able to be awake all day. I thought, 'How can anyone possibly do that?' I would get out of bed and go to the kitchen for a glass of water, and by the time I got there all I could think about was wanting to go back to bed.\"\n\nDoctors tested him for Covid-19 and Lyme disease. Both were negative. An ultrasound showed no problems, but blood work suggested he had an infection of some kind. A doctor prescribed a two-week course of a heartburn drug, and he lost 10 pounds. After two weeks, he began feeling better. Two months later, he tested positive for Covid-19 antibodies, suggesting his original Covid test had been a false negative.\n\nDoctors say Covid patients with only gastrointestinal symptoms often test negative when tested with a nasal-pharyngeal swab. The virus might be more likely to show up in fecal testing, which is common in other countries, but not widely used in the United States. The gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory tract both are rich in a receptor called ACE2, which the virus uses to get into our cells. But it's unclear why the virus sometimes seems to skip the respiratory tract and instead infects only the digestive tract.\n\n\"This is a very tricky and confounding virus and disease, and we are finding out surprising things about it every day,\" said Dr. Asaf Bitton, executive director of Ariadne Labs at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nDr. Ilan Schwartz, assistant professor of infectious diseases at the University of Alberta, said he was tested for Covid-19 after developing respiratory symptoms. The test came back negative, but then he developed Covid toes -- painful red or purple lesions on the tips of fingers and toes that are believed to be a telltale symptom of coronavirus, particularly in younger patients. It may happen as a result of small blood clots or when the virus invades blood vessels.\n\n\"I started getting these sores on my feet and couldn't figure out what was going on,\" said Dr. Schwartz, who is 37. \"They were really painful. I thought maybe I had stubbed them -- like all of them, which would be unusual. Then I thought maybe there's something wrong with my shoes. I've heard a lot of people with similar stories end up buying new shoes because they don't know what's going on. It's such an unusual symptom that it's not natural to think of a respiratory virus being responsible for sore toes.\"\n\nThomas Ryan, 36, an Atlanta attorney, said the first sign that something was wrong hit him during exercise.\n\n\"I went for a run on a Thursday afternoon after work and felt awful,\" he said. \"I hit the wall like you do in a marathon on a very short run for me.\"\n\nThe next morning, he woke up with a light cough, sore throat and a feeling in his chest like heartburn, and later developed fatigue, lung pain and shortness of breath. Although his Covid test was negative, his doctor told him that it was a false negative, and that based on his symptoms, he clearly had Covid-19.\n\n\"This is not great,\" said Mr. Ryan, who was still coughing weeks after falling ill. \"The amount of energy I have -- I feel like I'm at altitude. It was two weeks of not being able to do anything. If this is a mild case, it makes me think people are taking a lot of risks they probably shouldn't be.\"",

        "body": "Lise Davidsen, who made a widely hailed company debut last season, won't be back in the fall as planned. But she is giving a live recital this weekend.\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera placed a big bet on the young Norwegian soprano Lise Davidsen, casting her in five productions far into the future before she had even sung her first note in New York.\n\nMaybe it was a safe bet: By the time Ms. Davidsen made her debut with the company last fall, at just 32, she was already one of the fastest-rising singers in the world, collecting competition prizes and performing on opera's great stages. But the Met was a new challenge, a house that's prone to hype and acoustically unforgiving for smaller voices; it's quickly clear who thrives there, and who does not.\n\nIt took all of one entrance in Tchaikovsky's \"The Queen of Spades\" to brush off any fears about her future with the Met. The voice I heard was awe-inspiring in its power, an electric flash that filled the cavernous theater with its radiance; even when quieter, controlled and delicate, its softness was nonetheless focused, penetrating the sounds of her fellow singers and the orchestra as if carried by beams of light.\n\nIn Ms. Davidsen, the Met had found its newest star. And fans wouldn't need to wait long for her to return. The plan was for her to sing Leonore in Beethoven's \"Fidelio\" this fall. But, in what has become a template story, it was canceled -- along with everything else there until New Year's Eve, at the earliest -- because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAs it happens, Leonore was Ms. Davidsen's final role, at the Royal Opera House in London, before her schedule was virtually erased. Now it isn't clear when or if she will bring it to the Met; like the company itself, she won't be back in the house any time soon.\n\nBut on Saturday, she will be reunited with the Met -- not in New York, but from Oslo -- for the latest installment of its Met Stars Live in Concert series. These pandemic-born, small-screen performances, livestreamed in high definition with the audio quality of a studio album, have so far featured fan favorites like Ren\u00e9e Fleming and Jonas Kaufmann in unconventional, yet often beautiful, spaces. No exception, Ms. Davidsen's will be broadcast from the Oscarshall palace, the museum and summer residence of the Norwegian royal family.\n\nI joined Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, and veterans of the company's Live in HD cinema broadcasts, for a technical rehearsal on Thursday, at All Mobile Studios in Chelsea. Everyone was screened at the door with a temperature check and questionnaire; they shouted camera cues through masks. Afterward, I spoke with Ms. Davidsen on Zoom. By then, it was 10 p.m. in Oslo. Yet even following the run-through, with abrupt stops and starts that can be jarring for any artist, she was patient and gracious -- never the proud diva you might expect for someone in her position.\n\nWe talked about her Met program -- which charts an unlikely journey from Wagner to cabaret, operetta and Broadway, with the pianist James Baillieu -- and about how it comes between rehearsals for \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, a large-scale production that seems unfathomable in a time when many houses remain closed. I also wanted to hear from her about what it meant, as an erstwhile singer-songwriter from a small town, to be performing in a palace belonging to Queen Sonja of Norway, who last year flew to New York just to see her at the Met.\n\nWhen I brought up the subject, Ms. Davidsen laughed and said, \"This scarf I'm wearing is actually a gift from the queen.\"\n\nShe recalled a conversation with the queen the day before -- which she acknowledged is strange to say -- in which she was told that her life is a fairy tale. \"I was like, 'You're right,'\" Ms. Davidsen said. \"I'm talking to the queen as if we know each other; I'm doing this concert for the Met. For me it's all about the concert and making it good, but I can forget how special that is.\"\n\nHer Met recital begins with \"Dich, Teure Halle,\" from Wagner's \"Tannh\u00e4user,\" which she sang for competitions and her first solo album, as well as a declarative entrance at Bayreuth last summer. The music is a greeting; and at the palace in Oslo, it's an introduction to the recital's small yet ornate, wood-finished space, lit from behind by Scandinavian twilight and decorated with 19th-century paintings. (It's actually the dining room.)\n\nOn Thursday, Ms. Davidsen didn't appear to shrink her voice, treating the room as if it were the Met, while Mr. Baillieu matched her with the grandeur of Liszt's Wagner transcriptions. These are sensitive musicians, though, and they followed \"Tannh\u00e4user\" with smaller, rending songs by Grieg and Sibelius, as well as Richard Strauss.\n\nAfter an excerpt from Puccini's \"Manon Lescaut,\" the program shifts from Italian opera to Britten's \"Johnny,\" from the composer's \"Cabaret Songs\" written with W.H. Auden; it's comparatively more playful, with comedic glissandos and an extreme depth of range that reveals Ms. Davidsen's past as a mezzo-soprano. She closed with \"I Could Have Danced All Night,\" which I mentioned was also sung by Birgit Nilsson, the Swedish titan of opera, to whom she's been compared -- a coincidence, Ms. Davidsen said.\n\nShe wants you to think of the concert's cabaret-like turn as a program encore. \"You can't really lighten up my repertoire,\" Ms. Davidsen said. \"I wanted to light up the mood a little bit. I also feel that in some recitals and opera, I never get to show this other side. I don't need to; I don't have this cabaret kind of woman hidden, and it's not a peek or preview into my future. But this is fun, and different.\"\n\nIt's different, too, for Ms. Davidsen to simply be busy. She sang in two livestreamed concerts in Norway this spring and has been at work on her second album, but has otherwise been away from the stage since the Royal's \"Fidelio,\" which completed its run several days after houses closed elsewhere. I asked what it was like to perform as the industry was coming to a halt, and whether she had been afraid.\n\nWhat she described seemed a world away from pandemic precautions as we now know them. As \"Fidelio\" was opening, using hand sanitizer was seen as more important than wearing a mask. And on the day of the final rehearsal, she woke up feeling fatigued, and unable to push very hard at the gym. Then she lost her senses of smell and taste. At the time, that wasn't a widely known symptom, and she thought that she was tired because of stress. Her illness never got any worse, so she slept and, undaunted, sang on opening night. Only later did she realize she probably had Covid-19; indeed, she eventually tested positive for antibodies.\n\nThe protocols for Wagner's \"Die Walk\u00fcre\" in Berlin are exponentially more vigilant. Ms. Davidsen said she is tested every morning; results come by noon or 1 p.m., then the company rehearses from 2 to 9. She doesn't otherwise venture outside except for essentials. Inside the Deutsche Oper, both the cast and crew members are required to wear masks.\n\nMs. Davidsen couldn't give away much about this \"Ring\" cycle, an eagerly anticipated new production by Stefan Herheim, in which she is singing Sieglinde. \"All I can say is that it's a very different Sieglinde from what I expected,\" she said.\n\nIf this \"Walk\u00fcre\" is particularly mysterious, it's because \"Das Rheingold,\" the opera that precedes it in the cycle, was planned for June but canceled. It's like tuning into a new TV show halfway through a season and relying on a recap to figure out what's going on -- which adds a layer of difficulty to an already fraught production, the most ambitious opera staging since the pandemic began. To make matters worse, a recent rehearsal was canceled because of a heat wave. \"I couldn't think,\" Ms. Davidsen said, \"it was so hot.\"\n\n\"But we're happy we can work,\" she quickly added. \"The fact that we get to be there is better than anything.\"\n\nLise Davidsen\n\nSaturday at 1 p.m. Eastern, then available on demand for 12 days; metopera.org.",

        "body": "A Trump administration order could allow many troubled renters to avoid eviction through Dec. 31. We answer renters' questions here.\n\nThe Trump administration has announced an order to suspend the possibility of eviction for millions of renters who have suffered financially because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that the order was an emergency action, which it is entitled to take under the law.\n\nHere are the answers to questions that renters may have about the order, which is more expansive than the now-expired moratorium that was part of the virus relief package this spring. We will add to this list as we learn more. Please email your questions to hubforhelp@nytimes.com.\n\nWho is eligible?\n\nYou must meet a five-pronged test.\n\nYou need to have used your \"best efforts\" to obtain any and all forms of government rental assistance.\n\nYou can't \"expect\" to earn more than $99,000 in 2020, or $198,000 if you're married and filing a joint tax return. If you don't qualify that way, you could still be eligible if you did not need to report any income at all to the federal government in 2019 or if you received a stimulus check earlier this year.\n\nYou must be experiencing a \"substantial\" loss of household income, a layoff or \"extraordinary\" out-of-pocket medical expenses (which the order defines as any unreimbursed expense likely to exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income this year).\n\nYou have to be making your best efforts to make \"timely\" partial payments that are as close to the full amount due as \"circumstances may permit,\" taking into account other nondiscretionary expenses.\n\nEviction would \"likely\" lead to either homelessness or your having to move to a place that is more expensive or where you could get sick from being close to others.\n\nA lot of that is pretty subjective. If it's a close call, who decides?\n\nLandlords who disagree with renters' self-assessments could try to evict nonpaying tenants and dare them to fight back legally. Then, it could be up to a housing court judge to decide if a renter is eligible for the moratorium or if the landlord can, in fact, evict.\n\nHow do I prove to my landlord that I'm eligible?\n\nThe C.D.C. order makes reference to a declaration that renters should draft and then provides an example of one near the end of the document.\n\nWho should make a declaration?\n\nThe order says that every adult who is on the lease should draft and sign their own declaration.\n\nI have a roommate. What happens if one of us is under the income cap but the other is not?\n\nThe rules for roommates are not clear. We are asking federal officials for more clarity and will update this article when we know more.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-02T16:28:21.778Z New studies show inexpensive steroid drugs can help critically sick people survive Covid-19. Trump's new coronavirus adviser has questioned masks and alarmed government scientists. Biden plans a speech faulting Trump over reopening schools. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nI'm in a pretty bad way. Can I stretch the truth some?\n\nYou shouldn't. The order makes a point of noting that the declaration \"is sworn testimony, meaning that you can be prosecuted, go to jail, or pay a fine if you lie, mislead, or omit important information.\"\n\nWhat do I do with the declarations once they are done?\n\nEmail, send or hand them to the landlord in a way that allows you to get proof that the landlord received them. That way, there will be no question as to whether you did what you were supposed to do. Make sure you keep a copy for yourself.\n\nThen what?\n\nKeep paying as much as you can. Otherwise, you risk failing the eligibility test, which says that you should be trying to make partial payments to the best of your ability.\n\nCan the landlord still evict me for reasons other than nonpayment?\n\nYes. All the usual rules about criminal behavior or disruptions or destruction of property still apply. And it's possible that a landlord will look hard for some other reason to start the eviction process, so it's wise to follow every term of the lease, as well as any other building or property rule.\n\nWill interest or penalties accrue?\n\nThe order does not forbid landlords from charging fees, penalties or interest. Nor does it place any restrictions on how high they can go. Check your lease to see if there are any provisions about how this may work.\n\nWill I have to pay everything I owe all at once in January?\n\nYou might. The order specifically mentions this possibility.\n\nDoes the order apply to every landlord and every residential renter in the country?\n\nNo. Aside from the income caps, your local rules may apply instead. If you're in a state, territory or tribal area that already has a moratorium in place that provides the same or better level of protection, then that more local action will take its place. Local jurisdictions are also still free to impose stronger restrictions than the federal order. California's moratorium goes through the end of January, for example.\n\nThe federal moratorium doesn't apply in American Samoa, though it will if it reports its first coronavirus cases.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nI'm living in a motel right now. Does the order apply to those properties?\n\nNo. The order specifically excludes hotels and motels.\n\nWhat about Airbnb rentals and other similar properties?\n\nThe order excludes any \"guest house rented to a temporary guest or seasonal tenant as defined under the laws of the state, territorial, tribal, or local jurisdiction.\"\n\nWhat if my landlord sends me an eviction notice anyway?\n\nSeek counsel. You can search for a low- or no-cost legal assistance office near you via the Legal Services Corporation's map. Just Shelter, a tenant advocacy group, also offers information on local organizations that can help renters.\n\nDoes the order specify the size of the penalties that landlords may be subject to?\n\nYes. An individual landlord could be subject to a fine up to $100,000 if no death (say from someone getting sick after eviction) results from the violation, or one year in jail, or both. If a death occurs, the fine rises to no more than $250,000. If it's an organization in violation, the fines are $200,000 or $500,000.\n\nIs the order legal?\n\nThe White House and Centers for Disease Control think so. It is possible that landlord industry groups or others will sue to stop it, in which case it will be up to the courts to decide.\n\nWhen does the order take effect and how long does it last?\n\nIt takes effect as soon as it is published in the Federal Register. The order says that will happen on Sept. 4. The order applies through Dec. 31, and it's possible that it could be extended.\n\nI'm dizzy from all of the various local, state and federal orders. Is this the last of them?\n\nMaybe not. Congress could pass a new relief package that would supersede this order.",

On Twitter and Instagram, people have been venting about family, friends and co-workers going on nonessential trips and causing friction in their relationships.\n\nOne woman wrote on Twitter that her mother was insisting on flying from Oakland, Calif., to Portland, Ore., to visit her, but would not be allowed into the house if she did so. \"I told her, 'absolutely not,'\" she wrote. \"We will not see you! I don't care if she comes knocking on my door. She will not be allowed in.\"\n\nAnother tweeted that she told her sister that she could not visit for vacation: \"I said NO WAY! I told her I don't want her to board a plane, pick up Covid and deposit it in my house. She mad, but I don't care. I am HIGH risk and will not relent.\"\n\nAnd one woman wrote on Twitter that her stepson was coming to town with his girlfriend. \"If it was MY kid I would say no but there would be drama if I suggested the step son delay the trip,\" she wrote.\n\nJill Locke, a professor of political science at a college in Minnesota, and her younger sister, Jennifer, who lives in California and is the chief executive of a wine company, initially didn't see eye to eye about visiting their parents, who are in their 80s, in Seattle this summer. The sisters exchanged text messages and phone calls, with the younger Ms. Locke pushing for the trip while her older sister couldn't justify the prospect of traveling.\n\n\"We were coming at it from such different places,\" the older Ms. Locke said. \"For many reasons, for me, it felt like it was the wrong thing to do, even though I really wanted to see our parents, but she didn't feel the same way.\"\n\nBefore the pandemic, Ms. Locke planned to fly to Seattle from Minnesota with her husband and children, but as the coronavirus spread across the United States, she decided that she would rent an R.V. and drive there. She soon realized that the cost of the R.V. would be prohibitive, and felt that some states between Minnesota and Washington weren't taking the virus seriously enough. In the end, both sisters decided to stay home.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome -- which caused their blood oxygen levels to plummet -- and received supplemental oxygen. In severe cases, they were placed on ventilators to help them breathe. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. (And some people don't show many symptoms at all.) In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms. More serious cases can lead to inflammation and organ damage, even without difficulty breathing. There have been cases of dangerous blood clots, strokes and brain impairments.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"Weighing all these contingencies made me wonder what I would be bringing to my parents even if I traveled as responsibly as possible,\" the older Ms. Locke said. \"There have been a lot of texts between us, and we both got so worked up and frustrated.\"\n\nMs. Locke's sister said that she didn't take the prospect of traveling lightly and has been following guidance to not travel during the pandemic. Nonetheless, she felt that it was important that she see her aging parents sooner rather than later.\n\n\"At the time, I felt like 'if we don't go see our parents now, then when will we?'\" the younger Ms. Locke said. \"That's been the gutting thing: Not knowing the answer to that. It feels like time is being stolen from us.\"\n\nLindsay Chambers, a writer and editor who lives in Nashville, said that she has been surprised by the ways people are justifying going on vacation this year, including saying that they can't pass up cheap flights and those who would not reschedule bachelor and bachelorette parties. Ms. Chambers said she has barely left her home since February, but she has been following local news and seen images of people gathering at bars and popular tourist spots in downtown Nashville. These tourists, she said, are not being considerate of others. She was stunned to learn that her own friends were going on a beach trip this summer.\n\n\"I had to stop myself from shouting at friends who told us they'd be 'quarantining at the beach,'\" she said. \"Traveling to another state and staying in a rented condo in the middle of a raging pandemic is not how quarantine works. At all.\"\n\nMs. Chambers, 41, also described being confounded and upset by how some people manage to make her feel, like she's overreacting by following the recommendations from doctors on health and safety. Other people have also said they experienced this when they stay home while their friends and family interpret the rules more loosely.\n\n\"Maybe there's a degree of paranoia for me, and you couldn't pay me to get on a plane right now, but is there really such a thing as being too careful in a pandemic?\" Ms. Chambers asked. \"I feel like it's way, way, way better to come down on the side of caution.\"\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.\n\nRemember Greta Thunberg? News cycles were devoted to her passage across the Atlantic. World leaders praised or ridiculed her on Twitter, depending on their politics. She represented a movement that caught the world's attention.\n\nIn fact, before the pandemic, climate change was one of the biggest drivers of political economy in much of the developed world, even as the United States abandoned its path to carbon neutrality under the Trump administration.\n\nAnd the European Union, home to 446 million people and the richest collective of nations in the world, was starting the so-called Green Deal, the largest ever public investment in sustainable development, at $857 billion.\n\nBut as the pandemic hit, unleashing economic calamity and devastating job losses, climate change politics rapidly fell off the agenda.\n\nYet it's in that very agenda, Rachel Kyte argues, that the opportunities for genuine, durable economic recovery and job creation lie.\n\nMs. Kyte, the dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University and a former special representative to the United Nations for Sustainable Energy for All, has spent much of her career on the cutting edge of climate politics, science and the public policy debate around them.\n\n\"We need to invest in what is going to be competitive in a decarbonized world,\" she argues, not \"pour funding into zombie companies.\"\n\nBut in many places ruled by populists, Ms. Kyte observes, people may be the driving force of change before governments catch up.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-25T18:22:42.962Z 'No second chances': Colleges are coming down hard on students who violate virus restrictions. Many U.S. parents divide along political lines when it comes to sending their children back to school in person. Flu-season testing delays could make it easier for the virus to spread undetected. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"Populists, whether they come from the left or the right, don't do well with scientific advice,\" Ms. Kyte said, drawing a correlation between many populists' rejection of the science behind the climate crisis and their poor handling of the pandemic.\n\nShe talked with In Her Words about what a green recovery might look like and why the time for it is right now.\n\nThe conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nBy the time the coronavirus pandemic spread, the idea of switching to a green economy was prominent in Europe -- and indeed, a matter of debate around the world. How might it be integrated into whatever economic recovery lies ahead?\n\nWhen we think about how to build back, we have to think about how to get businesses back, how to get people back in jobs, how to get food systems and energy systems moving again.\n\nBut there is a moment for learning, right?\n\nOur energy demand has completely collapsed as we've all had to stay at home. Energy demand is down worldwide by 20 to 30 percentage points. That gives us an opportunity to really think about what is the energy system that we need as we come back.\n\nWhy is the energy system so important? Because the energy system accounts for the largest amounts of carbon emissions, which was driving the economy closer and closer to a precipice when it came to our ability to manage climate change. As a society, we've got to be able to respond to what we call the gray rhinos -- these big risks that are sitting right in front of us -- that we tend to try to ignore.\n\nSo, if we are already in a climate crisis, the way the economy comes back needs to be resilient to that crisis as well.\n\nWe already know that the oil and gas and fossil fuel part of the energy economy has been in real trouble. For geopolitical reasons, and then with the collapse of demand, oil prices came all the way down. Before the crisis, investors had been walking away from oil. Already the world was saying, \"OK, we need to decarbonize,\" therefore we need to invest in what is going to be competitive in a decarbonized world. And that is renewable energy -- it's a clean way to produce steel, it's a low carbon way to produce cement, it's the hydrogen economy for shipping and aviation. Stimulus should flow to these types of projects.\n\nAnd the good news is that most of those green things, those clean things are actually job rich and job rich in local economies.\n\nSome have argued that in a crisis like this, we just need to rev up the economic engines and worry about green transitions later. What do you say to that?\n\nThe worst thing in the world would be to double down on what's not working, what was already unattractive and which was already not performing very well.\n\nI think public attitudes around health and the environment are holding up and probably made even stronger as a result of this crisis. And so I don't think that investing in things which are going to make the air really dangerous for us, again, is something that's going to hold up for very long, especially with young people.\n\nCertainly that's where private investors are going. Why would public investors want to hold on to carbon assets? Then you're just creating sort of bad assets on the public balance sheet while the private sector is going to be investing in clean. I don't think that works for the poor and the vulnerable either.\n\nWouldn't it be better to learn the lessons of reconstruction? Europe built a European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in order to manage the transition and the adjustment as the Iron Curtain collapsed, and that was about taking very big uncompetitive industries that were dirty and had huge payrolls, and turning them into things that could be competitive globally.\n\nWhen you look across the world at political resistance to this kind of green rebuilding, what patterns do you see?\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThis crisis really has shown that populists, whether they come from the left or the right, whether we're talking about Nicaragua or Mexico or Brazil or the United States, don't do well with scientific advice.\n\nThere's a correlation really between leaders who aren't particularly keen on taking good scientific advice and their response to this crisis and the way in which they're managing it competently. And therefore, you think about, \"Well, what's going to be their response to the next crisis?\" -- which is the climate crisis.\n\nI think at the grass roots around the world, people see with their own eyes. They see crops disappearing. They see crop patterns changing. They see the air quality diminishing in their cities and towns. They see the sea level rising. They see the impact of storms. People know the climate is changing, and that what they want is government to work with them, to build resilience.\n\nHow do you take action or reach agreement on climate when there has been no common ground around the world for climate in the first place? It looks like it's every person for themselves out there right now.\n\nYou can't isolate yourself from a pandemic and you can't isolate yourself from climate change. So we do have to find mechanisms.\n\nIn 2008, I worked in the international financial system, and in the standing up of the G-20 in response to the financial crisis, you had committed multilateralists sitting in key jobs in international organizations and in key jobs in government and in key governments. There's no getting away from the fact that when you've got inward-looking politicians in key countries of the global economy, it makes it more difficult.\n\nThere is something we call reciprocal vulnerability, and I think women leaders are frankly, better at it. It's basically standing up and saying, \"You know what? I don't know, we don't know, but we are going to get through this together.\"\n\nThere's something extraordinarily powerful in that. Look at the countries that have done that versus the countries where it's like, \"We're best at this,\" or \"We're best at that,\" whether or not that's really true. In this crisis, imagine the international cooperation of walking into the room saying, \"We don't know, but we're going to get through this together.\" It's not a bad place to start.\n\nI can find green beans from Kenya in my local organic supermarket here in Brussels. It's good that the growers have a global market for their goods, but how do you maintain those livelihoods and jobs at the scale -- especially as different parts of the world are hit by the crisis-related downturn?\n\nThis crisis is going to force us to address some issues that we haven't really wanted to address in the last few years, which is that you can grow your green beans in Naivasha and you can export them to the Netherlands, and I can buy them the next morning, but we still don't have access to an affordable diet for millions and millions of Africans. We don't have effective local and regional markets for fresh foods in Africa. We need extraordinary amounts of investment in cold storage and in supply chains within the region. And so, when a shock comes and suddenly there's no flights to Amsterdam, everything collapses.\n\nThe same is true across Latin America. Most Latin American countries are exporting their food, and yet Latin Americans are suffering from type two diabetes, increasing amounts of noncommunicable diseases because of bad diets. And we have unparalleled rates of deforestation.\n\nSo the system is broken both from the perspective of health and the perspective of the planet. And we've seen our supply chains really leave us very vulnerable.\n\nIn Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.

        "body": "Experts have long predicted that psychotherapy was poised to go virtual. The pandemic may prove them right.\n\nFor about two years, Michael Raymos made the drive from Modesto, Calif., to Sacramento and back for therapy, and for the therapist, who could listen to stories of childhood abuse and gently unwind their hold on the present. Those regular office sessions, at a clinic at the University of California, Davis, created a strong bond, and Mr. Raymos came to rely on them to manage symptoms of post-traumatic stress and the emotional weight of a neurodegenerative disorder that struck him in 2012, in the prime of adulthood.\n\nBut this routine ended abruptly in mid-March, when the clinic went almost entirely virtual in response to the Covid-19 outbreak in Northern California. Since then, Mr. Raymos has engaged in twice-a-month sessions on his computer or phone.\n\n\"There is a drop of social contact, not being able to always see his expression,\" said Mr. Raymos, 49. \"There's more of an intimacy level when you're one on one and that office door is closed. But there's a comfort level at home. I'll sit there in bed with my dog, Bug, on my lap, and that comfort allows me to talk about things I maybe wouldn't have in the office, because of how painful they are.\"\n\nHe added: \"And I like not having to make that drive.\"\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has forced medical centers around the world to partially adopt telemedicine, with varying results. Some patients are not comfortable with the technology, or can't afford it; others need services that cannot be provided entirely online, like prenatal care.\n\nPsychiatry is a special case. Experts had predicted for years that the field's most intimate treatment -- psychotherapy, or the talking cure -- was poised to go largely virtual, for many or most patients, forever altering day-to-day practice. In this extraordinary year, they are likely to be proved right.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T14:17:02.142Z 'We are incredibly concerned': A group of local health departments urges the C.D.C. to pull its new guidance on testing. For many schools in the U.S., returning to the classroom means a stop in the courtroom. Trump promises a vaccine by the end of the year, and boasts of his pandemic response. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nIn March, federal health officials loosened restrictions on practicing across state lines, and have begun to expand reimbursement. Clinics across the country went virtual, with most consultations done by phone or computer. The number of virtual mental health visits in the sprawling V.A. Health System jumped more than sevenfold, from 7,500 to 52,600, in just the first two months of the U.S. epidemic.\n\n\"Overnight, everyone began practicing telepsychiatry, with physicians in New York, Texas, California, able to reach their patients, wherever they were,\" said Dr. John Torous, director of the digital psychiatry division at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, a Harvard affiliate.\n\n\"You're going to get a boost in access in care, for sure,\" he said. \"And I suspect it's going to saturate the system pretty quickly.\"\n\nThe U.C. Davis clinic had a built-in advantage in the transition: Its senior psychiatrist, Dr. Peter Yellowlees, in 2018 co-wrote the standard textbook on telepsychiatry, \"Telepsychiatry and Health Technologies.\" He also helped write the field's guidelines and has conducted dozens of studies on the practice. He has been a proponent since 1991, when, as a young psychiatrist in Australia, he treated his first patient on telepsychaitry, an Aboriginal woman with depression. At the end, she asked if he had recorded the session; he assured her he had not.\n\n\"She said,' 'Why not?'\" Dr. Yellowlees recalled, in an interview. \"She was disappointed. She wanted a copy; she said that she'd never been on TV before and wanted to show her community. It taught me about people's attitudes. Patients have always liked being treated on video -- it's the providers and physicians who were the major obstacles.\"\n\nMany Freudian-based therapists have been particularly skeptical, concerned that going virtual might alter or weaken a therapeutic bond built, often painstakingly, through the shared physical space of analysis. Others worry that a rich dimension of body language is lost in video interactions.\n\n\"In terms of trauma, one of the things many of us track is micro-expressions, these flickers of emotional tone, when people are talking,\" said Dr. Andres Sciolla, a psychiatrist in the U.C. Davis clinic. \"I cannot tell you how many times I have noticed a flicker of tears or fear in the gaze of a patient, perceived a shift in feeling, and explored that -- and found a lot behind that change.\"\n\nIf widely used approaches such as cognitive-behavior therapy lose something crucial by being virtual, it is not evident from the studies done so far. In one study, for instance, a team led by researchers based at the Baltimore Veterans Affairs Medical Center tracked more than 100 veterans being treated for depression over six months, half of them engaging in traditional, in-person therapy, the other half receiving care online. Both groups improved, on standard measures, by the same amount. Another study, led by Leslie Morland of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Pacific Islands Healthcare System, compared in-person and virtual talk therapy for 120 veterans with post-traumatic stress. It reached a similar finding: improvement across the board, no difference between the groups.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future.

Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"The evidence so far from these equivalency trials, comparing face-to-face versus over video -- every trial I've seen shows no difference in clinical outcomes,\" said John Fortney, director of population health in the University of Washington's psychiatry department. For more than a decade, Dr. Fortney has been trying to get teletherapy adopted in rural areas, where people have little or no access to mental health specialists. \"About 90 percent of patients report being satisfied with the experience,\" he said.\n\nAnd with the threat of coronavirus at large, safety has become a paramount concern.\n\n\"My psychiatrist literally saved my life, about 10 years ago, when I had a couple of suicide attempts,\" said Margaret, 70, a retired nurse, who, like Mr. Raymos, received in-person care at the U.C. Davis clinic and had to go virtual in March. \"I know how powerful those office visits can be. But I don't want to go out. I don't want to be exposed to this virus; I like that I can do this from home. My therapist, I feel his personality online; that still comes through. He's listening very carefully. He's really present to me.\"\n\nNot everyone who could benefit from psychiatric care is a candidate for the virtual variety. For people who are deeply delusional, who are scared, paranoid and alone, for instance, a Zoom call in these situations can be an invitation to confusion, or much worse. The rich sensory experience of full human interaction with a gifted therapist -- that quality that defies measurement and study, in any randomized trial -- is what many such people need.\n\nBut for now, in this moment of shared anxiety and uncertainty, the seal on telepsychiatry has broken. Psychiatric clinics may never look the same. Clients, not doctors, will choose where they want to be when receiving the talking cure, and which supports to have at hand, whether a pet on the couch, an Al Jarreau mix playing in the background or a cold beer.\n\n\"From clinical point of view, you can often learn more over video than in person, because you see people moving in their natural habitat, where they live, maybe how they interact with others,\" Dr. Yellowlees said. \"My office, by contrast, is not a neutral space. Your home is your space. It's more egalitarian, less stressful. And potentially you can turn the device off and end the session, if you really wanted.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

Consider this cherry, actually, this one here, hanging off the tree at the very end of a long, deep green row. Look at how its red and gold skin shines in the bright sun. It's a famous hybrid variety, a Rainier, which means it has sweet yellow flesh and that you'll have to pay a premium price to eat it. If you do, it will be delicious, the very taste of summer. But first it will have to get to you.\n\nSo far, this cherry has been mostly lucky. No disease has come for its tree, though there's a bad one, little-cherry disease, stalking nearby orchards. No frost kept its springtime blossoms from giving way to fruit. No excessive rain has fallen in the short time since it ripened.\n\nThat could have been a disaster, because water likes to pool in the little divot by the stem. There it seeps into the flesh, making the cherry swell. Too much, and the cherry will burst through its own skin, causing splits; whole harvests can be lost this way. So dangerous is poorly timed water that cherry growers rely on fans, wind machines and even low-flying helicopters to dry ripe fruit before it is lost. Yet wind presents its own peril: It can knock cherries against one another or into branches, bruising them so that they're rejected on the packing line, where fruit is sorted for size and quality with high-tech optical scanners. Rainiers, because of their color, are particularly prone to showing their past with telltale \"wind marks,\" tiny incursions of brownness on that golden skin. This cherry has just a few.\n\nBut it's not to market yet. The window in which a sweet cherry can be picked for sale is excruciatingly narrow. Cherries don't continue to ripen once they're off the tree, the way a peach does, and once picked they don't store for very long, even when refrigerated. If they're too ripe, they won't make it to the packing house, the truck or the airplane, the grocery-store display, your summery dessert. The sugar content must be Goldilocksian -- neither too high nor too low. Wait even a couple of days too many, and it may be too late.\n\nPaige Hake, the second generation of her family to farm this orchard, considered the cherry. Then she considered its neighbors, with their own wind marks, in the lambent heat of a June afternoon. She looked down the long green row of trees, lined with its strip of white plastic fabric, meant to reflect sunlight onto the undersides of the cherries, helping them color evenly. She consulted with her father, Orlin Knutson, who has been growing fruit on this stretch of dry sagebrush steppe near Mattawa, Wash., for 41 years, the last 31 of them organically. There was a refrigerated truck waiting by the gate, with a growing stack of full bins next to it. There was rain in the forecast, as well as more heat, and sugar levels in the cherries were rising as they spoke. They wanted to get these cherries harvested today; they were far enough along that it was probably now or never, a whole year of investment and work leading to this one afternoon. But it was getting late, and there were a lot of other cherries that needed to be picked, and today the crew of people available to pick them was smaller than they would have liked. She turned to me and pointed to the wind-marked cherry, still unsure whether it would be worth the cost of trying to get it to market. \"Would you buy that at Whole Foods?\" she asked.\n\nThe yellow cherry was one of a great many across the orchards of Washington State that were just beginning to ripen. Karen Lewis, who works with growers as a tree-fruit specialist for the agricultural extension service of Washington State University, has tried to calculate exactly how many individual cherries need to be picked during a whirlwind season that Jon DeVaney, the president of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association, calls \"eight weeks of craziness.\" Multiplying all the millions of boxes by the number of cherries they can hold, Lewis determined that as many as 24 billion individual cherries must be plucked, separately, from their trees and placed carefully into bags and buckets and bins, each and every one of them by human hands.\n\nLewis thinks that people who aren't used to thinking much about the source of their food, or who assume that the food system is as mechanized and smoothly calibrated as a factory, spitting out produce like so many sticks of gum, ought to spend some time contemplating that figure and what it means. \"I'm here to tell you that people do not think we harvest everything by hand,\" she says. But hands, belonging to highly skilled workers, are needed for every last cherry. During the harvest, many thousands of people are out picking by dawn, nearly every day, their fingers flying as they watch out for rattlesnakes under dark trees. (Compounding the labor crunch, this is also the time when workers in the region must hand-thin more than 100 million apple trees, so that the remaining fruit can grow larger.) Later in the season, many of the same hands will pick and place each peach and plum and apricot, every single apple -- five and a half billion pounds, just of apples, just in Washington, just last year. \"I think those numbers are staggering,\" Lewis said.\n\nThe cherry industry has done everything it can to squeeze every possible bit of extra time into the season. Growers plant at a range of different elevations: Every 100 feet above sea level, one orchard manager says, buys you an extra day until maturity. And they choose different varietals that ripen at slightly different speeds -- most red cherries are marketed to the public simply as \"dark sweets\" but are actually a genetically distinct array, whose different sizes and tastes and unique horticultural personalities are intimately known by growers and pickers. If everything bloomed and matured all at once, Lewis said, there's no way there would be enough bees, enough trucks, enough bins, to make the scale of the current cherry harvest possible. Most of all, there wouldn't be enough people. There already aren't.\n\nFor years, the tree-fruit industry in Washington -- like the salad industry in California, the blueberry industry in New Jersey, the tomato industry in Florida and countless other sources of the things that we eat -- has been struggling to find the workers it needs to keep producing food. Across the country, the number of farmworkers is dwindling. Current workers, who are often immigrants without legal permission to work in the industries that are reliant on them, are getting older; those who are able to are leaving an industry that's poorly paid and physically damaging and often exploitative; and crackdowns at the border mean that there are fewer new arrivals to take their place. To cope, some growers have turned to a ballooning visa-based \"guest worker\" program, which comes with its own significant problems, while many others have simply buckled under debt and rising costs, going under or selling their orchards to ever-bigger companies. \"Everyone's squeezed pretty much to the limit,\" Knutson said, surveying the dark leaves, the shining fruit, the clear blue sky. \"It's kind of an ugly time.\"\n\nSuch was the state of things before the coronavirus pandemic arrived, bringing with it a host of new troubles. When I called Lewis early in this year's cherry harvest, she had just sent out a newsletter that, along with the latest updates on cherry disease and apple varieties, included information on suicide prevention. Piled on top of everything else, she said, \"this is enough to take people to their knees.\"\n\nIn March, when the United States began to lock down to slow the spread of the new virus, some workers noticed a change in how the government talked about them. As leaders planned for closures, it became clear that many of the lowest-paid and least-respected jobs in America were, in fact, the most important: the ones that could not be paused or interrupted or bypassed if society was to keep functioning. You could not, as Knutson put it, simply close the door to a farm for a month and then reopen it. People who had regularly been called illegal suddenly found themselves rebranded as essential.\n\nHarvest seasons were underway or rapidly approaching across the country; without enough workers, the nation's food would not be produced. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced that it would \"temporarily adjust its enforcement posture,\" narrowing its focus to people involved in criminal activity rather than arresting anyone who was undocumented. In California, where labor-intensive fruit-and-vegetable crops account for about 85 percent of the state's crop sales, farmers handed out letters that workers who feared attracting the attention of law enforcement by going to work during lockdowns could carry with them: not papers by the usual definition, but a paper to show that they were, informally, and just for now, legitimate by virtue of being indispensable.\n\nIn Sunnyside, a city of about 17,000 people in the heart of the fruit belt that follows the Yakima River across south central Washington, this change in perspective felt belated and insufficient. Israel S., a father of four who has worked seasonal jobs in fruit and hops for the last decade, and who asked that his last name not be used because he is undocumented, had a trove of videos ready to pull up on his phone. One was a news report, in Spanish, about crops spoiling in Alabama after a harsh anti-immigrant law went into effect in 2011 and undocumented workers fled the state. (A similar law in Georgia that year may have cost as much as $391 million in unpicked crops, according to one University of Georgia study, even after the state tried to fill the gap with prisoners.) Another video showed endless rows of ice-covered Pink Lady apples, frozen in place on their branches before they could be picked, while mournful piano music played. (It reminded Israel of the previous fall, when there had been so few apple pickers that he sometimes stayed out working until dark, the apples hard and frigid in his hands.) Other farmworkers he knew shared the videos on Facebook, and Israel understood why. They knew their own importance, even if much of the country did not.\n\nIt was nearing dinner time, and Israel was in the kitchen of a rented house with his wife, Guadalupe, who was cooking tortillas on a hot plate, and their 18-year-old daughter, Nayeli, who was stretching tired arms. Israel and Nayeli woke up at 2:30 that morning so that they could drive an hour and 20 minutes to a cherry orchard near the Oregon border, arriving well before the sun crested the hills to begin 10 hours of picking. They had done the same every day for 10 days, and would do the same the next day, and again and again, for weeks, until Israel's eyes started to droop as he drove. Each morning, Guadalupe would be up even earlier. When schools and day care centers were open, she would join her husband in the fields, but with them closed, the cost of a babysitter for the younger children would negate most of her day's wages. Still, she got up every day to make fresh tortillas to pack for her husband and daughter's lunches. Nayeli, she teased, didn't like the store-bought kind.\n\nThe family was worried about getting sick -- other than work, they went out only to pick up food, and a large bottle of hand sanitizer took pride of place in the middle of the plastic-covered kitchen table -- but they were also ineligible for stimulus checks or unemployment benefits. There had been no question that those who were able to do so would keep working. There was no question for many people living and working in the valley, with its orchards and vineyards and fruit-packing houses and dairies and meatpacking plants. The virus first spread in more populous and affluent Seattle, on the other side of the mountains, but a lockdown there brought cases down quickly. Here, in Yakima County, the curve of the virus never really flattened; outbreaks spread in meatpacking plants, which the Trump administration prohibited from closing, and the warehouses where workers pack fruit for shipment and sale. (Workers at seven packing houses went on strike to demand more safety precautions and hazard pay, and at least one of the strikers, David Cruz, died of the virus.) In June, cases were rising faster than anywhere else in the state: Though the county was home to just over 3 percent of Washington's population, it would by the next month have 20 percent of its cases. \"If you stay home,\" Israel said, \"there is no money for rent.\"\n\nIsrael and Guadalupe are both from Michoac\u00e1n, one of the poorest states in Mexico. They used to live in New Mexico, then California, then Oregon. Israel worked in restaurants and construction until jobs disappeared in the 2008 recession and friends told him there was opportunity in the fields of Washington. By driving long distances, he can find work most of the year: trimming, thinning, trellising, harvesting. But he wouldn't call it opportunity, exactly. Because of the pressure to work quickly, both he and Guadalupe had been injured falling from ladders and now lived with chronic pain: Israel in his shoulder, Guadalupe in her back. \"Supposedly it was better here,\" he said, \"but it's not. There's more work for less money.\"\n\nIsrael was still wearing his work clothes -- he was careful not to wash them with his children's clothes, because of the pesticides, which burned his throat -- and there was cherry juice smashed into his pants. He'd brought home a large bucket of the fruit that he and Nayeli picked that day, a dark red variety called Coral, which was a nice kind to pick because the cherries are large and fill buckets a bit faster. For each bucket they filled, climbing up and down a ladder they carried from tree to tree, they earned about $3.75. Cherry work is sometimes compared to a casino: If the trees are full and there are few split cherries to pick around, the money can be unusually high for fieldwork, leading people to travel from California and elsewhere just for cherry season. But, Israel said, if trees \"don't have much, you're just walking around for hours.\" Today had been a good day. Not counting the three hours of driving or the cost of gas, he and Nayeli estimated that they each averaged $20 an hour. \"You have to go very quickly to earn that,\" Israel said.\n\nEarlier, wanting to show how hard it was to stretch that money, Guadalupe gave me a tour of the house, the best they could find within their budget. \"First, here,\" she said, pointing down at rough cement as I stepped through the front door, \"there is no floor.\" Israel had pulled up the carpet, so full of rat excrement that the children were getting sick. He'd made other repairs, too, but there was much more that needed fixing: a leaking roof, with mold visible in the ceilings and windows; no working electricity in the back of the house; a shower, kitchen sink and toilet that all drained directly into a puddle in the yard. It cost a thousand dollars a month, plus utilities, and the landlady, who wanted to move into the house herself, was threatening to have the sheriff evict them. Guadalupe concluded the tour in the unlit back hallway. \"We are essential, but we are in the shadows,\" she said. \"No one sees us.\"\n\nShe dished out bowls of rice and stew for dinner. The family joked about the familiar indignities of different crops they had worked -- the way hops can make your clothes smell like marijuana; how onion cutting requires a dangerous knife \"as sharp as a mother-in-law's tongue\" and can leave a smell in fabric that lasts a full year; the time a friend of Israel's was so exhausted during the cherry harvest that he fell asleep while picking and knocked his head on a tree branch. Nayeli made fun of the ancient boombox she and her dad sometimes took to the orchards, saying it was nearly the size of an air-conditioner yet still struggled to compete with the music of other workers. \"In the orchard, you don't play English music,\" she said. \"The language is Spanish.\"\n\nNayeli, who gave a speech at her virtual graduation from high school the week before, had her first job picking cherries, after school and on weekends, when she was 9. But she had no plans to keep following her parents' path. She had won a scholarship from the University of Washington and was saving her income from the cherry season to cover the cost of moving away.\n\nAnother steppe, another orchard. This one, between the Snake and Columbia Rivers, held 210 acres of cherries, 220 of apples and 40 of peaches and nectarines. It was the first day of the year's second harvest. Paul Carter, who manages the orchard for the large fruit company Stemilt, surveyed the morning shadows, the sun on the trees. \"We've invested, we've pruned, we've irrigated, and we've not got one dime back,\" he said. \"Everything's out there,\" unpicked and vulnerable.\n\nCarter remembered when he was young and his parents and grandparents used to come to Washington from their home in Arkansas to pick fruit, like lots of people did back then. These days, he added, \"I'm the only white boy around here.\" He was also one of the few people in the orchard who lived locally. Today there were nine pickers who lived in nearby towns, though all came by way of other places (one woman descended a ladder to explain that she lived in Pasco, but wasn't very comfortable being interviewed in Spanish -- she was originally from Guatemala, and her native language was Mam). Forty-five others had come from Mexico just for the season, to live and work at the orchards on temporary agricultural visas.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, the agricultural labor crisis in Washington became so acute that Lewis compared it to a pressure cooker: \"We were about to burst.\" Growers began turning to a little-used program that grants temporary work permits, known as H-2A visas, to foreign farmworkers. A present-day version of the midcentury Bracero program, for years it was used to bring Mexican fieldworkers to California, South American shepherds to the West and Caribbean sugar-cane workers to Florida. Washington State is now the second largest user of the system, which has also expanded rapidly across the country: Last year, the State Department issued 202,025 H-2A visas, compared with 31,892 in 2005. In order to employ workers on H-2A visas, farms are required to advertise for workers locally and come up short; they must also provide housing, transport and a minimum wage to guest workers and local ones alike, so as not to depress wages. These costs mean that growers view H-2A as a last resort, but one that they are turning to more and more. \"It's horribly expensive,\" said Carter, as masked workers picked another block of Rainiers, nestling them carefully into small, protective bins. But the alternative, he continued, is \"pure disaster. You're just on the prayer system\" at a time when \"a farmer's whole destiny is in his ability to get a whole bunch of people.\"\n\nIn March, as the virus continued to spread around the world, the State Department announced that it would suspend visa processing, effectively shutting off the flow of seasonal agricultural workers coming from Mexico. Industry groups and Sonny Perdue, the secretary of agriculture, pushed back with such urgency that the decision was quickly reversed; the State Department announced that the H-2A program would be continued as \"a national security priority.\" It's meaningful, said Daniel Costa, a lawyer and immigration expert at the Economic Policy Institute, that the H-2A system is one of the only parts of the immigration system that hasn't shut down because of the pandemic: \"The government has moved heaven and earth to make sure companies can keep employing these workers.\" Even though the visas were reopened, said Kristin Kershaw Snapp, the director of corporate affairs for Domex Superfresh Growers, another major Washington fruit company, the threat that they might not be was enough to realize how precariously the system was propped up. \"That was a very scary 12 hours,\" she said.\n\nIn light of the pandemic, Washington's governor, Jay Inslee, convened committees to draft new safety requirements for agricultural work sites. Social distancing was a particularly fraught issue for H-2A workers, who usually travel in employer-provided vans and live close together in shared housing or hotels. (Other cherry workers are often squeezed into tents, which the cherry industry, in an effort to forestall even worse conditions, has been given unique permission to use for housing.) Unexpected fragility was everywhere: If the state, for example, banned the use of bunk beds, as Oregon had, some farms could lose half of their emergency work force. In the end, Washington allowed bunk beds, though only if workers were organized into \"cohorts\" of 15, kept separate from other groups and slept head-to-toe to create more distance between their faces. The farmworkers' union Familias Unidas por La Justicia filed a lawsuit, arguing that the rules were a product of industry pressures and not supported by best practices in public health. But the court, which didn't find that the state had acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner, upheld the decision. In May, Lauren Jenks, an assistant secretary for the state health department, told The Los Angeles Times that the cohort system wouldn't remove all risk. \"This is just sort of a terrible math right now,\" she said.\n\nIn the Stemilt orchard, a young man from Oaxaca, working on his first H-2A visa, told me the work is \"marvelous,\" the pay far more than he could make at home. When the crew stopped for \"lunch\" -- it was 9 a.m., a sign of how early they started -- a 57-year-old from Michoac\u00e1n, working his 12th annual contract, said that he was glad for wages that had helped pay for surgery for his son and that he had grown used to being able to see his family only part of the year. When he first started coming to the U.S., he often worked alongside local workers, but now he mostly sees other guest workers: \"We were few, and with time it's been growing and growing and growing.\" (A month later, in July, a group of H-2A workers who worked for Stemilt in 2017 sued the company for using what they said was an illegal production quota system, threatening workers with termination if they failed to pick enough apples in a day. A Stemilt spokesman declined to comment, citing unresolved legal proceedings.)\n\nDan Fazio, a co-founder of the Washington Farm Labor Association, which helps growers bring in H-2A workers, sees the program as a good start toward a legal, well-regulated work force, though he adds that the costs and standards can be burdensome, especially for smaller-scale growers; he would like to see costs for housing passed on to workers, instead. When this year's extra, last-minute requirements were added, he said, \"a lot of people threw up their hands and said, 'I can't do it.'\"\n\nSome worker advocates, by contrast, call H-2A a modern system of indentured servitude. Workers often enter the program heavily in debt, because of travel costs (employers are required to reimburse these, but a recent survey of workers found they often don't) and because of the exorbitant fees they pay to recruiters in their home country. Upon arrival, they are dependent on their employers for their right to be in the U.S., which, coupled with the debt, makes it difficult for them to stand up to unsafe working conditions, wage theft or retaliation. A few years ago when H-2A workers at a blueberry farm in northern Washington called for a work stoppage to protest conditions after a 28-year-old worker fell ill on the job and then died, dozens of them were fired and then deported.\n\n\"They're seen as loyal,\" Costa said, \"but it's because they have no other options.\" This spring, as companies rolled out temporary \"hero\" pay for front-line workers, and the Trump administration offered billions in aid to farmers and ranchers, it suggested the opposite -- a pay cut -- for H-2A workers. (So far, there has been no cut.) Florida's governor, Ron DeSantis, blamed his state's skyrocketing cases on \"overwhelmingly Hispanic\" farmworkers, not stopping to question why they might be unable to stay home or what would happen to the food system if they did.\n\nAs workers kept Stemilt's orchards going in April and May, the company used proactive testing and quarantines to contain an outbreak of asymptomatic cases at its H-2A housing; there were no reported deaths. But when harvest season arrived, cases spread at other orchards. In late July, after the virus broke out among workers at Gebbers Farms, one of the state's largest cherry and apple growers and an employer of more than 3,000 H-2A workers, the state began an investigation into conditions at its labor housing, where bunk beds were still in use despite the farm keeping workers in cohorts of 42 instead of 15, as mandated by the state. (A company spokeswoman said that Gebbers applied for a variance to use a larger cohort system and didn't receive a response. After the outbreak began, it reduced its cohort size to 14 people.) As of early August, at least 200 workers showed symptoms or tested positive, and there were two confirmed deaths: Juan Carlos Santiago Rincon, a Mexican in his 30s; and Earl Edwards, a 63-year-old Jamaican. Reached by phone, Edwards's wife, Marcia Smith-Edwards, said that he was placed in the isolation unit on the farm and received no medical care during his illness. (In a statement, the Gebbers Farm spokeswoman said that safety officers checked on sick employees and that thermometers and transport to a hospital were available.) When Smith-Edwards last spoke to her husband, on July 31, he told her, \"I am being treated in America like hogs and pigs.\" Later that evening, she received a call that he had died.\n\nMany local farmworkers have mixed feelings about the system that employs the people they call \"los contratados.\" Some told me they resent that H-2A workers have their housing and transport paid for while they struggle to pay their own bills, that they hear about cases where employers, illegally, pay local workers less than workers on visas. \"What about those of us who are already here?\" asked Josefina Luciano, a farmworker and advocate who started working in dairies after years in fruit, asparagus and onions. \"Why don't you value my work?\" Still, when she talked about the contratados -- staying away from town in isolated housing, afraid of reprisals for speaking up -- her eyes filled with tears. \"They're disposable,\" she said. \"Same as us.\"\n\nOne June morning early in cherry season, the sun rose on hundreds of cars and trucks, many of them with California plates, parked along the edge of a long orchard off a dusty road. In the rows of trees, many people were unmasked, working quickly, and clusters formed where they poured cherries from their buckets into bins. Erik Nicholson, a national vice president of the United Farm Workers, stayed on the road, which was public property, and called out to the pickers in Spanish as they carried their ladders from row to row. \"How many buckets for you so far?\" he asked. \"Are they giving you masks?\"\n\nI met Nicholson, who lives in Eastern Washington and has worked with farmworkers for three decades, in the parking lot of a corner market at 4 that morning. (Farmworkers were specifically excluded from the National Labor Relations Act, and now fewer than 2 percent of them are unionized, but the U.F.W. sees its role as broad advocacy of their rights.) Nicholson had led negotiations with growers' organizations to help craft the state's new safety regulations, and now he was spending his days on the road, checking on orchards to see if the regulations were being followed. That meant tapping into the informal network -- text messages, word of mouth -- that local workers use to find the best places for picking. A man who stopped to get coffee had shown Nicholson a text message with the address of this morning's orchard. The drive was at least 45 minutes from his home in Prosser, but word was the picking would be good.\n\nNicholson checked the portable toilets and hand-washing stations, required this year to be placed every 110 yards instead of the usual 440 (for workers, a long walk is a costly use of time), and found an unusable sink, stuffed with wet paper towels, and bathrooms without any toilet paper. He pointed the mess out to a supervisor, who said a cleaning service would arrive soon; about 20 minutes later, it did. In a few hours, after the state's Department of Labor and Industries opened for the day, Nicholson would file a safety complaint against the orchard owner, Finley Cherries, one of more than 30 reports that he and two colleagues would file about infractions they saw at various farms. (More than six weeks later, he received an official reply to this one: \"Could not be substantiated.\") At the public talks he sometimes gives, he asks people to hold a strawberry and then to think about the hands that last handled it: Did that person have access to sick leave, to clean bathrooms, to soap and water, to health care? Often, the people he's talking to react by putting the strawberry down.\n\nMany of the orchard workers who talked to Nicholson -- cautiously, while supervisors in idling white trucks weren't pointedly watching -- were more interested in discussing their pay than the pandemic. A man who looked to be in his 60s complained that the per-bucket rate was lower than he expected. \"It's robbery,\" he said, \"but what are we going to do?\" At 7:20 a.m., after two hours of work, a group of young men climbed into a pickup truck and drove away. The pay was too low, they said, the picking standards too exacting. Tomorrow, they would return to California, hoping for something better.\n\nGrowers and pickers talk differently about the price of farm work. Labor represents an ever-higher percentage of growers' spending -- these days, Lewis said, cherry growers spend as much as 75 percent of their annual production costs in the few weeks of their harvest -- and their revenue per bin is declining. Fazio shared a common joke in apple circles: Farmers lose money on every box, but don't worry, they're going to make up for it in volume. But pickers, too, are losing. They haven't seen their per-bucket pay go up for at least a decade, even as their costs of living have risen substantially, and despite shortages, farmworkers remain one of the lowest-paid groups in America. Philip Martin, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of California, Davis, says that when piece rates do not rise with minimum wages, slower workers are squeezed out, leaving the rest to work fast and with higher risks. With H-2A workers, Martin added, \"we're getting the N.F.L. of pickers.\"\n\nWithout the power to set prices, growers have struggled to compete with cheaper production costs elsewhere in the world, and more and more of them are leaving the industry. What's left, increasingly, are companies with the size and the money -- or, as is becoming more common, with the necessary cadre of outside investors -- to adopt expensive new technologies meant to reduce their reliance on people. This trend toward consolidation and automation is longstanding, says DeVaney, of the Washington State Tree Fruit Association, but most pronounced in bad years; he expects the financial stress of the pandemic to speed it up. Nicholson says he wonders where that will leave rural communities that have already been hollowed out.\n\nAfter being asked to leave the orchard, we bought breakfast tacos and ate them in a park, where Nicholson gestured at the trailers across the road, the quiet, dingy downtown down the street. When people are replaced with technology, he said, \"the money is not going to stay here. It's going to go to Mountain View or Palo Alto.\" For fruit such as cherries, Martin expects some combination of three possible futures: more mechanization and ever fewer people; a major expansion of guest-worker programs; and the replacement of American produce with imports. This happened not long ago to the Washington asparagus industry, which largely collapsed in the face of cheaper Peruvian asparagus. Around the world, the portion of food that is imported is rising fast.\n\nIt wasn't just the U.S. that panicked when the pandemic threatened migrant labor. In Germany, the government encouraged students and unemployed people to step in after borders closed but ended up allowing experienced workers to be airlifted from Romania and Bulgaria instead. In Britain, where Brexit's impact on migration left 16 million apples to rot last year, the government's patriotic, pandemic-era \"Pick for Britain\" campaign mostly failed, also leading to airlifts.\n\nMartin quoted a dictum from the economist Varden Fuller that he thinks of often: that modern agriculture depends, for its seasonal labor force, on poverty at home and misery abroad. He has calculated that the cost of raising the wages of farmworkers in the United States by 40 percent, bringing workers above the poverty line, would -- even if it were footed solely by consumers -- increase a typical household's spending on fresh fruit and vegetables by just $21 a year.\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, there was outrage at images of all the food wasted -- rivers of dumped milk, fields of plowed-under potatoes -- when restaurants and schools closed, airplanes and cargo ships failed to depart and the workings of the food system were thrown out of whack. DeVaney wondered if shortages and back orders would make people realize how much work and how much vulnerability is hidden when they click an \"order\" button and groceries show up at their door: Would there be a real effort to make things more resilient? Or would people go back to being \"complacent and oblivious?\" Kershaw Snapp, of Domex Superfresh Growers, was used to thinking of farmers as eminently adaptable, simply because they dealt so frequently with disaster. (She remembered a time a warehouse burned down overnight, and an alternative plan for storing freshly picked fruit was in place by 8 a.m.) After the virus, though, things suddenly looked different. \"Everything is more fragile than I thought it was,\" she said.\n\nIn Sunnyside, Israel and Guadalupe found a new small house, where the plumbing and electricity worked and the deposit was within reach. The workdays stayed long. They had little hope that even the small changes since the pandemic -- things like more access to soap in the orchard -- would last after it was over. But they could still imagine that things might be different.\n\nOne day while talking with the family, I told them that I was also interviewing other people who interact, in different ways, with the cherries they pick: growers, consumers, vendors. What should I ask them? Israel wanted to know if there could be a path to legalization; Nayeli if wages could be raised. But it was Guadalupe who answered the quickest. \"If we are important,\" she said.\n\nOutside, the heat of summer beat down on dry hills and lush orchards alike. Every day, hands filled buckets, buckets filled bins and, one by one, across the state, the cherries were plucked. By the thousands, then the millions and finally the billions -- an exuberant bounty corralled into neat, sellable stacks by dusty roadsides.\n\nEventually, the cherries began to fade, but the peaches and apricots and nectarines grew heavy and ripe and the first of the apples reddened. The virus continued its spread, heat advisories kept children inside and still the fruit was relentless. Every day workers carried their ladders from row to row. Every day the fruit of their labor was stacked into refrigerated trucks and sped away.",

        "body": "As a teen, TikTok creates stress in my life. When I hang out with friends, they often ask if I want to make a TikTok with them. I never suggest it, but it nearly always comes up. I want to be nice and say yes, but then I worry that other friends will see the clip and feel excluded that they weren't part of it. At times, TikToks have made me feel separate from my friends, and I don't want to make anyone else feel that. How can I be polite and still respect my friends' feelings?\n\nM.\n\nYou sound like an exceedingly kind person. It's not always the case that someone takes a hurtful experience -- say, being excluded from friends' TikToks -- and resolves not to hurt others the same way. I believe that your empathy will serve you well.\n\nLet me suggest two ways to approach your friends. If you really don't enjoy dreaming up concepts for clips, filming them and sharing them on social media, just say, \"Let's do something else. I need a breather from TikTok.\" You may be surprised that others agree. Sometimes posting can feel like pressure.\n\nBut if the only thing stopping you is your fear of hurting absent friends, why not include a few when you hang out? Or invite others to make TikToks with you later? We can't all be invited to everything. And much of social life is an accident: being in the right place at the right time. Better to expand the pool of people who are in those places than reject fun opportunities when they arise. (And never stop being so thoughtful!)\n\nBabe, Are You Trying to Kill Me?\n\nMy boyfriend flew to Tulum for a vacation. I refused to go because I didn't think it was safe. I have an autoimmune disease that puts me at greater risk for developing severe symptoms of Covid-19. Now, I see pictures of my boyfriend going to parties in Tulum, getting spa treatments and not wearing a mask. He won't commit to getting tested the day he returns. In March, he was the one panicking! How do I get him to understand that his behavior is potentially dangerous for my health?\n\nGIRLFRIEND\n\nI don't want to go overboard. You haven't said how serious your relationship is or how you expressed your concerns to your boyfriend. Still, saying \"I see red flags here\" is a big understatement. This guy is prioritizing a good (and seemingly reckless) time in Mexico over his and your well-being.\n\nA medical note: You are placing too much faith in testing on the day your boyfriend returns from vacation. Testing is important, but there may be a lag between infection with the virus and testing positive for Covid-19. The only safe alternative is for him to quarantine for a period. Many states recommend 14 days.\n\nNow, six months into this pandemic, your question isn't rocket science. If your boyfriend refuses to wear a mask or observe social distancing and other sensible safety precautions, consider making his post-vacation quarantine a permanent one. Why would you want a boyfriend who doesn't care about keeping you or himself safe?\n\nNot the Therapist\n\nI recently reconnected with a person from my past on whom I am now developing a major crush. The feeling is mutual, which is great. But the other day, we discovered that we share a much-loved therapist. I've always wanted to date an evolved person who goes to a therapist -- just not mine! I also get the sense that neither of us wants to find a new therapist. Help!\n\nANONYMOUS\n\nCrushes are mostly fantasy -- and fun! But there's a long road between a crush, however \"major,\" and a relationship that's likely to cause your therapist ethical problems or you and your friend discomfort. For now, just enjoy getting to know each other again.\n\nSure, tell your therapist about the crush. But why borrow trouble? If this spark of interest develops into a romance -- or if you, your friend or the therapist feel uncomfortable -- your therapist can help one or both of you find new therapists. Your focus on therapy, though, instead of the relationship, suggests this may be a ways off.\n\nTo Give, or Not to Give\n\nWe received an evite to a virtual wedding. We weren't on the guest list for the original wedding (in real life) which was canceled as result of the coronavirus pandemic. That was fine with us because we're only casual friends of the groom's parents. Now that we're invited to the Zoom wedding and \"celebration,\" are we expected to give a gift? We barely know the groom and never met the bride.\n\nALICE\n\nNine out of 10 wedding questions I receive are about gifts. I find this nearly as odd as the pent-up anger over so-called \"gift grabs\" (being invited to weddings where we think we're only wanted for our gifts).\n\nI can't tell whether this invitation is welcome or suspect to you. But it's pretty simple either way: If you want to go to the Zoom wedding, say yes, then log in and send a token gift. If you don't, decline politely and call it a day.\n\nFor help with your awkward situation, send a question to SocialQ@nytimes.com, to Philip Galanes on Facebook or @SocialQPhilip on Twitter.",

Patel\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida has stressed that the state's coronavirus crisis is largely limited to the very old. He has repeatedly noted that Florida has seen more coronavirus deaths in people over the age of 90 than in all people under 65. But data reviewed by The New York Times shows that's changing: Deaths were greater in July for residents under 65 than for those over 90.\n\nAdditionally, more Floridians in the 25-44 age group died in July than had died in the previous four months of the pandemic combined, a review of Florida Department of Health data shows. More than 200 have died in all.\n\nAlthough they still make up a relatively small number of the more than 8,000 total coronavirus deaths in the state, the number of younger adults who died of the disease quadrupled last month, underscoring a bitter mathematical reality: As more and more young people test positive for the coronavirus, more of them will die.\n\nTali Elfassy, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Miami, said that while the case fatality rate is lower for younger people, there has recently been a huge shift in the age distribution of those getting infected -- from middle-aged and older individuals, to younger adults.\n\n\"Even if the majority of people who are dying from Covid are older individuals, the fact that we have this demographic shift toward younger people becoming infected is going to give us an increase in deaths among younger people,\" she said.\n\nNationally, the share of all deaths that occur in younger age groups remains small -- just 38 coronavirus deaths out of every 1,000 in July were attributed to younger people, but that is up from 22 per 1,000 in May.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-11T15:05:20.403Z A Russian vaccine works 'effectively enough,' President Putin said. But it hasn't completed Phase III tests. Virus cases have surpassed 20 million worldwide. Trump considers a rule that would block Americans thought to have the virus from returning home. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThrough July, about 3,800 people in the United States in the age group had died from coronavirus, according to figures published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That would make the coronavirus one of the leading causes of death for this age group, roughly comparable to the number of younger people who were murdered over the same time period in recent years.\n\nAnd these figures include only deaths officially attributed to the virus. The overall death count in the U.S. is far higher than normal this year, suggesting that the virus's toll is even greater than the official numbers show. More than 96,000 people age 25-44 have died so far this year, compared with an average of 78,000 at this point over the previous five years.\n\nHealth officials have worried that young people have been overly reckless in resuming social activities at parties and bars, and the number of infections among younger people has soared. However, the young people who are dying are not necessarily those who got sick at a party.\n\nAmong the young who succumbed to the coronavirus recently in Florida were a 26-year-old convenience store clerk and a 42-year-old restaurant cook. At least three of the people who died worked in residential facilities caring for the ill and disabled; one of them was 41 and two were 31. One 35-year-old woman worked at the front desk of a hospital.\n\nRecords also show the people who died from the virus in Florida among the young were disproportionately Black. Among people age 25 to 44, African-Americans make up 18 percent of Florida's population but have accounted for 44 percent of deaths. Black Floridians over 65 are dying at twice the rate of white residents, but among younger adults, the death rate is nearly three times as high.\n\nDeaths Among Black Young Adults Are Disproportionately Higher\n\nAfrican-Americans make up 15.5 percent of Florida's population and 19.4 percent of those who have died from the virus. The disparity is most stark when accounting for age.\n\nBlack share of state population\n\nPercentage of deaths\n\nAge 25-44\n\n18%\n\n44%\n\n45-64\n\n14%\n\n33%\n\n65-89\n\n9%\n\n18%\n\n90+\n\n7%\n\n9%\n\nBlack share of state population\n\nPercentage of deaths\n\nAge 25-44\n\n18%\n\n44%\n\n45-64\n\n14%\n\n33%\n\n65-89\n\n9%\n\n18%\n\n90+\n\n7%\n\n9%\n\nBlack share of state population\n\nPercentage of deaths\n\nAge 25-44\n\n18%\n\n44%\n\n45-64\n\n14%\n\n33%\n\n65-89\n\n9%\n\n18%\n\n90+\n\n7%\n\n9%\n\nSource: Florida Department of Health; Census Bureau\n\nBy Jugal K. Patel\n\nMore than a thousand Latinos in Florida have also died from the virus, though their death rate for most age groups is comparable to the death rate for non-Hispanic Whites.\n\nMany of the younger victims had diabetes or were obese, highlighting the risks people with health problems face no matter their age.\n\nRobert Ruiz, of Sebring, Fla., worked at a center for people with traumatic brain injuries. He got sick with the virus from one of the patients.\n\n\"He was only 31,\" his sister, Chenique Mills, said. \"That's why this is so unbelievable. He's not supposed to be gone. This is crazy.\"\n\nMr. Ruiz was overweight but had no underlying medical conditions, Ms. Mills said. His Facebook account is filled with selfies taken at the gym, where he was trying to slim down, she said. A born-again Christian, he was a rap artist who enjoyed performing at church functions.\n\nHe died July 12 in his bedroom, two days after the onset of symptoms. The coronavirus test administered every two weeks by his workplace came back positive two days later. He left behind a toddler.\n\n\"He was blowing it off. He didn't think it was that serious, either,\" Ms. Mills said. \"This whole 'you're young, it's not going to affect you' is irritating.\"\n\nMr. DeSantis said last month that the median age of new coronavirus cases had reached a low of 33, down from 50s and 60s in March and April. Records show that when tens of thousands of young people started testing positive shortly after the state reopened, the average age began to sneak back up, as young people infected the older people around them.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nThe median age now is 42.\n\nAt the peak of the crisis, the United States saw a point at which 400 young people were dying each week. The most detailed federal data on coronavirus deaths lags behind state and local case reports by several weeks, and does not fully reflect the current surge in deaths. Still, the figures show that nationwide, the toll is approaching 4,000.\n\nWhat's happening in Florida played out earlier in the Northeast. While much attention was given to tragedies at nursing homes and assisted living facilities, nearly 700 younger people died from the coronavirus in New York City alone. In New Jersey, 370 people in the 25 to 44 age group died.\n\nThe difference in Florida is that the increase in deaths among young people is occurring now.\n\nCoronavirus Deaths by Month and Age Group\n\nFlorida residents over 65 make up the vast majority of coronavirus deaths, but there has been substantial growth in deaths among younger age groups. Gov. Ron DeSantis often notes that deaths are more frequent for residents over 90 than for those under 65, but this was not true for deaths recorded in July.\n\nUnder 65\n\n65 to 89\n\n90+\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\nApril\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly\n\nUnder 65\n\n65 to 89\n\n90+\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\nApril\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly\n\nUnder 65\n\n65 to 89\n\n90+\n\n1,500\n\n1,000\n\n500\n\nApril\n\nMay\n\nJune\n\nJuly\n\nSource: Florida Department of Health\n\nBy Jugal K. Patel\n\n\"We're seeing more deaths among younger adults,\" said Dr. Russell Vega, the chief medical examiner who oversees the counties of Sarasota, Manatee and Desoto.\n\nConsidering that young people make up more than half of new reported infections, some believe the overall risk to the young is negligible.\n\nStill, health experts continue to urge younger people to take caution. \"This is not to be taken lightly,\" said Chighaf Bakour, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of South Florida. \"These are young people -- they are not supposed to be dying at this age.\"\n\nMs. Bakour pointed out that tracking deaths only tells a portion of the story since coronavirus infections can result in poor outcomes -- like chronic breathing problems and other long-term health complications -- without resulting in death.\n\nCindy Prins, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida, said the public should expect more deaths among young Americans.\n\n\"We've had this notion in people's heads that it's OK because young people don't get sick from this virus and young people certainly don't die from it,\" Dr. Prins said. \"Well, that isn't true. Young people are getting sick. Young people are dying.\"\n\nSeveral Florida-based epidemiologists said that coronavirus deaths among young people in the state may be helping to expose long-existing social and health inequities between Black and white people. African-Americans, they said, were more likely to have co-morbidities, like diabetes or obesity, even at a young age, which could make them more vulnerable to the virus and put them at a higher risk of death.\n\nInfections can be transmitted among ethnic minorities and economically disadvantaged people because they don't have the luxury to socially distance in their homes, which are often tight quarters, they said. Many of them also work essential jobs that already put them at risk, and have to use public transportation to get to in-person work.\n\n\"You have this double impact of minorities being more likely to contract Covid and then more likely to die because of the chronic conditions,\" Ms. Elfassy said.\n\nImelda Bernardo believed that her son, Alexander G. Bacani Bernardo, would recover from the coronavirus. After all, he was only 22, and didn't suffer from underlying illnesses. He weighed about 300 pounds, but he was tall and muscular, she said.\n\n\"Even though he's kind of big, he's fine. He's 22, he's good, he was fine,\" Mrs. Bernardo, 49, said.\n\nMother and son, immigrants from the Philippines, both worked in a nursing home in Jacksonville -- Mrs. Bernardo as a dietary cook and he as a dietary aide. While he was sick at home with his family, Mr. Bernardo is thought to have infected his father, Alvin, 49, who was a smoker with diabetes and hypertension, according to state health records.\n\nThe son died on July 17. His father, two days later.",

        "body": "Jujamcyn Theaters, the operator of five Broadway houses, asserts that it was wrongfully denied insurance coverage after the pandemic forced it to shut down.\n\nJujamcyn Theaters, the operator of five Broadway houses, has sued its insurers for denying it millions of dollars that the theater company says it deserves as payment for the losses suffered during the monthslong coronavirus pandemic shutdown.\n\nThe theater company said that one of the insurance companies, Federal Insurance Company, denied it \"even a penny\" of pandemic-related coverage, while the other company, Pacific Indemnity Company, paid it a fraction of what the Broadway operator believes it should be paid.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York on Tuesday, is the latest challenge to the insurance industry's refusal of coverage for the deluge of business losses experienced during the pandemic.\n\nAfter Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York shut down theaters in March and then closed all nonessential businesses, arts institutions of all kinds filed insurance claims for business income loss. But the insurance industry has issued a torrent of denials, arguing that its policies never promised this kind of coverage in the first place and that fulfilling all of these requests would bankrupt the industry.\n\nOn March 12, when Mr. Cuomo ordered an end to all gatherings of more than 500 people -- effectively shuttering all 41 Broadway theaters -- Jujamcyn was forced to cancel the hit musical \"Hadestown\" at the Walter Kerr Theater, as well as four other shows, including \"The Book of Mormon\" and \"Frozen.\"\n\nThe theater company submitted its business income loss claim to Federal Insurance, but the insurer denied coverage, saying that there was no \"direct physical loss or damage,\" which is needed to trigger payments. Such policies are designed to replace lost income in cases of building damage or when a civil authority has shut down the surrounding area. In its lawsuit, Jujamcyn argues that the coronavirus pandemic does cause physical loss or damage, explaining that the virus can adhere to surfaces for days and linger in the air inside buildings for hours.\n\nIn a July letter to the insurer's parent company, Chubb, Jujamcyn's lawyer requested that the insurer withdraw its denial, writing that its theaters might not generate box office revenue for the rest of the year and that its business income losses may exceed $29 million.\n\n\"Chubb has seized upon excuses to abandon its insured in its time of need,\" the lawyer, Jeffrey L. Schulman, wrote.\n\nChubb, which is also the parent company of Pacific Indemnity, is a common insurer of arts organizations. Weeks into the pandemic, the company's chief executive, Evan Greenberg, caused a stir among clients when he said in an earnings call that business interruption insurance \"doesn't cover Covid-19\" and that \"the industry will fight this tooth and nail.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIn a statement responding to Jujamcyn's lawsuit, Chubb said that it had paid out millions of dollars this year for the pandemic-related disruption of Broadway performances but that most standard property insurance policies do not cover pandemic risk when it comes to business interruption.\n\n\"Creating false expectations about coverage that does not exist, including filing baseless lawsuits, will not solve this crisis,\" it said.\n\nJujamcyn said in its lawsuit that it should also be granted insurance payments based on the fact that state and local government had shut its theaters down. The state's phased reopening does not yet include indoor theaters.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, which accuses both Federal Insurance and Pacific Indemnity of a breach of contract, part of the reason that Jujamcyn's business income insurance claim was denied was because the governmental orders did not prohibit access to the theaters, meaning theater employees were not barred from entering and checking on the buildings. Mr. Schulman called that a \"ludicrous position.\"\n\nThe second part of the lawsuit argues that Pacific Indemnity, which provides Jujamcyn with performance disruption coverage, was wrong in its decision to only grant the theater company one payment of $250,000 for its five theaters. The insurance company said that the pandemic qualified as a single \"occurrence,\" requiring only one performance disruption payout. Jujamcyn countered that the insurer was suffering from a \"serious case of seller's remorse\" and actually owed it more than $1 million.",

        "body": "From a Staten Island bakery to a boiler factory in Queens, these mom and pops, all over 100 years old, having staying power.\n\nThe number of small businesses in New York City closing because of the pandemic -- more than 2,800 since March -- has been stark. But some independent family businesses in the metropolitan area -- all deemed essential -- not only operated throughout the worst part of the outbreak and are still going strong, but also survived 20th-century crises like the Great Depression and World War II. Here are a few of them.\n\nC.O. BigelowGreenwich Village, Manhattan\n\nThe Village Apothecary Shoppe, founded by a Vermont doctor in 1838, was passed from employee to employee over the next 100 years, one of whom gave it its current name. In 1939 a Polish pharmacist, William Ginsberg, turned it into a family business, and today four generations of Ginsberg pharmacists have run Bigelow, which is part pharmacy, part boutique, part museum.\n\nDuring World War II, the drugstore had a penicillin window that was allowed to remain lit while the city shut down and went dark for air raid drills. During the blackout of 1977, Bigelow's soda fountain served customers 24 hours a day. And on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Ian Ginsberg, the current owner, watched the towers fall as waves of people ran up Sixth Avenue. He stayed at the store that day, sleeping in a lift chair in the surgical department.\n\nSince the pandemic began, longtime customers have been calling nonstop. \"Most people get their medical info from those great medical journals Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, so we deal with the fallout from that and have to calm everyone down,\" Mr. Ginsberg said.\n\nSales are down, but Mr. Ginsberg remains optimistic.\n\n\"Bigelow is a place people want to go to,\" he said. \"You never say, 'I want to go to a chain drugstore like CVS.' The minute we're a 'have to,' we're dead.\"\n\nHoltermann's BakeryGreat Kills, Staten Island\n\nWhen Claus Holtermann, a German immigrant, opened his Staten Island bakery in 1878, he delivered bread orders by foot. In the early 1930s, his son Albert built a new storefront and kitchen with his own hands. Since then, the bakery's original (and giant) dough mixers have worked around the clock to produce family specialties like long, narrow Pullman loaves and santart cakes (a ring of dough and fruit, like a denser version of a Bundt cake).\n\nEthel Holtermann, 90, remembers railroad cars of rationed flour deliveries arriving during World War II. Staten Island was still rural then, with dirt roads. But the arrival of the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964 changed everything.\n\nHoltermann's endured some trying times as the neighborhood changed around it. In the mid-20th century, the city developed and introduced Fresh Kills Landfill, which the Holtermanns vehemently opposed, with good reason: It was basically next door and would become one of the largest dumps in the world. As such, the Environmental Protection Agency would conduct regular water tests around the bakery, which had to take extra health precautions, Ms. Holtermann said. The bakery's patience paid off: The landfill closed in 2001 and is now a cutting-edge green space.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T08:59:32.204Z The White House announces a major virus test-kit deal, just days after the C.D.C. moved to discourage testing. Trump promises a coronavirus vaccine by the end of the year, and boasts of his pandemic response. Hurricane Laura and the virus collide in Louisiana and Texas. See more updates More live coverage: Markets Richfield FarmsClifton, N.J.\n\nThe Van Breeman family, Dutch immigrants, opened Richfield Farms in 1917. They would ship vegetables to New York City via the Morris Canal, which reminded them of the waterways in the Netherlands, according to family records. They also opened a farm stand in Clifton, which offered hot dogs, grilled cheese and sodas to soldiers training in the area during World War II.\n\nDuring the Great Depression, growing food and selling vegetable seeds saved the family business. Since then, the farm has diversified; it now has a retail garden center, a landscape design department and a nursery, in addition to its produce market and organic farm.\n\n\"People have told me this type of industry is not really impacted by recessions, depressions or epidemics,\" said Will Morton, a fourth-generation owner of Richfield Farms. \"We actually see an uptick in business when these things happen.\"\n\nThe farm is perfectly positioned, yet again.\n\n\"It's been busy,\" Mr. Morton said. \"Everyone is home. They're cooking. They're gardening. They're looking at their yards, they're looking at their neighbors' yards.\"\n\nSahadi'sBrooklyn Heights\n\nWith its bulk bins heaving with Middle Eastern ingredients and its popular prepared foods counter, this 125-year-old international grocery store has earned a cult following.\n\nAbrahim Sahadi, a Lebanese immigrant, opened A. Sahadi and Co. on Washington Street in Lower Manhattan -- what was then known as Little Syria -- in 1895. Wade Sahadi, his nephew, created Sahadi's Importing Company in 1941.\n\nIn 1948, construction of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel forced the store to relocate to Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn.\n\nFor Sahadi's, stresses on its importing business have mostly been caused by political issues in foreign countries, but the Sept. 11 attacks proved to be a big challenge too, said Ron Sahadi (Wade's grandson).\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider.

The worry then, he said, was whether people would continue to support a Middle Eastern grocery store. They did.\n\nLike many stores in old buildings, Sahadi's is not ideal for socially distant shopping. This spring, it closed to the public and focused on deliveries. But now its loyal customers are back, wearing masks.\n\nSussman-AutomaticLong Island City, Queens\n\nIn 1917, Arthur Sussman created a stand-alone boiler to heat steam irons for New York City's booming garment industry. At the onset of World War II, Mr. Sussman, working from his factory at Columbus Circle, supplied steam irons for military uniform makers. Soon thereafter, the factory relocated to Queens.\n\nBy the 1980s, much of the garment industry had moved overseas. The company transitioned to producing industrial boilers and steam generators for saunas.\n\n\"The industrial boiler division has always been strong in serving the scientific and health care communities,\" said Michael Pinkus, the company's current president. Throughout the pandemic, Sussman-Automatic has played a role in sterilizing respirator and ventilator parts.\n\nBut its home spa business has been doing well, too, just as it did in other difficult periods, like the 2008 recession and after Sept. 11.\n\n\"The primary impact of Sept. 11, 2008, and now this,\" Mr. Pinkus said, \"is the trend of looking at your home as the ultimate sanctuary, as a place to invest in, to spend quality time in.\"\n\nTeitel BrothersBelmont, the Bronx\n\nGilbert Teitel, 81, has worked at this Italian food imports store in some capacity since he was 8. He grew up in the upstairs apartment, where he watched his father and uncle, the store's founders, work in 24-hour shifts, replenishing the icebox in the days before refrigeration. He remembers stories of shoppers using ration books and coupons during World War II, when the shortage of olive oil and other Italian imports hit the store's bottom line. He watched property values plummet and crime rise when Belmont was rezoned in the 1960s.\n\nBut for Mr. Teitel, the pandemic is different.\n\n\"I have never seen anything like this in my life, and I don't think anyone else has. It's kind of disastrous,\" he said.\n\nBut he's still working. He chose the 105-year-old store over retirement because he enjoys discussing foods and socializing with customers, although he is having difficulty with the new normal.\n\n\"Everyone's wearing a mask and gloves. Only five people allowed in at a time. You have to stay six feet apart,\" he said. \"Sometimes I don't even recognize the customers because of the masks. It's taxing.\"",

        "body": "Impatient for a coronavirus vaccine, dozens of scientists around the world are giving themselves -- and sometimes, friends and family -- their own unproven versions.\n\nIn April, more than three months before any coronavirus vaccine would enter large clinical trials, the mayor of a picturesque island town in the Pacific Northwest invited a microbiologist friend to vaccinate him.\n\nThe exchange occurred on the mayor's Facebook page, to the horror of several Friday Harbor residents following it.\n\n\"Should I pop up and get your vaccine started?????,\" wrote Johnny Stine, who runs North Coast Biologics, a Seattle biotech company with a focus on antibodies. \"Don't worry -- I'm immune -- I have boosted myself five times with my vaccine.\"\n\n\"Sounds good,\" Farhad Ghatan, the mayor, wrote after a few follow-up questions.\n\nSeveral residents interjected skepticism in the exchange. They were swatted down by the mayor, who defended his friend of 25 years as a \"pharmaceutical scientist on the forefront.\" When residents raised additional concerns -- about Mr. Stine's credentials and the unfairness of encouraging him to visit San Juan Island despite travel restrictions -- Mr. Stine lobbed back vulgar insults. (The geekiest and least R-rated: \"I hope your lung epithelial cells over express ACE2 so you die more expeditiously from nCoV19.\")\n\nSeveral residents reported all of this to a variety of law enforcement and regulatory agencies. In June, the Washington attorney general filed a lawsuit against Mr. Stine not only for pitching the mayor with unsupported claims, but also for administering his unproven vaccine to about 30 people, charging each $400. In May, the Food and Drug Administration sent a letter warning Mr. Stine to stop \"misleadingly\" representing his product.\n\nAlthough his promotional tactics were unusual, Mr. Stine was far from the only scientist creating experimental coronavirus vaccines for themselves, family, friends and other interested parties. Dozens of scientists around the world have done it, with wildly varying methods, affiliations and claims.\n\nThe most impressively credentialed effort is the Rapid Deployment Vaccine Collaborative, or RaDVaC, which boasts the famous Harvard geneticist George Church among its 23 listed collaborators. (The research, however, is not happening on Harvard's campus: \"While professor Church's lab works on a number of Covid-19 research projects, he has assured Harvard Medical School that work related to the RaDVaC vaccine is not being done in his lab,\" a spokeswoman for Harvard Medical School said.)\n\nAmong the most tight-lipped projects is CoroNope, which refuses to name anyone involved because, according to the person responding to messages sent to the group's anonymous email account, the \"less than half a dozen\" biologists don't want to risk getting in trouble with the F.D.A. or with their employers.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-01T06:02:48.737Z As U.S. cases decline elsewhere, the Midwest sees a worrying spike. The virus is spreading much faster in Spain than anywhere else in Europe. Health care workers with Covid-19 may be going undiagnosed, according to a C.D.C. report. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nEach D.I.Y. effort is motivated, at least in part, by the same idea: Exceptional times demand exceptional actions. If scientists have the skills and gumption to assemble a vaccine on their own, the logic goes, they should do it. Defenders say that as long as they are measured about their claims and transparent about their process, we could all benefit from what they learn.\n\nBut critics say that no matter how well-intentioned, these scientists aren't likely to learn anything useful because their vaccines are not being put to the true test of randomized and placebo-controlled studies. What's more, taking these vaccines could cause harm -- whether from serious immune reactions and other side effects, or offering a false sense of protection.\n\n\"Take it yourself and there is not much anyone can or should do,\" said Jeffrey Kahn, the director of the Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. But once a person starts encouraging other people to try an unproven vaccine, \"you're headed right back to the days of patent medicine and quackery,\" he said, referring to a time when remedies were widely sold with colorful but misleading promises.\n\n'We are the animals'\n\nThe RaDVac vaccine effort, first reported on by MIT Technology Review, is different from Mr. Stine's project in two important ways. No one involved plans to charge for the vaccine. And unlike Mr. Stine's expletive-laden Facebook rants, RaDVaC has a 59-page scientific document to explain how it works and to guide others who might want to mix up the vaccine formulation on their own.\n\n\"The white paper is quite impressive,\" said Avery August, an immunologist at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., who is not involved with RaDVaC.\n\nBut the impetus of both projects is similar. In March, as Preston Estep, a genome scientist who lives in the Boston area, was reading about people dying amid the pandemic, he vowed not to sit complacently on the sidelines. He emailed some chemists, biologists, professors and doctors he knew to see whether any were interested in creating their own vaccine. Soon they had devised a formula for a peptide vaccine that could be administered through a spritz in the nose.\n\n\"It's very simple,\" Dr. Estep said. \"It consists of five ingredients you could mix together in a physician's office.\"\n\nThe key ingredient: tiny bits of viral proteins, or peptides, which the scientists ordered online. If all went well, the peptides would train the immune system to defend against the coronavirus, even with no actual virus present.\n\nIn late April, Dr. Estep joined several collaborators in a lab as they stirred the concoction and sprayed it in their nostrils. Dr. Church, a longtime mentor to Dr. Estep, said he took it alone in his bathroom to maintain social-distancing precautions.\n\nDr. Estep soon gave the vaccine to his 23-year-old son, and other collaborators also shared it with their family members. So far, no one has reported anything worse than a stuffy nose and a mild headache, Dr. Estep said. He has also refined the recipe, removing and adding peptides as new coronavirus research has emerged. So far, he has sprayed eight versions into his nose.\n\nA traditional drug development workflow begins with mouse or other animal studies. For RaDVaC, Dr. Estep said, \"we are the animals.\"\n\nBut without rigorous clinical trials, Dr. August said, there's no reliable way to know if it is safe or effective. He said he feared that the scientists' prestigious credentials might imply otherwise.\n\nDr. Church said that he respected the traditional evaluation process but that there should also be room for \"pre-research,\" and that most of what he had been involved with throughout his career -- including editing genes in human cells -- was considered \"fringe\" at first.\n\nAs of last week, Dr. Estep said, about 30 people in the United States, Sweden, Germany, China and Britain had taken the vaccine. He said a university professor in Brazil had told him he was considering making it in his lab and distributing it for free.\n\nVaccine via Facebook\n\nThere is a long history of scientists openly testing vaccines on themselves and their children, but in recent decades it has become less common, according to Susan E. Lederer, a medical historian at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. What's ethically and legally acceptable for testing and distributing your own medical product varies by institution and by country.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIn August, the Scientific Research Institute for Biological Safety Problems, a government institution in Kazakhstan, announced that seven employees had become the first people to try the Covid-19 vaccine they were developing. Russian and Chinese scientists affiliated with government and academic institutions have made similar pronouncements amid the pandemic.\n\nThe problem with Mr. Stine's product, according to Attorney General Bob Ferguson of Washington, is not that he took it. It's that he \"sold this so-called vaccine to people in Washington who are frightened and more apt to look for a miracle cure in the midst of a worldwide pandemic,\" Mr. Ferguson said in a statement. The lawsuit also cites Mr. Stine's unsupported safety and effectiveness claims.\n\nIn March, a few months after he said he vaccinated himself and his two teenage sons, he posted an ad on the Facebook page for North Coast Biologics. After decades of working with antibodies, Mr. Stine said in an interview, he knew that making a vaccine should be \"pretty goddamn easy.\"\n\nHe described a job that sounded a bit like writing Hollywood screenplays that never become movies. He makes antibodies that could be used against various pathogens and sells them to companies that could use them to develop drugs, but they probably won't. According to the Washington attorney general's suit, Mr. Stine's company was administratively dissolved in 2012.\n\nTo make his vaccine, he used a genetic sequence for the spike protein on the outside of the coronavirus to make a synthetic version. He put it in a saline solution, injected himself just under the surface of the skin of his upper arm and then took a so-called titer test to look for antibodies in his bloodstream. \"It took me 12 days from downloading the sequence to being titer positive,\" he said.\n\nIn his Facebook ad, he claimed that this left him immune to the virus and offered \"interested parties\" the opportunity to \"pay $400/person.\"\n\nAs part of an agreement that Mr. Stine eventually struck with prosecutors, he must refund all 30 people who had taken his vaccine.\n\nMr. Stine seemed amused by this, insisting that few people are likely to apply for a refund. His fee, he said, barely covered travel costs, and often he didn't charge.\n\nA man in his 60s in Montana, who asked to remain anonymous for privacy concerns, said he flew Mr. Stine out to inoculate him and his family. Now, he said, they have been able to return to \"normal behavior,\" such as having lunch with friends whose jobs put them at high risk for exposure. The man even joined Mr. Stine to visit a police officer friend in Washington State who had been diagnosed with Covid-19 and was \"on death's door.\" According to all three who were present, no one wore a mask. And Mr. Stine sat close to the sick officer in an enclosed space as he gave him a treatment.\n\nMr. Stine says his vaccine is similar to a recombinant vaccine being developed by the University of Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania. He also claims that a shot will not only protect people against the virus, but also treat those who have it. Dr. Louis Falo, a lead researcher on University of Pittsburgh's effort, said he was skeptical that Mr. Stine's vaccine could be safe or effective based on how it was assembled. Even if it was, he said, it's unlikely it would help sick people.\n\nIn the 1990s, Mr. Stine worked for Patrick Gray, a molecular biologist who contributed to the discovery of a hepatitis B vaccine and is now the chief executive of a biotech company.\n\nDr. Gray said in an interview that the science Mr. Stine published at Icos, the biotech company where they worked together, was \"sound\" but that the young scientist had a penchant for making too much of too little. \"Johnny was in a hurry to publish his work and advance his career,\" he said. \"We often insisted on more confirmation and more controls.\"\n\n\"Regarding his current scientific efforts, I don't believe Johnny is a 'scam artist,' but he has ignored F.D.A. regulations necessary for drug development,\" he wrote in an email. \"It's just not possible for an individual like Johnny to create a viable vaccine.\"\n\nThe mayor of Friday Harbor said he regretted responding to Mr. Stine's message on his Facebook wall, instead of privately. But he does not see why he should apologize for accepting his friend's formulation for free. \"I'd rather have the chance of having some protection than no protection at all and waiting and waiting,\" Mr. Ghatan said.\n\nThe controversy, however, has derailed their plans to meet, he said. But if another opportunity arises to get the jab, he said, \"I would.\"",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Radhika Kumar goes to work every morning hoping to save lives. As a contact tracer for Los Angeles County, her job, at least on paper, entails phoning people who have tested positive for the coronavirus, along with others they may have exposed, and providing them with guidance on how to isolate so as not to infect others. If that sounds easy, it is not.\n\nTo convince people to cooperate, she has to get them to trust her. She has to convince them that they might be infected, even if they have no symptoms. \"Oh yes,\" she'll say, \"I've been hearing that a lot.\" She has to let people curse at her and hang up, then she has to call them back the very next day. And if she wants them to heed her advice, she has to listen, really listen, to how scared they are that if they stay home from their jobs, they might not be able to feed their families.\n\n\"Sometimes it can really get to you,\" said Ms. Kumar. \"The other day I had one young lady, and she was screaming on the phone, 'You don't understand -- I have three kids. I have to go to work.'\" She went on. \"I kept calling back and calling back. I'm very relentless like that. I thought about it all night -- what am I going to do? I called her again first thing in the morning, and I was so relieved when she picked up.\"\n\nEven as officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continue to tout contact tracing's effectiveness, and state and local health agencies across the nation deploy new armies of tracers, tracking down all the people with the coronavirus is proving to be a Sisyphean task.\n\nOne of the key reasons, as Ms. Kumar and many other tracers are finding out, is fear.\n\nLulled by the state's early success in flattening the curve, officials in California, which now has more confirmed cases than any other state, failed not only to anticipate the outbreak's more recent trajectory, but also people's reluctance to cooperate with the government's tracing effort. Some simply can't be bothered, but more often people decline to participate because they are worried about wage loss, deportation or stigmatization.\n\nTaken together, those factors have created a snowball effect that has overwhelmed tracers' ability to reach people before it is too late.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, tracers were assigned 13,766 cases over the week ending July 28. But more than a third of the calls to people who tested positive went unanswered, and more than half of those who did pick up refused to provide at least one close contact.\n\n\"People are reluctant because they are scared,\" said Ms. Kumar, a 51-year-old mother of two. \"I've even had one person ask, 'Are you F.B.I.?' I said no, but they were like, 'Well you could be.' I just kept saying, 'I could be, but I am not!'\"\n\nIt wasn't supposed to be this way. This spring, after California public health officials were forced to abandon widespread tracing in the face of an overwhelming onslaught of cases, Gov. Gavin Newsom regrouped and launched the most ambitious program in the nation to keep track of infected people and those they may have exposed.\n\nThe effort, called California Connected, has cost upward of $30 million. It includes a new online academy run by the University of California to train county and state employees as disease investigators, and a public education campaign to reassure Californians that any information tracers gather is confidential.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-08T12:04:28.992Z As the U.S. relief talks falter again, Trump says he is prepared to act on his own. Cuomo says N.Y. schools can reopen in-person but leaves it up to districts to determine if, when and how. Thousands of cases went unreported in California when a computer server failed. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe state met an ambitious timetable of enrolling 10,000 trainees by early July. But while public health officials credit the manpower surge with helping to contain the pandemic at the margins, the program has been no panacea.\n\nTo be effective, contact tracing must take place promptly. The sooner public health workers reach a person who has tested positive, the sooner they can explain how to isolate and, as importantly, get a list of the person's close contacts so they can advise them to quarantine at home.\n\nWhen the state decided it needed 10,000 new tracers to accomplish that goal, it based the decision on an estimate that by this point in the summer, California would be seeing about 3,600 new cases a day, said Dr. Mark Ghaly, who as the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services oversees California's virus response.\n\nBut that estimate failed to account for the explosion of cases that followed the easing of the state's stay-at-home order. On the day earlier this month that California surpassed New York to top the nation in total confirmed cases, the state recorded a record 12,807 cases, or more than three times the earlier estimate.\n\nThe spike has also caused long delays at testing labs, meaning investigations triggered by positive results are taking longer to initiate.\n\nDr. Ghaly believes that California has enough tracers, at least for now. But at the county level, where daily call logs are getting longer and longer, officials say initial contact is now taking up to a week in some places, if it happens at all.\n\nChris Finnie, who at 70 is in a high-risk category, teaches an adult ceramics class in central California that has been on hold since March. Last month, in line with reopening guidelines, she decided to offer a makeup class. She moved the pottery wheels outside, put out hand sanitizer and sprayed down contact points before and after the class.\n\nTwo students came. Two days later, one of them emailed her to say she had tested positive. That result should have been conveyed by the lab to county health officials. But in an interview one week after the class, Ms. Finney said her student had yet to be contacted by the Santa Cruz County Health Department, and as a result, neither had she. \"It's very confusing,\" Ms. Finney said.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, where the number of tracers has gone from 200 to 2,600, Ms. Kumar and her colleagues are better equipped to keep up; once they are notified of a case, they are able to attempt to follow-up within a day more than 94 percent of the time.\n\nBut they are grappling with a more basic challenge: Getting people to answer the phone. Response rates vary, but in Los Angeles, they are so worrisomely low that the county is now offering $20 gift cards to people who complete an interview. Each day, tracers tackle a log of somewhere around 3,000 to 4,000 calls, said Dr. Jeffrey Gunzenhauser, the chief medical officer for the Los Angeles County Public Health Department.\n\nOn an average day, they might complete roughly half, meaning 1,500 to 2,000 roll into the next day, along with whatever new cases pop up. The county attempts to contact a person on three consecutive days before labeling the case a refusal.\n\nOver the most recent seven-day period for which data was available, less than 60 percent of people who tested positive for the virus agreed to an interview.\n\nOf those, only 40 percent were willing to provide at least one close contact. Of those close contacts, less than 64 percent picked up the phone and participated. And it remains an open question as to what percentage of people that are reached actually follow the guidance offered, which is the entire point of the program -- but which officials have no ready way to track.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\n\"We worry the most that we make all these calls, but they don't translate into isolation or quarantine,\" Dr. Ghaly said. \"So we are spending more and more time trying to make the calls educational -- it's sort of a choice between can we do a high volume of calls versus can we make impactful and effective calls.\"\n\nThat is where people like Ms. Kumar come in. Born in Malaysia, she came to the United States more than three decades ago. After raising her children, she decided to go back to school in 2011; public health appealed to her, she said, as a way to give back to her adopted country. Now, it's personal -- one of her close friends, a nurse, is battling the virus.\n\nShe spends anywhere from 20 to 45 minutes on a call, acting as an epidemiological investigator, educator and social worker wrapped in one.\n\nContact tracing is not just a matter of reading from a script, though every tracer is given one. It is not just calculating the number of days a person must self-isolate, or learning certain tricks of the trade, like the fact that it is better to call older people earlier in the morning because the younger ones tend to sleep in. Ultimately it involves something much harder to teach.\n\n\"How do I convey my message and be empathetic, when I cannot even see their expression when they cry,\" Ms. Kumar said she asks herself. \"It's not just an interview. It's a conversation. I say, 'I am here to help, let's figure this out together.'\"\n\nOne recent call involved a young mother who was positive, expecting twins and speaking from a room with her two other young children just on the other side of the door. What do the babies feel like when they move? Ms. Kumar asked, hoping to build a connection before she gently asking the mother what she was doing to isolate.\n\nThe woman told her that whenever she leaves the room, she wears gloves and a mask, but then her voice caught. \"It's hard to hug my kids with gloves on,\" Ms. Kumar recalled her saying.\n\nShe told the woman she understood, but that it was important to keep her distance.\n\nSome people she calls are worried because their immigration papers aren't in order. \"Yup, I don't care about that, I care that you are safe and your family is safe,\" she'll respond, before assuring them that Los Angeles does not share information with federal immigration authorities.\n\nOne restaurant worker she recently contacted didn't want to give his place of work, for fear managers would blame him for having to quarantine themselves. Other times, people will tell her they are self-isolating when she can hear that they are out and about.\n\nShe said the best approach is to educate rather than confront. She explains why it is important that co-workers be notified, and that the county can do that without ever mentioning the infected person's name. Sometimes it works, but not always; one older lady adamantly refused to name the family members helping to care for her, insisting they were \"doing the right thing\" and \"cleaning everything.\"\n\nOn a recent Friday, Ms. Kumar managed to speak with 10 of the 14 people on her list. In most instances, it took multiple attempts. One person cited a \"work call\" and told her to try again in the morning.\n\nBut she keeps at it. For every case she finds and isolates, she figures she is preventing at least some spread. That is all she can hope to do, she said, until there is vaccine.\n\n\"We are making a difference -- I know we are,\" Ms. Kumar said as she prepared for another day of calls, a long list of new cases in front of her.",

        "body": "\"April was dark\": On the rooftop of Baseera Khan's apartment building in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. The artist not only suffered from the coronavirus, but also struggled financially after exhibitions were put on hold and teaching gigs evaporated.Credit...Maridelis Morales Rosado for The New York Times\n\nThis Labor Day Weekend is unlike any other in recent memory: Broadway and most of the city's live performance venues have been closed for nearly six months; museums have only recently begun to reopen; and unemployment reached alarming levels in April.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has ravaged all parts of the economy, and culture workers are among the hardest hit. Yet some have managed to keep their jobs -- and even thrive -- while others are still struggling or have pivoted to new roles. Now more than ever we wanted to reflect on those people who have devoted their lives to the arts in some fashion. They've soldiered on, amid the shutdown, to create some semblance of normalcy -- whether recommending a book, securing the grounds of an iconic cultural institution or entertaining children. Here are some of their stories. -- Nicole Herrington, Weekend Arts Editor\n\nThe Shoemaker\n\nPhil LaDuca, 65, founder and creator of LaDuca Shoes in Manhattan\n\nBefore the pandemic halted live performance, LaDuca Shoes was, in the words of its creator, Phil LaDuca, \"ready to explode on the scene.\"\n\nHis flexible character shoes, which grace -- and save -- the prized feet of Rockettes as well as Broadway dancers and actors, were to be seen in an array of productions this year, among them \"The Eternals,\" the Marvel film whose release date has been moved to next year, and Andrew Lloyd Webber's \"Cinderella\" in London (pushed to next March). Also on the horizon? \"The Music Man,\" with Hugh Jackman and Sutton Foster, on Broadway.\n\nSpeaking recently from Los Angeles, where he lives with his wife, Ton, his voice was a mix of wonderment and dismay. The day that Broadway shows were shuttered, the couple were in New York for the opening of the new musical \"Six.\" He had designed the boots for the six actresses who play the ill-fated wives of Henry VIII.\n\n\"We were two hours away from the red carpet for opening night when I received the call,\" he said. \"Ton and I were desperate to get out of New York -- we heard rumors that they were going to stop flights. I was doing my Kurt Russell-Snake impersonation from 'Escape From New York.'\"\n\nBut while LaDuca did indeed escape, he hasn't stopped working. In the early days of the quarantine, LaDuca Shoes offered dance classes on Instagram Live. \"I always want to stay positive,\" he said. \"We did it out of love for the community.\"\n\nHe added: \"I went through a two-week period of funk and depression. And then I said, no, we're going to fight. Let's not sit on the sidelines!\"\n\nThe classes ended in August -- dancers, he said, have many more options now -- and the shop, on Eighth Avenue and 47th Street, has reopened for fittings and pickups. This summer brought a significant change at LaDuca Shoes: the LaDuca Palette, which features four new colors to accommodate more skin tones. He said the inspiration came from the Black Lives Matter movement, following the killing of George Floyd. He said it made him reflect on his own white privilege.\n\nLaDuca, who arrived in New York from the South Side of Chicago in 1979 with a pair of suitcases and $800 in his wallet, had no help in the creation of his footwear and shop. The movement made him question \"would a Black kid from the South Side of Chicago have had the same opportunities as me?\" he said. \"My answer is no. It made me realize I wasn't doing enough.\"\n\nAnd LaDuca's aim is to do everything he can for dancers. He was one himself. A year after he moved to New York, LaDuca was dancing on Broadway in Agnes de Mille's \"Brigadoon.\" Multiple injuries -- his own -- led him to start LaDuca Shoes about 20 years ago.\n\nHis favorite story involves a young woman from North Carolina who was in town for a Radio City Rockettes intensive. She left the shop with the Roxie, a hard-sole tap shoe LaDuca designed for the Rockettes, and the Alexis, \"because you need to bevel,\" he said, referring to the signature pose. \"The Rockette bevel is what it's all about.\"\n\nShe returned a year later -- and announced that she was a Rockette. \"That, to me, is what LaDuca shoes is,\" he said. \"I'm just concerned with how I'm going to keep evolving and helping dancers.\" GIA KOURLAS\n\nThe Bookseller\n\nJames Fugate, 65, co-owner of Eso Won Books in Los Angeles\n\nIt was the second week of the shutdown in March, and James Fugate, the co-owner of Eso Won Books in the Leimert Park neighborhood of South Los Angeles, was recovering from the flu. He thought it could have been Covid-19, but he couldn't get a test to confirm. Paul Coates, the founder of Black Classic Press (and father of Ta-Nehisi), had organized a Zoom conference for hundreds of Black booksellers and publishers to talk about how they were going to keep their businesses alive in the pandemic. Fugate joined, but turned off his audio so no one could hear him coughing.\n\nThe event spurred a flurry of marketing for readers around the country to support Black-owned bookstores, especially now that they couldn't shop in person. \"Suddenly we started getting 25 orders a day, and that really helped,\" Fugate said in a masked interview in late August, in the back office of his store on Degnan Boulevard.\n\nBut that boost was nothing compared to what was to come. On June 3, a week and a half after the police killing of George Floyd, Fugate posted a notice on Eso Won's website, apologizing for having fallen behind on filling the \"overwhelming amount of orders\" they'd received that week. \"We never anticipated anything like this,\" he wrote.\n\nSoon they were receiving 400 orders in a single day; \"I thought, it's going to take two days for me to get all those done,\" he said. By the next day, there were 1,200 more. \"Oh, no, no, no,\" he thought, \"there's no way.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, Black-owned bookstores are few and far between. Besides Eso Won, Fugate said he knew of only two others: Malik Books in nearby Baldwin Hills, and Reparations Club in Mid-City -- both predominantly African-American neighborhoods. \"We've always had a cross-section of Los Angeles come to our store,\" he said. \"Our growth is in part due to our long record.\"\n\nMost foot traffic still consists of South Los Angeles locals, but lately the majority of pickup orders are being placed by white customers from all over the county. \"There are some knuckleheads around here who are upset,\" he said. \"They're like, 'Why are all these white people coming here?'\"\n\nThis Labor Day closes out a summer that saw the greatest period of growth in the store's 30-year history. Fugate has been a bookseller all his life; he discovered his passion for the industry as a teenager, in copies of Publishers Weekly borrowed from his local library in Detroit. Now in his 60s, Fugate still processes and fulfills every single online order himself. (\"Sometime in June I said, 'Stop answering the phones. We cannot.'\")\n\nBut Fugate is grateful for the stress, and for his customers, who've by and large been understanding of the inevitable delays, and even lost transactions. He said he's \"disturbed\" to hear other bookstore owners complaining about the increased demand. \"If you went from doing 20 orders a day to 200 orders a day,\" he said, \"just be happy.\"\n\nHe also credits the American Booksellers Association for having developed a bulk ordering program to help stores like Eso Won handle higher sales volumes. Not all Black booksellers feel welcome \"around all those white people\" in the A.B.A., he said. \"But to me, you want to be part of that bookselling community.\"\n\nSince reopening Eso Won's doors on June 1, Fugate and the bookshop's co-owner, Tom Hamilton, have been worried about the virus; but Hamilton lets in only a few customers at a time, and asks that they wear masks and use hand sanitizer before entering. Store hours are now noon to 4 p.m., Monday through Saturday, but the owners are there much longer: from about 7 a.m. (sometimes earlier) until 5 p.m.\n\n\"Since the pandemic, it's like nothing we've ever seen,\" he said. \"We have so many books, but they all seem to be selling.\n\n\"I think that's going to continue for some time,\" he added, referring to both the steady flux of orders in his inbox and the civil rights movement that is at least partly fueling them. \"This isn't going to stop.\" LAUREN CHRISTENSEN\n\nThe Artist\n\nBaseera Khan, 40, a Brooklyn-based artist who will be in residency at the Kitchen this fall\n\nThe artist Baseera Khan decided to film a cooking series for Instagram called \"Apocalypse Cooking\" in the days after New York began sheltering in place.\n\nThe videos were decidedly tongue-in-cheek, almost parodying Instagram as a medium (\"look at all my toilet paper,\" \"I still have cute nails\"), that provided viewers with easy-to-follow recipes.\n\n\"'You don't need fancy things to make fancy food' was the theme,\" Khan said in a recent interview.\n\nOn March 26, Khan, who uses the pronoun \"they,\" did a live cooking session on BRIC Brooklyn's Instagram page. And then, that day, Khan started feeling the symptoms of Covid-19. Immediately after filming for BRIC, they started getting the chills.\n\n\"So April was dark for me,\" Khan said, and much of their life came to a halt.\n\nAlmost overnight, the four art shows that Khan -- who uses a range of materials to create installation, collage, sound and performance art -- had lined up for the rest of the year, including one at the Atlanta Contemporary in Georgia and another at the Wexner Center for the Arts in Ohio, were canceled, postponed or left in limbo. And Khan said teaching positions evaporated. (In addition to teaching at the summer Masters of Fine Arts program at the School of Visual Arts, Khan also taught last year at Virginia Commonwealth University.)\n\nWith barely any money coming in and no health insurance, Khan resorted to rationing food. \"I'd wake up in the morning and have coffee and a banana,\" they said. \"And then for a snack, I would have tea and an apple. I would wait until around six to make a proper meal. Then I would just go to sleep really early so I didn't have to be hungry.\"\n\nEvery day, Khan said they would also try to register for unemployment benefits, calling the state labor department again and again with little success.\n\nIt wasn't until June 1 that they were finally able to register.\n\n\"It was all a really horrific experience,\" Khan recalled. \"But then, at the same time, it felt familiar. Being an artist, you're either inundated with people and social activity or you're very alone. So there's an oil-and-water to it. It did feel familiar to isolate myself, to be honest.\"\n\nIn the summer months, Khan's circumstances slowly started turning around.\n\nThis fall the New Orleans Museum of Art will screen a film of their performance last year at the University of Albany. Titled \"Braidrage,\" the work featured Khan scaling a rock- climbing wall that had been constructed with resin casts of the artist's body parts as the \"rocks\" and a floor-to-ceiling thick black braid as the rope.\n\nKhan also started selling prints of their work on Instagram. And, on Sept. 8, Khan will begin a six week residency at the Kitchen in New York, where they will draw on their experiences in isolation and suffering from Covid-19 to create artwork in the form of a TV show.\n\n\"I'm doing the best I can in terms of not worrying,\" they said. \"I don't know any other way.\" ALISHA HARIDASANI GUPTA\n\nThe Security Team\n\nElrige Shelton, 58, and Jervin Archibald, 46, chiefs of security at Lincoln Center in Manhattan\n\nFor the two chiefs of security at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, one constant in their lives before the pandemic was daily conversations with audience members as they patrolled the sprawling 16-acre campus.\n\nElrige Shelton, the late-shift security chief, remembers frequently greeting an elderly man who was a regular at the summer dance sessions known as Midsummer Night Swing in Damrosch Park. The man would always show up with a much younger dance partner, he recalled.\n\nShelton's counterpart during the daytime shift, Jervin Archibald, can picture an older woman to whom he always said \"good morning\" when she was on her way to work. She would greet him back: \"Good morning, have a good day!\" He never learned her name, but she was a constant who disappeared when the pandemic shut down New York City in March.\n\nThere were the Lincoln Center patrons who would stop by just to chat about the plays or operas that they planned to see.\n\n\"Sometimes people just need someone to talk to,\" Archibald said. \"And you're there to give them an ear.\"\n\nAnd then there were the harried ticket holders desperate to get directions for a theater before showtime.\n\n\"I couldn't walk 10 feet without someone asking me a question,\" he said. \"Now no one wants to talk.\"\n\nThe Metropolitan Opera House and Lincoln Center Theater haven't hosted formal performances for more than five months, but the chiefs have been on duty the entire time, making sure the campus and its remaining population is safe.\n\nArchibald, 46, who has worked in Lincoln Center's security division for more than half of his life, starts his shift at 7 a.m., calling roll and getting his staff up to speed before heading out to patrol the campus.\n\nShelton, 58, who has worked there for more than 25 years, takes over at 3 p.m. and stays until 11 p.m., when -- during typical times -- audience members are usually streaming out of the various theaters after a ballet or concert or play.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Shelton took an hour-and-a-half bus ride from his hometown in Pennsylvania to Manhattan; now, the bus no longer runs, so he drives instead. In March, when the pandemic was first bearing down on the city, he remembers that much of his job was making sure his security staff felt safe.\n\n\"At first it was a little frightening,\" he said. \"We didn't want the staff to be fearful of coming to work.\"\n\nThen, he had to usher them through a difficult furlough period. As of July 1, out of Lincoln Center's roughly 400 full-time employees, about 30 percent were on furlough.\n\nFor months, Lincoln Center's campus was entirely shut down. Neighbors were no longer permitted to stroll around or sit by the fountain. The emptiness was hard for Shelton, who was used to monitoring crowds of several thousands before showtime and afterward.\n\nArchibald, whose father worked as a Lincoln Center security guard for 14 years, drives in every day from his home in Brooklyn. Earlier this summer, people who lived nearby told him that they were desperate for the grounds to open again.\n\n\"I miss the patrons, I miss my co-workers,\" he said. \"I'm hoping for the day that we can all come back.\"\n\nThen, in the middle of July, a partial reopening: The outdoor space opened to the public. Instead of theatergoers circulating on the campus, the outdoor areas are much more family oriented now, Archibald said. There are people walking their dogs, children riding bikes, older couples strolling through the plaza. For a couple of weeks, playlists curated by Lincoln Center employees and institutions like New York City Ballet played from the outdoor speakers on the plazas.\n\nWhile the chiefs are still missing their regular patrons and colleagues, there are new people -- and animals -- who are becoming familiar passers-by. Shelton said that he has gotten to know a huge German shepherd named Mr. Pancake. He often sees an elderly couple who told him how they miss the New York Philharmonic concerts.\n\n\"I consider myself a people person,\" Shelton said. \"So seeing the people come back, it relaxes me.\" JULIA JACOBS\n\nThe Theater Educator\n\nCaitlyn McCain, 23, artistic associate at New York City Children's Theater in Manhattan\n\nShe has enjoyed the heroine's spotlight in plays like Shakespeare's \"Cymbeline\" and \"As You Like It.\" But lately Caitlyn McCain's most visible role is not onstage but online, where she is simply Miss Caitlyn, the effervescent host of Creative Clubhouse Stories at New York City Children's Theater.\n\n\"Covid definitely had me shift my mind-set a bit,\" McCain said, \"although I've always seen acting and my work with young people in applied theater and education as kind of equally important.\"\n\nWhen the city went into lockdown in March, McCain was appearing in \"Five,\" a touring musical from this company. She was also its temporary gala associate, helping plan a fund-raiser that was soon canceled. Instead, she began to work with Nicole Hogsett, director of marketing and audience development, on \"how we were pivoting our programming,\" McCain said.\n\nThe result was Creative Clubhouse, a web page of performances, reading recommendations, craft projects, singalongs and games. McCain, who had been an education apprentice at the theater while an undergraduate at New York University, proposed also developing Creative Clubhouse Stories, a series of livestreaming book-based classes for ages 3 to 8.\n\n\"Covid-related things is how we started,\" she said. \"We chose books that explored boredom, anger, anxiety -- really big things that were probably coming up for a lot of little ones.\"\n\nIn the classes, Miss Caitlyn reads a picture book, introduces a related activity and discusses the theme. After hearing \"Ravi's Roar,\" Tom Percival's story about a boy who has trouble controlling his inner (and here, literal) tiger, \"one little human raises their hand and says, 'It makes me angry that I can't see my friends,'\" McCain recalled. This led to helpful reflections on how Ravi tamed his own beast.\n\nAlthough the story series is on hiatus until October, Creative Clubhouse features videos about each book. It also offers Start the Conversation, a resource for helping children deal with challenging subjects. The first installment, online now, covers race, racism and Black Lives Matter. It includes McCain demonstrating a stress-reducing exercise, as well as two videos she helped create: \"You Matter,\" for families of color, centers on Christian Robinson's children's book of the same title. \"Black Lives Matter,\" for white families, focuses on Anastasia Higginbotham's \"Not My Idea: A Book About Whiteness.\"\n\n\"I wasn't really interested in exploring 'We all matter' and 'We're all welcome here,'\" McCain said. \"That's been done.\" Instead, each video addresses specific concerns.\n\nAs artistic associate, a title she assumed on July 1, McCain is also developing digital programming connected to the theater's virtual season. In October, the company will stream a 2015 performance of \"A Band of Angels,\" Myla Churchill's adaptation of Deborah Hopkinson's book about a girl's encounter with her enslaved ancestor and the founding of the Fisk Jubilee Singers at Fisk University.\n\nMcCain said her goal was to give audiences \"the ability to adopt another person's point of view through their imaginations.\" LAUREL GRAEBER\n\nThe Coding Expert\n\nAndy Carluccio, 22, lead developer at Liminal Entertainment Technologies in Springfield, Va.\n\nAt the beginning of March, Andy Carluccio assumed that when he graduated from the University of Virginia he would pay his dues at a software company and only later try to find a job that combined computer science and theater, his twin passions.\n\n\"I thought the kind of work I'm doing now would be the kind of work I'd maybe do in five years,\" he said in an interview.\n\nBut by the end of the month -- after the pandemic forced performing arts venues across the country to shutter -- Carluccio had been recruited by his mentor Eamonn Farrell to contribute his coding expertise to an online production of Caryl Churchill's play \"Mad Forest\" at Bard College. He was also plugging away at his undergraduate thesis.\n\nAlong with Farrell, who was working as the show's video designer, Carluccio was charged with reconciling the creative vision of the production's director, Ashley Tata, with the capabilities of Zoom's teleconferencing software. The success of that endeavor in April (the production was reprised in May to critical acclaim) and the skyrocketing demand for streaming content convinced Carluccio that he didn't need to complete an office job apprenticeship before striking out on his own.\n\n\"I saw the writing on the wall that this was my chance to jump in and do it now,\" he said. \"I figured I wasn't even going to wait for the conferral of my degree.\" By May, Carluccio and his business partners, Jonathan Kokotajlo and Nolan Jacobs-Walker, had Liminal Entertainment Technology up and running.\n\nIn the few short months since its founding, the company has facilitated hundreds of livestreams for houses of worship, high school and university groups, children's theater organizations, Off Broadway productions and arts festivals from Carluccio's basement in Springfield, Va. He is modest about his team's role in these projects: \"We think of ourselves sort of like virtual plumbers, routing audio and video across the internet from remote performers and technicians back to me to mix into a final livestream for the audience to enjoy.\"\n\nDuring the spring it was not a foregone conclusion that theatermakers would be able to successfully pivot from live performance to creating compelling digital content. There were serious technical hurdles to clear and relatively few resources that artists and producers could draw on to make the switch. Some despaired, choosing to try to wait out the public health crisis.\n\n\"I created this company because I was saddened to see both community and professional theaters cancel their shows and close their doors because they felt the task of performing online was an insurmountable challenge,\" Carluccio explained. \"I wanted to do whatever I could to make sure these works could continue and perhaps even thrive during a time when performing arts felt most needed but least accessible.\"\n\nThe rapid evolution that online theater has undergone in just a few months has convinced the young technologist that the hybrid art form is here to stay. \"There are things that can be done by weaving together collaborators and designers over decentralized internet that I think has opened up design possibilities and audience interactions and scale in a way that we're not going to want to turn off once we're finally able to gather in person again.\" PETER LIBBEY\n\nThe Comedian\n\nKerryn Feehan, 37, a stand-up comedian in New York City\n\nBefore the pandemic emptied the streets of New York, Kerryn Feehan had her hands full. She was working as a writer for Paramount Network and performing stand-up comedy several nights a week.\n\nAfter the city went into lockdown, adjusting to life without live comedy \"was really depressing,\" Feehan said in a Zoom interview. She kept busy with fitness and created a show on Instagram called \"Cooking With Kerryn.\"\n\n\"I made toast for the first seven episodes,\" she said. \"It's stupid.\"\n\nHer first return to stand-up had its setbacks. In the early days of the health crisis, she participated in Zoom shows hosted by local clubs, telling jokes to \"Brady Bunch heads\" and viewers casually eating noodles on the other end of the screen. \"Those were -- interesting,\" Feehan said.\n\nShe telecommuted for a few months before losing her job in May. Then she applied for unemployment benefits and took on side gigs.\n\nThings started looking up soon after, though, as coronavirus cases in New York dropped and the city gradually began to reopen. Outdoor shows were cropping up in parks and on sidewalks, and Feehan was back onstage -- figuratively.\n\nNow she is performing almost nightly, with clubs like Stand Up NY (which holds performances in city parks) and an outdoor, pop-up comedy show called Take It Outside.\n\n\"While the conditions aren't ideal, it's better than nothing,\" Feehan said.\n\nMicrophones often need to be sanitized, if performers don't have their own, and there's more pressure on the hosts to keep audiences engaged in between sets. The reactions from the crowd have also changed.\n\nWatching a comedy show in a dimly lit club, where the spotlight is on the performer, allows the audience members more freedom to laugh at jokes others in the room may find insensitive or vulgar, Feehan said. \"You laugh with abandon,\" she said. \"You don't filter yourself.\"\n\nRemove the shroud of darkness, and people become more apprehensive. \"That's a challenge that has existed with every outdoor show, whether it's during the day or at night,\" Feehan said.\n\nThe adjustments can be quite humbling for veteran comedians, particularly those who have HBO and Netflix comedy specials under their belts and are now \"performing on Orchard Street while a garbage truck goes by,\" Feehan said.\n\nNaturally, there is no shortage of coronavirus jokes. Feehan would like to move on from them, but for now, that is all life has to offer. (One for the road: \"My dad is an essential customer at Home Depot,\" Feehan said. \"He's never leaving.\")\n\nThough she has consistent shows lined up, Feehan is aware that winter doesn't bode too well for outdoor comedy. She hopes the city will find a way to accommodate socially distanced, indoor performances -- whatever that may look like.\n\n\"The worst thing you can do is get rid of comedy shows,\" she said, calling the art form public therapy that encourages people to laugh at the strange times we live in.\n\n\"Comics,\" Feehan cheekily said, \"are the frontline workers.\" SARA ARIDI",

        "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- The setup of the two friends' agricultural venture was unusual. Their farm sat next to a gas station, inside a shipping container where the plants grew in vertically stacked shelves. And the timing of their first sales -- during the early days of Malaysia's coronavirus outbreak -- seemed less than ideal.\n\n\"We were a nascent product in an uncertain market,\" said Shawn Ng, 28, a co-founder of the vertical farm, the Vegetable Co. \"We weren't too sure if it would take off.\"\n\n\"But somehow,\" he added, \"the market kind of played in our favor.\"\n\nAs in-person shopping wanes during the pandemic, Mr. Ng's Malaysia-based operation is one of many small farms around the world that are selling fresh produce directly to consumers in ways that bypass brick-and-mortar grocery stores.\n\nSome farms sell on e-commerce platforms like Amazon or Lazada, Alibaba's online emporium for Southeast Asia, or through smaller ones like Harvie, a Pennsylvania-based website that connects consumers with individual farms across the United States and Canada.\n\nOthers, like the Vegetable Co., sell directly to customers.\n\n\"I was very 'kan cheong' during the lockdown period,\" said one of Mr. Ng's regular customers, Ayu Samsudin, using a Cantonese word for anxious. \"Having fresh vegetables delivered to your doorstep was such a relief.\"\n\nThe Vegetable Co. consists of a 320-square-foot shipping container on the edge of a parking lot in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's largest city. It opened for business, with just a handful of customers, about a month before the country's restrictive lockdown took effect in mid-March.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-03T07:29:44.526Z The University of South Carolina reports that more than 1,000 students currently have the virus. The C.D.C. tells health officials to be ready to distribute a vaccine by November, raising concerns over politicized timing. In Iowa, college students staged a sickout, and a football opener won't have fans after all.

Inside, tightly packed shelves with hydroponic lettuce, sprouts and other vegetables grow under LED lights.\n\nThe wallpaper outside the growing chamber shows blue sky and clouds, evoking the view from an old-fashioned farm. But employees pace the chamber's narrow corridor wearing rubber gloves, surgical masks and white lab coats, as if it were a hospital ward.\n\nThe founders have scant experience with traditional farming, and they speak about their work with Silicon Valley-like jargon.\n\nMr. Sha, who has a master's degree in management, said he first became interested in vertical farming after watching \"The Martian,\" the 2015 film in which an American astronaut played by Matt Damon is stranded on Mars and learns to grow his own food.\n\n\"I was lost in awe about the degree of precision in the technology along with the elegance of the solution to grow vegetables in a zero-gravity environment,\" he said. \"Since then, I have gone down the rabbit hole of independent research.\"\n\nThe coronavirus took off in Malaysia in March, after an Islamic revivalist group's gathering there became one of the pandemic's biggest vectors in Southeast Asia. Since then, the country of about 32 million has weathered the outbreak relatively well, at least compared with some of its neighbors. As of Thursday, it had reported fewer than 10,000 confirmed cases since the pandemic began, according to a New York Times database.\n\nMalaysia's initial lockdown allowed only one person per household to go outside for essential errands, and the police enforced local travel restrictions with roadblocks.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nBut even though the rules were gradually loosened to let most businesses reopen, many urban Malaysians have maintained the online shopping habits they developed during the initial lockdown, said Audrey Goo, the founder of MyFishman, an e-commerce platform that connects fishermen from villages along the country's west coast with consumers in Kuala Lumpur.\n\n\"Not many end users are willing to go back to the wet market,\" said Ms. Goo, adding that her company's sales had roughly doubled during the pandemic. \"So I think the whole business model will continue to change.\"\n\nMr. Ng said the Vegetable Co.'s parent company, Future Farms, was now seeking seed capital to finance an expansion into a larger facility. He recently hired an architect and a software developer to design it.\n\nFor now, though, the operation remains modest.\n\nOn a recent afternoon, Mr. Ng climbed into his car for a delivery run that snaked through low-rise residential neighborhoods, as the sun sank below Kuala Lumpur's hazy downtown skyline.\n\nOne of the customers on the 40-plus-mile route, Gudrun Olafsdottir, said that along with yoga and meditation, greens from the Vegetable Co. were part of a routine that helped her keep physically and mentally fit during the pandemic.\n\nMs. Olafsdottir, who is from Iceland and works in retail, found the farm on Facebook through a local chef who specializes in raw and vegan cooking. She said it was one of several local businesses that she was supporting these days with a \"financial hug.\"\n\n\"I think that we could do so many things to support those in need if we just consciously choose how we spend our time and money,\" she has written on her blog. \"A hug and a squeeze.\"\n\nIan Teh reported from Kuala Lumpur and Mike Ives from Hong Kong.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Trump administration officials on Wednesday defended a new recommendation that people without Covid-19 symptoms abstain from testing, even as scientists warned that the policy could hobble an already weak federal response as schools reopen and a potential autumn wave looms.\n\nThe day after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued the revised guidance, there were conflicting reports on who was responsible. Two federal health officials said the shift came as a directive to the Atlanta-based C.D.C. from higher-ups in Washington at the White House and the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAdm. Brett P. Giroir, the administration's coronavirus testing czar, called it a \"C.D.C. action,\" written with input from the agency's director, Dr. Robert R. Redfield. But he acknowledged that the revision came after a vigorous debate among members of the White House coronavirus task force -- including its newest member, Dr. Scott W. Atlas, a frequent Fox News guest and a special adviser to President Trump.\n\n\"We all signed off on it, the docs, before it ever got to a place where the political leadership would have, you know, even seen it, and this document was approved by the task force by consensus,\" Dr. Giroir said. \"There was no weight on the scales by the president or the vice president or Secretary Azar,\" he added, referring to Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services.\n\nRegardless of who is responsible, the shift is highly significant, running counter to scientific evidence that people without symptoms could be the most prolific spreaders of the coronavirus. And it comes at a very precarious moment. Hundreds of thousands of college and K-12 students are heading back to campus, and broad testing regimens are central to many of their schools' plans. Businesses are reopening, and scientists inside and outside the administration are growing concerned about political interference in scientific decisions.\n\nDemocratic governors who were weighing how to keep the virus contained as their economies and schools come to life said limiting testing for asymptomatic citizens would make the task impossible.\n\n\"The only plausible rationale,\" Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York told reporters in a conference call from Albany, N.Y., \"is that they want fewer people taking tests, because as the president has said, if we don't take tests, you won't know the number of people who are Covid-positive.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-26T23:24:27.805Z The C.D.C. was pressured to change guidance on testing asymptomatic people exposed to the virus. California makes a deal to more than double testing capacity and get results faster. N.Y.C.'s subway and bus service would be reduced by 40 percent without federal aid, the M.T.A. warns. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nOver the weekend, the Food and Drug Administration, under pressure from Mr. Trump, gave emergency approval to expand the use of antibody-rich blood plasma to treat Covid-19 patients. The move came just days after scientists, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, and Dr. Francis S. Collins, the director of the National Institutes of Health, intervened to stop the practice because of lack of evidence that it worked.\n\nThe move echoed a decision by the Food and Drug Administration to grant an emergency use waiver for hydroxychloroquine, a malaria drug repeatedly sold by Mr. Trump as a treatment for Covid-19. The agency revoked the waiver in June, when clinical trials suggested the drugs' risks outweighed any possible benefits.\n\nThe testing shift, experts say, was a far more puzzling reversal. Dr. Giroir said the move was \"discussed extensively by\" members of the White House coronavirus task force, and he named Dr. Redfield, Dr. Atlas, Dr. Fauci and Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of food and drugs. Notably, he did not name Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. But he said Dr. Fauci was among those who had \"signed off.\"\n\nIn a brief interview, Dr. Fauci said he had seen an early iteration of the guidelines and did not object. But the final debate over the revisions took place at a task force meeting on Thursday, when Dr. Fauci was having surgery under general anesthesia to remove a polyp on his vocal cord. In retrospect, he said, he now had \"some concerns\" about advising people against getting tested, because the virus could be spread through asymptomatic contact.\n\n\"My concern is that it will be misinterpreted,\" Dr. Fauci said.\n\nThe newest version of the C.D.C. guidelines, posted on Monday, amended the agency's guidance to say that people who had been in close contact with an infected individual -- typically defined as being within six feet of a person with the coronavirus and for at least 15 minutes -- \"do not necessarily need a test\" if they do not have symptoms.\n\nExceptions might be made for \"vulnerable\" individuals, the agency noted, or if health care providers or state or local public health officials recommended testing.\n\nDr. Giroir said the new recommendation matched existing guidance for hospital workers and others in frontline jobs who have \"close exposures\" to people infected with the coronavirus. Such workers are advised to take proper precautions, like wearing masks, socially distancing, washing their hands frequently and monitoring themselves for symptoms.\n\nHe argued that testing those exposed to the virus was of little utility, because tests capture only a single point in time, and that the results could give people a false sense of security.\n\n\"A negative test on Day 2 doesn't mean you're negative. So what is the value of that?\" Dr. Giroir asked, adding, \"It doesn't mean on Day 4 you can go out and visit Grandma or on Day 6 go out without a mask on in school.\"\n\nThe guidelines come amid growing concern that the C.D.C., the agency charged with tracking and fighting outbreaks of infectious disease, is being sidelined by its parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the White House. Under ordinary circumstances, administering public health advice to the nation would fall squarely within the C.D.C.'s portfolio.\n\nExperts have called the revisions alarming and dangerous, noting that the United States needs more testing, not less. And they have expressed deep concern that the C.D.C. is posting guidelines that its own officials did not author. A former C.D.C. director, Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, railed against the move on Twitter on Wednesday:\n\nLater, in an interview, Dr. Frieden elaborated. He noted that the C.D.C. had recently dropped its recommendation that people quarantine for 14 days after traveling from an area with a high number of cases to one where the virus was less prevalent. And he reiterated that testing the contacts of those infected was an important means of curbing the spread of the virus.\n\n\"We don't know the best protocol for testing of contacts: Should you test all contacts? That's the kind of study that frankly needs to get done,\" Dr. Frieden said. But absent the answer to that question, he added, \"I certainly wouldn't say, 'Don't test contacts.'\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes.

It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nDemocrats, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and two governors -- Mr. Cuomo and Gavin Newsom of California -- were outraged by the changes. Mr. Newsom said California would not follow the new guidelines, and Mr. Cuomo blamed Mr. Trump.\n\nRepresentative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, a Democrat and the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, also chimed in on Twitter: \"The Trump Admin has a lot of explaining to do. #COVID19 testing is essential to stopping the spread of the pandemic. I'm concerned that CDC is once again caving to political pressure. This simply cannot stand.\"\n\nMr. Trump has suggested that the nation should do less testing, arguing that administering more tests was driving up case numbers and making the United States look bad. But experts say the true measure of the pandemic is not case numbers but test positivity rates -- the percentage of tests coming back positive.\n\nAs Dr. Giroir denied that politics was involved, he encouraged the continued testing of asymptomatic people for surveillance purposes -- to determine the prevalence of the virus in a given community -- and said such \"baseline surveillance testing\" would still be appropriate in schools and on college campuses.\n\n\"We're trying to do appropriate testing, not less testing,\" he said.\n\nStill, the revisions left many public health officials scratching their heads. They might have made sense when the United States was experiencing a shortage of tests, some experts said, but that no longer appears to be the case. Dr. Frieden, however, said it was possible the administration was trying to conserve testing in case of another surge.\n\n\"The problem is we have too many cases, so there is basically no way to keep up the testing if you have a huge outbreak,\" he said.\n\nJennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said she was \"not as up in arms about the content of the guidelines\" as she was about the idea that the C.D.C.'s own experts did not write them -- and that C.D.C. officials were referring all questions about them to the health department in Washington.\n\n\"These guidelines are clearly controversial, and many are calling on C.D.C. to explain its rationale for them, but C.D.C. is unable to comment,\" she said in an email. \"This is really dangerous precedent, and I fear it will erode public trust in C.D.C.\"\n\nAbby Goodnough and Eileen Sullivan contributed reporting.",

But in a summer when maintenance crews are shrinking, skipped lawn trims and infrequent trash pickup have left some parkland unsightly and dirty at a time when New Yorkers say they need the city's 1,700 green oases more than ever.\n\nThe cigarette butts, charcoal heaps and candy wrappers have a snowballing effect on quality of life, contributing to a sense of a city fraying amid the pandemic. Some New Yorkers fear that the disheveled parks are a portent of something far worse than litter: a city spiraling toward decline.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-27T09:19:24.433Z Education systems are failing to reach many children, resulting in a 'global education emergency.'

In that era, a period of economic and social turmoil, the city's parks fell into disrepair and became hot spots for crime.\n\nHe added: \"All New Yorkers spend their time in them right now; if they are not well taken care of, then it feels like the city is not taking care of its citizens.\"\n\nIn a familiar pattern of economic inequity, many residents of underserved communities feel that their parks are the most tarnished.\n\nIn Bronx Park, which contains the Bronx Zoo, Elizabeth Soto, 19, arrived at dawn on a recent Saturday to set up an outdoor baby shower for her aunt. But she had to head back home to get a rake and trash bags to pick up all the garbage: Butterfinger wrappers, charcoal briquettes and aluminum foil.\n\n\"It's kind of depressing,\" said Ms. Soto as a squirrel licked a fruit snack wrapper nearby. \"We're stuck in the house, and then we come out of the house and we have to do extra cleaning.\"\n\nThat extra cleaning in past years might have been done by some 1,700 seasonal workers, who would cut grass, paint over graffiti and weed at all city parks. Because of the $84 million in cuts -- about 14 percent of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation's total yearly budget of $587 million -- those seasonal jobs went unfilled this year. The department has 45 percent less staff to handle more work, a spokeswoman said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mayor Bill de Blasio has said that 22,000 city jobs could be cut in October, including from the parks department.\n\nIn the meantime, maintenance hours have been reduced by 25,000 hours a week, according to the department, which uses an app to track chores. Maintenance crews are able to get to about 400 fewer sites per week, the department said. In McCarren Park, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for example, sunbathers lounged in knee-high grass last weekend, the result of a systemwide reduced mowing schedule.\n\nEven wealthier parks have not been fully spared: According to a spokeswoman for the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit organization that raises private money for that park, a drop in donations and in revenue from closed parks concessions made it necessary to reduce landscaping projects and divert resources to trash management.\n\nMark Focht, the parks department's deputy commissioner and chief operating officer, said that the combination of budget cuts and increased use has left the agency struggling to keep up with the trash. The department is launching an awareness campaign urging people to take their refuse with them and will have employees hand out garbage bags at sites throughout the city.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all.

They came to work straight thorough the pandemic, they were out here working every day to try and keep the places clean and presentable,\" Mr. Focht said. \"It is not always the condition in all places that we would like it to be, but the extent of what we can provide to the public is still critical to the health of the city.\"\n\nFears of a crime wave have not materialized; between April and June, the last quarter for which data was available, major crimes within parks were down by about 50 percent, according to New York City Police Department data.\n\nYet for some, the grimy parks still seem the last straw in a teetering city.\n\nAt Hector Aponte Track and Field, in Soundview Park in the Bronx, two cousins, Terrell Alexander and William Schuyler, ran football drills on a recent weekend, stepping around Ziploc bags of mangoes with chili flakes, a Pringles tube, scattered cheese curls and sharp Heineken caps.\n\nMr. Alexander, 30, a facilities assistant at an environmental law firm, said there was an emotional toll in seeing such a scene in a city that has been devastated by the virus and is struggling toward a comeback. \"It's hard to come here to see that,\" he said.\n\nIn Prospect Park in Brooklyn, two couples recently sat in folding chairs, surrounded by paper plates and fish bones strewn on the ground, looking at real estate listings for houses in Kingston, N.Y. They sat in a triangle of trash created by three vertiginous piles of rubbish made up of 38 full black plastic garbage bags.\n\nOne couple said they were considering moving now that theaters and other cultural attractions were shut, and the city's vibrancy had dimmed.\n\n\"If all the things that we are here for -- including a beautiful park -- if that's just another thing that's going down the tube,\" Rosie Cohe, 37, began saying, before her friend, Florencia Jocou, 39, finished the sentence: \"It's another reason to leave.\"\n\nSome have taken matters into their own hands. Ruben Diaz, Jr. the Bronx borough president, was so disgusted with the litter in Soundview Park -- across the street from his home -- that he started bagging it himself on Monday mornings. That has morphed into \"Meaningful Mondays,\" a volunteer call-to-action that has drawn up to 40 residents at a time to work alongside him for the past several weeks.\n\nAbout a dozen other Bronx officials have launched similar programs, Mr. Diaz said. The Hunters Point Parks Conservancy, which oversees the waterfront parks of Long Island City, has also launched volunteer cleanup days. In Prospect Park, neighborhood groups also do cleanups. \"The city is broke, the state says that they're broke, so this is the time where we all need to put our boots on the ground,\" Mr. Diaz said.\n\nNate Schweber contributed reporting.",

        "body": "Picking up trash makes the outdoors a more beautiful space to inhabit -- for everyone.\n\nWelcome. The At Home team got a lovely email recently from a woman in Brooklyn who lives near Prospect Park. One of her pandemic activities, she reported, is to go to the park to collect trash. She walks in one direction, gloved and masked, picking up detritus and filling a plastic bag. Then she walks back across the fields she's made pristine. \"It looks clean,\" she wrote, \"and I'm filled with happiness I can share by protecting this recreational area as a sanctuary during a pandemic.\"\n\nIt's worth giving that activity a try yourself this weekend, treating our shared, outside world as an extension of our own homes, places to care for and clean. I did with my kids, taking a long walk along a shoreline where people come to escape their hot apartments, to catch a breeze, to shoot the breeze. We managed three full garbage bags walking in one direction. And we thrilled to the beauty of our return journey, just as the letter writer did.\n\nLife during the pandemic can be lonely, even if you're lucky enough to have a pod. Picking up garbage in public, amazingly enough, can help alleviate it. People called out thanks and kudos as we walked. Conversations abounded, of just the sort we used to fall into with strangers before the virus came, albeit at a distance, albeit with masks.\n\nMore good ideas for living a good life at home and near it appears below. Please write and tell us what else you'd like to know about: athome@nytimes.com. And we'll try to be helpful to you, as this week a nice reader from Brooklyn was to us.\n\nHow to pass the time.\n\n\"Death Bed (Coffee for Your Head)\" became the soundtrack for thousands of TikTok videos this year. Our critic Jon Caramanica says the track by Powfu, a 21-year-old musician from Vancouver, is one of the year's best pop songs. And the Afro-fusion artist Burna Boy has a new album, mostly recorded during the pandemic, coming August 13. It was executive produced by Diddy and features guest appearances from Naughty by Nature, Chris Martin and Youssou N'Dour.\n\n\"Did I still love the city if bars and museums were closed? If there were no plays, musicals or movies?\" Our photographic timeline of the past five months looks at a season of massive change in New York City. And while life is not quite back to normal, city dwellers are taking the ferry to Governors Island and sunbathing in Brooklyn Bridge Park.\n\nThe Public Theater suspended its Shakespeare in the Park series this year for the first time, but the PBS series Great Performances has made last summer's \"Much Ado About Nothing,\" starring Danielle Brooks, available on its website into September. Other suggestions from our culture writers for what to do this weekend include taking in a livestream of the tenor saxophonist Shabaka Hutchings and checking out Sonos Radio, which offers a selection of curated programs from the likes of Khruangbin and David Byrne. (Those without Sonos devices can listen on demand on Mixcloud.)\n\nWhat to watch.\n\nIf you're missing the zaniness of \"Barry\" and have a half-hour to spare, Margaret Lyons suggests you watch \"Hitmen\" on Peacock Premium, starring the \"Great British Baking Show\" hosts Sue Perkins and Mel Giedroyc. (The first episode is free.)\n\nEvery day feels the same right now, it's true, so why not take in a final streaming of \"Groundhog Day\" before it leaves Netflix this month? \"Clueless\" is on its way out too, so schedule a viewing and make it a mini 1990s film fest weekend. (If your tastes skew more '80s, you've also got until the 31st to watch \"The Karate Kid,\" \"Tootsie\" and \"School Daze.\")\n\nAnd if you're in the mood for a new release, our critic Lovia Gyarkye says the new adaptation of \"The Secret Garden\" is just as charming as you remember.\n\nHow to deal.\n\nEvery cough, every sneeze, every tickle in the throat makes you wonder if you've caught Covid-19. The symptoms can be unpredictable. Our interactive guide can help you understand them. And if you've hit a \"pandemic wall,\" you're not alone. A recent Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll showed that a majority of American adults believes the pandemic is affecting their mental health.\n\nDreaming of future travel? Hotels are trying to put travelers' minds at ease: Hilton has partnered with Lysol, Radisson clerks toss you your key from three feet away and, at many chains, breakfast buffets are a thing of the past.\n\nPet adoptions have gone way up during the pandemic as lockdown has led to loneliness. If you're considering a pandemic puppy, you don't have to sacrifice style at home. But you'll want to choose furniture colors that complement your pet's fur, invest in a powerful vacuum and accept that your new family member is probably going to scratch up your leather sofa and gnaw on stray slippers.\n\nLike what you see?\n\nSign up to receive the At Home newsletter.

        "body": "The agency's chief spokeswoman, Emily Miller, was removed from her position just 11 days into the job. And the contract was terminated of a consultant who had advised the F.D.A. chief to correct misleading claims about plasma's benefits.\n\nThe head of the Food and Drug Administration ousted its top spokeswoman from her position on Friday in an urgent bid to restore the tarnished credibility of the agency after he made erroneous claims that overstated the benefits of plasma treatments for Covid-19 at a news conference with President Trump.\n\nThe decision came just a day after the F.D.A.'s parent agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, terminated the contract of a public relations consultant who had advised the F.D.A. commissioner, Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, to correct his misleading claims that 35 out of 100 Covid-19 patients \"would have been saved because of the administration of plasma.\"\n\nThe removals come at a moment when the agency, which will be making critical decisions about whether to approve coronavirus vaccines and treatments, is struggling to salvage its reputation as a neutral scientific arbiter.\n\nThe ousted spokeswoman, Emily Miller, had little experience in health care. She had spent years working in Washington for Republicans, including the former Texas Congressman Tom DeLay and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, and as a journalist for One America News, the conservative cable network. She was in her agency post for just 11 days.\n\n\"This is a low moment for the F.D.A. in at least a generation,\" Daniel Carpenter, a professor at Harvard University who studies the agency, said of Dr. Hahn's failure to control the public message about the plasma authorization. \"This was a major self-inflicted wound.\"\n\nThe most recent controversy over plasma follows a series of missteps by the F.D.A. that have fueled concerns that the agency is losing the public's trust as the nation faces a presidential election in November and a pandemic that has taken more than 180,000 American lives.\n\nAlso this week, the nation's premier public health agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was accused of bowing to political pressure after it revised its testing guidelines to say people without symptoms of the virus didn't need to get tested.\n\nDr. Hahn has already been criticized for a series of worrisome actions, including authorizing the emergency use of two malaria drugs Mr. Trump had favored -- a decision that was later revoked -- and for having allowed the sale of shoddy antibody tests early in the U.S. outbreak.\n\n\"The agency needs to work very hard to regain the trust of the American people -- there have been too many unforced errors,\" said Dr. David A. Kessler, who was F.D.A. commissioner under Presidents George Bush and Clinton, and is advising Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s presidential campaign. \"It needs to focus on what it does best, which is to put the data in front of the medical and scientific community and the American public, and stick with the data.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T23:12:23.376Z California will allow indoor dining in San Diego and San Francisco as early as next week. Two P.R. experts at the F.D.A. have been removed after the fiasco over convalescent plasma. 'We are incredibly concerned': Local health departments urge the C.D.C. to pull its new guidance on testing. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nDr. Hahn notified senior leadership at the F.D.A. on Friday that Ms. Miller would no longer be the official spokeswoman for the agency, and that he would be appointing someone to replace her in an interim capacity. Ms. Miller could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe consultant who was removed by the health and human services department, Wayne L. Pines, said he wasn't told why his contract was severed.\n\n\"I did recommend that he correct the record,\" he said. \"If a federal official doesn't say something right, and chooses to clarify and say that the criticism is justified, that's refreshing.\"\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services denied that Mr. Pines's contract was terminated because of his involvement in the plasma messaging.\n\nIt was \"100 percent coincidence,\" said Brian Harrison, the department's chief of staff. \"H.H.S. has been reviewing and canceling similar contracts, so I had it sent to our lawyers, who recommended termination. This was routine,\" he said.\n\nNevertheless, the decision by Dr. Hahn to clarify his remarks and to grant a series of media interviews appears to have rankled H.H.S. officials, who saw it as ill-timed, given that the Republican convention was underway. Trump administration officials are often reluctant to publicly admit error out of concern that doing so provides political ammunition to their critics.\n\nMr. Pines is president of the large health care practice at APCO Worldwide, a public relations and lobbying firm that represents health companies that do business before the F.D.A. He said he did this work on his own, outside of his APCO practice. He would not say how much he was paid, but noted that as a friend to Dr. Hahn, he is willing to continue advising him for free.\n\nMeredith McGehee, executive director of Issue One, which promotes bipartisan political reform, was critical of the contract, noting the potential for conflicts of interest in Mr. Pines's work for the F.D.A., and his company's health care client base.\n\n\"This notion that, 'Oh, I'm doing it in my private capacity, on the one hand, and I'm representing health care interests, on the other,' it doesn't pass the smell test,\" said Ms. McGehee.\n\nThe F.D.A. did not respond to requests for comment on Friday about Mr. Pines's contract or whether it was vetted for conflicts of interest.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nMs. Miller started at the agency on Aug. 17 after a career in both politics and journalism. In 2004, while working for the Department of State, she made headlines after she apparently cut off an interview for a taped segment between Tim Russert, the host of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" and her boss, the then Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who could be heard apologizing to Mr. Russert and saying \"Emily, get out of the way.\" In 2015, reporters cast doubt on whether Ms. Miller had been a victim of a home invasion, a story that she had repeatedly included in public remarks and in a book, \"Emily Gets Her Gun: But Obama Wants to Take Yours.\"\n\nThe decision to hire Ms. Miller as the agency's top spokeswoman was seen as puzzling by outside observers, given that she had little experience in health care. On May 30, Ms. Miller tweeted, \"Remember coronavirus?\"\n\nThe F.D.A. had been considering allowing the use of convalescent plasma as a treatment for Covid-19 on an emergency basis, but last week The New York Times reported that the decision had been delayed after top health officials Dr. Francis S. Collins and Dr. Anthony S. Fauci intervened and expressed concern that the available evidence on the effectiveness of the treatment was too weak. F.D.A. officials argued that although the data was preliminary and needed continued analysis as more patients are treated, plasma still met the agency's standard for emergency use authorization.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Mr. Trump tweeted that the \"deep state\" at the F.D.A. was slowing drug development. Late that night, the White House press secretary tweeted that the president would have a news conference the next day \"concerning a major therapeutic breakthrough.\"\n\nThe announcement should have been a rare win for the F.D.A., which for months had fended off criticism of its track record on the pandemic, and questions about the independence of Dr. Hahn, who was previously pressured by Mr. Trump to authorize malaria drugs that turned out to be ineffective for Covid-19 and carried risks of harmful side effects. But last weekend, finally, the agency could reveal some legitimate good news: convalescent plasma, the antibody-rich plasma donated by Covid-19 survivors, showed promise for a subset of patients when given early.\n\nThe announcement, made at the White House on Sunday, has instead spurred a week of recriminations, anger and mistrust between the F.D.A. and H.H.S. The officials' statements Sunday cast nuanced and preliminary data as \"a very historic breakthrough,\" as Mr. Trump put it. The exaggerated statements drew criticism from scientists and at least three former agency commissioners.\n\nWithin the F.D.A. and H.H.S., officials have offered conflicting accounts for how a single misleading statistic -- that plasma led to a 35 percent reduction in deaths -- appeared in the remarks of Mr. Trump, Dr. Hahn and Alex. M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary. It was also unclear why Dr. Hahn, a longtime cancer doctor, and Mr. Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive, did not themselves catch the overstated statistic. No randomized trials have found a survival benefit for convalescent plasma. The 35 percent number referred to a tiny subset of patients, and was a relative comparison between two groups, not an absolute reduction in deaths.\n\nAt a speech at the convention on Thursday evening, the president again overstated what's known about the benefits of plasma, promising it \"will save thousands and thousands of lives.\"\n\nMissteps by the F.D.A., a federal agency that has long prided itself on its scientific independence, have heightened concerns that the American public may not be willing to take a vaccine approved by the agency, particularly if the decision is seen as having been made under pressure from Mr. Trump.\n\n\"It's very important for the leadership of the agency, especially the commissioner, to be accurate about the information he's providing and to do it in a way that really sticks to the facts,\" said Dr. Mark McClellan, who was F.D.A. commissioner under President George W. Bush.\n\n\"There's almost not enough adjectives to describe how appalling this is,\" said Emily K. Brunson, a medical anthropologist at Texas State University. Opinion polls have shown that many Americans are already wary of taking a vaccine for the virus.\n\nIf approval of a vaccine is viewed as politically motivated, she said, \"it has the potential to really make this a disastrous situation.\"\n\nSharon LaFraniere and Maggie Haberman contributed reporting.",

        "body": "ROME -- With confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. hitting 5 million Sunday, by far the highest of any country, the failure of the most powerful nation in the world to contain the scourge has been met with astonishment and alarm in Europe.\n\nPerhaps nowhere outside the U.S. is America's bungled virus response viewed with more consternation than in Italy, which was ground zero of Europe's epidemic. Italians were unprepared when the outbreak exploded in February, and the country still has one of the world's highest official death tolls at over 35,000.\n\nBut after a strict nationwide, 10-week lockdown, vigilant tracing of new clusters and general acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing, Italy has become a model of virus containment.\n\n\"Don't they care about their health?\" a mask-clad Patrizia Antonini asked about people in the United States as she walked with friends along the banks of Lake Bracciano, north of Rome. \"They need to take our precautions. ... They need a real lockdown.\"\n\nMuch of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical know-how to treat the virus that the continent itself didn't have when the first COVID-19 patients started filling intensive care units.\n\nM ore than four months into a sustained outbreak, the U.S. reached the 5 million mark, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Health officials believe the actual number is perhaps 10 times higher, or closer to 50 million, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40% of all those who are infected have no symptoms.\n\n\"We Italians always saw America as a model,\" said Massimo Franco, a columnist with daily Corriere della Sera. \"But with this virus we've discovered a country that is very fragile, with bad infrastructure and a public health system that is nonexistent.\"\n\nWith America's world's-highest death toll of more than 160,000, its politicized resistance to masks and its rising caseload, European nations have barred American tourists and visitors from other countries with growing cases from freely traveling to the bloc.\n\nFrance and Germany are now imposing tests on arrival for travelers from \"at risk\" countries, the U.S. included.\n\n\"I am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention,\" German Health Minister Jens Spahn said last week.\n\nMistakes were made in Europe, too, from delayed lockdowns to insufficient protections for nursing home elderly and critical shortages of tests and protective equipment for medical personnel.\n\nHard-hit Spain, France, Britain and Germany have seen infection rebounds with new cases topping 1,000 a day, and Italy's cases went over 500 on Friday. Some scientists say Britain's beloved pubs might have to close again if schools are to reopen in September.\n\nEurope as a whole has seen over 207,000 confirmed virus deaths, by Johns Hopkins' count.\n\nIn the U.S., new cases are running at about 54,000 a day -- an immensely high number even when taking into account the country's large population. And while that's down from a peak of well over 70,000 last month, cases are rising in nearly 20 states, and deaths are climbing in most.\n\nIn contrast, at least for now Europe appears to have the virus somewhat under control.\n\n\"Had the medical professionals been allowed to operate in the States, you would have belatedly gotten to a point of getting to grips with this back in March,\" said Scott Lucas, professor of international studies at the University of Birmingham, England. \"But of course, the medical and public health professionals were not allowed to proceed unchecked,\" he said, referring to President Donald Trump 's frequent undercutting of his own experts.\n\nWhen the virus first appeared in the United States, Trump and his supporters quickly dismissed it as either a \"hoax\" or a scourge that would quickly disappear once warmer weather arrived. At one point, Trump suggested that ultraviolet light or injecting disinfectants would eradicate the virus. (He later said he was being facetious).\n\nTrump's frequent complaints about Dr. Anthony Fauci have regularly made headlines in Europe, where the U.S. infectious-disease expert is a respected figure. Italy's leading COVID-19 hospital offered Fauci a job if Trump fired him.\n\nTrump has defended the U.S. response, blaming China, where the virus was first detected, for America's problems and saying the U.S. numbers are so high because there is so much testing. Trump supporters and Americans who have refused to wear masks against all medical advice back that line.\n\n\u202a\"There's no reason to fear any sickness that's out there,\" said Julia Ferjo, a mother of three in Alpine, Texas, who is \"vehemently\" against wearing a mask. \u202aFerjo, 35, teaches fitness classes in a large gym with open doors. She doesn't allow participants to wear masks.\n\n\u202a\"When you're breathing that hard, I would pass out,\" she said. \"I do not want people just dropping like flies.\"\n\nAnd health officials watched with alarm as thousands of bikers gathered Friday in the small South Dakota city of Sturgis for an annual 10-day motorcycle rally. The state has no mask mandates, and many bikers expressed defiance of measures meant to prevent the virus's spread.\n\nDr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who is leading a team seeking treatments for COVID-19, decried such behavior, as well as the country's handling of the virus.\n\n\"There's no national strategy, no national leadership, and there's no urging for the public to act in unison and carry out the measures together,\" he said. \"That's what it takes, and we have completely abandoned that as a nation.\"\n\nWhen he gets on Zoom calls with counterparts from around the globe, \"everyone cannot believe what they're seeing in the U.S. and they cannot believe the words coming out of the leadership,'' he said.\n\nAmid the scorn from other countries, Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien, newly recovered from a bout with the virus, gave an upbeat picture Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n\"We're going to fight like heck. We're working hard on vaccines. We're working hard on testing machines that are portable and fast. ... We're working on therapeutics,\" he said. \"I'm so impressed with our scientists and our doctors and our first responders and the folks who are attacking this disease, and God bless them all.\"\n\nMany Europeans point proudly to their national health care systems that not only test but treat COVID-19 for free, unlike the American system, where the virus crisis has only exacerbated income and racial inequalities in obtaining health care.\n\n\"The coronavirus has brutally stripped bare the vulnerability of a country that has been sliding for years,\" wrote Italian author Massimo Gaggi in his new book \"Crack America\" (Broken America), about U.S. problems that long predated COVID-19.\n\nGaggi said he started writing the book last year and thought then that the title would be taken as a provocative wake-up call. Then the virus hit.\n\n\"By March the title wasn't a provocation any longer,\" he said. \"It was obvious.\"\n\n___\n\nPane reported from Boise, Idaho.

        "body": "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Venezuelan officials are denouncing people who may have come into contact with the coronavirus as \"bioterrorists\" and urging their neighbors to report them. The government is detaining and intimidating doctors and experts who question the president's policies on the virus.\n\nAnd it is corralling thousands of Venezuelans who are streaming home after losing jobs abroad, holding them in makeshift containment centers out of fear that they may be infected.\n\nPresident Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has tackled the coronavirus much as he has any internal threat to his rule: by deploying his repressive security apparatus against it.\n\nIn commandeered hotels, disused schools and cordoned-off bus stations, Venezuelans returning home from other countries in Latin America are being forced into crowded rooms with limited food, water or masks. And they are being held under military guard for weeks or months for coronavirus tests or treatment with unproven medications, according to interviews with the detainees, videos they have taken on their cellphones and government documents.\n\n\"They told us we're contaminated, that we're guilty of infecting the country,\" said Javier Aristizabal, a nurse from the capital, Caracas, who said he spent 70 days in centers after he returned from Colombia in March.\n\nIn one major city, San Crist\u00f3bal, governing party activists are marking the homes of families suspected of having the virus with plaques and threatening them with detention, residents said. In another city, Maracaibo, the police are patrolling the streets in search of Venezuelans who re-entered the country without official approval. Local opposition politicians whose constituencies register an outbreak say they are threatened with prosecution.\n\n\"This is the only country in the world where having Covid is a crime,\" said Sergio Hidalgo, a Venezuelan opposition activist who said he had come down with symptoms of the disease, only to find police officers at his door and government officials accusing him of infecting the community.\n\nAs the pandemic tore through neighboring countries, overwhelming health care networks far more prepared than Venezuela's collapsed system, Mr. Maduro took a hard-line approach, treating the coronavirus as a national security threat that could destabilize his bankrupt nation and jeopardize his grip on power.\n\n\"The pandemic clearly presents a threat to the government because it shows the precariousness of its resources,\" said John Magdaleno, a Venezuelan political scientist in Caracas. \"The priority is not dealing with the pandemic. It is short-term political survival.\"\n\nIn his seven years in power, Mr. Maduro has overseen the collapse of Venezuela's health care system, the destruction of the national economy, and a marked increase in the country's international isolation.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-19T22:21:26.179Z Some teachers' unions push to delay in-person learning as more colleges go online only. Officials in Wuhan and Hubei Province tried to hide information from China's central leadership, a U.S. report finds. Hold off approving plasma for emergency use, Fauci and others warn the F.D.A.: The data isn't strong enough yet. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nWith dwindling resources to prepare the nation's broken hospitals or help its already impoverished population survive the crisis, Mr. Maduro has turned to bare-bones detention facilities, repression and coercion to try to stop the virus from overwhelming the country, political analysts said.\n\nThe government's heavy-handed approach may be keeping more people at home and slowing the virus's spread, but it is also discouraging those who may be sick from seeking help. That, in turn, is making the pandemic even harder to fight, doctors in Venezuela said.\n\n\"When people feel sick, they think they have a legal or a police problem, as if they were delinquents,\" said Julio Castro, a Venezuelan doctor who advises the opposition-controlled Congress on health care. \"So they prefer to hide.\"\n\nThe true scope of the pandemic in Venezuela, a country that stopped releasing health statistics as basic as infant mortality years ago, is nearly impossible to determine.\n\nBut with 20 top officials reporting that they had tested positive and some doctors warning that their hospitals were near capacity, the situation may be far worse than the official tally of 288 deaths in a country of about 30 million people suggests.\n\nDoctors and journalists who have questioned official statistics say they have been threatened. At least 12 Venezuelan doctors and nurses have been detained for making public comments on the coronavirus, according to medical unions.\n\nVenezuelan migrants who return home after losing their jobs abroad in the wake of the pandemic are particularly targeted.\n\nAccording to the Colombian government, about 95,000 Venezuelans have crossed back into their home country since March, and 42,000 are waiting their turn along the border.\n\nOnly 1,200 are allowed to return each week through the main border crossing, under Venezuelan government guidelines, forcing others to wait for months in makeshift camps. Those who use illegal trails to cross the porous land border are publicly labeled threats.\n\nOn Twitter, the armed forces of Venezuela urged the population to report so-called bioterrorists, referring to Venezuelans who had evaded government border controls and returned home.\n\nThe Times interviewed seven Venezuelans who were held in containment centers. Several said they had been crammed into rooms without beds, hot food, windows or sufficient drinking water.\n\n\"You couldn't ask anyone for help, because the only thing you got was abuse,\" said Mr. Aristizabal, the nurse, who was shuttled among several centers after he returned from visiting his mother in Colombia.\n\nDuring his detention, Mr. Aristizabal said he had slept on the ground at times -- on the asphalt of a bus station or on the floor of a windowless hotel room that he shared with five other people.\n\nSome said that they had been detained with babies just a year old, with no special provisions made for the children. Others said that they had been obliged to take the medications outlined in Venezuela's official protocol for treating anyone who has, or is suspected of having, the coronavirus, even without showing any symptoms.\n\nThe drugs listed in the government guidelines are unproven for treating the coronavirus, and could have dangerous consequences. The treatments include hydroxychloroquine, which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned can cause dangerous heart rhythm abnormalities in coronavirus patients, and an anti-parasite drug called ivermectin, which the World Health Organization said should not be used to treat the illness.\n\nVideos taken by Venezuelans in confinement centers showed unsanitary conditions. Several people said they were not getting treatment for pre-existing conditions, were given a single mask for their stay and were unable to practice social distancing.\n\nBut the worst part, they said, was that they had no idea of how long they would be held.\n\nIn one video published by an opposition lawmaker, five older men and women wrapped in dirty blankets are shown crammed into a small, windowless room with dilapidated chairs and one bunk bed without mattresses in what they said was a government-run first-aid station in Caracas.\n\n\"Please take me out of here,\" said one visibly distraught man. \"I'm dying here. I feel worse every day.\"\n\nMr. Maduro's crackdown on returning Venezuelan migrants contrasts with the freedom enjoyed by the country's governing elite, who are weathering the lockdown on closed Caribbean islands, hillside mansions and lavish, invitation-only restaurants.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 17, 2020\n\nWhy does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nTop party officials who contract the coronavirus seek treatment in private clinics or at Caracas's reliable military hospital. For a few thousand dollars, wealthy returning travelers can skip the mandatory quarantine and go straight home.\n\nLuxury bulletproof SUVs without license plates zip through Caracas's upmarket neighborhoods at night, while a few miles away, armed pro-government militias enforce the lockdown in the poorest communities.\n\nMr. Maduro claims that his rapid response -- he locked down the country on March 17, right after the first two coronavirus cases were confirmed -- has prevented the devastation endured by nearby countries.\n\nOfficially, Venezuela boasts one of the region's lowest infection rates. Five months after the virus was detected, the number of daily deaths, according to the government, has never surpassed 12.\n\n\"You're given care that's unique in the world, humane care, loving, Christian,\" said Mr. Maduro in a national address on Aug. 14.\n\nBut health experts say the low official figures are the result of extremely low testing rates. Accurate coronavirus tests are scarce and take weeks to process in one of the two laboratories approved by the government, according to eight doctors in three Venezuelan states interviewed for this article. The doctors did not want to reveal their names for fear of government persecution.\n\nMost patients with Covid-19 symptoms are never tested or die before they receive their results, so they are never included in the official statistics, the doctors said.\n\nIn the western state of Zulia, the government said 70 people had died from Covid-19 by the second week of August. But a group of doctors who track mortality in the state said that in a single hospital -- Zulia's largest -- 294 patients had died with coronavirus symptoms by then.\n\nDays before Venezuela confirmed its first coronavirus case, the governor of Zulia, Omar Prieto, said in a public address that he ordered military counterintelligence to question a prominent doctor for alerting about potential infections.\n\n\"This is an issue of national security and this man has to be investigated,\" Mr. Prieto said about the doctor, Freddy Pachano.\n\nZulia's capital, Maracaibo, has since become the epicenter of Venezuela's pandemic.\n\nOne crematory in Maracaibo went from processing its usual average of five bodies a day to 20 bodies by June, before its oven broke from overwork, according to the facility's manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal.\n\nOfficials in Maracaibo have since opened a common grave in the municipal cemetery.\n\nMr. Prieto, the governor, tested positive for the coronavirus but recovered at a private clinic.\n\nDr. Pachano, who tried to sound the alert about the impending crisis, has fled to Colombia to avoid arrest.\n\n\"It's not possible to take adequate measures to fight the disease if you don't really know what is happening,\" he said.\n\nAnatoly Kurmanaev and Isayen Herrera reported from Caracas.

And the U.S. now has company as a coronavirus outlier.\n\nThe United States is no longer the world's only rich country still suffering through a major coronavirus outbreak. So is Spain.\n\nSpain's number of cases has surged in the last month. Over the last week, its per capita rate of new cases has been five times larger than France's, six times larger than Portugal's and 15 times larger than Japan's. Adjusted for population, Spain's outbreak has even surpassed the U.S. outbreak over the last few days.\n\nHow has it happened? Health experts are still trying to figure that out. But some of the early answers may sound familiar to Americans.\n\nLack of a clear national message. Spain's prime minister -- Pedro S\u00e1nchez, of the Socialist Workers' Party -- has not promoted medical disinformation, as President Trump has. Yet S\u00e1nchez has recently handed back control of virus policy to regional governments, instead of continuing to provide clear leadership about how people should behave. \"In the past month, regions have announced new measures almost weekly, and they have often differed,\" Raphael Minder, who's based in Madrid for The Times, told me.\n\nLast week, S\u00e1nchez went on vacation and didn't address the public as the crisis mounted, Rodrigo Orihuela of Bloomberg reported.\n\nPremature reopening. Spanish officials, like their American counterparts, made the mistake of thinking they could help the economy by prioritizing it over public health. Bars and nightclubs reopened. British tourists -- a major source of revenue -- were allowed to travel to Spain without restriction, in what Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez of El Diario called \"a desperate attempt to save the summer season.\"\n\nIn truth, the only way to help the economy is to control the virus. \"We wanted to return to normality too quickly,\" Magda Campins, a Barcelona doctor, told El Pa\u00eds.\n\nNot enough testing and contact tracing. The shortages have made it \"difficult for health authorities to identify and isolate potential virus carriers,\" according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nAs I've written before, there is a set of consistent lessons from around the world about how to beat back the virus: Mass testing. Rapid quarantines, contact tracing and, when necessary, lockdowns. Limited social gatherings, especially indoors. Widespread mask wearing.\n\nAfter taking these steps, many countries, including Canada, Australia and much of Europe and Asia, have the virus under control. Spain itself followed this strategy in the spring and also sharply reduced new cases (as you can see in the chart above) -- before lifting its state of emergency on June 21 and reopening less carefully than its neighbors.\n\nSince then, it has joined the U.S. as a classic exception that proves the rule.\n\nIn other virus developments:\n\nScientists have confirmed the first known case of reinfection in a person who had recovered. But the patient experienced no symptoms from his second infection, indicating his immune system may have learned how to respond.\n\nA judge in Florida struck down the state's requirement that public schools open their classrooms for in-person instruction.\n\nThe University of Alabama said that 531 cases had been identified among students, faculty and staff since classes resumed at its Tuscaloosa campus last week.\n\nOutside scientists believe Trump administration officials have misrepresented the effectiveness of blood plasma treatment.\n\nOn today's episode of \"The Daily\" The Times's infectious disease reporter, Donald McNeil, talks about the state of the pandemic.\n\nTWO MORE BIG STORIES1. Night 1 of the R.N.C.\n\nOn the first night of the Republican National Convention, President Trump and his allies presented a bleak vision of the country's future under a Biden administration. Donald Trump Jr., the president's son, framed the election as a choice between \"church, work and school\" and \"rioting, looting and vandalism.\" Here's a four-minute video recap of the night.\n\nRepublicans also mounted what Times reporters called \"a fierce and misleading defense\" of Trump's record on race relations and the coronavirus. Here's a fact-check.\n\nCan it work? Political analysts aren't sure.\n\n\"So far, the RNC seems to be mostly providing content designed to thrill MAGA devotees who already love Trump,\" Robby Soave wrote for the conservative publication Reason. \"I'd think that's a questionable strategy.\" And David Brooks of The Times wrote: \"This convention is targeted to one voter: Donald Trump. The whole convention is to make his lonely soul feel affirmed.\"\n\nJim Geraghty of National Review countered: \"Democrats should feel a little less confident about November right about now. Given the raw material of short snippets of speech, rally video footage, flyovers, ceremonies, the president hugging the disabled, etc., talented editors can make Trump appear Reaganesque.\"\n\n2. Unrest in Wisconsin\n\nProtests, fires and looting erupted in Kenosha, Wis., a day after video showed a police officer shooting an unarmed Black man, Jacob Blake, in the back. Protesters set several Kenosha businesses on fire early this morning. In Madison, thousands of people gathered near the Wisconsin State Capitol.\n\nGov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, announced that he was calling state legislators to a special session next week to consider measures on police accountability.\n\nOfficials have not yet offered many details on the encounter on Sunday, and the officers involved were not wearing body cameras. Blake was in stable condition as of Monday evening.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nTropical Storm Marco significantly weakened before making landfall in Louisiana last night. Still, officials warned residents to stay vigilant for the next storm, Laura, which is following closely behind.\n\nJerry Falwell Jr., a prominent evangelical leader, appeared to be nearing the end of his leadership at Liberty University, after a young associate told Reuters he had a yearslong sexual relationship involving Falwell and his wife.\n\nTikTok sued the U.S. government, accusing the Trump administration of depriving it of due process when Trump issued an executive order to block the app from operating in the country.\n\nPostmaster General Louis DeJoy, facing tough questioning from Democrats in Congress, rejected suggestions that changes he made to the Postal Service were meant to influence the election. Watch a video of the highlights here.\n\nAleksei Navalny, a prominent Russian dissident who fell into a coma last week, was a victim of poisoning, German doctors said. A Berlin hospital is now treating Navalny.\n\nThe billionaire Carl Icahn and a handful of other investors have made hundreds of millions of dollars betting that America's malls would default on their loans as the pandemic accelerates their decline.\n\nLives Lived: Sister Elaine Roulet, a Roman Catholic nun, had a simple idea: that women in prison should have regular time with their children. She created a host of programs to help \"women who are forgotten,\" as her friend the actress Glenn Close said. Roulet died at 89.\n\nIDEA OF THE DAY: The Biden file\n\n\"Joe Biden's life is replete with mistakes and regrets. And, if he comes to the Presidency, he is unlikely to supply much of the exalted rhetoric that reaches into a nation's soul. But, for a people in mourning, he might offer something like solace, a language of healing.\"\n\nThat comes from a new profile of Biden by The New Yorker's Evan Osnos, which I recommend. And if you are interested in trying to understand a politician who will dominate the news for the next two months -- and maybe the following four years -- you can also check out the following:\n\nA 2010 Atlantic article by Mark Bowden argued that Biden's verbosity was core to his political success. It has helped him forge fast, deep connections with voters, as Olivia Nuzzi captured in a more recent New York magazine story.\n\nMore than a year before this year's Democratic National Convention stressed Biden's personal history of tragedy, Politico Magazine's Michael Kruse wrote about grief as Biden's political \"superpower.\"\n\nBiden's efforts to overcome his childhood stutter were the subject of a powerful piece by The Atlantic's John Hendrickson, who also stutters. It changed the way I think of Biden's frequent verbal stumbles.\n\nThe definitive study remains Richard Ben Cramer's \"What It Takes,\" a history of the 1988 presidential campaign, Biden's first. The book \"defined Biden to Biden,\" The Times's media columnist, Ben Smith, has written. You can read an excerpt here.\n\nPLAY, WATCH, EAT, FOOTBALLWhat if pizza grew on farms?\n\nPizza farms -- a Midwestern culinary tradition in which farms operate pizzerias -- are well suited to the coronavirus pandemic. Farmers are looking to make up for lost restaurant sales, and families want a safe place to eat outside their homes.\n\nJulia Moskin, a food reporter, profiled five pizza farms around the country. If you don't live near one, you can mimic the experience at home, by making a classic Pizza Margherita and eating in your own backyard.\n\nFootball dysfunction\n\nFive years ago, Rolling Stone magazine named Daniel Snyder as the country's worst owner of a pro sports franchise. What has happened to his team -- the Washington Football Team -- since then?\n\nAttendance has fallen further. The team has failed to win a single playoff game. It has fired multiple coaches and executives. Its cheerleaders have described being pressured into posing topless for photos. And Snyder has had to abandon his vow \"never\" to change the team name from the slur \"Redskins\" -- but still hasn't come up with a new name.\n\nThe Times has a new story on the infighting between Snyder and his co-owners that has aggravated the team's problems. \"In the century-long history of the N.F.L., rarely has a team faced this much turmoil at once,\" Ken Belson and Katherine Rosman write.\n\nA new look for the Girl Scouts\n\nFor the first time in decades, the Girl Scouts are updating their uniforms, introducing more modern apparel like leggings, crew-neck sweatshirts and denim jackets. The iconic vests and sashes now have pockets designed to fit a phone. \"In all our fittings that was the No. 1 thing,\" said Wendy Lou, the group's deputy chief revenue officer.\n\nDiversions\n\nThese embroidery projects that realistically depict food are oddly mesmerizing.\n\nThe late-night comedy hosts all watched the start of the Republican convention.\n\nGames\n\nHere's today's Mini Crossword, and a clue: Spiny-leaved succulent (four letters).\n\nYou can find all of our puzzles here.\n\nThanks for spending part of your morning with The Times. See you tomorrow. -- David\n\nP.S. The word \"woketopians\" appeared for the first time in The Times yesterday, as noted by the Twitter bot @NYT_first_said.\n\nYou can see today's print front page here.\n\nToday's episode of \"The Daily\" is about where we stand on the pandemic.

        "body": "Admissions tests for many graduate schools have gone online. But not the MCAT, the exam for aspiring doctors. It must still be taken in person, pandemic or not.\n\nStudents applying to graduate schools can take the GRE, the LSAT and other tests at home this year because of the risks of gathering in an exam room for hours during the pandemic. But applicants sitting for the longest and arguably most grueling graduate entrance exam, the Medical College Admission Test, do not have that option.\n\nEven as the nation is overwhelmed by a tide of Covid-19 cases, the Association of American Medical Colleges, which administers the test, is requiring would-be doctors to sit for the $320 exam in small groups at testing centers running back-to-back sessions in order to make up for time lost in the spring, when exams were canceled.\n\nNew testing protocols implemented in May require test takers and staff members to wear masks and maintain social distancing, and prescribe rigorous disinfection of test centers. But examinees have complained of sloppy practices, and there have been isolated reports of people saying they tested positive for the coronavirus around the time they took the exam.\n\nThe association has acknowledged four such cases, while a student group now counts eight. (The A.A.M.C. also has issued a national \"roadmap\" for ending the pandemic that calls for more testing and national criteria for stay-at-home orders.)\n\nNow that group, Students for Ethical Admissions, has called on medical schools to follow Stanford's lead and waive the exam requirement this year, saying students taking the MCAT are putting their health at risk.\n\n\"How can the general public trust physicians and other health care workers when the medical community is so willing to endanger its own?\" the student group asked last month in a letter to medical schools. The group noted that the number of new daily Covid-19 cases in the United States in July was roughly double what it had been in April, when the exams were canceled.\n\nThe American College of Physicians, which represents the nation's internists, has come out in support of a waiver, as has the American Medical Women's Association, which called for more rigorous safety precautions at test sites.\n\nBut Dr. David J. Skorton, the A.A.M.C.'s president, said the organization could not provide the exam remotely because of concerns about both security and equity for examinees who don't have high-speed internet access.\n\nThe association has the support of its deans council, which represents member medical schools, and has said that the safety protocols in place were \"consistent with sound public health principles.\"\n\nDr. Skorton said the exam rooms are a \"low-risk,\" not a \"zero-risk\" environment. \"If you're going to go into medicine, you're going to go into a profession where there is no way to eliminate risk,\" he said.\n\n\"There is no way to put people at zero risk -- that is the nature of the beast. It's different than other professions. What we do is take care of patients.\"\n\nThe estimated 100,000 people who will take the MCAT are years away from becoming physicians, and many will never make it: Just over 40 percent of the 53,371 applicants to American medical schools last year secured a spot.\n\nThe MCAT tests applicants' knowledge of biology, chemistry, physics, psychology and sociology, as well as critical analysis and reasoning skills. The college canceled testing in mid-March, when much of the country was under lockdown, and resumed on May 29 with a shortened version of the seven-and-a-half-hour test. It is now five hours and 45 minutes, with no lunch break.\n\nMany students were relieved the exams started up again, Dr. Skorton said, including some who were retaking it to boost their scores and others who had scheduled exam dates scuttled earlier this year.\n\nTo protect the health and safety of test takers, testing centers are positioning applicants at work stations six feet apart and requiring everyone to wear masks. They also are adopting protocols that call for rigorous cleaning and disinfection between testing sessions of every work station, keyboard, mouse, touch screen, headphone set, check-in station, chair arm, locker and doorknob.\n\nThe new testing schedule -- with exams given three times a day, at 6:30 a.m., 12:15 p.m. and 6 p.m. -- appears to leave little time for cleaning. But Scott Overland, a spokesman for Pearson VUE, which administers the MCAT at 290 centers in the United States, said that start times were staggered to prevent crowding and to allow for the cleaning of work stations, and that many test takers finished the exam early.\n\nTesting centers are operating at half the normal capacity to allow for spacing, and work stations are surrounded by 66-inch-high wall barriers, he said.\n\nBut Students for Ethical Admissions, which will not disclose the names of its members for fear of repercussions, said its survey of some 200 recent test takers found that many reported they were not screened for symptoms of Covid-19 when they checked in at the testing centers.\n\nThey also complained of crowded waiting rooms, inadequate cleaning and inconsistent masking and social distancing. The student group said it knew of eight people who tested positive after taking the exam, including two who were most likely infectious on the exam day, as well as four family members who had been infected by test takers.\n\nThe A.A.M.C. said it knew of four students who tested positive \"close in time\" to taking the test, including one who was symptomatic on the exam day and one who tested positive for the coronavirus before taking the MCAT.\n\nTwo students told The New York Times they were secluded for weeks while preparing for the exam, but became ill and tested positive shortly afterward. Both students asked not to be identified for fear it would hurt their chances of getting into medical school.\n\nBoth said they had inadvertently spread the illness to older relatives, one of whom was hospitalized for weeks; only one test taker said she had reported her illness to the A.A.M.C.\n\nOne student said each time examinees entered or exited the test room during the nearly six-hour test, they were required to place their hands on a scanner and then remove their mask -- touching their face -- so that a photo could be taken for identification purposes.\n\n\"Four kids in front of me scanned their palm, and it never got sanitized,\" the student said.\n\nThe A.A.M.C. said that 43,000 students had taken the exam since testing resumed May 29; of the few infections reported to the college, only one individual expressed concern that the exposure occurred at a testing center, Dr. Skorton said.\n\nSeveral schools have announced they are changing their use of the MCAT this year, citing the public health crisis and the social and economic upheaval of recent months.\n\nThe University of Washington and the University of Minnesota are making the MCAT optional for current applicants who have not yet taken it and are reluctant to take it during the pandemic.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nDartmouth's Geisel School of Medicine will consider waiving the requirement on a case-by-case basis, while Stanford Medical School has said it would rely on other measures to evaluate the academic readiness of applicants this coming year.\n\n\"While the MCAT has value, medicine is a profession that relies on more than whether someone can take a test and regurgitate knowledge,\" said Dr. Iris Gibbs, associate dean for medical admissions at Stanford. \"It's about personal attributes like empathy and caring and being able to problem-solve.\"\n\nStanford, which made the decision in June, was also concerned about equity and the potential that students living in coronavirus hot spots, as well as those with disabilities or chronic illnesses, would be disenfranchised by a requirement to take the MCAT, Dr. Gibbs said.\n\n\"We don't want our pre-health students to worry about taking the exam if this means placing themselves potentially at risk,\" she said.",

        "body": "Getting a pandemic puppy seemed like a bad idea for a blended family. Until we did it.\n\nEven as a child, I never wanted a dog. When I was a longtime single through my 20s, a friend once asked me who I'd rather be with: a partner who had a dog or a partner who had a cat. I said, \"a kid.\"\n\nMy stepdaughter, Louise, is 10 years old and like many girls her age, she has a nurturing and maternal streak. She's attuned to the needs of her parents, friends, babies and animals. At the apartment her father and I share in Hudson, N.Y., we don't have a backyard or pets; at her mom's 40 minutes away, they have a dog, a cat and two horses. We always assumed she was getting the best of both worlds: city and country life.\n\nIn early May, after her elementary school in Catskill, N.Y., closed for the year (they'd been temporarily closed since March), she told me matter-of-factly that she had anxiety, a word I'd never heard her use in relation to herself. She hadn't been sleeping well since March. She'd fall asleep easily, only to wake up an hour later, wide-awake, on edge. We tried everything: the Calm app, sleep programs, meditations, warm milk, reading, yoga, no television, talking about her fears. We blamed it on the leftover ice cream cake from my birthday that she loved eating at nighttime. We blamed it on the fact that for years when one of us was out of town, we'd let her sleep in our bed. Plus, we told ourselves, kids around the world were having a hard time sleeping during the pandemic.\n\nBut she kept waking up, sometimes five times a night, and then none of us were sleeping. When my head hit the pillow, I'd wonder with dread if it would be one of those nights we'd all be up every other hour.\n\nIn the mornings, Louise would be drained and teary, feeling guilty and overwhelmed. She said she was scared at night, and she thought a puppy as a companion would help. Yes, her mom had a full-grown dog, but she explained to us that this puppy would be for the purpose of transitioning between homes.\n\nTwo daughters of divorce\n\nLouise and I connect on the fact that we are both daughters of divorce. Her dad's parents are still together, so it's a perspective and way of life she and I share that he doesn't relate to. \"Fourteen must have been really hard for your parents to divorce,\" she'll often say, tinged with more compassion than I've ever been met with from family or friends on the subject.\n\nWhen the topic of blended families comes up, she'll say, almost proudly, \"I've been going back and forth between homes since I was two.\" But she'll also quote a line from the best-selling \"Blended\" by Sharon M. Draper, a book we both read and loved, about an 11-year-old biracial girl alternating weeks (and chapters) at her mom's and her dad's.\n\n\"You know the part where she says, 'I never say I'm going home, it's either 'mom's house' or 'dad's house?'\" Louise said to me. \"It feels like that sometimes.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-03T09:47:02.666Z As the C.D.C. prepares for two vaccines, here are some answers to a few of the most common questions. As outbreaks disrupt life on campus, colleges take a zero-tolerance stand against parties. New outbreaks test South Korea's strategy. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nWhen I watch Louise shuffle back and forth between two worlds, it helps me become more in touch with my own foggy memories of doing the same thing as a kid. In my late 20s I learned the term \"Sleeper Effect\" coined by psychologist and researcher Judith Wallerstein. The Sleeper Effect is a phenomenon wherein a kid who appears to have coped well with their parents' divorce later shows unexpected behavior and difficulties stemming from the divorce. I'd wholeheartedly experienced this, but hadn't had a name for it. No matter how \"amicable\" a divorce is, packing a bag and moving between bedrooms every few days would give anyone some anxiety. I felt for her.\n\nStill, my husband and I had a big \"no\" to a new puppy, while her mom had a big \"yes.\" My husband and I thought we were doing her a favor by showing her a boundary -- we thought she'd thank us later. We didn't want the responsibility with our already chaotic freelance schedules. My husband is a musician who traveled and toured regularly, pre-pandemic, and we didn't know how long we'd be quarantining. Co-parenting during a nonpandemic has enough challenges -- how would adding a dog to the mix of social distancing, working from home and conflicting perspectives on mask-wearing possibly help?\n\nI figured I could outtalk Louise. For years she has listened to and respected me. We'd never had a conflict and, aside from getting an ice cream, I'd never had to tell her \"no.\" But whenever we had conversations about a puppy, they turned teary and she'd push back. She made a list of pros and cons.\n\nOne of the frustrations in a co-parenting relationship is that you simply can't control (nor will you ever know) exactly what is going on in the other household; you can only make the rules for your own household. So, with that in mind, we told Louise if she wanted to get a puppy that stayed at her mom's house, we'd support that. But it could never come to ours.\n\nShe told us the purpose of the puppy would be to go back and forth with her.\n\nEnter Bella\n\n\"Think about it from the puppy's perspective,\" I said once, reasoning that the two different environments for the puppy would be overstimulating and confusing.\n\n\"Oh. You like, want it to be happy?\" she asked once, sort of getting it.\n\nLooking back, I realize that the two different environments are possibly overstimulating and confusing for her. So why shouldn't she have more support?\n\nFor Louise's 10th birthday, in June, she and her mom went to pick up Bella, who was 8 weeks old. Bella is part Bichon rise and part miniature Goldendoodle, and she and Louise were instantly in love. For her birthday, Louise asked for gifts for Bella instead. Though I gave her books and a necklace, the present she was most excited about was the salmon dog treats.\n\nOnce Louise had Bella, the issue had become: We had said \"no\" to Bella being at our place, and Louise said she couldn't sleep well without Bella, so now Louise wasn't sleeping over anymore.\n\nMy husband and I stuck to our guns -- for a while. Bella wasn't allowed at our apartment, then that rule evolved to: Bella wasn't allowed at our apartment until Louise trained her for at least a month. The puppy would only stay in Louise's room, with a gate on the door. Louise would be responsible for taking her outside. We'd still take Louise on our joint-custody days but at night bring her back to her mom's.\n\n\"We missed her\"\n\nOur rules got old fast; we'd backed ourselves into a corner. We were driving miles more, spending hours more in the car, because we had to think of outdoor dog-friendly activities, many of which had been off the table during the pandemic -- like camping, and even certain swimming holes we'd come to rely on in summer. My husband began a routine of pre-ordering grilled cheeses from a deli, picking up Bella and Louise, and driving to a hiking trail. There, they'd eat the sandwiches, hike, then he'd drive them back to Louise's mom's house. Some days, I'd join them.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nBut now, without Louise staying over, I wasn't sleeping well. It didn't feel right. We missed her.\n\nIn 2007, a children's book \"Fred Stays With Me\" was released. The book follows a young girl with divorced parents who each tell her, after Fred the dog eats socks and trashes the car, \"Fred can't stay with me!\"\n\n\"Excuse me,\" the girl says, \"but Fred doesn't stay with you. Fred stays with ME!\" Louise loved the book and took to quoting that line from time to time.\n\nAfter three weeks, our rules all seemed silly. Seeing Louise love and care for Bella so passionately was inspiring, and she showed us the responsibility we'd asked of her. We let Bella (and therefore Louise) begin sleeping over.\n\nNow, we walk more -- instead of her past routine of waking at 6 a.m. and watching \"Gilmore Girls\" until 8, Louise laces up her sneakers for a mile-long walk with her dad, where they have long, meandering discussions on politics, the pandemic and Harry Potter. All three of us go to sleep and wake up earlier. She's taken full responsibility for Bella, and I've never seen her happier. She laughs, sings and dances with her. She's empowered.\n\nI recently read parenting advice that told parents to say \"sorry\" to your kids. They'll grow up and remember if you did or didn't, and it will have a profound effect on the relationship you will or won't have with them. I've admitted we were tone deaf to Louise. We'd thought we were listening, but maybe we weren't listening hard enough.\n\n\"You were right about getting a puppy,\" I've said to her a couple times. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\n\"Yes, she is officially the fluffiest and cutest puppy in the whole universe,\" she responds, forgivingly, hugging Bella.\n\nOne day, Louise and I were walking to a protest with 10-week-old Bella. Louise was holding Bella like a baby, and she sheepishly said, \"I think I might have went a little too crazy with the I-need-a-dog-thing,\" apologizing back to me.\n\n\"It's good to ask for what you need, honey,\" I told her. \"You won't always get it, but it's a good skill to have.\"\n\nWhen I tuck Louise into bed now, I often see her holding Bella's paw before drifting off to (a non-wakeful) sleep. During those sleepless nights, she'd listen to \"Bella's Bedtime Sleep Story\" for kids on the Calm app. Now she has her very own Bella.\n\nChloe Caldwell is the author of three books including I'll Tell You in Person and Women.

        "body": "Deprive people of interactions with peers, and their social skills will atrophy. This is yet another side effect of the pandemic.\n\nAs the school year begins amid a global pandemic, many are concerned about the negative impact that virtual or socially distanced learning may have on children's developing social skills.\n\nBut what about grown-ups? It seems adults deprived of consistent and varied peer contact can get just as clumsy at social interactions as inexperienced kids.\n\nResearch on prisoners, hermits, soldiers, astronauts, polar explorers and others who have spent extended periods in isolation indicates social skills are like muscles that atrophy from lack of use. People separated from society -- by circumstance or by choice -- report feeling more socially anxious, impulsive, awkward and intolerant when they return to normal life.\n\nPsychologists and neuroscientists say something similar is happening to all of us now, thanks to the pandemic. We are subtly but inexorably losing our facility and agility in social situations -- whether we are aware of it or not. The signs are everywhere: people oversharing on Zoom, overreacting or misconstruing one another's behavior, longing for but then not really enjoying contact with others.\n\nIt's an odd social malaise that can easily become entrenched if we don't recognize why it's happening and take steps to minimize its effects.\n\n\"The first thing to understand is that there are biological reasons for this,\" said Stephanie Cacioppo, the director of the Brain Dynamics Laboratory at the University of Chicago. \"It's not a pathology or mental disorder.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-01T08:25:36.896Z As U.S. cases decline elsewhere, the Midwest sees a worrying spike. The virus is spreading much faster in Spain than anywhere else in Europe. Health care workers with Covid-19 may be going undiagnosed, according to a C.D.C. report. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nEven the most introverted among us, she said, are wired to crave company. It's an evolutionary imperative because there's historically been safety in numbers. Loners had a tough time slaying woolly mammoths and fending off enemy attacks.\n\nSo when we are cut off from others, our brains interpret it as a mortal threat. Feeling lonely or isolated is as much a biological signal as hunger or thirst. And just like not eating when you're starved or not drinking when you're dehydrated, failing to interact with others when you are lonely leads to negative cognitive, emotional and physiological effects, which Dr. Cacioppo said many of us are likely experiencing now.\n\nEven if you are ensconced in a pandemic pod with a romantic partner or family members, you can still feel lonely -- often camouflaged as sadness, irritability, anger and lethargy -- because you're not getting the full range of human interactions that you need, almost like not eating a balanced diet. We underestimate how much we benefit from casual camaraderie at the office, gym, choir practice or art class, not to mention spontaneous exchanges with strangers.\n\nMany of us have not met anyone new in months.\n\n\"This daily interacting with individuals out in the world gives you a sense of belonging and security that comes from feeling you are part of, or have access to, a wider community and network,\" said Stefan Hofmann, a professor of psychology at Boston University. \"Social isolation slashes that network.\"\n\nThe privation sends our brains into survival mode, which dampens our ability to recognize and appropriately respond to the subtleties and complexities inherent in social situations. Instead, we become hypervigilant and oversensitive. Layer on top of that a seemingly capricious virus and we're all tightly coiled for fight or flight.\n\nYou get a sidelong glance and immediately think the other person dislikes you. A confusing comment is interpreted as an insult. At the same time you feel more self-conscious, fearing any missteps will put you further at risk. As a result, social situations, even a friendly phone call, become something to avoid. People start to withdraw, rationalizing they are too tired, didn't like the person much to begin with or there's something they'd rather watch on Netflix.\n\nIt's a phenomenon that the British physician Beth Healey knows all too well. She spent a year at a remote outpost in Antarctica as part of a team doing research for the European Space Agency.\n\n\"We had quite a lot of training before we went about how returning home can be difficult,\" she said. \"You kind of laugh it off, thinking it won't happen to you.\"\n\nBut sure enough, when Dr. Healey re-entered civilization in early 2016, she said she felt uneasy. \"One of my good friends met me in New Zealand and I could feel myself hiding behind her a little bit when checking in at the hotel,\" she said. \"Normally I'd have been happy to take the lead but I was hoping they would speak to her.\"\n\nFor months, she was nervous getting on a bus and overwhelmed going to the supermarket. \"It was really strange and feels similar to what we're seeing now after the isolation\" because of the coronavirus, she said. \"But, in a way, it was easier coming out of Antarctica into the world because nobody else felt the same way and now everyone is being a bit weird.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure.

These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nSome of her fellow crew members had such a hard time readjusting that they immediately signed up to go back to Antarctica. The same thing often happens to soldiers returning from long deployments and also prisoners released after years in solitary confinement. Even if they come home to supportive families, within days or weeks, they want to go back.\n\n\"I don't want to make an equivalence between prisoners in solitary confinement and what all of us are going through now but there are definite similarities,\" said Craig Haney, a psychology professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies the effects of isolation on inmates. \"People feeling uncomfortable with other people is part of what happens when denied the normal social contact that we so much depend on.\"\n\nIn every interaction you have to make countless intuitive judgments -- interpreting words, gestures and expressions and reacting appropriately. You've also got to get the timing and pacing right, as well as titrate how much to share and with whom. Social interplay is one of the most complicated things we ask our brains to do. In normal circumstances, we get a lot of practice, so it becomes somewhat seamless. You don't think about it. But when you have fewer opportunities to practice, you get off your game. The surreal and clunky quality of virtual or masked interactions just makes matters worse.\n\nIsolation experts say it's a slippery slope and advise taking steps to keep your social skills as nimble as possible during this unsocial time. Dr. Haney said inmates who rebound after solitary confinement are the ones who realized their isolation was a serious threat to their sense of self and security and took every opportunity to reach out to other people.\n\n\"The guys who survive best are the ones who write letters and maintain visitation and who maintain communication with other people, even if it's just through the walls of a cell block,\" he said. \"It's the ones who withdraw deeply in and eschew contact with others who do the worst.\"\n\nThat's why it's important to block out time every day to connect with others, whether through a socially distanced chat, telephone call or, at the very least, a thoughtful text.\n\nAnd as we all gradually re-emerge from our confinement and widen our social circles, don't expect anyone or anything to be the same. Dr. Healey said the crew members from her polar expedition who had the greatest difficulty reintegrating were the ones who expected to resume jobs and relationships exactly where they left off. People inevitably change over time and certainly after something significant, like a pandemic, upends their lives and shakes their confidence in what they thought they knew. Values shift. Personalities alter. None of us are the same.\n\nSo give yourself and everyone else a break. Have patience for your own and other people's weirdness.\n\nKate Murphy, a frequent contributor to The New York Times, is the author of \"You're Not Listening: What You're Missing and Why It Matters.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "Despite precautions, the coronavirus has swept through a number of weddings, large and small, infecting guests and vendors.\n\nJo Ellen Chism, 57, a retiree who lives in The Woodlands, Texas, about an hour outside Houston, was nervous about attending her stepson's wedding on June 20.\n\n\"They were going to postpone it, but then the Catholic church decided they would open and would have up to 75 people,\" she said. \"75 people seemed like a pretty big gathering to me during this Covid time.\"\n\nShe went to support her family. She was inside the church for an hourlong service that included a processional and communion. At the reception, at Haak Winery, she sat indoors at a round table with other guests, some of whom were from out of town. While everyone started the day in masks, they took them off for photos and never replaced them.\n\nHer symptoms started four days later. With a runny nose, sore throat and bad headache, it could have been a sinus infection. Two days later she tested positive for Covid-19 along with 12 other guests, including her 10-year-old grandson and the groom's 76-year-old grandfather. He is still recovering after a trip to the emergency room with double pneumonia. She said 13 additional guests had symptoms but didn't get tested.\n\nMs. Chism's oldest son kept track of all the sick guests through the seating chart, on which he marked who was positive, negative and untested. Still, like most super-spreader events, without sophisticated contact tracing, it's impossible to identify patient zero.\n\n\"I could just kick myself because I probably shouldn't have gone to that wedding,\" she said. \"I am really thankful I was not terribly ill.\" (She missed the birth of two grandchildren because of her need to isolate.)\n\nVendors Helpless at Controlling Guests' Behavior\n\nAfter a brief pause, wedding season is back in full swing across the country. Couples are working within the confines of state laws to carry out their nuptials during the pandemic. But despite precautions coronavirus has swept into many of these events, both large and small, infecting guests and vendors.\n\nThe situation is so dire, some wedding planners are self-quarantining after events and even subcontracting their duties at the reception, the part of the weddings where people mingle more closely. Some brides and grooms are having guests sign liability forms upon arrival. Others say they are losing sleep for two weeks after their wedding, wondering what unintentional harm they might have caused to people they love.\n\nIn June, a wedding planner in Arkansas who wished to remain anonymous to protect her business predicted weddings would become the next super-spreader events.\n\n\"Weddings are so different from going into a store or sitting in a restaurant for 45 minutes,\" she said. \"These receptions last for three, four hours, and everyone is in an indoor space, breathing the air. They aren't wearing masks and they are dancing. And when they start drinking, it's like there is no pandemic.\"\n\nSix months ago her anxieties were about the weather or tight schedules. Now they are much heavier. \"I am scared there is going to be an outbreak at one of my weddings and someone is going to die.\"\n\nThe problem, she said, is that she, along with other vendors, are helpless at controlling guests' behavior at a private party. \"All the vendors are masked up, and I am cracking the whip on the vendors, but I can't do anything with the guests,\" she said.\n\nThat vendor, despite her nervousness, pointed out that she is contractually obligated to carry out terms of the contract signed with the couple.\n\nSarah Betts, a wedding planner in Houston, said even if vendors had power to reign in rowdy guests, the bride and groom could just move their event to a less strict venue. \"Some venues make the bride wear masks, while others say those walking down the aisle are exempt,\" she said. \"It's a little lawless down here.\"\n\nWithout universal standards she is at the mercy of her clients, many of whom want their festivities indoors, without masks, with out-of-town friends and with dancing. \"I have a grandmother who is 90 who I am around a lot,\" she said. \"I haven't had my first wedding yet this summer, but when I do, I am going to self-quarantine after.\"\n\nRules and Regulations Vary by State\n\nState laws vary when it comes to weddings. Some wedding spaces are governed by the same rules as restaurants, meaning they can accommodate a certain percentage of their overall capacity. In Arkansas, for example, you can fill venues to 66 percent capacity. So an event in a 1,000-person ballroom can legally host 666 guests. In other states events are limited to the size of the group. In parts of New York, for example, gatherings are limited to 50 people regardless of the space.\n\nMs. Betts said many of her clients feel safer with smaller affairs. \"I have clients doing private, intimate ceremonies, because no one is making a big stink about those,\" she said. \"No one wants to be the new epicenter of the outbreak.\"\n\nBut even weddings with the tightest guest list aren't immune to the coronavirus.\n\nSunshine Borrer, 26, a veterinary technician in Houston, attended her sister-in-law's wedding in Crockett, Texas, which has a population of 6,000. \"It was a real small town,\" she said. \"Covid wasn't something I was super concerned about.\" The 30-person wedding was held outdoors, but the after party was in a small bar area of an indoor restaurant.\n\nIt took about a week for her symptoms to develop. She tested positive for Covid-19, along with the bride and groom, another couple, and the bride's daughter. Fortunately all cases were mild.\n\nShe noticed there is no etiquette for how to communicate a coronavirus outbreak to wedding guests. \"The bride and groom maybe told the people they were living with, but that was it,\" she said. \"They told one of my other sisters-in-law, and she is a nurse, so she took it upon herself to tell people.\"\n\nMs. Chism said it was her oldest son, not the bride and groom, who alerted wedding guests to the virus exposure. \"If it were me I would have been on the phone calling every single person,\" she said. \"But it wasn't me.\"\n\nPre-wedding events are risky as well. In July, Kathleen Oglesby, 66, hosted a tea-party bridal shower at her home in Aubrey, Texas, for her daughter-in-law. The 10 guests wore big, Kentucky Derby-style hats and ate mini Bundt cakes. Days after the event the entire guest list went into a two-week quarantine after a guest tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"She was a friend of my daughter-in-law's, and she helped me so much with the bridal shower that I went to her house and brought her a wreath as a thank you,\" she said. \"I'm so lucky I didn't get it, because I probably wouldn't make it.\" Ms. Oglesby has an underlying heart condition.\n\n\"It was really scary,\" she added. \"My mind was running wild.\"\n\nSome Are Concerned About Risks\n\nSome couples are acutely aware of the fact that their wedding could turn into a super-spreader event.\n\nKate, 31, a social worker for the state of New York, married her husband, a 30-year-old engineer, in a boutique hotel in central New York during the July 4 weekend. She didn't want to give her full name, because \"there's a lot of judgment for people who went through with weddings, even with precautions.\"\n\nThe event had less than 50 attendees, including vendors. Masks were on the entire time even outside and in photographs. There was no dancing -- not even a first dance for the bride and groom. \"We didn't want to leave room for interpretation,\" she said.\n\nStill, she spent her wedding night in the honeymoon suite of the boutique hotel worrying. \"I was hit with the thought, 'What did we just do? What if everyone gets sick?'\" she said. \"I didn't sleep more than 10 minutes that whole night.\"\n\nShe checked in with guests regularly, making sure no one had symptoms. Only on Day 14 could she begin thinking about her wedding with joy. \"My husband and I needed those two weeks to pass so the memories weren't tainted by anything terrible,\" she said. \"It was a long two weeks.\"\n\nSome couples are turning to waivers to protect themselves from liability in case of an outbreak.\n\nThe wedding planner in Arkansas said she uses her clients' fears about liability to drive them toward more protective measures. \"I tell them, 'Listen, we don't know where liability is going to fall, and you are the host of this event,'\" she said. \"You want to say at the end of the day you did everything you could possible to keep your guests safe.\"\n\nMs. Betts said, \"I tell my clients, 'If you really feel you have to push this form, why are we having this wedding in the first place?'\"\n\nThen there are the newlyweds who feel little responsibility for wedding guests getting infected.\n\nMs. Chism's stepson, a 27-year-old engineer in Houston who didn't want to be named because of the topic's sensitivity, believes his guests exercised free will when attending his wedding.\n\n\"My wife felt bad and said, 'I feel like it's all our fault,'\" he recalled. \"I said, 'Look, they took a chance on coming, they knew the risk. People could have come or they didn't have to come.'\"\n\nWhen asked whether he would make the same decision again, his answer was absolutely: \"The day was very memorable, it felt like a normal wedding. Minus the part about people getting sick.\"",

        "body": "BERLIN -- When she returned to Germany last week from a vacation in Serbia, one of the first things Snjezana Kirstein did was to stop at a pop-up coronavirus testing center at Berlin's Tegel Aiport.\n\nWhereas such tests can be hard to find in the United States, with unpredictable costs and results two weeks in coming, Ms. Kirstein was on her way in a matter of minutes after having her nose and throat swabbed. She expected an answer in 24 to 48 hours. The test was not only swift, it was free.\n\n\"I think it is super,\" Ms. Kirstein said. \"It was so easy to find, and best of all, it didn't cost me a thing.\"\n\nThis week, Germany began requiring that same simple test for all citizens or residents, like Ms. Kirstein, and other travelers who enter the country from coronavirus \"hot spots,\" again making it a leader in using testing as a firewall against the spread of the virus.\n\nAs Europe reopens, cases have begun ticking up nearly everywhere, to a greater or lesser extent, leaving countries in a constant, seesaw battle to tamp down outbreaks before they undo months of hard-won progress made during costly lockdowns this spring.\n\nGermany is no exception. This week it recorded 879 new coronavirus infections in a single day, part of a rising trend that has begun to worry officials as people return from trips abroad during the summer vacation season.\n\nOne of the biggest concerns in Germany and across the continent is that travelers will carry the virus with them. Until now, Germany, like other countries, has relied on quarantining newly arriving travelers. But such measures are not always enforced, or strictly followed.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, Germany has made testing a primary tool in its battle against the virus. Now it is turning to that approach again to head off a potential second wave of infections. Its capacity to make testing efficient, affordable and available has distinguished it among industrialized nations.\n\nUnlike the United States or Britain, both of which allowed their public health agencies to keep tight control over standards for tests and discouraged private clinics, labs or companies from developing their own, Germany disseminated a blueprint for a test as soon as it had one.\n\nIn January, doctors at the Charit\u00e9 research hospital in Berlin developed one of the world's first diagnostic tests for the new coronavirus. They quickly made it available to the country's public hospitals and research laboratories, as well as a nationwide network of about 200 privately owned labs. Everyone focused on making test kits.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-05T13:43:20.568Z America is testing more. But the results are too slow, a survey finds. Democrats and Republicans have agreed to work toward a deal on a relief package by the end of the week. The number of virus-related deaths worldwide has passed 700,000. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe World Health Organization later approved the kits and distributed instructions for developing them worldwide. At that time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were still struggling to develop test kits in the United States.\n\nWhile nearly 90 percent of Germany's population of 83 million is covered by public insurance, people can also opt for private insurance that either competes with the public system, or provides top-up coverage.\n\nBy May, the German authorities required all insurance companies to cover the cost of testing. Initially it was limited to those with symptoms, but today it is available to just about everyone, with the government agreeing to help cover the costs.\n\n\"We have had a very important principle since the beginning of the pandemic -- that testing in Germany is not a question of money,\" said Jens Spahn, Germany's health minister. \"That is a big difference to many other countries that have failed to test enough over many months.\"\n\nEarly on, the government also ordered hospitals and labs to reduce all but necessary treatments to free resources to process coronavirus tests, earmarking millions to support the effort and ensuring speedy results.\n\nThese measures allowed Germany to ramp up testing at a pace that prevented the country's hospitals -- well equipped in any case, with one of the world's highest ratios of intensive care beds per capita and a centralized system to transfer patients between them -- from becoming overwhelmed.\n\nBy March, Germany was one of the highest testers per capita in the world. Other countries have since overtaken it, in part because Germany has been so effective in targeting tests and following up on positive results to isolate those infected and shut down chains of infection before they get out of control.\n\nSo while Germany can carry out as many as 1.2 million tests per week, according the health ministry, it is only currently testing half that many people. That gives it the bandwidth to easily expand testing to incoming travelers, while still maintaining readiness should a big second wave arrive.\n\nThe United States has a capacity of 4.5 million tests per week, according to the Rockefeller Foundation, but its population is also roughly four times the size of Germany's, and results can take five to 14 days.\n\nThe United States also lacks comprehensive contract-tracing, another factor that has left it struggling to contain the spread of the virus. Germany has had fewer than 10,000 deaths attributed to the virus, the United States more than 150,000.\n\nThose awaiting test results in Germany are required to self-quarantine, and are released from the obligation immediately if the result is negative. They must also leave contact information in case they have a positive result and need to be traced.\n\nThe speed of the results, then, is critical to the containment effort. People are more likely to abide isolation for two days than for two weeks, and even if they don't they still have less time to wander around and potentially expose others. Germany's shorter turnaround also reduces the time that healthy people are taken out of productive roles in society.\n\nThose who refuse a test must remain in quarantine for two weeks, unless they can provide a negative test less than 72 hours old. Under current E.U. travel restrictions, foreigners from outside the bloc are allowed to enter the country only if they have the right to live and work in Germany, with few exceptions.\n\nGermany's wide availability of testing has not made everyone happy, however, and not all agree on the benefits.\n\nSome experts warn that it could overwhelm laboratories and threaten the country's readiness to deal with a resurgence of the virus when colder temperatures push people back indoors.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 4, 2020\n\nI have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\n\"It is questionable whether the general testing of travel returnees offers an appropriate balance between benefit and expense,\" said Dr. Michael M\u00fcller, head of the Association of Medical Labs, which represents more than 200 labs across the country.\n\nOthers have questioned whether it is fair to saddle taxpayers with the burden of paying for the tests for those who willingly risk traveling outside Europe, despite warnings by government health authorities.\n\nThe requirement for travelers includes those coming from 130 countries and regions, including the United States and three districts in Spain, which the German authorities consider high-risk for spread of the virus.\n\nBut Mr. Spahn rejected the idea that only the wealthy were traveling, citing people with families in Turkey or elsewhere in Europe whom they visited.\n\n\"I know the saying, 'Whoever can afford a ski trip can pay for their broken leg,' but when you think that idea through, then especially in a pandemic, it compromises solidarity in society,\" Mr. Spahn said. \"So testing will remain cost-free.\"\n\nWhile Germans are normally quick to decry any encroachment on their personal privacy, the threat of the virus returning appears to frighten them more, and there has been little pushback to the proposed requirement for travelers.\n\nOn the second day after a testing station was set up at Tegel Airport, dozens of people pushing luggage trolleys stacked with suitcases or young children in strollers waited patiently for their turn to submit a voluntary test.\n\n\"It is an unbelievable hassle to set it up and organize it, but if it gives passengers back a sense of security when traveling, then it is worth it,\" said Hannes Stefan H\u00f6nemann, spokesman for the airport's operator.\n\nThe requirement for travelers include those coming over land as well if they have visited a hot zone. Health authorities in the southern state of Bavaria, the gateway for people returning by car from vacations on the Mediterranean coasts, set up test centers at three highway rest stops near the border, as well as at airports and major train stations.\n\nOver the weekend, before the requirement went into effect this week, about 18,000 people were tested voluntarily, they said.\n\nBavaria made free testing available to all residents on July 1. The government invested 200 million euros, about $235 million, to expand laboratory capacity, both public and private, as well as personnel and working hours. Today it has the capacity for about 27,000 tests a day, state health minister, Melanie Huml, said.\n\n\"Test, test, test is the name of the game in Bavaria,\" she said. \"Our goal is to recognize infections as quickly as possible to stop chains of infection as early as early as possible.\"\n\nShe estimates they can test as many as 2,000 travelers each day, the same capacity as expected in Berlin's airports. Those who test positive will be alerted immediately, as will the public local health office, so it can follow up on care and contact tracing.\n\n\"Corona is not over and does not forgive any lack of vigilance,\" Ms. Huml said. \"We have to be careful to prevent a second wave from creeping up on us.\"",

        "body": "Daniel Prude died in Rochester after officers covered his head with a hood. The devices are widely used, but the N.Y.P.D. does not give them to patrol officers.\n\nShortly before Daniel Prude lost consciousness while the Rochester police held him down, one of the officers had pulled a white hood from his pocket and slipped it over Mr. Prude's head.\n\nThe mesh hood is a common device that the police and correction officers use, known as a \"spit hood\" or \"spit sock.\" It was intended to keep Mr. Prude, who had been spitting on the ground, from exposing them to disease.\n\nEarlier that night, Mr. Prude, who had a history of mental illness, had run out of his brother's home naked and was behaving erratically, telling at least one person that he had the coronavirus, according to police reports.\n\nThe officers went on to hold Mr. Prude down on the pavement for two minutes, his head still wrapped in the sack, as he lost consciousness and his pulse stopped. Paramedics restarted his heart, but he died a week later in a hospital. An autopsy found the cause of death was \"complications of asphyxia in the setting of physical restraint.\"\n\nMr. Prude's death, along with the jarring body camera footage of him being subdued, has brought new scrutiny to the longstanding use of spit hoods and similar devices by law enforcement.\n\nWhat is a spit hood?\n\nA spit hood, or spit guard, is a loose, breathable fabric sack that can be placed over a person's head to prevent them from biting or spitting.\n\nThere are many designs, but the hoods usually are made of a porous, breathable fabric, often a mesh that allows officers to see the suspect's face. Many hoods have an elastic band designed to stay loosely secured around a person's neck.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-03T22:23:49.286Z President Trump's vaccine chief sees a 'very, very low chance' of a vaccine by Election Day. Hydroxychloroquine prescriptions soar on President Trump's say-so. The virus is surging at U.S. colleges, where more than 51,000 cases have been identified so far. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe devices are intended to keep an emotionally disturbed person from biting or spitting on an officer, not just to prevent the spread of diseases but also to avoid other injuries.\n\n\"People quite frankly underestimate the level of danger that officers can face from individuals that are using their mouths and their teeth,\" said Maria Haberfield, a professor of policing science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, in New York City.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic -- and the risk that officers could be infected by a suspect's saliva -- have drawn attention to the use of spit hoods, though it is difficult to track whether use of the devices has increased in the last six months.\n\nWho uses them and why?\n\nThe use of spit hoods or spit shields is widespread among medics, prison guards and the police, throughout the United States and internationally.\n\nAuthorities in many European countries use the device to shield themselves from infectious diseases, and many American police departments also employ them as a restraining device.\n\nScotland Yard announced last year that it would supply all officers with spit hoods; the Garda, Ireland's national police force, began deploying the device more widely early this year. Most police departments in the United States have them on hand.\n\nPolicies on spit masks vary among major police departments; some will not allow the devices to be used on children, or on a person who has been pepper-sprayed.\n\nChris Petzer, the owner of Handcuff Warehouse, a Virginia-based law enforcement equipment company that supplies spit hoods, said the emergence of the coronavirus has only heightened the growing demand for the devices.\n\nSpit hoods are more often used by corrections officers, in prisons and jails, Mr. Petzer said, and many police departments do not issue them to patrol officers.\n\nThe New York Police Department is one of the departments that does not give spit guards to patrol officers, a spokesman, Al Baker, said.\n\nBecause of the coronavirus epidemic, however, the department has begun issuing them to emergency services officers, who are also trained as medics, on a trial basis, Mr. Baker said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Are spit hoods dangerous?\n\nA medical study published in 2019 found the use of a spit hood produced \"no clinically significant changes\" in a person's ability to breathe, provided he or she was healthy.\n\n\"Most of the time, they are safe unless a person has an underlying condition,\" Ms. Haberfield said.\n\nBut a spit hood is often used in combination with other restraints, as it was in Mr. Prude's case. After putting the hood on his head, three officers held Mr. Prude down, one pressing his head to the pavement, one placing a knee on his back and a third holding down his legs.\n\nNeil Gehlawat, a California lawyer who has sued on behalf of several people who died after being restrained in a spit hood, said the devices can lead to physiological stress, like trouble breathing or an increased heart rate.\n\n\"You'll have the person who is being restrained, usually in a prone position so they're facedown, there's already pressure on the diaphragm,\" he said. \"And then a spit mask is being put on top of that person, that further restricts their ability to breathe.\"\n\nHe added: \"They're really restricting airflow, and they can often lead to people asphyxiating and dying.\"\n\nHave the devices played a role in other deaths?\n\nSpit hoods have been involved in at least 10 deaths in police custody since 2001, though it is difficult to determine how much the spit hood contributed to those deaths.\n\nIn April, Carlos Ingram Lopez, a 27-year-old cooking school graduate, died in Tucson, Ariz., after police held him down and covered his face with a blanket and a hood. Like Mr. Prude, Mr. Lopez was in the middle of a mental health breakdown.\n\nJacob Bauer died in Pleasanton, Calif., in August 2018 after police restrained him with batons and tasers and applied a spit mask to his face. Prosecutors later cleared the officers involved in Mr. Bauer's death of criminal wrongdoing.\n\nEven in cases where someone has not died, the use of spit hoods has stirred controversy and prompted lawsuits.\n\nPolice officers in Sacramento, for instance, placed a hood on the head of a 12-year-old boy, who officers said was spitting at them, in April 2019. A video of the incident went viral online, and the boy's family sued the Sacramento police department for $100,000, claiming the boy had been traumatized.\n\nSusan Beachy contributed research.",

        "body": "Melbourne, Australia's second-largest city, is becoming a case study in handling a second wave of infections. There are lots of unanswered questions.\n\nAustralia's second-largest city, Melbourne, grappling with a spiraling coronavirus outbreak in a country that once thought it had the pandemic beat, has now imposed some of the toughest restrictions in the world.\n\nBut as officials cast about for ways to break the chain of infections, the city has become a confounding matrix of hefty fines for disobedience, minor exceptions for everything from romantic partners to home building, and endless versions of the question: So, wait, can I ____?\n\nRestaurant owners are wondering about food delivery after an 8 p.m. curfew began on Sunday night. Teenagers are asking if their boyfriends and girlfriends count as essential partners. Can animal shelter volunteers walk dogs at night? Are house cleaners essential for those struggling with their mental health? Can the Covid-tested exercise outside?\n\n\"This is such a weird, scary, bizarro time that we live in,\" said Tessethia Von Tessle Roberts, 25, a student in Melbourne who admits to having hit a breaking point a few days ago, when her washing machine broke.\n\n\"Our health care workers are hustling around the clock to keep us alive,\" she said.\"Our politicians are as scared as we are, but they have to pretend like they have a better idea than we do of what's going to happen next.\"\n\nPandemic lockdowns, never easy, are getting ever more confusing and contentious as they evolve in the face of second and third rounds of outbreaks that have exhausted both officials and residents. With success against the virus as fleeting as the breeze, the new waves of restrictions feel to many like a bombing raid that just won't end.\n\nFor some places, risk calculations can change overnight. In Hong Kong, officials banned daytime dining in restaurants last month, only to reverse themselves a day later after an outcry. Schools in some cities are opening and closing like screen doors in summer.\n\nBut in many areas where the virus has retreated and then resurged, the future looks like a long, complicated haul. Leaders are reaching for their own metaphors to try to explain it.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom has compared his opening and shutting of businesses to a \"dimmer switch.\" Dan Andrews, the premier in Victoria, where Melbourne is the capital, has repeatedly referred to \"pilot light mode\" for industries like construction and meatpacking, which have been ordered to temporarily reduce their work forces.\n\nWhatever the metaphor, it's dark. Melbourne, a city of five million that is considered a capital of food and culture, is becoming a prime example.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-04T10:03:05.885Z 'Long days, long nights': Washington prepares for a prolonged fight over virus relief.

See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nIt, and the rest of Australia, was once a shining victor, believing the virus to have been licked as of late June. Then Melbourne's hotel quarantine program broke down, with returning travelers passing the virus to security guards, who carried the contagion into their neighborhoods.\n\nThe spread continued even after Melbourne started a so-called Stage 3 lockdown in early July -- until recently, the highest level of restrictions -- with no large gatherings and most people working from home. Officials grew increasingly angry as they discovered that the perception of a problem solved had produced complacency.\n\nTraffic data showed people in Melbourne driving more in July than they had during the first Stage 3 lockdown, in March and April. Even worse, almost nine out of 10 people with Covid-19 had not been tested or isolated when they first felt sick, Mr. Andrews, the state's top leader, said in late July. And 53 percent had not quarantined while waiting for their test results.\n\n\"That means people have felt unwell and just gone about their business,\" Mr. Andrews said.\n\nHe made face masks mandatory the next day, on July 22.\n\nStill, infections have continued to rise. They peaked at 753 new cases on July 30 and have hovered around 500 a day ever since, with the death toll in Victoria now standing at 147, after 11 deaths were recorded on Monday.\n\nThose figures have paved the way for a Stage 4 lockdown -- what officials are calling a \"shock and awe\" attack on the virus -- that will last at least six weeks.\n\nOverwhelming force, with precision, seems to be the goal. The chief modelers of the pandemic response in Australia have found that the virus can be suppressed only if more than 70 percent of the population abides by social distancing guidelines and other public health rules.\n\nMr. Andrews said the new restrictions would take 250,000 more people out of their routines, in the hopes of reaching the necessary threshold.\n\nSo retail stores will be closed. Schools will return to at-home instruction. Restaurants will be takeaway or delivery only. Child-care centers will be available only for permitted workers.\n\nThose are the restrictions that are already well understood. The rules requiring more explanation are tied to the curfew and industries that have to cut back.\n\nLarge-scale construction projects of more than three stories, for example, will have to reduce their on-site work force by 75 percent, and workers will not be able to work at more than one location. Small-scale construction cannot have more than five workers.\n\nAll of which sounds clear. But does bathroom renovation, for example, amount to home building in an apartment with one bathroom? And what about fixing things that break, like Ms. Von Tessle Roberts's washing machine?\n\nSome businesses, such as cleaning services, are already emailing customers to say they think they can do some work, for people who pay through welfare or who need help for mental health reasons. But, like many others, they are still seeking official clarification.\n\nMr. Andrews, a Labor politician sometimes described as awkward and paternal, has become the dad everyone needs answers from. He now oversees what may be the country's most intrusive bureaucracy since Australia was settled by English prison wardens and convicts.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 3, 2020\n\nI'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.Should I refinance my mortgage?It could be a good idea, because mortgage rates have never been lower. Refinancing requests have pushed mortgage applications to some of the highest levels since 2008, so be prepared to get in line. But defaults are also up, so if you're thinking about buying a home, be aware that some lenders have tightened their standards.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.Is the coronavirus airborne?The coronavirus can stay aloft for hours in tiny droplets in stagnant air, infecting people as they inhale, mounting scientific evidence suggests. This risk is highest in crowded indoor spaces with poor ventilation, and may help explain super-spreading events reported in meatpacking plants, churches and restaurants. It's unclear how often the virus is spread via these tiny droplets, or aerosols, compared with larger droplets that are expelled when a sick person coughs or sneezes, or transmitted through contact with contaminated surfaces, said Linsey Marr, an aerosol expert at Virginia Tech. Aerosols are released even when a person without symptoms exhales, talks or sings, according to Dr. Marr and more than 200 other experts, who have outlined the evidence in an open letter to the World Health Organization.\n\nOn Tuesday, he answered questions from reporters about dog-walking (allowed after curfew, sort of, only near home) and other subjects of great confusion at a news conference in Melbourne.\n\nThanking those who complied with the new rules and scolding those who did not, he announced that no one in self-isolation would now be allowed to exercise outdoors. A door-knocking campaign to check in on 3,000 people who had Covid-19 or were waiting for test results found that 800 of them were not at home.\n\nAll 800 have been referred to the Victoria police for investigation. The fine for violators, he said, will be 4,957 Australian dollars ($3,532).\n\nWorking, even legally, will also become trickier. Other than, say, hospital workers with formal identification, everyone traveling for a job deemed essential during the lockdown must carry a formal document -- a work permit signed by the employer and employee.\n\nFor Cara Devine, who works at a wine store that closes at 8 p.m., that means carrying a government form with her everywhere, and hoping that the police recognize her task as essential when she heads home after the curfew. But she also worried about the Uber drivers who take her back and forth.\n\n\"Even before the newest restrictions, I've had two Uber drivers being really late picking up from the shop because they got stopped by the police, taking about an hour out of their work time,\" she said.\n\nThe police are already confronting opposition. On at least four occasions in the last week, they reported having to smash the windows of cars and pull people out after they refused to provide a name and address at a police checkpoint. The Victoria police commissioner, Shane Patton, said a 38-year-old woman had also been charged with assault after attacking a police officer who had stopped her for not wearing a face mask.\n\nSome criminologists are questioning whether the harsher enforcement will help. Mostly, though, Melburnians are just trying to endure.\n\nWalking to get groceries, Peter Barnes, 56, said he welcomed the stricter rules, though he admitted his city was starting to feel like George Orwell's \"1984,\" with the heavy hand of the state around every corner.\n\nThose focused solely on the economics, he said, should remember the obvious: \"You can't hire a corpse. Very bad employment prospects for people who are dead.\"\n\nBy Monday night, the city seemed to be in listening mode. The streets were emptying out, silent in hibernation.\n\n\"It's like a Sunday in the 1950s,\" said Mark Rubbo, the owner of Readings, Melbourne's largest independent bookstore. He also noted that people were stocking up again on books through online orders, with a memoir called \"The Happiest Man on Earth,\" about a Holocaust survivor, becoming a runaway hit.\n\nMs. Von Tessle Roberts has found another solution, perhaps just as likely to grow in popularity: Stand on your front porch and scream. That's the name she has given to an event she posted on Facebook, set for Friday at 7 p.m. By Tuesday afternoon, 70,000 people had expressed an interest in joining her collective shout in anguish.\n\n\"Yelling is great,\" she said. \"It's less dehydrating than crying.\"\n\nBesha Rodell and Yan Zhuang contributed reporting from Melbourne, and Livia Albeck-Ripka from Cairns, Australia.",

        "body": "Want to get The Morning by email? Here's the sign-up.\n\nGood morning. Steve Bannon was arrested on fraud charges. The postmaster general is set to testify today. And on the final night of the D.N.C., Joe Biden formally accepted his party's nomination for president.\n\nLast night, the Democratic National Convention capped off four days of remote speeches, video montages and roll-call votes with a final address from the party's presidential nominee, Joe Biden.\n\n\"America's history tells us that it has been in our darkest moments that we've made our greatest progress,\" Biden said, in a speech that mixed a somber assessment of the state of the country with hopeful appeals to its values. \"And in this dark moment, I believe we are poised to make great progress again.\"\n\nWhat did the convention tell us about the Democrats' message for November? Our colleague Lisa Lerer, who writes the On Politics newsletter, suggested four big takeaways.\n\n1. Character and the coronavirus. The convention pitched Biden's Washington experience and story of personal tragedy as a match for a moment of national crisis.\n\n\"Viewers got a very good sense of Biden himself as a family man, someone with a moral compass,\" Lisa told us. And both Biden and his running mate, Senator Kamala Harris of California, sharply criticized President Trump's response to the pandemic.\n\n2. High stakes. \"This convention was waged in existential terms,\" Lisa said. Perhaps the starkest warning came from former President Barack Obama, who cast his successor as a threat to American democracy.\n\n3. A big tent. From disaffected Republicans to progressive Democrats, the convention showcased the breadth of the coalition the party hopes to mobilize. But squabbles over speaking times, generational gaps and divergent ideologies also laid bare the challenges of holding such a wide coalition together.\n\n\"On the first night, for example, voters heard from John Kasich, a Republican, and Senator Bernie Sanders, a democratic socialist,\" Lisa said. \"Those two men likely agree on very little beyond the need to defeat Trump.\"\n\n4. Winning is one thing, governing another. Notable speakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren and former President Bill Clinton touted aspects of Biden's policy agenda, as did Biden himself. But the convention focused more on critiquing Trump's stance on problems like gun violence, climate change and the virus than on detailing Democrats' solutions.\n\nGiven Biden's current lead, Lisa noted, that might be enough. \"But I do think voters like to know what they're getting with a candidate,\" she said. \"What will this person do beyond simply ousting the guy in office right now? I'm not sure this convention answered that question.\"\n\nTrump and the G.O.P. will get a shot at a rejoinder when their own largely virtual convention starts Monday.\n\nFor more on the D.N.C.'s fourth night:\n\n\"After nearly a half-century of public life defined most viscerally by the forced commingling of politics and personal loss, the tint of the moment at last matches Mr. Biden's own story,\" writes The Times's Matt Flegenheimer.\n\nWatch highlights from last night and see a breakdown of speaking times at the convention.\n\nTimes Opinion writers ranked the night's best and worst moments.\n\nFOUR MORE BIG STORIES1. Steve Bannon arrested on fraud charges\n\nSteve Bannon, Trump's former adviser, was charged with defrauding donors to an online fund-raising effort to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Prosecutors said Bannon had siphoned nearly $1 million from the project to pay off personal expenses.\n\nBannon was arrested early Thursday by federal postal inspectors and special agents from the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, who found him off the coast of Connecticut, on a 150-foot yacht owned by a fugitive Chinese billionaire.\n\nBackground: The fund-raising project, called We Build the Wall, brought in more than $25 million. But it failed to accomplish much with the money, and Trump eventually disavowed it. Three others were also arrested.\n\n2. A warning from a former postal official\n\nDavid C. Williams, a former member of the U.S. Postal Service's board of governors who resigned in protest in April, told lawmakers that the Trump administration appeared to want to strong-arm the agency into becoming a \"political tool.\"\n\n\"If this is the beginning of what the president promised, it's the end of the Postal Service,\" Williams said of recent policy changes that included raising rates and cutting back crucial services.\n\nToday: Postmaster General Louis DeJoy is scheduled to testify before the Senate this morning. He is likely to face tough questions about the cuts and about his potentially conflicting business interests.\n\n3. As schools reopen, many lack nurses\n\nFewer than 40 percent of American schools had full-time nurses before the pandemic. Yet with outbreaks already emerging in schools that have reopened, there has been no national effort to provide them with resources to hire more.\n\nIn central Washington State, Janna Benzel is responsible for her entire school district -- monitoring 1,800 students for coronavirus symptoms when classrooms open this month, on top of her regular duties. \"I'll have to go to these schools and assess every sniffle and sneeze that could potentially be a positive case,\" she told The Times. \"I just don't know if I can do it alone.\"\n\nSign up for our Schools Briefing to get the latest on how educators and parents are handling the return to school.\n\n4. Kremlin critic's suspected poisoning\n\nA Russian hospital is refusing to allow the prominent Kremlin critic Aleksei Navalny to be transferred abroad for treatment after a suspected poisoning, the opposition leader's spokeswoman said today, setting up a potential standoff as a plane from Germany arrived to fly him out of the country.\n\nNavalny was rushed to the hospital yesterday after he appeared to suffer agonizing pain on a domestic flight after drinking a cup of tea at an airport in Siberia. A doctor said today that nothing had been found to support the idea that Navalny was poisoned.\n\nThis is not Navalny's first brush with medical emergencies: In 2017, an assailant threw a green chemical liquid in his face, causing severe eye burns. Last year, while in jail for leading an unauthorized protest, he had to be hospitalized for a mysterious \"severe allergic reaction.\"\n\nSome context: Poison has been the favored weapon of Russia's security service for over a century.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nThe wildfires ripping across Northern California have killed at least four people and forced at least 62,000 from their homes. Here's an updated map of the blazes.\n\nThe police in Thailand have arrested activists after weeks of protests that culminated on Sunday in the largest street rally the country has seen since a military coup six years ago.\n\nRegulators questioned Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, this week as part of a Federal Trade Commission inquiry into whether the company broke antitrust laws.\n\nHours before Uber and Lyft were set to suspend service in California, an appeals court let the ride-hailing companies continue operating while a court weighs their challenge to a ruling requiring them to reclassify their drivers as employees.\n\nLives Lived: Ann Syrdal was a psychologist and computer science researcher who helped develop synthetic voices that sounded like women. She laid the groundwork for such modern digital assistants as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. She died at 74.\n\nIDEA OF THE DAY: Garden your worries away\n\nThe pandemic has been a boon to home gardening. The mental and physical benefits of the activity are well known: longer lives, lower levels of depression and exposure to vitamin D. \"Gardening reduces stress,\" Huma Yasin has written in The Times.\n\nContact with nature can also provide philosophical comfort, The New Yorker's Rebecca Mead argues: \"Many people, when faced with their own mortality or that of their loved ones, become more attuned to the natural world. This is evidence not just of a garden's power to distract and inspire but of its power to console.\"\n\nAnd for some marginalized communities, gardening grants agency over food insecurity and a lack of healthy options. \"Possibilities, solutions, freedom -- that's what I'm growing,\" a Los Angeles gardener and activist told The Wall Street Journal. \"That's what the gardens represent.\"\n\nPLAY, WATCH, EAT, CUBEMake some dip\n\nCowboy caviar (also known as Texas caviar) lies somewhere between a dip and a salad. You can customize the recipe with corn, avocados or whatever else you have on hand. Serve with tortilla chips and enjoy.\n\nThe translator behind 'My Brilliant Friend'\n\nIf you've ever read the wildly popular \"Neapolitan Novels\" series in English, you've come across the translation work of Ann Goldstein. Though she's worked with Elena Ferrante since 2004, even she has never met the famously secretive Italian novelist; they communicate through Ferrante's publisher.\n\nGoldstein, who used to lead The New Yorker's copy desk, became one of the most acclaimed literary translators in the world through her work on the series. The pair collaborated again on Ferrante's latest novel, \"The Lying Life of Adults,\" out next month.\n\nRead about her fascinating life in a new profile.\n\nWatch something ... mesmerizing\n\nOur weekly suggestion from Gilbert Cruz, The Times's Culture editor:\n\nI have never solved a Rubik's Cube and probably never will. Many of you might be the same. But there's something fascinating about that colorful square. So small! So difficult!\n\nA new Netflix documentary offers a peek into the world of competitive cubing, where mostly young people gather to solve the puzzles as quickly as possible. (We're talking seconds here.) \"The Speed Cubers\" focuses specifically on the sweet friendship between two of the top cubers in the world -- the Australian star Feliks Zemdegs and the American Max Park, an autistic teenager whose parents first put a cube in his hand as a means of increasing his fine motor skills.\n\nSoundtracked by the constant clicky-clack sounds of people fiddling with the cubes, this 40-minute film is a reminder that what might seem small and niche to you can be the whole world to others.\n\nDiversions\n\nTake a virtual tour of Harlem, one of New York's most storied neighborhoods.\n\nIn this week's Modern Love column, a relationship is tested, first by quarantine, then by military service.\n\nThe late-night comedy hosts bantered about the arrest of Steve Bannon.\n\nGames\n\nHere's today's Mini Crossword, and a clue: Onetime ruler of Iran (four letters).\n\nOr try this week's news quiz.\n\nYou can find all of our puzzles here.\n\nThanks for spending part of your morning with The Times.

        "body": "In what may be the world's most important math puzzle, researchers are trying to figure out how many people in a community must be immune before the coronavirus fades.\n\nWe've known from the beginning how the end will arrive. Eventually, the coronavirus will be unable to find enough susceptible hosts to survive, fading out wherever it briefly emerges.\n\nTo achieve so-called herd immunity -- the point at which the virus can no longer spread because there are not enough vulnerable humans -- scientists have suggested that perhaps 70 percent of a given population must be immune, through vaccination or because they survived the infection.\n\nNow some researchers are wrestling with a hopeful possibility. In interviews with The New York Times, more than a dozen scientists said that the threshold is likely to be much lower: just 50 percent, perhaps even less. If that's true, then it may be possible to turn back the coronavirus more quickly than once thought.\n\nThe new estimates result from complicated statistical modeling of the pandemic, and the models have all taken divergent approaches, yielding inconsistent estimates. It is not certain that any community in the world has enough residents now immune to the virus to resist a second wave.\n\nBut in parts of New York, London and Mumbai, for example, it is not inconceivable that there is already substantial immunity to the coronavirus, scientists said.\n\n\"I'm quite prepared to believe that there are pockets in New York City and London which have substantial immunity,\" said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"What happens this winter will reflect that.\"\n\n\"The question of what it means for the population as a whole, however, is much more fraught,\" he added.\n\nHerd immunity is calculated from the epidemic's so-called reproductive number, R0, an indicator of how many people each infected person spreads the virus to.\n\nThe initial calculations for the herd immunity threshold assumed that each community member had the same susceptibility to the virus and mixed randomly with everyone else in the community.\n\n\"That doesn't happen in real life,\" said Dr. Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health. \"Herd immunity could vary from group to group, and subpopulation to subpopulation,\" and even by postal codes, he said.\n\nFor example, a neighborhood of older people may have little contact with others but succumb to the virus quickly when they encounter it, whereas teenagers may bequeath the virus to dozens of contacts and yet stay healthy themselves. The virus moves slowly in suburban and rural areas, where people live far apart, but zips through cities and households thick with people.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-16T12:02:59.293Z A teachers' strike closes down a school district in Arizona that was set to begin classes on Monday. The F.D.A. gives emergency approval for a new spit test as U.S. testing stalls. South Korea warns of another outbreak tied to a church. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nOnce such real-world variations in density and demographics are accounted for, the estimates for herd immunity fall. Some researchers even suggested the figure may be in the range of 10 to 20 percent, but they were in the minority.\n\nAssuming the virus ferrets out the most outgoing and most susceptible in the first wave, immunity following a wave of infection is distributed more efficiently than with a vaccination campaign that seeks to protect everyone, said Tom Britton, a mathematician at Stockholm University.\n\nHis model puts the threshold for herd immunity at 43 percent -- that is, the virus cannot hang on in a community after that percentage of residents has been infected and recovered.\n\nStill, that means many residents of the community will have been sickened or have died, a high price to pay for herd immunity. And experts like Dr. Hanage cautioned that even a community that may have reached herd immunity cannot afford to be complacent.\n\nThe virus may still flare up here and there, even if its overall spread is stymied. It's also unclear how long someone who has recovered may be immune, and for how long.\n\nVirus-Resistant Communities?\n\nThe coronavirus crashed this year's Purim celebrations in the Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods of New York City, tearing through the parades and masquerades in Brooklyn on March 9 and 10.\n\nSchools and synagogues soon shut down to quell the spread, but it was too late. By April, thousands in the Brooklyn communities were infected, and hundreds had died.\n\n\"It's like a black hole in my memory because of how traumatic it was,\" said Blimi Marcus, a nurse practitioner who lives in Borough Park, which was hit hard by the virus.\n\nBut all that has changed now, Ms. Marcus added: \"The general feeling is one of complacency, that somehow we've all had it and we're safe.\"\n\nIs it possible that some of these communities have herd immunity? In some clinics, up to 80 percent of people tested had antibodies to the virus. The highest prevalence was found among teenage boys.\n\nBut people at clinics are more likely to be showing symptoms and therefore more likely to be infected, said Wan Yang, an epidemiologist at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York. Random household surveys would probably find lower rates -- but still well above the 21 percent average reported for New York City, she said.\n\nResearchers in Mumbai conducted just such a random household survey, knocking on every fourth door -- or, if it was locked, the fifth -- and took blood for antibody testing. They found a startling disparity between the city's poorest neighborhoods and its more affluent enclaves. Between 51 and 58 percent of residents in poor areas had antibodies, versus 11 to 17 percent elsewhere in the city.\n\nThe lowest-income residents are packed tightly together, share toilets, and have little access to masks. \"These factors contributed to a silent infection spread,\" said Dr. Jayanthi Shastri, a microbiologist at Kasturba Hospital in Mumbai who led the work.\n\nMost researchers are wary of concluding that the hardest-hit neighborhoods of Brooklyn, or even those in blighted areas of Mumbai, have reached herd immunity or will be spared future outbreaks.\n\nBut models like Dr. Britton's hint that it's not impossible. Other researchers have suggested, controversially, that herd immunity can be achieved at rates of immunity as low as 10 or 20 percent -- and that entire countries may already have achieved that goal.\n\nCriticism trailed Sunetra Gupta, a theoretical epidemiologist at Oxford University, after a widely circulated interview in which she said that London and New York may already have reached herd immunity because of variability among people, combined with a theoretical immunity to common cold coronaviruses that may protect against the new one.\n\n\"That could be the explanation for why you don't see a resurgence in places like New York,\" she said.\n\nMost experts reject that notion. Several studies have shown that certain immune cells produced following infection with seasonal coronaviruses may also recognize the new coronavirus.\n\nBut \"where is the evidence that it's protective?\" asked Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at the University of Florida.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 12, 2020\n\nCan I travel within the United States?Many states have travel restrictions, and lots of them are taking active measures to enforce those restrictions, like issuing fines or asking visitors to quarantine for 14 days. Here's an ever-updating list of statewide restrictions. In general, travel does increase your chance of getting and spreading the virus, as you are bound to encounter more people than if you remained at your house in your own \"pod.\" \"Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from Covid-19,\" the C.D.C. says. If you do travel, though, take precautions. If you can, drive. If you have to fly, be careful about picking your airline. But know that airlines are taking real steps to keep planes clean and limit your risk.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nThese cities have not returned to pre-pandemic levels of activity, other experts noted.\n\n\"We are still nowhere near back to normal in our daily behavior,\" said Virginia Pitzer, a mathematical epidemiologist at the Yale School of Public Health. \"To think that we can just stop doing all that and go back to normal and not see a rise in cases I think is wrong, is incorrect.\"\n\nA second wave might also hit groups or neighborhoods that were spared by the first, and still wreak havoc, she said. Immunity is a patchwork quilt in New York, for instance: Antibodies were present in 68 percent of people visiting a clinic in the Corona neighborhood of Queens, for instance, but in just 13 percent of those tested at a clinic in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn.\n\nBut another group, led by the mathematician Gabriela Gomes of the University of Strathclyde in Britain, accounted for variations within a society in its model and found that Belgium, England, Portugal and Spain have herd immunity thresholds in the range of 10 to 20 percent.\n\n\"At least in countries we applied it to, we could never get any signal that herd immunity thresholds are higher,\" Dr. Gomes said. \"I think it's good to have this horizon that it may be just a few more months of pandemic.\"\n\nOther experts urged caution, saying these models are flawed, as all models are, and that they oversimplify conditions on the ground.\n\nJeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University, said it wasn't clear to him that Dr. Gomes's model offered only one possible solution. And he was suspicious of the big ranges among the four countries.\n\n\"I think we'd be playing with fire if we pretended we're done with this,\" Dr. Shaman said.\n\nThe new models offer food for thought, he and other experts said, but should not be used to set policy.\n\n\"Mathematically, it's certainly possible to have herd immunity at these very, very low levels,\" said Carl Bergstrom, an infectious disease expert at the University of Washington in Seattle. \"Those are just our best guesses for what the numbers should look like.\"\n\n\"But,\" he added, \"they're just exactly that, guesses.\"\n\nImperfect Immunity\n\nBut what about immunity at levels lower than those needed for herd immunity?\n\n\"Definitely the disease would not spread as well if it gets back into New York,\" said Joel Miller, a mathematical modeler at La Trobe University in Australia. \"The same level of behavior change will have more effect on the disease now than it did four months ago.\"\n\nThinking of a city or country as composed of subgroups, demarcated by age, race and level of social activity, might also help governments protect those with the least immunity.\n\nThat perspective also might help put a renewed focus on groups who require the higher levels of immunity, because of greater exposure levels and other inequities, including Black and Latino residents, said Dr. Manoj Jain, an infectious disease expert at Emory University. \"That's where this info is very useful,\" he said.\n\nThe models also suggest a vaccination strategy: Rather than uniformly vaccinate all groups, governments could identify and immunize those most likely to be exposed in \"superspreader\" events.\n\n\"Getting those people vaccinated first can lead to the greatest benefit,\" said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. \"That alone could lead to herd immunity,\"\n\nVaccination schemes for other pathogens have successfully exploited this approach. For example, when children were given the pneumococcal vaccine in the early 2000s, rates of bacterial pneumonia in the elderly rapidly dropped because of a \"herd effect.\"\n\nVaccines that offer just 50 percent protection are considered to be moderately effective, but at that efficiency, even a low herd immunity target would require that a large proportion of the population be immunized, Dr. Bergstrom noted.\n\nIf there are early reports of side effects that may scare away some people, he said, \"we'd do well to start thinking about all that now.\"\n\nBack in Brooklyn, fewer than 1 percent of people tested at neighborhood clinics over the past eight weeks have had the virus. But there are still handfuls of cases, Ms. Marcus said, adding that her 10-year-old niece was in quarantine because a counselor at her day camp had tested positive.\n\n\"Sometimes that's all you need, right?\" she said. \"I'm still hoping we don't see what we had in March and April, but I'm not so sure that we've seen the end of it.\"",

        "body": "Accuracy is everything, typically, when we take a diagnostic test -- an incorrect result can lead to anguish and erroneous, if not harmful, treatment. Currently the most reliable way to identify a coronavirus infection is by a polymerase chain reaction (P.C.R.) test: A swab, usually taken from the nasal passage, produces a sample that is then sent to a specialized laboratory. P.C.R. tests, which can detect minute amounts of genetic material from the virus, cost upward of $100; in ideal circumstances, they take just hours to analyze. But because of high demand, supply shortages and other issues, many commercial labs are taking more than a week to process them. That means a positive test often comes back too late to enable contact tracers to notify those who have been exposed before they might in turn infect others. In these circumstances, the diagnosis is useful only for making personal health decisions and providing data on the rate of infection in a community.\n\nIn a July 21 report in JAMA Internal Medicine, the C.D.C.'s response team for Covid-19 estimated that nine out of 10 infections are not being identified -- and obstacles to getting tested are probably major reasons. To capture more of those cases, many of which may not show obvious symptoms, says Daniel Larremore, a computational biologist at the University of Colorado, Boulder, \"we need to shift our thinking.\" Specifically, he says, we need to go from prioritizing the accuracy of individual test results to prioritizing the ability of a testing system to reduce the rate of the virus in a given population -- even if that results in more misdiagnoses.\n\nTo see how this could work in practice, consider one strategy for increasing testing capacity: pooling samples for analysis. Suppose one person in 100 has the virus. Testers take and label a nasal swab from all of them; a portion of each sample is saved, and the rest is grouped with the samples taken from nine other people. The lab then runs 10 analyses, one for each group of 10 samples. Nine of those will return negative results, a determination given to all 90 members in those groups. The lab then retests each individual sample in the positive group to find the infected member. Over all, the lab has conducted 20 analyses, rather than the 100 needed to test everyone individually.\n\nAt a certain threshold, diluting samples by combining them with so many others might make the virus harder to detect, but the technique has proved effective in batches of five for P.C.R. testing. Nebraska was able to stretch its supplies by pooling, except among populations with high infection rates, which cause more groups to test positive and thus require more individual assays. \"That can change week to week and possibly day to day,\" says Jonathan Kolstad, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley. \"Florida, three months ago, you could have done pretty big pools. Now you wouldn't want that.\" But, he and his colleagues note in a working paper published in July in the National Bureau of Economic Research, computer modeling could use factors like a person's age, job, ZIP code and social networks to classify people by their risk of infection and group their samples accordingly. In theory, as more people with the virus are removed from circulating among others, the infection rate will go down and the pools can be expanded, making testing more efficient. Consequently, the economists' analysis showed, testing daily would cost only twice as much as testing monthly.\n\nEven when pooled, P.C.R. testing, which detects about 98 percent of infections and returns very few false positives, is too impractical as a way to regularly test millions of people. Because it's so precise, it may identify traces of the virus for weeks after a person has stopped being contagious, says Michael Mina, a pathologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But significantly less sensitive tests could still prevent outbreaks -- if the testing was frequent enough and returned almost instant results. In July, researchers from the Yale School of Public Health published a study in JAMA Network Open that models screening scenarios for college campuses. They found that testing students every two days with a method that detects just 70 percent of the infections would be able to contain the virus. This conclusion depended on an important assumption, however: that students identified as infected are isolated within eight hours and that all students are taking preventive measures like social distancing and wearing masks indoors. If students are tested only upon showing symptoms, outbreaks could not be contained.\n\nThe same principle also seems to apply in less tightly controlled environments. A group of researchers including Larremore and Mina simulated a small city and a large university, in order to model the effect of tests that varied in their accuracy, frequency and turnaround time. In a preprint paper released at the end of June, they reported that weekly screening of everyone with tests that are 100 times less sensitive than P.C.R. tests would prevent outbreaks if the results were immediate and positive cases self-isolate. Mina is pushing for rapid federal deployment of at-home tests, cheap enough to use daily, which several companies are developing.\n\nBut such tests face regulatory hurdles before they can be produced widely. Other rapid tests that are available now may need to be refined further before they can be \"operationalized,\" or used effectively in an actual setting, like a school, according to Dave O'Connor. He and colleagues in the AIDS Vaccine Reseach Laboratory at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, have been piloting what is called a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) test, which can be done on saliva, as part of the N.I.H. Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics initiative. They're running their project out of a minivan. \"The first day we tested five or six people,\" he told me. \"Today we ran 80.\"\n\nThe question then is whether such screening actually works. A report published by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota warns that simply testing a wider swath of the population will be counterproductive unless the \"the right test is given to the right person at the right time\" and then that person takes appropriate action in response. For instance, says Tom Friedrich, who is part of the Wisconsin effort, do positive cases self-isolate? \"Or do we discover that it's just really hard for people to modify their behaviors?\" If overtaxed local health departments are \"making a trade-off to rapidly test a bunch of asymptomatic people with no known exposure, instead of testing symptomatic folks\" -- those who are more likely to pose a risk to others -- \"that's a problem,\" says Angela Ulrich, one of the Minnesota report's authors.\n\nRecently seven states struck a deal to jointly purchase three million antigen tests, which look for viral proteins and return results in minutes. To detect infection, they require that more of the virus be present than P.C.R. tests do, but, Mina says, they may be able to \"capture the vast majority of people at risk of spreading it at the time that they're taking it.\" He adds, though: \"It doesn't mean you're not going to be positive tomorrow or that you weren't positive yesterday.\"\n\nTo filter out enough asymptomatic carriers to reduce overall infection rates, such rapid tests would need to be given every few days, focusing first, when supplies are limited, on groups with the highest risk of spreading the virus. \"Imagine that you go to the airport and check your bags and then you spit in a tube,\" Larremore told me. If your test is positive, you can't fly and are sent for a diagnostic follow-up. A system like that, he says, even if set up by individual companies or schools, would reduce spread and free up more P.C.R. tests for people with symptoms: \"Every little bit helps here.\"\n\nCompared with a diagnostic test, a screening test would give the taker no definitive health information; being identified as infected would incur costs like lost wages. But, Larremore says, we shouldn't underestimate the value of giving information to someone that \"allows you to protect people around you.\" If we could act on that knowledge immediately, testing positive, instead of being the frightening news it often is now, could actually be, Larremore says, \"really empowering.\"",

        "body": "Dozens of research groups around the world are playing the long game, convinced that their experimental vaccines will be cheaper and more powerful than the ones leading the race today.\n\nSeven months into the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 30 vaccines rapidly advancing through the rigorous stages of clinical trials, a surprising number of research groups are placing bets on some that have not yet been given to a single person.\n\nThe New York Times has confirmed that at least 88 candidates are under active preclinical investigation in laboratories across the world, with 67 of them slated to begin clinical trials before the end of 2021.\n\nThose trials may begin after millions of people have already received the first wave of vaccines. It will take months to see if any of them are safe and effective. Nevertheless, the scientists developing them say their designs may be able to prompt more powerful immune responses, or be much cheaper to produce, or both -- making them the slow and steady winners of the race against the coronavirus.\n\n\"The first vaccines may not be the most effective,\" said Ted Ross, the director of the Center for Vaccines and Immunology at the University of Georgia, who is working on an experimental vaccine he hopes to put into clinical trials in 2021.\n\nMany of the vaccines at the front of the pack today try to teach the body the same basic lesson. They deliver a protein that covers the surface of the coronavirus, called spike, which appears to prompt the immune system to make antibodies to fight it off.\n\nBut some researchers worry that we may be pinning too many hopes on a strategy that has not been proved to work. \"It would be a shame to put all our eggs in the same basket,\" said David Veesler, a virologist at the University of Washington.\n\nCoronavirus Vaccine Tracker\n\nA look at all the vaccines that have reached trials in humans.\n\nIn March, Dr. Veesler and his colleagues designed a vaccine that consists of millions of nanoparticles, each one studded with 60 copies of the tip of the spike protein, rather than the entire thing. The researchers thought these bundles of tips might pack a stronger immunological punch.\n\nWhen the researchers injected these nanoparticles into mice, the animals responded with a flood of antibodies to the coronavirus -- much more than produced by a vaccine containing the entire spike. When the scientists exposed vaccinated mice and monkeys to the coronavirus, they found that it completely protected them from infection.\n\nThe researchers shared their initial results this month in a paper that has yet to be published in a scientific journal. Icosavax, a start-up company co-founded by Dr. Veesler's collaborator, Neil King, is preparing to begin clinical trials of the nanoparticle vaccine by the end of this year.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-27T08:00:21.368Z Almost 500 million schoolchildren have been cut off from learning, a report finds. A C.D.C. recommendation to test fewer people for the virus raises concerns. As Hurricane Laura slams the U.S., evacuation shelters adjust for the virus. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nU.S. Army researchers at the Walter Reed Army Institute have created another spike-tip nanoparticle vaccine, and are recruiting volunteers for a clinical trial that they also plan to start by the end of 2020. A number of other companies and universities are creating spike-tip-based vaccines as well, using recipes of their own.\n\nImmune punch\n\nAntibodies are only one weapon in the immune arsenal. Blood cells known as T cells can fight infections by attacking other cells that have been infiltrated by the virus.\n\n\"We still don't know which kind of immune response will be important for protection,\" said Luciana Leite, a vaccine researcher at Instituto Butantan in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil.\n\nIt's possible that vaccines that arouse only antibody responses will fail in the long run. Dr. Leite and other researchers are testing vaccines made of several parts of the coronavirus to see if they can coax T cells to fight it off.\n\n\"It's a second line of defense that might work better than antibodies,\" said Anne De Groot, the C.E.O. of Epivax, a company based in Providence, R.I.\n\nEpivax has created an experimental vaccine with several pieces of the spike protein, as well as other viral proteins, which it plans to test in a clinical trial in December.\n\nThe effectiveness of a vaccine can also be influenced by how it gets into our body. All of the first-wave vaccines now in clinical trials have to be injected into muscle. A nasal spray vaccine -- similar to FluMist for influenza -- might work better, since the coronavirus invades our bodies through the airway.\n\nSeveral groups are gearing up for clinical trials of nasal spray vaccines. One of the most imaginative approaches comes from a New York company called Codagenix. They are testing a vaccine that contains a synthetic version of the coronavirus that they made from scratch.\n\nThe Codagenix vaccine is a new twist on an old formula. For decades, vaccine makers have created vaccines for diseases such as chickenpox and yellow fever from live but weakened viruses. Traditionally, scientists have weakened the viruses by growing them in cells of chickens or some other animal. The viruses adapt to their new host, and in the process they become ill-suited for growing in the human body.\n\nThe viruses still slip into cells, but they replicate at a glacial pace. As a result, they can't make us sick. But a small dose of these weakened viruses can deliver a powerful jolt to the immune system.\n\nYet there are relatively few live weakened viruses, because making them is a struggle. \"It's really trial-and-error based,\" said J. Robert Coleman, the chief executive of Codagenix. \"You can never say exactly what the mutations are doing.\"\n\nThe Codagenix scientists came up with a different approach. They sat down at a computer and edited the coronavirus's genome, creating 283 mutations. They then created a piece of DNA containing their new genome and put it in monkey cells. The cells then made their rewritten viruses. In experiments on hamsters, the researchers found that their vaccine didn't make the animals sick -- but did protect them against the coronavirus.\n\nCodagenix is preparing to open a Phase 1 trial of an intranasal spray with one of these synthesized coronaviruses as early as September. Two similar vaccines are in earlier stages of development.\n\nThe French vaccine maker Valneva plans to start clinical trials in November on a far less futuristic design. \"We are addressing the pandemic with a rather conventional approach,\" said Thomas Lingelbach, the C.E.O. of Valneva.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nValneva makes vaccines from inactivated viruses that are killed with chemicals. Jonas Salk and other early vaccine makers found this recipe to work well. Chinese vaccine makers already have three such coronavirus vaccines in Phase 3 trials, but Dr. Lingelbach still sees an opportunity for Valneva making its own. Inactivated virus vaccines have to meet very high standards for purification, to make sure all the viruses are not viable. Valneva has already met those standards, and it's not clear if Chinese vaccines would.\n\nThe United Kingdom has arranged to purchase 60 million doses of Valneva's vaccine, and the company is scaling up to make 200 million doses a year.\n\nFaster and cheaper production\n\nEven if the first wave of vaccines work, many researchers worry that it won't be possible to make enough of them fast enough to tackle the global need.\n\n\"It's a numbers game -- we need a lot of doses,\" said Florian Krammer, a virologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.\n\nSome of the most promising first-wave products, such as RNA vaccines from Moderna and Pfizer, are based on designs that have never been put into large-scale production before. \"The manufacturing math just doesn't add up,\" said Steffen Mueller, the chief scientific officer of Codagenix.\n\nMany of the second-wave vaccines wouldn't require a large scale-up of experimental manufacturing. Instead, they could piggyback on standard methods that have been used for years to make safe and effective vaccines.\n\nCodagenix, for example, has entered into a partnership with the Serum Institute of India to grow their recoded coronaviruses. The institute already makes billions of doses of live weakened virus vaccines for measles, rotaviruses and influenza, growing them in large tanks of cells.\n\nTapping into well-established methods could also cut down the cost of a coronavirus vaccine, which will make it easier to get it distributed to less wealthy countries.\n\nResearchers at Baylor College of Medicine, for example, are doing preclinical work on a vaccine that they said might cost as little as $2 a dose. By contrast, Pfizer is charging $19 a dose in a deal with the U.S. government, and other companies have floated even higher prices.\n\nTo make the vaccine, the Baylor team engineered yeast to make coronavirus spike tips. It's precisely the same method that has been used since the 1980s to make vaccines for hepatitis B. The Indian vaccine maker Biological E has licensed Baylor's vaccine and is planning Phase 1 trials that will start this fall.\n\n\"They now already know they can make a billion doses a year,\" said Maria Elena Bottazzi, a Baylor virologist. \"It's easy-breezy for them, because it was exactly the same bread-and-butter vaccine technology that they have been working with for years.\"\n\nEven if the world gets cheap, effective vaccines against Covid-19, that doesn't mean all of our pandemic worries are over. With an abundance of other coronaviruses lurking in wild animals, another Covid-like pandemic may be not far off. Several companies -- including Anhui Zhifei in China, Osivax in France and VBI in Massachusetts -- are developing \"universal\" coronavirus vaccines that might protect people from an array of the viruses, even those that haven't colonized our species yet.\n\nMany scientists see their ongoing vaccine work as part of a long game -- one that the well-being of entire nations will depend on. Thailand, for example, is preparing to purchase Covid-19 vaccines developed overseas, but scientists there are also carrying out preclinical research of their own.\n\nAt Chulalongkorn University, researchers have been investigating several potential candidates, including an RNA-based vaccine that will go into Phase 1 studies by early 2021. The vaccine is similar to one that Pfizer is now testing in late-stage clinical trials, but these scientists want the security of making their own version.\n\n\"While Thailand has to plan for buying vaccines, we should do our best to produce our own vaccine as well,\" said Kiat Ruxrungtham, a professor at Chulalongkorn University. \"If we are not successful this time, we will be capable to do much, much better in the next pandemic.\"",

        "body": "Thursday: Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a deal that would more than double the state's testing capacity and criticized federal guidelines.\n\nGood morning.\n\nCalifornia officials on Wednesday flexed the market muscle of the nation's most populous state, announcing a deal they said would more than double the state's coronavirus testing capacity, driving down costs significantly.\n\n\"We are moving forward in a different direction to disrupt the market,\" Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"We're advancing this partnership as only California can with our purchasing power and the number of people we have.\"\n\n[Track every coronavirus case in California by county.]\n\nComing in addition to the more than 100,000 tests conducted across the state on average each day, the new lab and supply chain run by the diagnostics company PerkinElmer, based in Massachusetts, will allow for 150,000 more tests per day, with a required turnaround of no more than two days, allowing public health officials to move quickly to identify outbreaks.\n\nThat speed and capacity, officials said, will be critical for safely reopening schools and businesses. Mr. Newsom said that he would unveil updated reopening guidelines on Friday.\n\n[Read about the state's most sweeping rollback of reopening efforts, in mid-July.]\n\nThe lab will ramp up starting this fall, a time at which experts worry a second wave of coronavirus cases will coincide with flu season, creating what Mr. Newsom described as a kind of respiratory \"twindemic.\"\n\nHe said the deal with PerkinElmer would allow health care workers in California to test simultaneously for the flu and the coronavirus at no additional cost.\n\nThe announcement comes not long after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly revised its testing guidelines to exclude people who don't have symptoms of Covid-19, even if they have been exposed.\n\nPublic health experts, who attribute much of the virus's spread to people who are infected but not symptomatic, called the guideline change alarming and dangerous.\n\nCalifornia was the first state to recommend tests for some people without symptoms, and officials have been vocal about the need for widespread testing -- particularly in populations that have been disproportionately affected by the virus, such as Latino Californians working in essential jobs.\n\n[Read about why some experts have said focusing care on workers in Central Valley was overdue.]\n\nBut in mid-July, the state had to adjust its testing guidelines to be stricter, as the state contended with soaring cases and a national shortage of testing supplies.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mr. Newsom roundly rejected the C.D.C. guidelines and positioned the new testing program as a kind of response to insufficient help from the federal government.\n\n\"This is exactly what the federal government should be doing,\" he said. \"If you had seen the federal government doing this, it would've saved taxpayers billions of dollars.\"\n\n[Is California doing enough testing? Here's what to look for.]\n\nState officials said the average cost of a coronavirus test currently ranges from $150 to $200. Once the new partnership is at full capacity, each test will cost as little as $31, though the higher figure also included things like staff protective gear, while The Sacramento Bee reported the lower price does not.\n\nTesting availability has varied widely across the country, and waits for results have stretched into weeks in some cases, making it impossible to warn contacts in time to contain the spread.\n\n(This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up to get it delivered to your inbox.)\n\nNow, a brief update on the wildfires\n\nMr. Newsom on Wednesday once again underscored the historic scale of the wildfires this year.\n\n\"If you don't believe in climate change, please come to the state of California,\" he said. \"We will educate you.\"\n\n[Read more about why prescribed burns are a critical tool for fighting destructive wildfires.]\n\nIn this latest round of blazes, he said, more than 15,000 firefighters were battling fires that have burned 1.3 million acres, with the weather continuing to be a challenge. Over the past day, 423 more lightning strikes sparked 50 new fires -- though firefighters were able to suppress all of them.\n\nSeven deaths have been linked to the fires, though the governor warned that more may be discovered as neighborhoods reopened. Similarly, the number of homes and buildings that have been destroyed, currently 1,690, was expected to increase significantly once officials and residents could better survey the damage.\n\n[Track the wildfires burning in California with The Times's map.]\n\nRead more:\n\n\"2020 can go to hell.\" In Lake Berryessa, residents have watched a pandemic and now fires ravage their town.

[The New York Times]\n\nAnd Finally ...\n\nAs we hurtle toward the election, there's been a lot of attention paid to the mechanics of casting a ballot during a pandemic.\n\nLeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers was the headliner in a group of athletes who recently started a multimillion-dollar effort to recruit more and younger poll workers in Black electoral districts; many poll workers are older and interacting with so many people would most likely put some at risk of getting sick with Covid-19.\n\nMr. James also partnered with the Dodgers to make Dodger Stadium a polling site.\n\nCalifornia state officials have pushed hard to make voting by mail very easy.\n\nBut recently, concerns about the United States Postal Service have raised alarms about whether a ballot dropped in a mailbox will make it to its destination.\n\nSo -- although the postmaster general said he'd suspend cost-cutting measures until after the election following an outcry -- California election officials created this mail-in ballot tracker aimed at easing voters' minds. It will tell you when your ballot has been mailed, received and counted, the site says.\n\nAnd once again, if you need to make sure you're registered to vote, you can do that here.\n\nCalifornia Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

        "body": "JERUSALEM -- As the United States and other countries anxiously consider how to reopen schools, Israel, one of the first countries to do so, illustrates the dangers of moving too precipitously.\n\nConfident it had beaten the coronavirus and desperate to reboot a devastated economy, the Israeli government invited the entire student body back in late May.\n\nWithin days, infections were reported at a Jerusalem high school, which quickly mushroomed into the largest outbreak in a single school in Israel, possibly the world.\n\nThe virus rippled out to the students' homes and then to other schools and neighborhoods, ultimately infecting hundreds of students, teachers and relatives.\n\nOther outbreaks forced hundreds of schools to close. Across the country, tens of thousands of students and teachers were quarantined.\n\nIsrael's advice for other countries?\n\n\"They definitely should not do what we have done,\" said Eli Waxman, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science and chairman of the team advising Israel's National Security Council on the pandemic. \"It was a major failure.\"\n\nThe lesson, experts say, is that even communities that have gotten the spread of the virus under control need to take strict precautions when reopening schools. Smaller classes, mask wearing, keeping desks six feet apart and providing adequate ventilation, they say, are likely to be crucial until a vaccine is available.\n\n\"If there is a low number of cases, there is an illusion that the disease is over,\" said Dr. Hagai Levine, a professor of epidemiology at Hebrew University-Hadassah School of Public Health. \"But it's a complete illusion.\"\n\n\"The mistake in Israel,\" he said, \"is that you can open the education system, but you have to do it gradually, with certain limits, and you have to do it in a very careful way.\"\n\nThe United States is facing similar pressures to fully reopen schools, and President Trump has threatened to withhold funding for districts that don't reopen. But the U.S. is in a far worse position than Israel was in May: Israel had fewer than 100 new infections a day then. The U.S. is now averaging more than 60,000 new cases a day, and some states continue to set alarming records.\n\nIsrael's handling of the pandemic was considered successful at first. The country of nine million quickly closed its borders, shuttered schools in mid-March and introduced remote learning for its two million students. In April, Passover and Ramadan were celebrated under lockdown.\n\nBy early May, infection rates had fallen from more than 750 confirmed cases a day to double digits. The youngest students, grades three and under, and older students taking final exams returned in small groups, splitting the week to take turns using classrooms.\n\nThen, emboldened by the dropping infection rates, the government completely reopened schools on May 17, the day a new government was sworn in.\n\nIn his inaugural speech, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised a new budget that would deliver three things: \"Jobs, jobs, jobs.\" His new education minister, Yoav Gallant, said that the school system's \"immediate mission\" was to allow parents to return to work with peace of mind.\n\nInna Zaltsman, an Education Ministry official, said administrators also wanted \"to return the children to routine as much as possible, for their emotional and pedagogic well-being.\"\n\nShopping malls, outdoor markets and gyms had already reopened, and soon houses of worship, restaurants, bars, hotels and wedding halls did too. Mr. Netanyahu told Israelis to grab a beer and, while taking precautions, \"Go out and have a good time.\"\n\nIn hindsight, that advice was wildly premature.\n\nThat same day, a mother phoned a teacher at Jerusalem's historic Gymnasia Ha'ivrit high school. Her son, a seventh-grade student there, had tested positive for the virus.\n\nBy the next day, the school confirmed another case in the ninth grade. Ultimately, Israeli officials said, 154 students and 26 staff members were found to be infected.\n\n\"There was a general euphoria among the public, a sense that we had dealt with the first wave well and that it was behind us,\" said Danniel Leibovitch, Gymnasia's principal. \"Of course, that wasn't true.\"\n\nThe Education Ministry had issued safety instructions: Masks were to be worn by students in fourth grade and higher, windows kept open, hands washed frequently and students kept six feet apart whenever possible.\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakBack to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 7, 2020\n\nThe latest highlights as the first students return to U.S. schools.\n\nSchools are open in parts of the country -- and some are already closing again. Students have already faced altered classrooms and emergency quarantines. We spoke to some to see what school is like in the age of Covid-19.Photos of a crowded high school hallway evoked outrage on social media. The student who took them says she was suspended.Faced with remote learning or socially distanced classroom options, some parents of rising kindergartners are considering holding their kids back.Teachers, show us your classrooms! We want to see how educators are preparing to keep themselves and students safe if their schools open this fall.\n\nBut in many Israeli schools, where up to 38 children squeeze into classrooms of about 500 square feet, physical distancing proved impossible.\n\nUnable to comply with the rules, some local authorities ignored them or simply decided not to reopen at full capacity.\n\nThen a heat wave hit. Parents complained that it was inhumane to make children wear masks in steaming classrooms where open windows nullified the air conditioning.\n\nIn response, the government exempted everyone from wearing masks for four days, and schools shut the windows.\n\nThat decision proved disastrous, experts say.\n\n\"Instead of canceling school in those days, they just told the kids 'OK, well you have to stay in the class with the air conditioning on and take your masks off,' so you have no ventilation really,\" said Dr. Ronit Calderon-Margalit, a professor of epidemiology at Hebrew University-Hadassah Braun School of Public Health. \"You have the ideal circumstances for an outbreak.\"\n\nThe Gymnasia became a petri dish for Covid-19.\n\nWhen the first case was discovered, the student's classmates, teachers and other contacts were quarantined. After the second case, which was not directly linked to the first, the school was closed and everyone was instructed to quarantine for two weeks. All students and staff were tested, often waiting in line for hours.\n\nAbout 60 percent of infected students were asymptomatic. Teachers, some of whom had been teaching multiple classes, suffered the most and a few were hospitalized, the principal said.\n\nParents were furious. Oz Arbel told Israel's Army Radio that for a school project, his daughter's classmates sat at a table and passed around a cellphone with a teacher who was showing symptoms. His daughter and wife became infected.\n\nOne Gymnasia student, Ofek Amzaleg, told Kan public radio that a teacher who coughed in class and joked that he didn't have coronavirus was among those who tested positive. Ofek also became infected.\n\nMr. Leibovitch, the principal, said he had no knowledge of any teacher coming in with symptoms.\n\nSeeking to contain the contagion, the Education Ministry vowed to shut any school with even one Covid-19 case. It ultimately closed more than 240 schools and quarantined more than 22,520 teachers and students.\n\nWhen the school year ended in late June, the ministry said, 977 pupils and teachers had contracted Covid-19.\n\nBut the Health Ministry, lacking the infrastructure and resources, did not make contact tracing a priority. In the Gymnasia case, Professor Waxman said, nobody even identified which buses the students had ridden on to school.\n\nProms were canceled, but graduating seniors in the central city of Ra'anana held an underground prom party anyway. Dozens contracted the virus.\n\nA nursery school teacher, Shalva Zalfreund, 64, sent a note to parents saying she believed she had been infected in her school, where some parents had sent their children from homes with cases of the virus. She died in July.\n\nOutside school walls, the coronavirus returned with a vengeance. Covid wards that had closed with festive ceremonies in late April began filling again, with confirmed infections spiraling to about 800 a day by late June and more than 2,000 a day by late July.\n\nSome blamed the hasty school reopening as a major factor in the second wave. Siegal Sadetzki, who resigned in frustration last month as Israel's director of public health services, wrote that insufficient safety precautions in schools, as well as large gatherings like weddings, fueled a \"significant portion\" of second-wave infections.\n\nBut others said singling out schools was unfair when the real problem was that everything reopened too quickly.\n\n\"The single super-spreader event in the Gymnasia just happened to be in a school,\" said Dr. Ran Balicer, an Israeli health care official and adviser to the prime minister on the pandemic. \"It could have happened in any other setting.\"\n\nNow Israel is confronting the same questions as other countries, trying to learn from its mistakes in planning for the school year that begins Sept. 1.\n\nPublic health experts worldwide have coalesced around a set of guidelines for reopening schools.\n\nA major recommendation is to create groups of 10 to 15 students who stay together in classrooms, at recess and lunchtime, with teachers assigned to only one group. Each group has minimal contact with other groups, limiting any spread of infection. And if a case of Covid-19 emerges, one group can be quarantined at home while others can continue at school.\n\nOther key recommendations include staggering schedules or teaching older students online, keeping desks several feet apart, sanitizing classrooms more frequently, providing ventilation and opening windows if possible, and requiring masks for staff and students old enough to wear them properly.\n\nIsrael has already moved in that direction.\n\nThe government recently appointed a coronavirus czar, Dr. Ronni Gamzu, who transferred responsibility for virus testing and investigation from the Health Ministry to the military. \"This is an operation, not medicine,\" he declared.\n\nOn Sunday, the government approved plans for returning only grades two and lower to school in full-size classes in the fall. Younger children are less likely to become seriously ill, and some studies have suggested that they are less likely than adults and teenagers to transmit the virus to others.\n\nThe plans also call for splitting older students into capsules of 18 and for mostly online instruction for grades five and above. Principals will have flexibility to adjust their school's policies based on local conditions.\n\nEven those measures may not be enough.\n\nMenashe Levy, president of the Israeli High School Principals Association, arranged desks six feet apart in a standard classroom. It could accommodate 14 students, not 18.\n\nBut Israel is plunging ahead. Only one option has been ruled out: closing the schools.\n\n\"This is a long-term pandemic,\" said Dr. Nadav Davidovitch, a pandemic policy adviser to the government. \"We cannot close schools for a year.\"\n\nIsabel Kershner reported from Jerusalem, and Pam Belluck from the United States.",

        "body": "Warnings had piled up for years that nursing homes were vulnerable. The pandemic sent them to the back of the line for equipment and care.\n\nBRUSSELS -- Shirley Doyen was exhausted. The Christalain nursing home, which she ran with her brother in an affluent neighborhood in Brussels, was buckling from Covid-19. Eight residents had died in three weeks. Some staff members had only gowns and goggles from Halloween doctor costumes for protection.\n\nNor was help coming. Ms. Doyen had begged hospitals to collect her infected residents. They refused. Sometimes she was told to administer morphine and let death come. Once she was told to pray.\n\nThen, in the early morning of April 10, it all got worse.\n\nFirst, a resident died at 1:20 a.m. Three hours later, another died. At 5:30 a.m., still another. The night nurse had long since given up calling ambulances.\n\nMs. Doyen arrived after dawn and discovered Addolorata Balducci, 89, in distress from Covid-19. Ms. Balducci's son, Franco Pacchioli, demanded that paramedics be called and begged them to take his mother to the hospital. Instead, they gave her morphine.\n\n\"Your mother will die,\" the paramedics responded, Mr. Pacchioli recalled. \"That's it.\"\n\nThe paramedics left. Eight hours later, Ms. Balducci died.\n\nRunaway coronavirus infections, medical gear shortages and government inattention are woefully familiar stories in nursing homes around the globe. But Belgium's response offers a gruesome twist: Paramedics and hospitals sometimes flatly denied care to elderly people, even as hospital beds sat unused.\n\nWeeks earlier, the virus had overwhelmed hospitals in Italy. Determined to prevent that from happening in Belgium, the authorities shunned and all but ignored nursing homes. But while Italian doctors said they were forced to ration care to the elderly because of shortages of space and equipment, Belgium's hospital system never came under similar strain.\n\nEven at the height of the outbreak in April, when Ms. Balducci was turned away, intensive-care beds were no more than about 55 percent full.\n\n\"They wouldn't accept old people,\" Ms. Doyen said. \"They had space, and they didn't want them.\"\n\nBelgium now has, by some measures, the world's highest coronavirus death rate, in part because of nursing homes. More than 5,700 nursing-home residents have died, according to newly published data. During the peak of the crisis, from March through mid-May, residents accounted for two out of every three coronavirus deaths.\n\nOf all the missteps by governments during the coronavirus pandemic, few have had such an immediate and devastating impact as the failure to protect nursing homes. Tens of thousands of older people died -- casualties not only of the virus, but of more than a decade of ignored warnings that nursing homes were vulnerable.\n\nPublic health officials around the world excluded nursing homes from their pandemic preparedness plans and omitted residents from the mathematical models used to guide their responses.\n\nIn recent months, the coronavirus outbreak in the United States has dominated global attention, as the world's richest nation blundered its way into the world's largest death toll. Some 40 percent of those fatalities have been linked to long-term-care facilities. But even now, European countries lead the world in per capita deaths, in part because of what happened inside their nursing homes.\n\nSpanish prosecutors are investigating cases in which residents were abandoned to die. In Sweden, overwhelmed emergency doctors have acknowledged turning away elderly patients.\n\nIn Britain, the government ordered thousands of older hospital patients -- including some with Covid-19 -- sent back to nursing homes to make room for an expected crush of virus cases. (Similar policies were in effect in some American states.)\n\nBut by fixating on saving their hospitals, European leaders sometimes left nursing-home residents and staff to fend for themselves.\n\n\"We thought about it, and we said, 'Care homes are important,'\" Matt Keeling, a British emergency adviser, testified recently. \"We thought they were being shielded, and we probably thought that was enough.\"\n\nIt wasn't. Only about a third of European nursing homes had infectious-disease teams before the Covid-19 pandemic. Most lacked in-house doctors and many had no arrangements with outside physicians to coordinate care.\n\nFew countries embody this lethally ineffective pandemic response more than Belgium, where government officials excluded nursing-home patients from the testing policy until thousands were already dead. Nursing homes were left waiting for proper masks and gowns. When masks did arrive from the government, they came late and were sometimes defective.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-08T07:02:16.850Z As the U.S. relief talks falter again, Trump says he is prepared to act on his own. Cuomo says N.Y. schools can reopen in-person but leaves it up to districts to determine if, when and how. Thousands of cases went unreported in California when a computer server failed. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"Tape the masks to the bridge of your nose,\" regional health officials advised in one email.\n\nOne nursing-home executive, bereft of options, ordered thousands of ponchos after seeing animal-keepers wearing them in a countryside zoo. Another home managed to get 5,000 masks from a staff member's father in Vietnam. The precious cargo arrived through the embassy's diplomatic pouch.\n\nBelgian officials say denying care for the elderly was never their policy. But in the absence of a national strategy, and with regional officials bickering about who was in charge, officials now acknowledge that some hospitals and emergency responders relied on vague advice and guidelines to do just that.\n\nThe situation was so dire that the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res dispatched teams of experts more accustomed to working in war-hardened countries. On March 25, when a team arrived at Val des Fleurs, a public nursing home a few miles from European Union headquarters, they were greeted by the stale smell of disinfectant and an eerie stillness, pierced only by the song of a caged canary.\n\nSeventeen people had died there in the past 10 days. There was no protective equipment. Oxygen was running low. Half the staff was infected. Others showed signs of trauma common in disaster zones, a psychologist from the medical charity concluded.\n\nThe director and her deputy were sick with Covid-19, and the acting chief collapsed in a chair, crying, as soon as the team met her.\n\n\"I never thought I would work with M.S.F. in my own country. That's crazy. We are a rich country,\" said Marine Tondeur, a Belgian nurse who has worked in South Sudan and Haiti.\n\nMs. Tondeur was horrified at her country's response.\n\n\"I feel a bit ashamed, actually, that we forgot those homes.\"\n\n'Firefighters in Pajamas'\n\nIn February, as the coronavirus was taking root in northern Italy, Belgian officials expressed little alarm. Maggie De Block, Belgium's federal health minister, spent the month playing down the risk. She saw no need to worry about hospital capacity or testing capabilities.\n\n\"It isn't a very aggressive virus. You would have to sneeze in someone's face to pass it on,\" she said on March 3, adding, \"If the temperature rises, it will probably disappear.\"\n\nEven after the World Health Organization highlighted the importance of creating plans to protect nursing homes, a spokesman for the health authority in Belgium's Dutch-speaking region said there was no reason to worry.\n\n\"The risk of infection is very small for now,\" he said.\n\nYet the warning signs were there. Belgium has one of the world's largest nursing-home populations per capita, and years of research has shown that respiratory illnesses like Covid-19 are among the most common diseases in such facilities. Data from China demonstrated that the elderly were most at risk from Covid-19.\n\nGovernment reports as far back as 2006 had called for infectious-disease training for nursing-home doctors and public help to stockpile protective equipment. A separate report in 2009 recommended adding nursing homes to the national pandemic plan. Both proposals went nowhere.\n\nSo, at the beginning of March, nursing homes were effectively on their own. Belgium's internal risk-assessment documents did not even mention nursing homes among the top concerns.\n\n\"We have received no specific recommendations from the ministers,\" the nursing-home association Femarbel wrote to its members.\n\nNursing homes around the world operate at the seams of local, regional and national oversight, but Belgium magnifies that problem. Divided by language and perpetually difficult to govern, Belgium has so many layers of bureaucracy that it is sometimes referred to as an administrative lasagna.\n\nThe country has not one but nine health ministers, who answer to six parliaments. The federal government takes a coordinating role in a pandemic, but nursing homes are the purview of regional authorities.\n\nSo even when officials realized the threat posed by Covid-19, they could not act decisively.\n\n\"We needed several weeks to figure out who was responsible,\" Pedro Facon, a top federal health official, testified this month.\n\nBy the middle of March, with the coronavirus spreading rapidly, regional governments offered nursing homes advice -- yet it was unhelpful on key points. Government documents stressed the importance of masks, while simultaneously declaring them all but unavailable.\n\n\"There are virtually no masks available on the market,\" one document said. Caregivers were advised to reuse masks, withhold them from administrative staff members, and scrounge for gear from nearby hospitals.\n\nAnd scrounge they did. At the Christalain home, Steve Doyen -- the co-owner and Ms. Doyen's brother -- said he found a handful of gowns and goggles through a friend who liked dressing up as a doctor for Halloween.\n\nWorsening the problem, Belgium was unable to test even a fraction of those infected. So the health authorities decided to test severely ill, hospitalized patients. Everyone else was told to recover at home.\n\nThat meant leaving contagious people inside crowded, understaffed, underequipped nursing homes.\n\n\"We got the impression quite early on that we would take the back seat,\" said Lesley Moreels, the director of a public nursing home in Brussels. \"We felt that we were going to be firefighters in pajamas.\"\n\nTest, Return, Infect\n\nBelgium went into lockdown on March 18. Dozens of nursing-home residents had already died. Three days later, Jacqueline Van Peteghem, a 91-year-old resident at the Christalain home, was sent to UZ Brussel, a nearby hospital, where she was tested for Covid-19. Within days, her test came back positive.\n\nShirley and Steve Doyen assumed Ms. Van Peteghem would remain hospitalized for treatment and to prevent the disease from spreading to scores of other residents. But her symptoms had stabilized, and Mr. Doyen said that a hospital doctor declared her healthy enough to return home.\n\nSo, on March 27, paramedics in hazmat suits delivered Ms. Van Peteghem, on a stretcher, to the door of Christalain.\n\nMr. Doyen greeted them wearing a surgical mask.\n\n\"Is this mask all you have?\" the paramedics asked, Mr. Doyen recalled.\n\n\"Yes,\" he said.\n\n\"Good luck,\" they responded.\n\nFor the next hour, Christalain staff members watched as the paramedics decontaminated themselves and their ambulance. Asked later about the hospital's policies, the chief executive, Prof. Marc Noppen, said infectious patients were not normally returned to nursing homes but that it may have happened in some cases.\n\nNo one can be certain if Ms. Van Peteghem's return was the reason, but Covid-19 infections in the home increased. Residents began dying. Ms. Van Peteghem, who initially survived the virus, died last month.\n\nThe Belgian authorities were aware of such problems, according to internal documents. \"Some patients have returned from the hospital infected,\" a government emergency committee wrote on March 25. \"Several hot spots have been caused this way.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nThe committee recommended testing nursing-home residents and establishing locations to house Covid-19 patients who would otherwise be returned to homes.\n\nBut national and regional authorities could not agree on those recommendations, and the country remained a hodgepodge of policies.\n\nFor another two weeks, even as the government expanded its testing capability, health advisers resisted adding nursing homes to the national testing priority list. They worried that even the newfound capacity would be unable to meet the demand under the broadened criteria, according to documents and government officials.\n\n\"The federal government had tests. Hospitals had tests,\" said Dr. Emmanuel Andr\u00e9, a virologist who was tapped as a top government adviser and who advocated for broader federal testing. \"But nursing homes? There were no tests allowed.\"\n\nAs a stopgap measure, Philippe De Backer, a minister who had been tapped to expand testing, pushed out an initial batch of nursing-home tests in early April. But he and others wanted residents formally added to the testing priority list. Support for that change finally coalesced on April 8. Mr. De Backer dialed into a conference call of the government's risk-management group -- one of many committees that set policy in Belgium.\n\n\"You can stop debating,\" he said. \"We're testing in care homes.\"\n\nWhen the first results were announced, one in five residents tested positive. By then, more than 2,000 residents had already died.\n\nAs the testing debate unfolded in late March and early April, hospitals quietly stopped taking infected patients from nursing homes.\n\nThe policy -- officially it was just advice -- took shape in a series of memos from Belgian geriatric specialists.\n\n\"Unnecessary transfers are a risk for ambulance workers and emergency rooms,\" read an early memo, signed by the Belgian Society for Gerontology and Geriatrics and two major hospitals.\n\nExtremely frail patients and the terminally ill should receive palliative care and not be hospitalized, the memo said. The document offered a complex flowchart for deciding when to hospitalize nursing-home residents.\n\nThe gerontology society says that its advice -- drafted in case of an overwhelmed hospital system -- was misunderstood. The society is not a government agency, doctors there note, and it never intended to deny hospital care for the elderly.\n\nBut that is what happened.\n\nDo Not Admit\n\nOn the morning of April 9, Dr. Andr\u00e9, the government adviser, was preparing for the daily news briefing when one question, submitted in advance by a journalist, caught him by surprise: Would nursing-home residents soon be allowed to go to the hospital?\n\n\"Why is this question coming?\" Dr. Andr\u00e9 remembers thinking. \"Yes, of course they can.\"\n\nBut time and again, nursing-home residents with Covid-19 symptoms were denied hospitalization, even when referred by doctors who had assessed that they might recover.\n\n\"The decision not to accept residents in hospitals really shocked me,\" said Michel Hanset, a doctor in Brussels who tried in vain to admit several nursing-home patients.\n\nNo data exists on how often this happened, but M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res says about 30 percent of the homes it worked in during its deployment reported this problem.\n\nGovernment figures are also telling. During the first weeks of the crisis, nearly two thirds of nursing-home residents' deaths occurred in hospitals. But as the crisis worsened, and the geriatric memos began circulating, that number plummeted.\n\nAt the peak of the outbreak, a mere 14 percent of gravely ill residents made it to hospitals. The rest died in their nursing homes, according to government data compiled by Belgian scientists and released to The New York Times.\n\nIt is impossible to know how many deaths were preventable. But hospitals always had space. Even at the peak of the pandemic, 1,100 of the nation's 2,400 intensive care beds were free, according to Niel Hens, a government adviser and University of Antwerp professor.\n\n\"Paramedics had been instructed by their referral hospital not to take patients over a certain age, often 75 but sometimes as low as 65,\" M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res said in a July report.\n\nSome senior regional and national officials acknowledge this problem.\n\n\"I heard from staff in care homes that emergency doctors were arriving, taking residents and then they were sending them back to care homes, saying they could not keep them in the hospital,\" Christie Morreale, the top health official in Wallonia, Belgium's French-speaking region, said in an interview.\n\nMs. De Block, the national health minister, declined to be interviewed and did not respond to written questions. In interviews, senior hospital doctors defended their policies. They said that nursing-home staff sought hospital care for terminally ill patients who needed to be comforted into death, not dragged to the hospital.\n\nIf nursing-home residents were denied admission, they say, it was because a doctor determined that they were unlikely to survive.\n\n\"If you think medical treatment is of benefit for that patient, he or she will be hospitalized,\" said Professor Noppen, the UZ Brussel executive. \"It's as simple as that.\"\n\nNursing-home administrators are adamant that was not the case.\n\n\"At a certain point, there was an implicit age limit,\" said Marijke Verboven of Orpea group, which owns 60 homes around Belgium.\n\nMr. Moreels, whose nursing home, Val des Roses, also had an intervention from a M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res team, agreed. \"The ambulance wouldn't take them,\" he said. \"There was no detailed consultation. They just said 'Why did you even call us?'\"\n\nThe Brussels ambulance service denied any policy of refusing to take nursing-home residents to the hospital. Yet even some doctors are skeptical.\n\n\"We learned that people from care homes believed it was not even worth calling an ambulance,\" said Dr. Charlotte Martin, the chief epidemiologist at Saint-Pierre Hospital in central Brussels. \"They should have been the first ones to get in the pipeline. And instead they were just forgotten.\"\n\nAt the Christalain home, activities resumed this summer and life inched toward something resembling normal. But a shadow remains: 14 residents have been confirmed to have died of Covid-19. Another, devastated and confused from the quarantine, killed herself in April.\n\nMr. Pacchioli, whose mother died after being refused hospitalization, is haunted by a question. \"Maybe it wasn't too late,\" he said. \"If she had gone to the hospital, maybe she would have survived.\"\n\nThe M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res teams concluded their nursing-home missions in Belgium in mid-June. Some members returned to developing countries. Others now work in another rich nation in crisis: the United States.\n\nToday, Ms. De Block, Belgium's national health minister, speaks about the nursing homes as if they were an unfortunate footnote in a story of a successful government response. She notes with pride that Belgium never ran out of hospital beds.\n\n\"We took measures at the right moment,\" she said in an interview, adding, \"We can be proud.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by David Kirkpatrick and Selam Gebrekidan in London, Julia Echikson and Koba Ryckewaert in Brussels, and Christina Anderson in Stockholm.",

        "body": "Workplaces have grown steadily less friendly to older employees, and the pandemic has pushed more of these workers from the labor market.\n\nJoey Himelfarb estimates that in his 25 years in sales, hawking everything from Hewlett-Packard computers to cars and swimming pools, he has been laid off or downsized at least a half-dozen times.\n\nThe most recent occasion came in April, when he got a call from the chief executive officer of the start-up in northern Virginia that had hired him 10 months earlier. The company sells systems that extract data from video. Mr. Himelfarb worked remotely from his apartment in Belle Mead, N.J. \"I was working my tail off,\" he said. \"We were busy.\"\n\nBut now, the boss told him, because of the coronavirus pandemic, the company could no longer afford his mid-five-figure salary.\n\nYou will never meet a more relentlessly upbeat job-seeker. \"I'm good at landing on my feet,\" Mr. Himelfarb said. \"I'm good at networking.\" His business card reads, \"Positive Beats Negative Every Day.\"\n\nBut Mr. Himelfarb, 61, has never been unemployed for this long. He managed financially as long the federal relief program supplemented his $346 weekly unemployment check with an additional $600. That extra support has ended, forcing him to dip into his savings.\n\nEconomists who study the employment and retirement of older Americans are worried about people like him. Once, older workers benefited from a so-called experience premium: Because of their years on the job, they earned more than younger employees and were less likely to be laid off during downturns. But \"the premium has been shrinking over time,\" said Richard Johnson, an economist at the Urban Institute who studies employment and retirement among older adults.\n\nWorkplaces have grown steadily less friendly to older workers, who lost bargaining power as unions weakened, the gig economy arose and age-discrimination laws remained laxly enforced.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T14:17:02.142Z 'We are incredibly concerned': A group of local health departments urges the C.D.C. to pull its new guidance on testing. For many schools in the U.S., returning to the classroom means a stop in the courtroom. Trump promises a vaccine by the end of the year, and boasts of his pandemic response. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nEven before the pandemic, the position of this group had become precarious. An Urban Institute study that followed about 2,000 older workers from 1992 to 2016 found that about half suffered involuntary job separations, despite the sample having stable full-time employment and higher education levels than most adults in their 50s and above.\n\nThe coronavirus and the resulting recession have intensified their job insecurity, said Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist at the New School. \"It accelerated the trend toward involuntary retirement -- a polite way of saying 'being pushed out of the labor market.'\"\n\nThe New School's Retirement Equity Lab reported in early August that 2.9 million workers ages 55 to 70 had left the labor market since March -- meaning that they were neither working nor actively job-hunting -- and projected that another 1.1 million might do so by November. \"They're exiting the labor force at twice the rate they were during the Great Recession\" of 2007 to 2009, Dr. Ghilarducci said.\n\nIn July, more than 9 percent of workers over age 65 were unemployed, according to an Urban Institute analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Using a broader definition, including those employed part time who would prefer full-time positions and those not working for other reasons, the proportion rises to 16.5 percent -- a sharp decline from the spring, but still a sobering number.\n\nUnemployment rose higher still for older women, Black and Latino workers, and those without college degrees, Dr. Johnson found. \"In good times and bad, unemployment is always higher for people of color and people with lower education,\" he said. Such disparities \"become even more pronounced during a recession.\"\n\nResearchers can't yet say what role health concerns have played in the displacement of older workers. Only about a third can work from home, Dr. Ghilarducci said, so fears of contracting the coronavirus at workplaces may prevent some from returning to work. It's more likely, she said, that employers are quicker to rehire younger people, who they think will cost less in health benefits and stay on the job longer.\n\nIndustries where older workers have been hardest hit include construction, manufacturing, transportation and warehousing, education and other nonprofessional services, the Urban Institute found. In leisure and hospitality, more than a third of workers over 55 lost their jobs.\n\nAmong them is Becky Schaffner, 64, who had worked at the Omaha Marriott since the hotel opened 39 years ago, most recently as an administrative assistant in sales, making $16 an hour. \"I loved my job,\" she said. \"Talking to people from all over. Taking care of their needs.\"\n\nMs. Schaffner was furloughed along with most of her co-workers in mid-March, then laid off in July. Now that the $600 federal supplement has ended, her unemployment comes to $338 weekly, making it hard to cover the mortgage on her Fremont, Neb., home.\n\nA knitter and needlewoman, Ms. Schaffner has for years held a part-time job at Michaels, the crafts chain. Working there boosts her morale, she said, but every dollar she earns is deducted from her unemployment.\n\nSeveral weeks spent submitting online applications have so far yielded three or four no-thanks form letters and one interview that seemed to go well, but the employer hired someone else. \"It takes the air out of your balloon,\" Ms. Schaffner said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nJob losses at older ages, when there is less time to recover, can cause financial damage that ripples into later life. It takes older workers longer to get rehired, for instance. During the Great Recession, Dr. Johnson has reported, only 41 percent of laid-off workers over age 62 found employment within 18 months, compared with 78 percent of those ages 25 to 49.\n\nAfter involuntary job separations, only one in 10 older workers ever earned as much again; at age 65, their median household income was 14 percent lower than for those who were not pushed out.\n\nSuch patterns have economists predicting downward mobility for the middle class. Lower-income groups have always struggled in retirement and rely on Social Security, Dr. Ghilarducci noted. But if they endure protracted unemployment or involuntary retirement, \"it's middle-class older workers who will draw down their nest eggs,\" years before they had planned.\n\nThey may tap Social Security early, permanently reducing their benefits. \"They also have access to credit and can take a second mortgage or max out a credit card and go into debt,\" she added.\n\nShe and other economists have urged Congress to again raise unemployment benefits to keep older workers from falling into poverty. Congress could also pass legislation making age discrimination suits easier to win, after a 2009 Supreme Court decision made it more difficult.\n\nOther remedies like increased Social Security benefits and a lowered Medicare age, though helpful, could prove difficult to fund; both programs already need financial reinforcement.\n\nBut many older workers already face tough decisions. Ms. Schaffner has scant retirement savings, after a divorce, children's medical bills and unexpected auto expenses. She had intended to work until 70, to receive the maximum in Social Security benefits and to rebuild her savings.\n\nThat is still her plan, but if unemployment stretches on, she said, she might look into taking Social Security before her full retirement age.\n\nMr. Himelfarb, on the other hand, enjoys working so much that he never wants to retire. As he networks, he maintains his innate optimism by running, swimming and watching reruns of \"Frasier.\" He has started a side business to coach others through transitions.\n\n\"I don't know what the universe has in store for me,\" he said. \"I just know it's good. Annie was right: The sun will come out tomorrow.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "body": "BERLIN -- The news that children in Berlin would return to classrooms last spring caught me and my husband by surprise. Like parents across the world, we were very concerned about anyone in our family getting or spreading the coronavirus.\n\nWe knew people who had secretly organized play dates and flouted the rules during the months we were supposed to be isolating, but we had followed the rules scrupulously. We wore masks, kept our distance from our parents, and even, when playgrounds reopened on April 30, resisted returning to them, despite our younger son's pleas.\n\nAt first, we were surprised by the authorities' insistence that children return to school. I tried to read as much as I could to help me stay calm. When I learned about a leading group of German pediatricians who supported the idea of children, especially young ones, returning to school, largely for their mental well-being, I was persuaded. I could tell that my sons, Hugo, 8, and Bruno, 3, were suffering in many small ways from the lack of contact with other kids and from the insularity of our new way of life.\n\nThe Berlin Senate stipulated that schools could only allow children to return with very strict hygiene and social distancing measures in place. Each school, however, was responsible for implementing its own safety rules as long as they aligned with the Senate's guidelines. At that time, there had been about 5,400 Covid-19 infections in Berlin and 112 deaths.\n\nIn our son's school, the administration divided each elementary class in half, then assigned each group a single teacher. The administration enlisted faculty from other parts of the school, like librarians and vice principals, to replace teachers who were considered high-risk and were not required to return to the classroom.\n\nThe groups of students entered school at staggered times, sat alone instead of in pairs, and were taught only two core subjects, math and language arts. The children were not allowed to have recess, break for a snack or eat lunch in the cafeteria. Masks were not mandated.\n\nBecause of the complexity of the scheduling, the safety requirements, the many missing teachers and the limited availability of classrooms, my oldest son was only in school physically for a week in May and a week in June, for three hours each day. The remaining time, he was at home remote learning.\n\nThe new rules at day cares, which are called KiTas for Kindertagesst\u00e4tten in German, were less stringent than at school. Child psychologists recommended that KiTa caregivers not wear masks. Parents were no longer allowed inside and children were dropped off and picked-up at the front door.\n\nHugo, who was in second grade, was very anxious about returning to school, fearing that he would get us or his grandparents sick. We swallowed our misgivings and told him that we trusted the school's decisions and that neither the school nor we would knowingly put him in harm's way.\n\nAfter only a couple days in the classroom, we could see how being back at school physically helped Hugo enormously. Spending time with his teacher and being around his classmates was clearly important to his mental well-being. The semblance of normalcy mitigated his fears of the virus and improved his at-home learning, too.\n\nSeeing him blossom after months of isolation helped me relax. We soon started organizing play dates for him again. Bruno, too young to be scared by an invisible virus, was just thrilled to return to KiTa.\n\nThe return to some aspects of our old lives felt so good and also essential for our mental health as parents. It was lovely to see our children in their old environments, connecting with other children, and being loved and cared for by other people again.\n\nThe Coronavirus OutbreakBack to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 7, 2020\n\nThe latest highlights as the first students return to U.S. schools.\n\nSchools are open in parts of the country -- and some are already closing again. What's it like for students to return to classrooms in the age of Covid-19? We asked them.Photos of crowded high school hallways evoked outrage on social media. The student who took them says she was suspended.Should 5-year-olds start kindergarten this year? Our Parenting team looks at the options.Teachers, show us your classrooms! We want to see how educators are preparing to keep themselves and students safe if their schools open this fall.\n\nBut by the end of the second week of KiTa, Bruno came home with a fever and a runny nose, symptoms that quickly spread to our older son and then my husband. I spent 48 hours very worried that we'd all been exposed to the coronavirus and went around our apartment rubbing disinfectant wipes on door knobs and surfaces. Those fears turned out to be unfounded, but they lurk in the back of my mind constantly.\n\nMost schools in Berlin resume on Monday. After a quiet summer, infections have started rising again in Germany and the health authorities have made appeals to the public to stay vigilant. As of Wednesday, there were 9,399 coronavirus cases and 223 total deaths in Berlin.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Senate published their latest guidelines that require schools to return to regular operations, including instruction in all subjects, as well as extracurricular activities, without the requirement of social distancing. For now, the hygiene rules stipulate masks, regular ventilation and hand-washing, as well as the avoidance of body contact. Schools are being asked to come up with creative outdoor solutions for certain, subjects like music and drama. All employees of schools and KiTas can be tested for the virus for free, even without symptoms.\n\nMy husband and I, like many other parents, are concerned that it will just be a matter of time before our schools are forced to close, either partially or completely. The responsibility for closing a school lies with the local health authority of the city district, not with the school administration.\n\nWe feel lucky to live in a country where the virus has been taken seriously by most and where the social safety net is strong. Our medical system is well-prepared. However, we're surprised that the educational authorities didn't seem to use the summer to prepare for the inevitable return of the virus and that families are being thrown into an unnecessary state of uncertainty so shortly before the start of school. We know we are still far away from a normal life, especially with regard to our children's education.\n\nLuisa Weiss is a writer and freelance translator and editor living in Berlin.

        "body": "Everyone is stressed and anxious now. We have to find and help the children who are hurting most.\n\nLast week, to write about the risks of summer -- the recurring safety issues of children being out in the sun, or near the water, I talked to safety-minded pediatric emergency room doctors about what was worrying them, as they thought about the children they might be seeing during their shifts over the coming weeks, and I specified that I wasn't asking about Covid-19 infection -- I was asking about other dangers to children, in this summer shadowed by that virus.\n\nBut among their concerns about drownings and fractures, the emergency room doctors kept bringing up mental health as a worry. At a time when we are all definitely not safe and not OK, we have to find and help the children who are hurting most.\n\nDr. Maneesha Agarwal, a pediatric emergency physician and assistant professor at Emory in Atlanta, said that although the lockdown and social distancing have been hard on children, \"we initially saw a lull in children coming in with mental health problems.\" There was less bullying, because school and social interactions had stopped, and children were being supported by their families.\n\nBut she was concerned that returning to school could bring a new wave of bullying, particularly around pandemic-related issues, whether because of lockdown-related weight gain, or because of changes in family circumstances, with parents losing jobs and families more stressed.\n\nDr. Maya Haasz, an attending physician in the pediatric emergency room at Children's Hospital Colorado and an assistant professor at University of Colorado School of Medicine, brought up the vulnerability of children who already had mental health concerns, especially depression and anxiety, and emphasized the need for parents to ask children about their moods, mental health and low moments.\n\n\"Our whole society is stressed,\" said Dr. Sarah Vinson, an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Morehouse School of Medicine. She said that for some children, \"school was their refuge,\" and being home was a deprivation, while, \"for other kids, school was where all their stress was held, they're much happier to be at home.\" Now, those children may be headed back to school, facing old anxieties, as well as all the new stresses of school during the pandemic.\n\n[Sign up for the Well Family newsletter]\n\nDr. Adiaha Spinks-Franklin, a developmental behavioral pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital and an associate professor at Baylor, said, \"parents are reporting an increase in anxiety levels for children who were already kind of anxious in their temperament, and kids who previously had not had anxiety have developed anxious behaviors.\" Some parents are reporting their children have germ fears, she said, or fears of other people, or obsessions with following the pandemic news. She's seeing more issues with sleep, she said, and more symptoms of depression, usually connected to social isolation.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-10T09:22:05.016Z As U.S. schools reopen, a study finds at least 97,000 children were recently infected. The F.D.A chief is caught between scientists and the president. In a visit to Taiwan, a top U.S. official praises the island's response to the pandemic. See more updates More live coverage:\n\nNadine Kaslow, a professor of psychiatry at Emory School of Medicine, said, \"I'm concerned we're going to have a generation of compulsive hand-washers, scared of people, anxious and depressed.\" There's a lot more tension in many homes, she said, with parents trying to juggle multiple responsibilities, and children may be witnessing conflict between their parents.\n\nParents need to help children talk about their feelings, Dr. Kaslow said. Some parents of younger children find it helpful to use feelings charts, available on the internet. If kids consistently can't point to things they enjoy, think about looking for additional help.\n\nDr. Spinks-Franklin suggested a free downloadable ebook about coronavirus for children, put out in collaboration with the American Psychological Association. \"I actually read that with one of my patients through our online call,\" she said. \"She was just so anxious about coronavirus and we read the book together.\" Afterward, she said, \"she was able to articulate how much she learned from the book and what she can do and what her family can do to keep them safe.\"\n\nIf you're worried about your child, you may need some guidance in finding help in this changing landscape of remote therapy and tele-mental health. \"Often I'll tell people to start with their pediatrician, they often have a sense of what's available, and recommendations around mental health providers,\" Dr. Vinson said. \"Insurance companies have really lowered barriers around providing tele-mental health services,\" she said.\n\nThe summer may be a good time to look for a therapist if a child is struggling; as the school year picks up, schedules may fill. Talk to your child's primary care provider, talk to the school, consider reconnecting with a counselor or therapist who has seen your child before. If your child is already taking a medication -- for anxiety, for attentional issues, for depression -- talk to the doctor who prescribed it to see if an adjustment is indicated.\n\nRemote mental health may be harder with young children, Dr. Kaslow said, though many therapists are finding ways to be really creative, asking children to show their favorite toys and how they play with them, and to talk about their home environments and how they're feeling.\n\nDr. Vinson said that for many children with mental health problems, symptoms have gotten more severe. \"If they were anxious, they're more anxious, if they were depressed, it's harder, if it's schizophrenia, the voices went up.\" Her own work as a child and adolescent psychiatrist has increased, she said, with children needing more help during the pandemic.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\n\"Parents need to take their children seriously,\" Dr. Spinks-Franklin said. \"This is a very stressful time for adults and children, and we don't want to disregard it when a child tells us how stressed they are, how worried they are.\"\n\nCindy Liu, an assistant professor of pediatric newborn medicine and psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the director of the developmental risk and cultural resilience program, said that in a setting in which we are all now accustomed to thinking of the risks of viral infection, it's important to consider \"stress contagion\" and the risks to those who are most vulnerable, and to families at higher risk because of structural racism and socioeconomic disparities.\n\n\"Stress in families can be quite contagious as well,\" Dr. Liu said. Quarantined together, she said, children are exposed to parental stress, but also get to witness \"how parents cope and regulate their stress.\" And racial minorities may have less access to mental health services, she said, and to other supports to help parents cope themselves, and help their children through.\n\nDr. Kaslow, past president of the American Psychological Association, said that amid all the stresses of the pandemic, there have been positive experiences for many children, with strong family bonds and unusual amounts of time together. \"Be sure the balance of your interactions with your children are about love, positive nurturance and fun,\" she said. Even with the responsibilities of overseeing remote learning, she said, \"loving warm interactions need to take precedence\" over struggling with them about behavior, or about schoolwork. \"When children feel connected, they're going to learn better, do better, stay on track,\" she said.\n\n\"Having a kid struggling right now in no way means you're not a good parent,\" Dr. Kaslow said. \"It's not a reflection on your love for them -- it's an unprecedented time.\"\n\nDr. Vinson said she is encouraging families \"not to take for granted the things that sound simple -- sleep, movement. I talk to all my families about movement, exercise, nutrition, and really protecting those things, because you need your brain at its best while you're dealing with all this stress right now.\"\n\nDr. Perri Klass is the author of the forthcoming book \"A Good Time to Be Born: How Science and Public Health Gave Children a Future,\" on how our world has been transformed by the radical decline of infant and child mortality.",

        "body": "Monica Clark, a lawyer who penned a novel about love without \"struggle,\" found that her real life love story with William Jones, a TV reporter in Chicago, followed suit.\n\nWilliam Ryan Jones had some time to kill before attending a party at the Cameroon Embassy in Washington, so he asked Monica Marie Clark if he could tag along with her to her friend's birthday party.\n\nMr. Jones and Ms. Clark had crossed paths before at mutual friends' gatherings, but this time, they were both single. Mr. Jones, 36, a television reporter at WLS-TV in Chicago, had traveled to town in the summer of 2018 for the embassy party. That morning he found himself, thanks to friends, seated at a brunch next to Ms. Clark, 36, then a senior counsel in the legal division of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nMr. Jones, Ms. Clark and her friends moved on to Marvin, a bistro in Washington's U Street corridor. The evening was sultry, but they found an oasis on the bar's rooftop, where the drinks flowed and the DJ spun '90s R&B. \"I was talking about my relationship philosophy,\" Mr. Jones said. \"When two people come together, you should become your better selves. I think we should support each other. As I was talking, Monica's eyes just changed. You know how in sitcoms, someone is in love and the music starts to play? It's kind of corny, but I saw my future.\"\n\nMs. Clark, a graduate of Harvard and Georgetown Law who grew up in Jamaica Estates, Queens, also felt a special connection. She recognized in Mr. Jones the same values of ambition and duty with which her parents had raised her and her older brother. \"I feel a responsibility to achieve something because I grew up in a privileged household and I'm a Black person,\" she said. \"I agreed with everything he was saying. I had never had that experience before.\"\n\nThey did not kiss that evening, but Mr. Jones returned to Washington the next week for a proper first date. \"I wanted to see if it was the alcohol or if this is my life,\" he said. While they ate hamburgers at a restaurant on the Potomac, their server pointed out some other patrons trying to get Mr. Jones's attention -- they recognized him from his reporting job in Chicago. \"I planned that,\" Mr. Jones said, jokingly.\n\nMs. Clark had noticed during their earlier interactions that Mr. Jones had a nice speaking voice, but during the bottomless mimosa brunch, she was also drawn to his smile and his understated style. \"He's reflective, he's got his stuff together,\" she said, \"and he had nice style.\"\n\nIt was the type of love story that Ms. Clark had always been drawn to. She is a fan of classic Black romantic movies like \"Love Jones\" and \"Brown Sugar\" from the late 1990s and early 2000s. She'd even written her own unpublished romance manuscript, \"Lessons From Robin,\" chosen as a Marlene Award Finalist by Washington Romance Writers in 2014. \"There aren't that many stories out there with Black characters that are just a love story that aren't a struggle,\" she said. \"Whenever I saw one, it fed your soul, this is so great, a love story. I wanted to create one.\"\n\n[Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.]\n\nShe and Mr. Jones began a long-distance relationship, showing off their respective towns and getting to know each other. They shared similar backgrounds. Mr. Jones received his degree in journalism from Northwestern, while Ms. Clark wrote a column for the Harvard Crimson in college. Both had been raised by loving, long-married parents with high expectations for their children. Ms. Clark is the daughter of Dr. Luther Clark, a cardiologist and deputy chief patient officer at Merck, and Camille Clark, who retired as assistant executive director of Forestdale, a child welfare agency in Queens.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-04T08:32:47.649Z President Trump's vaccine chief sees a 'very, very low chance' of a vaccine by Election Day. Hydroxychloroquine prescriptions soar on President Trump's say-so. The virus is surging at U.S. colleges, where more than 51,000 cases have been identified so far. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"I think a lot of people's parents were like, 'Get good grades,'\" Ms. Clark said. \"My parents cared about that, but they were very strategic: 'You need to run for office, get a leadership role on the newspaper.' Me and my brother, having parents who were very focused on the college process, it motivated us.\" She now serves as the vice president of the Harvard Black Alumni Society.\n\nMr. Jones, his older brother and younger sister were raised in Forest Park, a Cincinnati suburb, the son of Will Jones, a retired Cincinnati Fire Department firefighter, and Marlinda Jones, a retired AT&T project manager. In 2012, Mr. Jones won an Emmy for his work with the Detroit station WDIV covering an immigrant advocacy nonprofit organization that he had volunteered with. He now chairs the scholarship committee for the Chicago chapter of the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nMr. Jones said that he wanted \"to be with someone who is trying to be their best, whatever that may be. If someone's ambitious, it shows they're not someone who is just going to settle in life.\"\n\nBut as Ms. Clark said she has found out that \"not everybody wants an accomplished woman. With Will, he actually appreciated that about me.\"\n\nAbout a year and a half after their first date, Mr. Jones wanted to propose with a grand gesture, and started with a phone call to Dr. Clark to state his intentions. \"I have a younger sister; I knew if my sister would move out of Cincinnati for a relationship, there would have been a lot of drama,\" Mr. Jones said. The two men ended up having a friendly 45-minute conversation.\n\nMr. Jones meticulously planned a proposal on Nov. 2, 2019, scheduling a haircut, a beard shaping and then an Uber to the LondonHouse hotel in Chicago where they would begin their date. He booked a saxophonist and photographer and found a spot near the city's downtown river walk where the artists could look inconspicuous. \"I went to that location probably 10 times,\" he said. \"I practiced getting on one knee. I checked the weather report for the last seven years: 'Is it going to snow or rain?' I knew Monica wouldn't want to get her hair wet.\"\n\nThe couple strolled along the Chicago river walk, and on its steps, Mr. Clark proposed with a 1.8-carat, pear-shaped diamond ring surrounded by a halo of smaller stones purchased in Chicago's Jeweler's Row. Ms. Clark said yes, and they hugged and celebrated while the saxophonist played tunes by Mary J. Blige and K-Ci & JoJo.\n\nMs. Clark found a Chicago job as senior legal counsel at the food and beverage ingredient manufacturer Tate & Lyle in Chicago and moved in with Mr. Jones in a Wicker Park apartment with her cat, Jack. They hung art passed on to them from Ms. Clark's mother, a Harlem Renaissance and African art collector who has donated pieces and books to the Brooklyn Museum and the Museum of Modern Art. The couple began planning their nuptials, excited to show off Chicago to their 150 guests.\n\nThen the coronavirus began to surface. As they inched closer to their scheduled Aug. 8 wedding date, the couple reluctantly canceled their New York engagement, bachelor and bachelorette parties and watched with dread as other friends' weddings were postponed.\n\nOn April 18, while covering a press briefing with Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Mr. Jones asked what he'd advise people considering holding weddings, reunions and other family gatherings over the summer. Ms. Clark watched from home as the governor offered a 73-second response that provided no definitive answer, and no reassurance. \"I saw the writing on the wall,\" Mr. Jones said. \"Days later Monica and I made the decision to postpone our wedding.\"\n\nThey were, of course, disappointed. But the couple decided to move forward with a small wedding and reschedule the larger celebration. \"She didn't stay down for long,\" Mr. Jones said of Ms. Clark. \"She's easy to cheer up. I like that.\"\n\nWhile planning a smaller ceremony, the couple found themselves witnessing another piece of history: On May 31, Mr. Jones was assigned to cover the George Floyd protests in downtown Chicago. He stood on a Loop sidewalk strewn with hangers from a nearby Macy's when a group of four young masked men walked by. Mr. Jones interviewed them for several minutes, gently reminding them to at times avoid using bad language, about why they came out to demonstrate that night. \"What can the police do to improve the relationship with young Black men like yourself?\" he asked.\n\n\"I got it,\" answered one, stepping forward. \"For real. They need to make it so that the police live in the towns and the communities that they're trying to police,\" he said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\n\"It's very important to get your message across,\" said Mr. Jones at the end of the interview. \"You guys did a good job expressing your opinion. I appreciate you all stopping and talking with me tonight.\"\n\nMs. Clark was again watching from home. \"He was in the middle of everything,\" she says of Mr. Jones. \"For him, professionally, that was a cool experience, but at the same time I noticed with him and in general with the George Floyd thing, I think it had a unique impact on Black men. It was a stressful time for them in particular. He also had to deal with his own feelings about the state of America.\"\n\nAside from several just-to-be-sure coronavirus tests, the rest of the summer passed relatively peacefully until the couple found themselves, on Aug. 8, on another city rooftop on another sticky day.\n\nThe couple's parents, Demetrius Davis, the pastor of CityPoint Community Church, (plus two photographers, a reporter and a hotel staffer) gathered on the 17th-floor terrace of Chicago's downtown Kimpton Hotel Palomar, sweating beneath their face masks. Ms. Jones, the mother of the groom, sported one covered in flashing silver sequins. A breeze kicked up at the bride's arrival, lightly ruffling the oversize organza flower pinned to the Vera Wang gown she and her mother found in Chicago. Ms. Jones played DJ, pressing a button on her son's phone, to queue up a jazz cover of John Legend's \"All of Me,\" while the bride, per the hotel's safety requirements, wore a lacy mask crafted by her dry cleaner, and walked down an abbreviated aisle strewn with mauve rose petals.\n\nWhile their parents wiped their eyes, the couple held hands in front of the golden hour Chicago skyline, gazed at each other, and tried to dial down their grins. Pastor Davis read a passage from I Corinthians and in a short blessing prayed for bright days in the couple's future. They hopped over a broom acquired from Etsy to some applause from viewers from a nearby high-rise watching from their balconies.\n\nAfter cake and champagne on the rooftop with their parents but before a 9 p.m. restaurant reservations, the couple video chatted with their siblings and their families.\n\nBefore taking a four-day honeymoon trip to the Traverse City area in Michigan to hike the dunes and visit local wineries, the couple returned to their apartment to enjoy some time off with each other and with Jack, no longer just Ms. Clark's cat. \"It is now our cat,\" Mr. Jones said.\n\nOn This Day\n\nWhen Aug. 8, 2020\n\nWhere Kimpton Hotel Palomar, Chicago\n\nHometown Treats After the rooftop ceremony, the newlyweds cut a two-tier almond cake with buttercream frosting from ECBG Cake Studio in Chicago. \"I don't know if we're allowed to feed each other during the pandemic,\" the bride said. \"We're in the same household,\" the groom pointed out.\n\nIntimate Reception The couple and their parents enjoyed a patio dinner at Aba, a Mediterranean restaurant in Chicago's West Loop. They dined on lamb, shrimp, hummus, as well as homemade stracciatella, a gelato, and frozen Greek yogurt. They also sipped champagne sent to the table as a surprise from friends.\n\nPutting It in Writing The morning of the wedding, the bride and groom wrote each other cards and exchanged gifts -- she gave him a Briggs and Riley duffel, he gave her diamond stud earrings. They also wrote thank you notes to their parents.\n\nContinue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and Instagram.",

        "body": "\"How to Stop the Next Pandemic,\" a Times documentary, reveals how your choices make future pandemics more likely.\n\nThe pandemic is your fault.\n\nYes, yours.\n\nIf you are avoiding people, wearing a mask and generally following what public health officials tell you to do (even if that has been a moving target), the notion that you have anything to do with why this pandemic occurred may seem ridiculous.\n\nAfter all, it's easy to look for blame in others.\n\nYou may be pointing your finger at Chinese officials for not acting fast enough. A recent Pew study suggested 78 percent of Americans place \"a great deal of the blame for the global spread of the coronavirus on the Chinese government's initial handling\" of the outbreak.\n\nMaybe you blame politicians who have prioritized their political well being over the health of the people they govern? Or are other people's diets the problem? A dinner party? A beach party? The police?\n\nThere is enough blame to go around.\n\nFinding blame in yourself can be a more difficult task. But experts say you have played a role whether you know it or not.\n\n\"What we eat, what we wear, all the other kinds of things that we buy, whether we have a cellphone or not, how many children we have (if we have children), how much we travel -- all of those choices put varying degrees of pressure on the rest of the natural world,\" the pandemic-focused author David Quammen told me in a Zoom interview.\n\nIt's that simple. We've created a world where it's impossible to make choices that don't impact the natural world.\n\n\"The more we disrupt wild, diverse ecosystems, the greater jeopardy we have of contacting all of the very diverse viruses that wild animals carry,\" said Mr. Quammen.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-01T08:25:36.896Z As U.S. cases decline elsewhere, the Midwest sees a worrying spike. The virus is spreading much faster in Spain than anywhere else in Europe. Health care workers with Covid-19 may be going undiagnosed, according to a C.D.C. report. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nStill not convinced? Do you own a cellphone?\n\n\"Owning a cellphone makes you a customer for a mineral called coltan,\" Mr. Quammen explained\n\nWhen coltan is refined it makes tantalum. And there's a trace amount of it inside that phone or computer you are using to read this story. Problem is, it's only found in a few remote places.\n\n\"One of which is a highly diverse forest area in the eastern Democratic Republic of The Congo,\" Mr. Quammen continued.\n\n\"So when I buy a cellphone, I'm a customer for tantalum and I'm sending a miner into a forest area in eastern Congo. And that miner is probably going to eat bushmeat. So I own a little of the responsibility for the jeopardy that that miner may come in contact with a new virus and spread it to others.\"\n\nAn awkward pause took hold as I contemplated Mr. Quammen's proposal.\n\n\"Maybe spread it back to you?\" I asked.\n\n\"Yes, maybe spread it back to me.\"\n\nI was talking to Mr. Quammen while doing research for \"How to Stop the Next Pandemic,\" a 14-minute Times documentary that ask the questions: Why do pandemics happen? And how do we stop them in the future?\n\nThe short film highlights a scary trend largely overshadowed by the coronavirus ravaging the globe: New pathogens that may cause pandemics are on the rise.\n\nTrends in historical data charting the incidents of new emerging infectious diseases point to a future with more Covid-19-like events, not fewer.\n\n\"Yes, they're increasing over time in direct correlation with human population growth and our ecological footprint,\" said Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance, a nonprofit that aims to protect the public from the emergence of disease.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future.

Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nIf you're not already concerned about future pandemics, talking to a disease ecologist focused on zoonoses (diseases that pass between animals and humans) will likely open your eyes.\n\nDr. Daszak, who has a knack for monologuing about pathogens, has been warning the world for decades about potential pandemics. In 2008 he co-authored a study titled \"Global trends in emerging infectious diseases,\" which showed how emerging infectious disease events \"have risen significantly over time.\"\n\n\"These pandemics have been with us throughout history,\" Dr. Daszak said. \"But what's happening now is we've globalized the planet, we've colonized the planet, and we're now coming across the last remaining viruses that wildlife carry that we've never experienced before.\"\n\nIf you don't want to see more Covid-19-like events in the future, I urge you to watch our short film to become more aware of their origins, what role you play in them and most importantly what we can do to stop them.\n\nBefore finishing my interview with Dr. Daszak, I cautiously joked, \"With Covid-19, is nature sending us a message?\"\n\nDr. Daszak stared at me without smiling.\n\n\"Nature didn't send us this message. We sent it to ourselves,\" Dr. Daszak said.\n\nOur consumer habits have changed the planet so significantly that \"we dominate every ecosystem on earth right now,\" he said.\n\n\"And our response is: we blame one country, versus another. We blame people who eat one species over people who eat another. And we blame nature. Well, no, we need to point the finger directly at ourselves, understand what's going on and change it.\"\n\nThe call ended.\n\nAnd just like that, the pandemic was my fault.\n\nYours too.",

    "Why Antibody Tests Won't Help You Much": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Most antibody tests are useful only for large population surveys, diagnosis in certain children or when initial diagnostic testing fails, according to an expert panel.\n\nGetting an antibody test to see if you had Covid-19 months ago is pointless, according to guidelines issued this week by a major medical society.\n\nMany tests are inaccurate, some look for the wrong antibodies and even the right antibodies fade away, said experts at the Infectious Diseases Society of America, which issued the new guidelines.\n\nBecause current tests cannot determine if someone is immune, the society said, they \"cannot inform decisions to discontinue physical distancing or lessen the use of personal protective equipment.\"\n\nAntibody testing generally should be used only for population surveys, not for diagnosing illness in individuals, the panel said. But its guidelines described two situations in which antibody testing could be used when the normal diagnostic tests for the virus -- called PCR tests -- failed or were likely to fail.\n\nPeople who felt sick weeks or months ago and now wonder if they are immune to Covid-19 \"probably shouldn't bother\" getting an antibody test, said Dr. Angela M. Caliendo, a testing expert at Brown University's Alpert Medical School and a member of the society's expert panel.\n\nMany New Yorkers fell ill in the spring, could not get tested then and now wonder whether they had the disease and are immune; the panel concluded that current antibody tests cannot answer that question.\n\n\"We don't really know if a positive test means you're protected,\" Dr. Caliendo said. \"If you were sick back in March, you probably don't have antibodies any more; and if you were only mildly sick, you may not have gotten antibodies.\"\n\nMoreover, she said, \"if you live in a low-prevalence area, you have a much higher likelihood of getting a false-positive test, meaning you may think you are protected but you aren't.\"\n\nDespite the flaws of antibody tests, recent studies of patients who definitely were infected suggest that they have long-lasting immunity and that it is very unlikely they will get reinfected.\n\nThat may be because white blood cells known as B and T cells, which are \"primed\" to recognize and attack the coronavirus, remain in circulation long after antibodies have faded away. But B and T cells are not analyzed by common antibody tests.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-21T22:32:21.851Z A new C.D.C. report suggests that child-care centers may reopen safely in areas where the virus is contained. U.S. universities have been trying to prepare for months, but outbreaks are forcing last-minute changes. Cases surge in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nOther experts echoed the society's recommendation against individual antibody tests.\n\nMichael T. Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, called diagnostic clinics that charge individuals for antibody tests \"snake oil salesmen.\"\n\nAntibody tests -- which analyze blood for proteins produced by the immune system that bind to the outside of the virus and neutralize it -- are useful mostly for surveys of large populations to see roughly how many people have had the disease, the society said.\n\nEven for that purpose, only tests that are correctly positive more than 96 percent of time and correctly negative at least 99.5 percent of the time should be used, according to the guidelines.\n\nVery few of the dozens of tests made in this country, Europe and Asia that the panel looked at met those standards, Dr. Caliendo said. None can be done at home or immediately in doctors' offices, and the best are assays known as Elisa or CIA (chemiluminescence immunoassay). Tests using paper strips were less consistently accurate, the panel found.\n\nWith two exceptions, antibody tests should not be used to diagnose individual infections, the society said. When a patient has all of the symptoms of Covid-19, including X-ray evidence of pneumonia but still comes up negative on repeated diagnostic PCR tests for the virus, an antibody test may be useful.\n\nIdeally, it should be given not immediately after symptoms appear, but three to four weeks later -- \"the sweet spot,\" Dr. Caliendo said.\n\n(PCR nasal swab tests may come up negative after the virus migrates from the nose and throat to the lungs, Dr. Caliendo explained; but the body may not produce enough antibodies to be detectable in the blood until more than two weeks have passed.)\n\nThe tests can also be used for diagnosis when a doctor suspects a child has multisystem inflammatory syndrome, a rare but serious complication of Covid-19 in children. Because it is not known how long after the initial infection this inflammation begins, doctors should do both a PCR test and an antibody test, the guidelines said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also issued guidelines for using antibody tests; they were last updated on Aug. 1. The guidance is based on validations of test kits by the National Cancer Institute, while the infectious disease society reviewed test results from all over the world, said Dr. Kimberly E. Hanson, a testing expert at the University of Utah Hospital who was also on the expert panel.\n\nThe panel found it hard to decide which tests were worth recommending.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration's decision in April to approve tests without even reviewing their safety and efficacy data \"turned out to be a problem,\" Dr. Hanson said. \"The market was flooded with poorly performing tests.\"\n\nAfter harsh criticism from testing experts and Congress, the F.D.A. reversed that decision in May and gave test-makers 10 days to prove their tests were accurate or be banned from selling them.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Department of Health and Human Services, citing an executive order from President Trump, said that laboratories that developed their own in-house tests for the virus did not have to pass F.D.A. review. The order does not apply to the commercial tests the panel analyzed.\n\nThe tests still on the market now are better but still not good enough, experts said.\n\nThe panel examined 9,500 papers describing test validation and found only 47 worth considering. \"It was a mishmash of stuff,\" Dr. Hanson said.\n\nDr. Caliendo said, \"We na\u00efvely thought this would be simple. There are not a lot of high-quality results on these tests.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 17, 2020\n\nWhy does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nEven in those 47 papers, the same tests did better or worse in different studies, they said.\n\nTests that do not detect so-called IgG antibodies, which start appearing about two weeks after infection, are not useful, Dr. Hanson said.\n\nThere are two other types: IgM antibodies appear later in SARS-CoV-2 infections than they do with other viruses, are less specific than IgG antibodies, and levels fluctuate more, she said.\n\nIgA antibody tests do not effectively distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other coronaviruses that cause common colds.\n\nEven for population surveys, tests must be highly accurate, experts said. In populations with only a few people infected, even a 1 percent inaccuracy rate can introduce wide margins of error.\n\nAntibody tests are different from antigen tests, which look for a protein on the surface of the virus. They are not considered highly accurate but give results in 15 minutes. Because laboratory backups and shortages of testing reagents have delayed more accurate PCR tests by as much as two weeks in some cities, many institutions have switched to using antigen tests.\n\nDr. Hanson said the society knew there was \"a lot of interest\" in antigen tests.\n\n\"But we have not even been able to get our hands on any to evaluate,\" she said. \"There are too many manufacturers with emergency-use authorization, and the demand is high.\"\n\nA positive result on an antigen test is generally considered accurate, she said, but a negative one means the patient should be retested with a PCR test.\n\nDr. Caliendo said her hospital in Rhode Island did not use antigen tests at all, and local schools used them to test only children who were clearly ill.\n\n\"We're doing things that are less than ideal, because we can't get the materials we need,\" she added.\n\nThe society is looking at the new saliva tests, which appear to be about as sensitive as nasal swab tests, Dr. Hanson said, \"but there's not a lot of data on how long the virus is in saliva.\"\n\nAlso, she said, \"saliva is bubbly and hard to pipette.\" As a result, labs are reporting 3 percent of tests invalid, compared to 1 percent for swab tests, \"which is frustrating.\"\n\nOn the other hand, she said, swabbing can make a patient sneeze, which endangers the person giving the tests. Spitting does not, Dr. Hanson said, \"so you don't need the same level of PPE -- which matters, because here in Utah, it's 100 degrees in the testing tents.\"",

        "body": "Women produce a more powerful immune response than do men, a new study finds.\n\nThe coronavirus may infect anyone, young or old, but older men are up to twice as likely to become severely sick and to die as women of the same age.\n\nWhy? The first study to look at immune response by sex has turned up a clue: Men produce a weaker immune response to the virus than do women, the researchers concluded.\n\nThe findings, published on Wednesday in Nature, suggest that men, particularly those over age 60, may need to depend more on vaccines to protect against the infection.\n\n\"Natural infection is clearly failing\" to spark adequate immune responses in men, said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University who led the work.\n\nThe results are consistent with what's known about sex differences following various challenges to the immune system.\n\nWomen mount faster and stronger immune responses, perhaps because their bodies are rigged to fight pathogens that threaten unborn or newborn children.\n\nBut over time, an immune system in a constant state of high alert can be harmful. Most autoimmune diseases -- characterized by an overly strong immune response -- are much more prevalent in women than in men, for example.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-26T07:48:16.998Z The C.D.C. changes testing guidelines to exclude those exposed to virus who don't exhibit symptoms. The Trump administration ordered hospitals to report data to H.H.S. or risk losing funding. At the Republican National Convention, Melania Trump acknowledges the pandemic's human toll. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\n\"We are looking at two sides of the same coin,\" said Dr. Marcus Altfeld, an immunologist at the Heinrich Pette Institute and at the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf in Germany.\n\nThe findings underscore the need for companies pursing coronavirus vaccines to parse their data by sex and may influence decisions about dosing, Dr. Altfeld and other experts said.\n\n\"You could imagine scenarios where a single shot of a vaccine might be sufficient in young individuals or maybe young women, while older men might need to have three shots of vaccine,\" Dr. Altfeld said.\n\nCompanies pursuing coronavirus vaccines have not yet released clinical data analyzed by the participants' sex, but the Food and Drug Administration has asked them to do so, as well as by racial and ethnic background, said Dr. William Gruber, a vice president at Pfizer.\n\nDr. Iwasaki's team analyzed immune responses in 17 men and 22 women who were admitted to the hospital soon after they were infected with the coronavirus. The researchers collected blood, nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva, urine and stool from the patients every three to seven days.\n\nThe analysis excluded patients on ventilators and those taking drugs that affect the immune system \"to make sure that we're measuring natural immune response to the virus,\" Dr. Iwasaki said.\n\nThe researchers also analyzed data from an additional 59 men and women who did not meet those criteria.\n\nOver all, the scientists found, the women's bodies produced more so-called T cells, which can kill virus-infected cells and stop the infection from spreading.\n\nMen showed much weaker activation of T cells, and that lag was linked to how sick the men became. The older the men, the weaker their T cell responses.\n\n\"When they age, they lose their ability to stimulate T cells,\" Dr. Iwasaki said. \"If you look at the ones that really failed to make T cells, they were the ones who did worse with disease.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nBut \"women who are older -- even very old, like 90 years old -- these women are still making pretty good, decent immune response,\" she added.\n\nCompared with health care workers and healthy controls, the patients all had elevated blood levels of cytokines, proteins that rouse the immune system to action. Some types of cytokines, called interleukin-8 and interleukin-18, were elevated in all men but only in some women.\n\nWomen who had high levels of other cytokines became more seriously ill, the researchers found. Those women might do better if given drugs that blunt these proteins, Dr. Iwasaki said.\n\nThe study has limitations. It was small, and the patients were older than 60 on average, making it difficult to assess how the immune response changes with age.\n\n\"We know that age is proving to be a very important factor in Covid-19 outcomes, and the intersection of age and sex must be explored,\" said Sabra Klein, a vaccine expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nThe study also did not offer a reason for the differences between men and women. Because the women were past menopause, on average, \"it is doubtful that sex steroid hormones are involved,\" Dr. Klein said.\n\nStill, the new findings are \"exciting\" because they begin to explain why men fare so much worse with the coronavirus, she added: \"The more robust T cell responses in older women could be an important clue to protection and must be explored further.\"",

A wet Saturday gives way to a bright and pleasant Sunday.\n\nAlternate-side parking: In effect until Sept. 7 (Labor Day). Read about the amended regulations here.\n\nSo, you've noticed more garbage piling up at your public park. You're not alone.\n\nAcross the city's sprawling park system, New Yorkers are trying to make the most of their hours outdoors, even if it is spent near shattered glass, charcoal heaps and overstuffed trash cans.\n\nThe issue is two-pronged: More New Yorkers, deprived of their usual time inside bars, reception halls and friends' living rooms, have been descending on the city's public lawns. But the Department of Parks and Recreation has fewer resources to keep up with trash management.\n\nIn a recent article, my colleague Sarah Maslin Nir explored why the parks are receiving less care at a time when they seem to be in greater demand. Here's what she found.\n\nIncreased park use and budget cuts are to blame for trash pileups.\n\nEven in normal times, an uptick in park use like the recent one would have made it harder for workers to keep the green spaces clean. But the city's fiscal crisis, which was brought on by the pandemic, led to an $84 million cut to parks department funding this fiscal year. That's a seventh of the department's total budget.\n\nAs a result, the department's staff has been cut by nearly half. Maintenance hours have been shaved by 25,000 hours per week, too, so crews are able to attend to 400 fewer sites each week.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-28T09:46:02.316Z For many schools in the U.S., returning to the classroom means a stop in the courtroom.

City employees will also begin handing out garbage bags to park visitors.\n\nCity leaders and neighborhood groups are also working to aid parks. In the Bronx, Ruben Diaz Jr., the borough president, and dozens of volunteers clean up litter on Mondays at Soundview Park. Mr. Diaz calls them \"Meaningful Mondays.\"\n\n\"The city is broke, the state says that they're broke, so this is the time where we all need to put our boots on the ground,\" Mr. Diaz told Ms. Nir.\n\nFrom The Times\n\nA Perk for N.Y.'s Richest Areas: First Dibs on Top Public Schools\n\nAt the Met, a Promising Sign: The 'Hot Dog King' Is Back in Business\n\nWhat's That on the Met's Roof Garden?

Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear.

Free, but donations are welcome.\n\nIt's Friday -- what's cooking?\n\nMetropolitan Diary: A good lonely\n\nDear Diary:\n\nI used to go into New York from Mount Vernon by myself to see shows, taking the subway downtown from 241st Street. The price had gone up to a dime at the time.\n\nWhen I got to Times Square, I'd walk up Broadway to Lindy's for supper. I always had the same thing: ground sirloin steak. It came with a baked potato and wonderful creamed spinach.\n\nI'd also have a beer even though I was underage. The drinking age was 18 then, but at 16 I was 6 feet 6 inches tall. Close enough.\n\nThe meal cost less than $5 with tip. I never had the cheesecake for which Lindy's was famous because I needed the money for a theater ticket.\n\nAfter dinner, I'd walk up and down among the theaters looking to see what ticket I could get for $10 or less just before curtain time. I would go to $15 for a musical.\n\nYou could see almost anything if you timed it right. On one of my trips, I saw \"Guys and Dolls.\" Alan Alda's father was in the cast. In the show, Lindy's became Mindy's and praises for the cheesecake were sung.\n\nI was lonely, but it was a good lonely and I felt sophisticated beyond my years.\n\nIn 1963, I honeymooned in New York, and my wife and I passed what was the second Lindy's. The cheesecake recipe was posted in the window. We wrote it down, and although my wife became a great cook, she never made the cheesecake.\n\nI wonder what it tasted like.\n\n-- Nils Peterson\n\nNew York Today is published weekdays around 6 a.m. Sign up here to get it by email.

        "body": "Renters receive more relief, but there's a looming problem for landlords, especially those who own just a few properties.\n\nAs an eviction crisis has seemed increasingly likely this summer, everyone in the housing market has made the same plea to Washington: Send money -- lots of it -- that would keep renters in their homes and landlords afloat.\n\nCity officials have called for such rent relief. So have landlord associations, tenant advocates, legal aid lawyers, housing researchers, public health experts and economists.\n\nNow millions of renters have been covered by a national eviction moratorium, an unprecedented order by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help control the coronavirus pandemic. But there is still no money.\n\nCongress has yet to adopt a new aid package that includes broad rent relief. It hasn't passed any other cash assistance lately either. Expanded unemployment benefits, worth $600 a week, expired at the end of July, along with a more limited eviction moratorium. There have been no new stimulus checks. And additional unemployment benefits created by executive action by President Trump have not yet reached many workers.\n\nThat means that while the new order has halted most evictions through the end of the year, there remains no mechanism to cover what those tenants cannot pay -- or to control the cascading consequences when rent dries up.\n\nTenants will still be on the hook for all this unpaid rent when the moratorium expires Dec. 31. And landlords in the meantime may find it increasingly hard to make repairs and cover the mortgage. For this reason, even advocates cheering the moratorium call it a half measure. And landlord groups warn it could destabilize the housing market even more.\n\n\"We're not comfortable with any protracted moratorium, because we just simply don't agree that is the answer,\" said Greg Brown, the senior vice president of government affairs with the National Apartment Association. \"We think rental assistance in and of itself is the answer. That said, if this is the approach that's going to be taken, you absolutely have to have it connected to rental assistance.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-03T07:54:49.941Z The University of South Carolina reports that more than 1,000 students currently have the virus. The C.D.C. tells health officials to be ready to distribute a vaccine by November, raising concerns over politicized timing. In Iowa, college students staged a sickout, and a football opener won't have fans after all.

But that bill was not passed by the Senate. And in negotiations over a new relief package, rental aid has been a less prominent priority, as Democrats and the White House have argued over the bill's total cost, unemployment payments and aid to state and local governments.\n\nNow with the moratorium in place, the effects on landlords may not be immediately visible. Many property owners are accustomed to vacancies and occasional months without rent payments (and those who evict tenants in more normal times can often expect the process to take months). But researchers warn that the strain will build, particularly on the small mom-and-pop landlords who own a few units and count on that income for their retirement.\n\n\"Some of them aren't going to make it,\" said Jenny Schuetz, an urban economist with the Brookings Institution. \"It's the real estate equivalent of a family-owned small business.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus. Open spaces prevent the virus from building up in concentrated amounts and being inhaled, which can happen when infected people exhale in a confined space for long stretches of time, said Dr. Julian W. Tang, a virologist at the University of Leicester.What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThose small-scale rental properties, often older and with higher maintenance costs, are more likely to be lower-income housing than newer corporate-run apartments. If the owners can't keep paying their bills, she said these properties could be put up for sale or enter foreclosure.\n\nShould private equity firms buy them up -- as they did with many single-family homes during the Great Recession -- rental properties that are relatively affordable today may become less so.\n\nAbigail Staudt, a lawyer with the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland, said the moratorium without rental assistance wasn't a permanent fix for tenants and would amount to a hardship for small landlords.\n\n\"And who is providing affordable housing -- it is often the small landlord,\" she said.\n\nWhat could happen next won't be as visible as the unemployment crisis, reported in weekly and monthly national data. It won't be easy to track in the housing market; multifamily transactions are less transparent than sales of single-family homes. And it won't be as clear as seeing families lining up at food banks, Ms. Schuetz said. Most families in need of housing never turn up at shelters looking for a place to stay.\n\n\"It's not as if one day everyone's fine, and then the next day everything is horrible,\" said Peggy Bailey, the vice president for housing policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. But she warned that the absence of rental assistance would make it harder over time for tenants and landlords to recover from the economic crisis.\n\n\"We're just asking people to get further behind and expend their savings and do all sorts of things that have longer-term implications than just even the next six months,\" she said.\n\nMatthew Goldstein contributed reporting.",

        "body": "Cases are rising among children everywhere. But those in minority communities are much more likely to become infected and severely ill, new data show.\n\nOne of the notable features of the new coronavirus, evident early in the pandemic, was that it largely spared children. Some become severely ill, but deaths have been few, compared to adults.\n\nBut people of color have been disproportionately affected by Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, and recent studies have renewed concern about the susceptibility of children in these communities.\n\nThey are infected at higher rates than white children, and hospitalized at rates five to eight times that of white children. Children of color make up the overwhelming majority of those who develop a life-threatening complication called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C.\n\nAnd children of color comprise the majority of those who have died of Covid-19. Of more than 180,000 Americans who have died of Covid-19, fewer than 100 are children, according to the C.D.C.\n\nThe deaths include 41 Hispanic children, 24 Black children, 19 white children, three Asian-American children, three American Indian/Alaska Native children, and two multiracial children.\n\nThe unique vulnerabilities of these youngsters are coming to light even as the number of infections in children is rising and schools and parents around the country are grappling with nettlesome decisions about reopening safely.\n\nThe susceptibility of minority children to the disease is not unique to the United States. Black children hospitalized in the United Kingdom were more likely than whites to be transferred to critical care and to develop MIS-C, according to a study published last week in the journal BMJ.\n\n\"Children don't exist in a vacuum,\" said Dr. Monika K. Goyal, a pediatric emergency medicine specialist at Children's National Hospital in Washington.\n\nAmong 1,000 children tested for Covid-19 at a site in Washington in March and April, nearly half of the Hispanic children and nearly one-third of the Black children were positive for the coronavirus, Dr. Goyal found in a recent study.\n\n\"They live in homes where their parent or caregiver doesn't have the luxury of telecommuting, so they are at increased risk of exposure,\" she added. \"They are also more likely to live in multigenerational households. It's all connected.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-01T15:22:44.733Z Across the globe, students are returning to the classroom. New York City delays the start of school to get ready for in-person classes. For parents of school-age children, there's no easy answer to the question of sending them back to classrooms. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nPoverty also is linked to a higher risk of infection, and Dr. Goyal's research, published on Tuesday in the journal Pediatrics, found that children from low-income families were much more likely to become infected than those with the most affluent parents.\n\nThe higher infection rates appear to be driven by greater exposure to the virus, Dr. Goyal said: \"There's nothing to indicate that there's some sort of genetic predisposition to Covid based on race or ethnicity.\"\n\nDr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatrics at Stanford, agreed: \"I know exactly what's happening to those kids. Their parents are frontline, blue-collar or essential workers.\"\n\nDr. Maldonado said she had frequently treated adult patients with the coronavirus who said their partners or children were sick, as well.\n\nResearchers at Harvard have documented higher infection rates in Massachusetts communities with high proportions of immigrants, high numbers of food service workers and high numbers of people living in large, shared households.\n\nImmigrants may hesitate to seek medical care, and employees who work in the food service industry often lack adequate paid sick leave, said Jose Figueroa, assistant professor of health policy and management at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\"What you have is the perfect recipe for fast transmission of Covid-19 in the Latino community,\" he said. \"Working adults who keep going to work because they need to put food on the table and pay the rent, and who often have young children.\"\n\nWhile restaurant patrons worry about the distances between tables and wonder whether to dine outdoors, \"someone is preparing the food in the back, and they don't have the luxury of being outdoors,\" Dr. Figueroa said. \"They're in small kitchens cooking the food, and even if they're wearing masks, they're often in small, confined spaces.\"\n\nThe true number of children who have been infected with the coronavirus may not be known, as young children tend to have milder courses of the disease and have never been routinely tested in the United States.\n\nA mother in the Bronx, who asked to be identified only as Darlene to protect her child's privacy, said her son was sick for months during the spring peak of the coronavirus outbreak in New York City. But health providers in the Bronx deflected her repeated requests to have the 3-year-old tested in March and through much of April, because he did not have a fever and was not having difficulty breathing, she said.\n\nWhen she managed to get him tested in April, the result was negative. But her son was lethargic, complained of a stomach ache, had persistent diarrhea and often woke up wailing in the middle of the night.\n\nOrdinarily an active and playful toddler, he had difficulty walking and fell a number of times, Darlene said: \"I knew something was wrong -- this was not my baby.\"\n\nFinally, in June, as his symptoms were resolving, Darlene was able to take him to his regular doctor at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, who tested him for antibodies to the virus. The result was positive, indicating he had indeed been infected. (Other family members tested negative for antibodies).\n\nDr. Goyal's study reported that Hispanic children were six times more likely to test positive for the coronavirus than white children who came to the testing site in Washington. Black children were twice as likely to test positive as white children.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated September 1, 2020\n\nWhy is it safer to spend time together outside?Outdoor gatherings lower risk because wind disperses viral droplets, and sunlight can kill some of the virus.

It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nTwo other reports by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention last month underscored the heightened risk of poor outcomes for children of color.\n\nHispanic children were at greatest risk of severe disease: they were hospitalized at a rate nearly eight times that of white children, according to the C.D.C. Black children were hospitalized at a rate five times that of white children.\n\nThe C.D.C. study, which looked at 576 children under the age of 18 who had been hospitalized in 14 states between March 1 and July 25, found that nearly half had at least one underlying health condition. The most common was obesity, followed by chronic lung disease and premature birth.\n\nAmong the hospitalized children whose race and ethnicity were known, nearly half were Hispanic, and 29 percent were Black. Hispanic and Black children also had higher rates of underlying health conditions: 45 percent and 29 percent, respectively. Among white children, 15 percent had underlying health problems.\n\nAnother C.D.C. paper looked at 570 children with MIS-C in 40 states, the District of Columbia and New York City, between March 2 and July 18. Of those whose race was known, only 13 percent were white; 40 percent were Hispanic, and 33 percent were Black.\n\nJust under 3 percent were Asian, and about 10 percent were listed as \"other\" or multiracial. Fewer than 1 percent of the children were American Indian/Alaskan Native or Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nTwo-thirds of the children had no pre-existing medical conditions before the onset of MIS-C, though the proportion of those who were obese was slightly higher than in the general population. The most common symptoms were abdominal pain, vomiting, a skin rash and diarrhea.\n\nWhile children over all have been less severely affected by the disease, there was a 21 percent increase in confirmed infections among children between the second and third weeks of August, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nThe academy estimates children represent 9.5 percent of all cases in states that have reported positive tests by age, with 476,439 confirmed infections in children, among the six million Covid-19 cases in the United States. (The definition of child varies from state to state, but is usually 18 and under, or under 18.)\n\nSince the vast majority of children infected with the virus have a mild or asymptomatic illness, many cases may have been missed earlier this year, when testing was scarce and limited to the very ill, said Dr. Alefiyah Malbari, an assistant professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.\n\nWhen parents called their pediatricians and said their children had symptoms, \"Our line was, 'This could be Covid -- quarantine yourself as if you had Covid,'\" Dr. Malbari said. \"Even the playgrounds were closed, so it was easy to do.\"\n\nNow, with schools opening and testing more widely available, \"we have to take these symptoms really, really seriously.\"",

        "body": "Most people won't spread the virus widely. The few who do are probably in the wrong place at the wrong time in their infection, new models suggest.\n\nFor a spiky sphere just 120 nanometers wide, the coronavirus can be a remarkably cosmopolitan traveler.\n\nSpewed from the nose or mouth, it can rocket across a room and splatter onto surfaces; it can waft into poorly ventilated spaces and linger in the air for hours. At its most intrepid, the virus can spread from a single individual to dozens of others, perhaps even a hundred or more at once, proliferating through packed crowds in what is called a superspreading event.\n\nSuch scenarios, which have been traced to call centers, meat processing facilities, weddings and more, have helped propel a pandemic that, in the span of eight months, has reached nearly every corner of the globe. And yet, while some people seem particularly apt to spread the coronavirus, others barely pass it on.\n\n\"There's this small percentage of people who appear to infect a lot of people,\" said Dr. Joshua Schiffer, a physician and mathematical modeling expert who studies infectious diseases at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. Estimates vary from population to population, but they consistently show a striking skew: Between 10 and 20 percent of coronavirus cases may seed 80 percent of new infections. Other respiratory diseases, like the flu, are far more egalitarian in their spread.\n\nFiguring out what drives coronavirus superspreading events could be key to stopping them, and expediting an end to the pandemic. \"That's the million dollar question,\" said Ayesha Mahmud, who studies infectious disease dynamics at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIn a paper posted Friday to the website medRxiv that has not yet been through peer review, Dr. Schiffer and his colleagues reported that coronavirus superspreading events were most likely to happen at the intersection where bad timing and poor placement collide: a person who has reached the point in their infection when they are shedding large amounts of virus, and are doing so in a setting where there are plenty of other people around to catch it.\n\nAccording to a model built by Dr. Schiffer's team, the riskiest window for such transmission may be extremely brief -- a one- to two-day period in the week or so after a person is infected, when coronavirus levels are at their highest.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-07T20:21:57.647Z Cuomo says N.Y. schools can reopen in-person but leaves it up to districts to determine if, when and how. With U.S. stimulus talks stalemated, the jobs report provides little promise of a break in the gridlock. The U.S. economy added jobs last month, but only a small fraction of those lost in the spring. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe virus can still spread outside this window, and individuals outside it should not let up on measures like mask-wearing and physical distancing, Dr. Schiffer said. But the longer an infection drags on, the less likely a person is to be contagious -- an idea that might help experts advise when to end self-isolation, or how to allocate resources to those most in need, said Dr. Mahmud, who was not involved in the study.\n\nCatching and containing a person at their most infectious is another matter, however. Some people stricken with the coronavirus start to feel unwell within a couple days, whereas others take weeks, and many never end up experiencing symptoms. The length of the so-called incubation period, which spans the time between infection and the onset of symptoms, can be so variable that some people who catch the virus fall ill before the person who gave it to them does. That rarely happens with the flu, which reliably rouses a spate of symptoms within a couple days of infection.\n\nIf the coronavirus reaches a peak in the body before symptoms appear -- if symptoms appear at all -- that increase might be very tough to identify without frequent and proactive testing. Symptom-free spikes in virus load appear to happen very often, which \"really distorts our ability to tell when somebody is contagious,\" Dr. Schiffer said. That, in turn, makes it all too easy for people to obliviously shed the pathogen.\n\n\"It really is about opportunity,\" said Shweta Bansal, an infectious disease ecologist at Georgetown University who was not involved in the study. \"These processes really come together when you are not only infected, but you also don't know you're infected because you don't feel crummy.\" Some of these unwitting coronavirus chauffeurs, emboldened to go out in public, may end up causing a superspreading event that sends the pathogen blazing through a new population.\n\nThis confluence of factors -- a person in the wrong place at the wrong point in their infection -- sets the stage for \"explosive transmission,\" Dr. Bansal said.\n\nThe team's model also pointed to another important variable: the remarkable resilience of the coronavirus when it is aloft.\n\nA growing body of evidence now suggests that the coronavirus can be airborne in crowded, poorly ventilated indoor environments, where it may encounter many people at once. The virus also travels in larger, heavier droplets, but these quickly fall to the ground after they are expelled from the airway and do not have the same reach or longevity as their smaller counterparts. Dr. Schiffer said he thought the coronavirus might be more amenable to superspreading than flu viruses because it is better at persisting in contagious clouds, which can ferry pathogens over relatively long distances.\n\n\"It's a spatial phenomenon,\" he said. \"People further away from the transmitter may be more likely to be infected.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 6, 2020\n\nWhy are bars linked to outbreaks?Think about a bar. Alcohol is flowing. It can be loud, but it's definitely intimate, and you often need to lean in close to hear your friend. And strangers have way, way fewer reservations about coming up to people in a bar. That's sort of the point of a bar. Feeling good and close to strangers. It's no surprise, then, that bars have been linked to outbreaks in several states. Louisiana health officials have tied at least 100 coronavirus cases to bars in the Tigerland nightlife district in Baton Rouge. Minnesota has traced 328 recent cases to bars across the state. In Idaho, health officials shut down bars in Ada County after reporting clusters of infections among young adults who had visited several bars in downtown Boise. Governors in California, Texas and Arizona, where coronavirus cases are soaring, have ordered hundreds of newly reopened bars to shut down. Less than two weeks after Colorado's bars reopened at limited capacity, Gov. Jared Polis ordered them to close.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.What is school going to look like in September?It is unlikely that many schools will return to a normal schedule this fall, requiring the grind of online learning, makeshift child care and stunted workdays to continue. California's two largest public school districts -- Los Angeles and San Diego -- said on July 13, that instruction will be remote-only in the fall, citing concerns that surging coronavirus infections in their areas pose too dire a risk for students and teachers. Together, the two districts enroll some 825,000 students. They are the largest in the country so far to abandon plans for even a partial physical return to classrooms when they reopen in August. For other districts, the solution won't be an all-or-nothing approach. Many systems, including the nation's largest, New York City, are devising hybrid plans that involve spending some days in classrooms and other days online. There's no national policy on this yet, so check with your municipal school system regularly to see what is happening in your community.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, many comparisons have been drawn between Covid-19 and the flu, both of which are diseases caused by viruses that attack the respiratory tract. But plenty of differences exist, and in many ways the coronavirus is more formidable. \"This study adds yet another layer to how it's different from influenza,\" said Olivia Prosper, a researcher at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville who uses mathematical models to study infectious diseases but was not involved in the study. \"It's not just about how sick it makes you, but also its ability to transmit.\"\n\nMoreover, certain people may be predisposed to be more generous transmitters of the coronavirus, although the details are \"still a mystery,\" Dr. Schiffer said.\n\nBut when a superspreading event occurs, it likely has more to do with the circumstances than with a single person's biology, Dr. Schiffer said. Even someone carrying a lot of the coronavirus can stave off mass transmission by avoiding large groups, thus depriving the germ of conduits to travel.\n\n\"A superspreading event is a function of what somebody's viral load is and if they're in a crowded space,\" he said. \"If those are the two levers, you can control the crowding bit.\"\n\nBoth Dr. Mahmud and Dr. Prosper noted that not everyone has the means to practice physical distancing. Some people work essential jobs in packed environments, for instance, and are left more vulnerable to the consequences of superspreading events.\n\nThat makes it all the more important for those who can participate in control measures like mask-wearing and physical distancing to remain vigilant about their behavior, Dr. Mahmud said.\n\n\"That's what we should be doing,\" she said. \"Not just to protect ourselves, but to protect others.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "body": "The big bouquets of roses. The towering signs spelling out the letters of each house in Greek. And the hundreds of rushees clutching their acceptance envelopes as they run through campus together.\n\nBid day at the University of Alabama, when sororities decide which pledges will join their sisterhoods, is cause for celebration.\n\nBut this past weekend, women at the school, which has one of the biggest Greek systems in the country with 11,000 members, were warned not to party following their invitations to join any of two dozen sororities because of the potential spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThat did not stop all of them.\n\nThe bars and sidewalks along the Strip were crowded on Sunday as sorority members and other students reveled in their return-to-school rituals, sparking criticism from public officials, the fury of university officials and worries from other Tuscaloosans.\n\nThe concerns over Greek life come amid reports of virus outbreaks at fraternities and sororities across the country. Universities are struggling with how to prevent tightly packed sorority and fraternity houses from turning into coronavirus clusters.\n\nAt the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, officials abruptly called off in-person classes on Monday after identifying four clusters in student housing facilities, including one at the Sigma Nu fraternity.\n\n\"The frats are being frats: They are having their parties,\" Lamar Richards, a U.N.C. sophomore, said.\n\nThe New York Times has identified at least 251 cases of the virus tied to fraternities and sororities. At the University of California, Berkeley, 47 cases were identified in a single week in early July, most of which were connected to the Greek system. In Mississippi, a significant outbreak in Oxford, home to the state's flagship university, was partially blamed on fraternity parties. At the University of Washington's Seattle campus, at least 165 of the 290 cases identified by the school have been associated with its Greek Row.\n\nAs students return to campus, there have been virus outbreaks at residence halls and other university housing as well. More than 13,000 students, faculty and staff members at colleges have been infected with the coronavirus, according to a Times database of cases confirmed by schools and government agencies.\n\nBut fraternities and sororities have been especially challenging for universities to regulate. Though they dominate social life on many campuses, their houses are often not owned or governed by the universities, and have frequently been the site of excessive drinking, sexual assault and hazing. That same lack of oversight, some experts say, extends to controlling the virus. Even on campuses that are offering online instruction only, people are still living in some sorority and fraternity houses.\n\n\"Fraternity and sorority homes have long functioned as a kind of 'no-fly zone' for university administrations,\" said Matthew W. Hughey, a professor of sociology at the University of Connecticut who has studied Greek life and social inequality on campuses. \"The structure that's already been set up makes them harder to control when it comes to the transmission of disease.\"\n\nAmong the 25 fraternity houses hosting students over the summer at the University of Washington, 15 of them suffered a coronavirus outbreak in the last week of July. At least 165 students of the 1,000 living there tested positive for the virus. Students quarantined within their fraternity houses, sometimes designating an entire floor for infected students. Across two of the facilities, 45 out of 65 students tested positive.\n\nAnd at the University of Southern California, where classes -- all held remotely -- started on Monday, administrators have traced two outbreaks to fraternity houses over the past month, according to Dr. Sarah Van Orman, the university's chief student health officer. In mid-July around 45 people tested positive for the virus, most of them members of fraternities or sororities. And last week 15 people were found to be infected, some of them fraternity members and others who lived nearby.\n\n\"It's very challenging for everyone during this time, but we know particularly for young adults who crave connection, who crave being together,\" Dr. Van Orman said.\n\nSome members say they are making the appropriate sacrifices, like not holding the social events that many look forward to as a way to relax, form friendships and recruit new members.\n\n\"We have a lot of rules in place. We can't do a lot,\" said Tyler Blaylock, a 21-year-old senior at Florida Gulf Coast University. \"We can't do functions, and if we got caught, we would get kicked off, so we are not messing around.\"\n\nMr. Blaylock tested positive for Covid-19 in March, along with at least 10 other members of his Sigma Chi fraternity.\n\n\"My biggest thing is, I want to shake someone's hand and get to know a guy,\" Mr. Blaylock said. \"You can't do that through Zoom.\"\n\nFraternities and sororities say they have recommended significant departures from the familiar rhythms of Greek life to avoid spreading the virus. The North American Interfraternity Conference, a trade association of 58 fraternities -- about 85 percent of the total -- said its members were following local public health guidelines regarding the size of group gatherings. And in some cases, their own social distancing rules are even more strict.\n\nFraternities at the University of Missouri, for instance, have suspended all gatherings on chapter property starting next week, despite guidelines from the university that allow for gatherings of up to 20 people. A council made up of the fraternity chapters on campus recommended that each chapter allow members living in fraternity houses one guest at a time, and only in individual rooms, not in common spaces.\n\n\"Chapters will be met with strict consequences for violating the new rules,\" the group's board wrote in a memo last week.\n\nOn Monday, the National Panhellenic Conference, an umbrella organization covering 26 sororities with 400,000 undergraduate members, recommended that all sororities move to a fully virtual rush this fall.\n\nProspective members will be vetted on Zoom or other internet platforms, said Dani Weatherford, the organization's chief executive.\n\nSchools Reopening \"Back to School\n\nUpdated Aug. 17, 2020\n\nThe latest on how schools are navigating an uncertain season.\n\nUniversities across the country are facing a rising demand for tuition rebates as students ask if college is becoming \"glorified Skype.\"In Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest school district has perhaps the most ambitious plan in the country to test for the coronavirus.Families priced out of \"learning pods\" are seeking alternatives.How are campus newspapers covering back to school? We want to hear from student journalists.\n\nSorority houses are privately owned -- usually by the local or national chapters of the organizations. But they often have agreements with universities that require them to adhere to campus rules on health and safety, Ms. Weatherford said. Most sororities are requiring members to sign \"wellness pledges\" in which they vow to check their temperature daily and be aware of symptoms -- and take appropriate action if they have any.\n\nAt the University of Alabama, administrators recently visited sorority houses and issued new occupancy limits.\n\n\"They came into each one of the houses and said, 'This is how many people can fit into this room socially distanced. This is how many people can sit in the dining room at any particular time,'\" Ms. Weatherford said.\n\nSome sororities hired a moving company to haul students' belongings into their rooms, rather than having a parade of family members carrying things in.\n\nDiscipline for those who violate the rules is handled by each sorority, Ms. Weatherford said.\n\n\"Where you're going to have problems with this will not be within the university's care,\" Mayor Walt Maddox of Tuscaloosa said, nodding to new university policies that banned rites of Greek life like swaps and formals. But he acknowledged that safeguards could ebb behind closed doors or away from campus, and that outbreaks could emerge within the university's Greek organizations.\n\nDespite all the restrictions, both fraternities and sororities say they are reporting swelling numbers of applicants. Students are pining for the connections that college life is supposed to offer. And with many of the normal avenues of meeting people and making friends closed off, many students are turning to the Greek system. There are about 800,000 undergraduate members of fraternities and sororities.\n\n\"So far our recruitment registration numbers have been phenomenal, record-breaking,\" Ms. Weatherford said.\n\nBut that enthusiasm can sometimes translate into behavior that non-Greek students say endangers others.\n\nRobert Beyer, a senior at the University of Southern California, said he had observed good social distancing practices in neighborhoods around campus -- except fraternity row, where he said he routinely saw large groups of students standing close together.\n\n\"Their attitudes are so selfish,\" Mr. Beyer said. \"They don't care about spreading it to other people. I've heard people say, 'It's worth it to socialize and be with my friends even if it means getting Covid.'\"\n\nSome students and faculty said university administrators, not Greek-system students, were to blame for bringing students back to campus and not reining in bad behavior: \"I feel like the school should have more strictly enforced the parameters they set in the first place,\" said Kesan Ucheya, 17, a freshman at the University of North Carolina.\n\nOn Monday, Matthew Spangler, the president of the Sigma Nu chapter at Chapel Hill, where a virus cluster had been identified, said that he tested negative for the coronavirus with a fast test on Friday, but that his mother urged him to get another test.\n\nHe is awaiting those results.\n\nAre There Coronavirus Cases on Your Campus?\n\nAlex Lemonides, Michael Venutolo-Mantovani and Lucy Tompkins contributed reporting.",

        "body": "How to get a healthy glow even if you've barely laid eyes on the sun all summer.\n\nIt has been a weird summer, many of us cooped up indoors, and our skin has noticed. Now, in these last weeks of the season, skin care obsessives as well as the more laid-back among us are getting sick of the dull skin that has become something of a hallmark of the pandemic.\n\nLuckily, there are ways to combat it. \"There are a lot of ways to get a healthy glow,\" said Dr. Paul Jarrod Frank, a dermatologist in New York. \"The tricks that can help you get there are actually very easy.\"\n\nProtect Yourself From Screens\n\nSunscreen is a necessity for long summer afternoons. But it's also important to protect yourself from the increased screen time indoors. This, according to some skin care experts, is one reason for skin dullness.\n\nUnlike the well-known dangers of ultraviolet light, science is still debating the effects of the blue light from our mobile phones, tablets, monitors and other digital devices. We know it can cause hyperpigmentation but not how much exposure is harmful. Dr. Barbara Sturm, the German aesthetics doctor who has a namesake skin-care line, argues that the blue light emitted by our electronic screens can cause significant damage.\n\n\"It penetrates deep into the skin, making it potentially more dangerous than UV rays,\" Dr. Sturm said. Over time, she said, exposure to screens can cause premature aging, uneven tone, loss of firmness, dryness and impaired healing.\n\nYou can limit your exposure to blue light by switching to \"night shift\" on some devices and wearing mineral sunscreens with iron oxides (which have been shown to be more protective against visible light than other sunscreen options).\n\nDr. Sturm recommends a quick fix with antipollution products. Her own Anti-Pollution Drops contain cocoa seed extract to form a shield to help protect against environmental pollution, while purslane soothes and calms irritation.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-27T09:19:24.433Z Education systems are failing to reach many children, resulting in a 'global education emergency.' As Hurricane Laura slams the U.S., evacuation shelters adjust for the virus. The Justice Department says it may investigate four Democratic-led states over nursing-home outbreaks. See more updates More live coverage: Markets Give Yourself a Massage\n\nPati Dubroff, a makeup artist and Chanel makeup ambassador, typically spends 20 minutes massaging her clients' faces to bring out a glow before beginning a makeup application. She uses microcurrent devices, face rollers and gua sha stones.\n\n\"I'll use a combination of those things to get the muscles awake and oxygenated,\" Ms. Dubroff said.\n\nDr. Sturm also recommends facial massage, explaining that the lymphatic system is one of the body's key methods of detoxification. \"It's responsible for carrying away and filtering out toxins and waste from every cell, tissue and organ,\" she said.\n\nDr. Sturm recommends applying a serum or oil all over your face and neck to reduce friction. Beginning above the collarbone, gently massage the skin using your fingertips in downward, circular motions for about a minute. Repeat, moving up the neck, the forehead and then down, from the temples to the jawline.\n\nContinue the motion from your chin toward your ears and from the upper lip and cheekbones outward, finally to the eye area. You'll instantly see a bit of radiance in your complexion, she said.\n\nExfoliation Is Key\n\nSimilarly, Joanna Vargas, an aesthetician and the author of \"Glow From Within,\" recommends dry brushing as a form of exfoliation to boost glow and to prep for self-tanner.\n\n\"A dry brush is not a huge investment,\" Ms. Vargas said. (Prices range from $10 to $30.) She suggests starting at the tops of your feet and doing long strokes upward, always toward your heart. Dry brushing exfoliates the skin and improves the texture.\n\n\"After you've done dry brushing for about a minute or a minute and a half, and you do your whole body, you actually start to sweat,\" she said. \"That's how much of an increase in circulation you can stimulate with a simple one-minute dry-brushing routine.\" After dry brushing, shower and cleanse off dead skin cells with a calming body wash.\n\nDr. Frank likes using chemical and physical exfoliators two to three times a week to turn over dead skin cells. \"I recommend only mild exfoliation at home,\" he said.\n\n\"There are a lot of great products out there,\" he added. \"Even Neutrogena Acne Proofing Daily Facial Scrub with Salicylic Acid gives a nice little turnover to the skin.\"\n\nHydrate From Head to Toe\n\nThe most common cause of dull skin is dehydration. Ms. Vargas recommends using a hyaluronic acid serum for hotter months to increase moisture and luminosity.\n\n\"It absorbs very quickly into the skin without leaving a lot of heavy product on the skin that could cause further breakouts,\" she said. \"I'm also a really big fan of a good body cream that makes you feel hydrated all day.\" Ms. Vargas likes Jordan Samuel Hydrate Facial Serum and Dior Sakura Body Cream.\n\nIt's important to also apply a moisturizer under makeup. \"Sometimes if someone is excessively oily, I'll use a mattifying primer, but only strategically on the sides of the nose, top of the chin, top of the forehead,\" Ms. Dubroff said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 24, 2020\n\nWhat are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nShe also likes to mix a highlighting fluid like the Chanel Les Beiges Sheer Healthy Glow Highlighting Fluid in Pearly Glow and Sunkissed into a body moisturizer and applying all over. \"That's a nice way to add a subtle glow but to not walk out looking like a disco ball,\" she said.\n\nGet a Light Treatment\n\nLED light, red and infrared light devices are also excellent at making skin brighter and more healthy looking. \"They're good for all skin types, all skin tones,\" Ms. Vargas said. \"Again, that's something that's a worthy investment.\" There are plenty of in-office treatments, as well as at-home tools.\n\n\"There are some very summer-appropriate brightening lasers with zero downtime,\" Dr. Frank said. A popular option at his office is a laser called NeoElite, which evens out skin tone, redness and inflammation, boosting brilliance. Dr. Frank's office is also doing a lot of Genesis laser facials, which works to help with pores and brighten the skin. \"It's great for people who are just looking for skin maintenance without having to worry about downtime,\" he said.\n\nThere's Always Makeup\n\nThe finishing touch for a lit-from-within look, say the makeup artists, is a light wash of color. After moisturizing and priming, Ms. Dubroff uses a bit of sheer foundation on the sides of the nose, top of the chin and around the mouth where natural shadows occur, to get a natural highlighted look.\n\nThen she'll use a second, slightly deeper shade where any pigmentation occurs, then top off any spots with a concealer. She uses light washes of bronzer on the perimeter to bring more light to the face.\n\n\"It's adding that tone, which is just a sun-kissed wash of color,\" she said.\n\nThe last step of Ms. Dubroff's glow routine is to tap a couple of drops of highlighting fluid around the highest points. \"That last thing is like the pop of sunlight,\" she said.\n\nPatrick Ta, a makeup artist who recently introduced a makeup collection called Major Glow, is also a fan of glow-y makeup products, all over the body. He prefers body oils over self-tanners to get a bright look.\n\n\"Focus on the high points, like your shoulders, d\u00e9collet\u00e9, cheekbones, forehead, where you would naturally get more sun if you're standing outside,\" Mr. Ta said. \"I would add glow to those areas, so everything is cohesive.\"\n\nIf in doubt about your makeup abilities, Ms. Dubroff has a simple and easy solution to boosting skin's warmth. \"Get a jump rope or hula hoop, just to get your blood pumping,\" she said. \"Even five minutes of movement makes a big difference.\"",

        "body": "A new C.D.C. survey indicates that young people, as well as Blacks and Latinos of all ages, are showing signs of deteriorating mental health and some are resorting to substance abuse.\n\nThe collateral damage from the pandemic continues: Young adults, as well as Black and Latino people of all ages, describe rising levels of anxiety, depression and even suicidal thoughts, and increased substance abuse, according to findings reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn a research survey, U.S. residents reported signs of eroding mental health in reaction to the toll of coronavirus illnesses and deaths, and to the life-altering restrictions imposed by lockdowns.\n\nThe researchers argue that the results point to an urgent need for expanded and culturally sensitive services for mental health and substance abuse, including telehealth counseling. In the online survey completed by some 5,400 people in late June, the prevalence of anxiety symptoms was three times as high as those reported in the second quarter of 2019, and depression was four times as high.\n\nThe effects of the coronavirus outbreaks were felt most keenly by young adults ages 18 to 24. According to Mark Czeisler, a psychology researcher at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, nearly 63 percent had symptoms of anxiety or depression that they attributed to the pandemic and nearly a quarter had started or increased their abuse of substances, including alcohol, marijuana and prescription drugs, to cope with their emotions.\n\n\"It's ironic that young adults who are at lower risk than older adults of severe illness caused by Covid-19 are experiencing worse mental health symptoms,\" said Mr. Czeisler.\n\nA survey of about 5,000 people done in April, during the earlier days of the pandemic, Mr. Czeisler said, suggested that tremors in the mental health firmament were beginning to surface.\n\nAlready in April, high percentages of respondents reported they were spending more time on screens and less time outside than before the pandemic, which translated into more virtual interactions and far fewer in person. They noted upheavals to family, school, exercise and work routines, and to their sleeping patterns. All of these are factors that can contribute to the robustness of mental health.\n\nBut why do young adults appear to be crumbling at rates far greater than older people?\n\nMr. Czeisler said that the team hoped to conduct more research along those lines. He mentioned one direction of inquiry that could prove especially illuminating: measuring the extent to which people can tolerate uncertainty, or \"the ability to accept the unknown, because now there are so many questions, especially for young people, about relative risk, duration of the pandemic and what their futures will look like.\"\n\nIn this latest survey, nearly 41 percent overall reported symptoms of at least one adverse reaction, ranging from anxiety and depression to post-traumatic stress disorder. Nearly 11 percent said they had suicidal thoughts in the month leading up to the survey, with the greatest clusters being among Black and Latino people, essential workers and unpaid caregivers for adults. Men were more likely to express such feelings than women were.\n\nThe researchers, who represent a joint effort largely between Monash University and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said the symptoms were less pronounced in older groups, perhaps an indication that their longer life experience has been beneficial to helping them ride out the current turbulence.",

        "body": "\"These amazing young kids are running the whole show,\" said the owner of the Wood Cafe, which gives away food. \"Their energy propels it.\"\n\nThe line snaked around the block on a recent Sunday afternoon as Angelenos on foot and in their cars waited to receive grocery bags brimming with squash and tomatoes, multicolored carrots and loaves of fresh-baked bread from two dozen volunteers, most of them young.\n\nThe food giveaway took place under makeshift tents set up in the parking lot of the Wood Cafe in Culver City, Calif., which has been closed for business since early in the pandemic. Demetrios Mavromichalis, its owner, teamed up with Natalie Flores, an urban farmer and educator, to use the restaurant to store and distribute quality surplus organic and seasonal produce collected from local farmers' markets and grocery stores, as well as herb and vegetable seedlings from Ms. Flores's gardens to help people grow their own food.\n\nThey served over a thousand people, a number that has been growing weekly since the pandemic began. Mr. Mavromichalis credits the program's success to the \"dream team\" of high school and college-age volunteers.\n\n\"These amazing young kids are running the whole show,\" he said. \"We sit back and they just take over. They have a better idea of how to distribute the food, how to keep the line moving, how to distance people. Their energy propels it, they are not being micromanaged with adults telling them what to do.\"\n\nMr. Mavromichalis's 19-year-old son, Nikolaos, was recently appointed secretary of Nourish LA, the group formed to manage the enterprise.\n\n\"It's just a thrill to see my neighbors again,\" he said. \"It not like a 'handout of food to the needy,''' he said, explaining that they do not feel that they are \"doing charity,\" but rather sharing food with neighbors and friends. \"I want this to be the coolest, most fun thing that you can do, like a party.\"\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-09-01T08:25:36.896Z As U.S. cases decline elsewhere, the Midwest sees a worrying spike. The virus is spreading much faster in Spain than anywhere else in Europe. Health care workers with Covid-19 may be going undiagnosed, according to a C.D.C. report. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nDespite the upbeat spirit of the volunteers, the situation faced by many of the families that they serve remains grim. A perfect storm of job loss, rising food prices and school closings, and the loss of subsidized school meals, has resulted in \"a hidden epidemic of hunger in America\" said Crystal FitzSimons, a director with the Food Research and Action Center.\n\nAs of April, food insecurity in the United States had doubled over all and tripled among households with children over pre-pandemic levels, according to a report published by the Northwestern University Institute for Policy Research based on data in the U.S. Census Household Pulse Survey.\n\nThe institute's director, Diane Schanzenbach, said that the latest available figures, released in the middle of July, show that things have gotten a bit worse since April.\n\nThis crisis has become palpable for 14-year-old Maccabee Veder, who volunteers weekly at the Wood Cafe. \"In the cars sometimes there are little children. It's sad to see how the pandemic has affected them and that they don't have enough food,\" she said. \"Once I even recognized someone from my class.\"\n\nMaccabee's contribution this Sunday was placing a long-stemmed flower in each food bag. She was joined by 9-year-old Kalea Jade, who said, \"I don't just give food. I help to spread happiness and kindness.\"\n\nResearch shows that volunteering has a variety of benefits, including enhancing empathy, lowering the risk of depression, instilling a sense of purpose, and even improving one's physical health. Of special relevance during the Covid crisis, volunteering is also one of the best way to combat feelings of social isolation.\n\nAt a time of rising political polarization, reaching out to serve others can renew one's sense of shared national identity and purpose, says the Harvard developmental psychologist Richard Weissbourd, the director of the Making Caring Common Project, an organization that promotes civic engagement in the young.\n\n\"We have a lot of Americans who are vulnerable and suffering right now,\" he said. \"To the extent that we are all Americans, each one of us is responsible for all of us, that's an attitude that we want to cultivate in young people.\"\n\nDr. Weissbourd argues that service expands one's circle of concern beyond family and friends to \"people who are different from you, who you would not ordinarily meet.\" But he adds the proviso that one should serve others without condescension.\n\n\"What we worry about some with our work with high school students is that service takes the form of doing for others rather than doing with them, and it can become patronizing,\" Dr. Weissbourd said. \"There needs to be a reciprocal relationship where you are learning from them and receiving from them as well.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider. Does it have at least two layers? Good. If you hold it up to the light, can you see through it? Bad. Can you blow a candle out through your mask? Bad. Do you feel mostly OK wearing it for hours at a time? Good. The most important thing, after finding a mask that fits well without gapping, is to find a mask that you will wear. Spend some time picking out your mask, and find something that works with your personal style. You should be wearing it whenever you're out in public for the foreseeable future. Read more: What's the Best Material for a Mask?What are the symptoms of coronavirus?In the beginning, the coronavirus seemed like it was primarily a respiratory illness -- many patients had fever and chills, were weak and tired, and coughed a lot, though some people don't show many symptoms at all. Those who seemed sickest had pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome and received supplemental oxygen. By now, doctors have identified many more symptoms and syndromes. In April, the C.D.C. added to the list of early signs sore throat, fever, chills and muscle aches. Gastrointestinal upset, such as diarrhea and nausea, has also been observed. Another telltale sign of infection may be a sudden, profound diminution of one's sense of smell and taste. Teenagers and young adults in some cases have developed painful red and purple lesions on their fingers and toes -- nicknamed \"Covid toe\" -- but few other serious symptoms.Why does standing six feet away from others help?The coronavirus spreads primarily through droplets from your mouth and nose, especially when you cough or sneeze. The C.D.C., one of the organizations using that measure, bases its recommendation of six feet on the idea that most large droplets that people expel when they cough or sneeze will fall to the ground within six feet. But six feet has never been a magic number that guarantees complete protection. Sneezes, for instance, can launch droplets a lot farther than six feet, according to a recent study. It's a rule of thumb: You should be safest standing six feet apart outside, especially when it's windy. But keep a mask on at all times, even when you think you're far enough apart.I have antibodies. Am I now immune?As of right now, that seems likely, for at least several months. There have been frightening accounts of people suffering what seems to be a second bout of Covid-19. But experts say these patients may have a drawn-out course of infection, with the virus taking a slow toll weeks to months after initial exposure. People infected with the coronavirus typically produce immune molecules called antibodies, which are protective proteins made in response to an infection. These antibodies may last in the body only two to three months, which may seem worrisome, but that's perfectly normal after an acute infection subsides, said Dr. Michael Mina, an immunologist at Harvard University. It may be possible to get the coronavirus again, but it's highly unlikely that it would be possible in a short window of time from initial infection or make people sicker the second time.I'm a small-business owner. Can I get relief?The stimulus bills enacted in March offer help for the millions of American small businesses. Those eligible for aid are businesses and nonprofit organizations with fewer than 500 workers, including sole proprietorships, independent contractors and freelancers. Some larger companies in some industries are also eligible. The help being offered, which is being managed by the Small Business Administration, includes the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program. But lots of folks have not yet seen payouts. Even those who have received help are confused: The rules are draconian, and some are stuck sitting on money they don't know how to use. Many small-business owners are getting less than they expected or not hearing anything at all.What are my rights if I am worried about going back to work?Employers have to provide a safe workplace with policies that protect everyone equally. And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nThe opportunities for these kinds of interactions have diminished at a time when social distancing requirements limit our contact with others. But the restrictions have not prevented some young people from devising indirect ways to help.\n\nWhen sports were canceled at Acalanes High School in the San Francisco Bay Area because of the pandemic, Owen Estee called his friend Zach Appel to suggest that they offer lacrosse lessons to interested teens and donate their fees to the White Pony Express, a local group that delivers food to community organizations that serve the hungry. Zach thought of his grandmother, who was afraid to leave her house and needed people to go out and get her food. \"I realized how many people are like that, and maybe we can help them out,\" he said.\n\nThe boys, both 15, started Lacrosse Against Hunger, which has raised over $3,000 so far. \"After the pandemic, we want to get the rest of our team involved and start a lacrosse camp to continue raising money to buy food,\" Owen said.\n\nIn Columbus, Ohio, Aggie Barrington, age 9, visited a homeless shelter with her mother. The child was upset to see that the people there were not joining to eat hot meals together, as they had done before the pandemic. \"I said, 'Mom, can we please help,'\" Aggie recalled. Over dinner that night, the family talked it over and decided to make sack lunches and deliver them to the shelter. Aggie shared their idea in a video appeal posted on social media.\n\nOver 500 families joined in and 12,000 lunches have been delivered to the shelter since March, an effort that is being coordinated by the Columbus-based nonprofit Seeds of Caring.\n\n\"Maybe we're young, but we can still be powerful even though some adults think that we can't,\" Aggie said. \"Kids are novices about the way the world works,\" her mother, Molly Barrington, added. \"But they have tremendous hearts full of passion and compassion to serve others. We adults need to recapture that.\"\n\nThe future of our democracy may depend on restoring this ethic of mutual caring, says James Youniss, emeritus professor of psychology at the Catholic University of America in Washington. He participated in a 2007 study that showed that students who engaged in service projects in high school volunteered more often and voted in higher numbers later in life.\n\nDr. Youniss said he wished more schools had well-designed mandatory service requirements to help educate young people about the needs in their communities and instill in them a lifelong habit of becoming engaged.\n\n\"There's something bigger than themselves out there,\" he said. \"It's not just about my getting into a good college -- it's what I can be as a person, what I can contribute.\"",

        "body": "The usual diagnostic tests may simply be too sensitive and too slow to contain the spread of the virus.\n\nSome of the nation's leading public health experts are raising a new concern in the endless debate over coronavirus testing in the United States: The standard tests are diagnosing huge numbers of people who may be carrying relatively insignificant amounts of the virus.\n\nMost of these people are not likely to be contagious, and identifying them may contribute to bottlenecks that prevent those who are contagious from being found in time. But researchers say the solution is not to test less, or to skip testing people without symptoms, as recently suggested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nInstead, new data underscore the need for more widespread use of rapid tests, even if they are less sensitive.\n\n\"The decision not to test asymptomatic people is just really backward,\" said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, referring to the C.D.C. recommendation.\n\n\"In fact, we should be ramping up testing of all different people,\" he said, \"but we have to do it through whole different mechanisms.\"\n\nIn what may be a step in this direction, the Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would purchase 150 million rapid tests.\n\nThe most widely used diagnostic test for the new coronavirus, called a PCR test, provides a simple yes-no answer to the question of whether a patient is infected.\n\nBut similar PCR tests for other viruses do offer some sense of how contagious an infected patient may be: The results may include a rough estimate of the amount of virus in the patient's body.\n\n\"We've been using one type of data for everything, and that is just plus or minus -- that's all,\" Dr. Mina said. \"We're using that for clinical diagnostics, for public health, for policy decision-making.\"\n\nBut yes-no isn't good enough, he added. It's the amount of virus that should dictate the infected patient's next steps. \"It's really irresponsible, I think, to forgo the recognition that this is a quantitative issue,\" Dr. Mina said.\n\nLatest Updates: The Coronavirus Outbreak Updated 2020-08-29T07:17:04.982Z California will allow indoor dining in San Diego and San Francisco as early as next week. Two P.R. experts at the F.D.A. have been removed after the fiasco over convalescent plasma. 'We are incredibly concerned': Local health departments urge the C.D.C. to pull its new guidance on testing. See more updates More live coverage: Markets\n\nThe PCR test amplifies genetic matter from the virus in cycles; the fewer cycles required, the greater the amount of virus, or viral load, in the sample. The greater the viral load, the more likely the patient is to be contagious.\n\nThis number of amplification cycles needed to find the virus, called the cycle threshold, is never included in the results sent to doctors and coronavirus patients, although it could tell them how infectious the patients are.\n\nIn three sets of testing data that include cycle thresholds, compiled by officials in Massachusetts, New York and Nevada, up to 90 percent of people testing positive carried barely any virus, a review by The Times found.\n\nOn Thursday, the United States recorded 45,604 new coronavirus cases, according to a database maintained by The Times. If the rates of contagiousness in Massachusetts and New York were to apply nationwide, then perhaps only 4,500 of those people may actually need to isolate and submit to contact tracing.\n\nOne solution would be to adjust the cycle threshold used to decide that a patient is infected. Most tests set the limit at 40, a few at 37. This means that you are positive for the coronavirus if the test process required up to 40 cycles, or 37, to detect the virus.\n\nTests with thresholds so high may detect not just live virus but also genetic fragments, leftovers from infection that pose no particular risk -- akin to finding a hair in a room long after a person has left, Dr. Mina said.\n\nAny test with a cycle threshold above 35 is too sensitive, agreed Juliet Morrison, a virologist at the University of California, Riverside. \"I'm shocked that people would think that 40 could represent a positive,\" she said.\n\nA more reasonable cutoff would be 30 to 35, she added. Dr. Mina said he would set the figure at 30, or even less. Those changes would mean the amount of genetic material in a patient's sample would have to be 100-fold to 1,000-fold higher than the current standard for the test to return a positive result.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said in an emailed statement that it does not specify the cycle threshold ranges used to determine who is positive, and that \"commercial manufacturers and laboratories set their own.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it is examining the use of cycle threshold measures \"for policy decisions.\" The agency said it would need to collaborate with the F.D.A. and with device manufacturers to ensure the measures \"can be used properly and with assurance that we know what they mean.\"\n\nThe C.D.C.'s own calculations suggest that it is extremely difficult to detect any live virus in a sample above a threshold of 33 cycles. Officials at some state labs said the C.D.C. had not asked them to note threshold values or to share them with contact-tracing organizations.\n\nFor example, North Carolina's state lab uses the Thermo Fisher coronavirus test, which automatically classifies results based on a cutoff of 37 cycles. A spokeswoman for the lab said testers did not have access to the precise numbers.\n\nThis amounts to an enormous missed opportunity to learn more about the disease, some experts said.\n\n\"It's just kind of mind-blowing to me that people are not recording the C.T. values from all these tests -- that they're just returning a positive or a negative,\" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York.\n\n\"It would be useful information to know if somebody's positive, whether they have a high viral load or a low viral load,\" she added.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak \"Frequently Asked Questions\n\nUpdated August 27, 2020\n\nWhat should I consider when choosing a mask?There are a few basic things to consider.

And if one of your co-workers tests positive for the coronavirus, the C.D.C. has said that employers should tell their employees -- without giving you the sick employee's name -- that they may have been exposed to the virus.\n\nOfficials at the Wadsworth Center, New York's state lab, have access to C.T. values from tests they have processed, and analyzed their numbers at The Times's request. In July, the lab identified 794 positive tests, based on a threshold of 40 cycles.\n\nWith a cutoff of 35, about half of those tests would no longer qualify as positive. About 70 percent would no longer be judged positive if the cycles were limited to 30.\n\nIn Massachusetts, from 85 to 90 percent of people who tested positive in July with a cycle threshold of 40 would have been deemed negative if the threshold were 30 cycles, Dr. Mina said. \"I would say that none of those people should be contact-traced, not one,\" he said.\n\nOther experts informed of these numbers were stunned.\n\n\"I'm really shocked that it could be that high -- the proportion of people with high C.T. value results,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \"Boy, does it really change the way we need to be thinking about testing.\"\n\nDr. Jha said he had thought of the PCR test as a problem because it cannot scale to the volume, frequency or speed of tests needed. \"But what I am realizing is that a really substantial part of the problem is that we're not even testing the people who we need to be testing,\" he said.\n\nThe number of people with positive results who aren't infectious is particularly concerning, said Scott Becker, executive director of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. \"That worries me a lot, just because it's so high,\" he said, adding that the organization intended to meet with Dr. Mina to discuss the issue.\n\nThe F.D.A. noted that people may have a low viral load when they are newly infected. A test with less sensitivity would miss these infections.\n\nBut that problem is easily solved, Dr. Mina said: \"Test them again, six hours later or 15 hours later or whatever,\" he said. A rapid test would find these patients quickly, even if it were less sensitive, because their viral loads would quickly rise.\n\nPCR tests still have a role, he and other experts said. For example, their sensitivity is an asset when identifying newly infected people to enroll in clinical trials of drugs.\n\nBut with 20 percent or more of people testing positive for the virus in some parts of the country, Dr. Mina and other researchers are questioning the use of PCR tests as a frontline diagnostic tool.\n\nPeople infected with the virus are most infectious from a day or two before symptoms appear till about five days after. But at the current testing rates, \"you're not going to be doing it frequently enough to have any chance of really capturing somebody in that window,\" Dr. Mina added.\n\nHighly sensitive PCR tests seemed like the best option for tracking the coronavirus at the start of the pandemic. But for the outbreaks raging now, what's needed are coronavirus tests that are fast, cheap and abundant enough to frequently test everyone who needs it -- even if the tests are less sensitive.\n\n\"It might not catch every last one of the transmitting people, but it sure will catch the most transmissible people, including the superspreaders,\" Dr. Mina said. \"That alone would drive epidemics practically to zero.\"",
