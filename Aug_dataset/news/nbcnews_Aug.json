    "'A little bit of hope': COVID-curbing efforts may mean milder flu season": {

        "body": "Experts have been raising the alarm about the coming flu season, warning that the combination of the seasonal virus plus COVID-19 could overwhelm the nation's health care system. But global efforts to curb the spread of the coronavirus may mean the U.S. is in for a milder flu season.\n\nIndeed, it appears efforts to curtail the coronavirus have led to significantly fewer cases of influenza in the Southern Hemisphere, currently in the midst of its winter months, which is typically a precursor to the U.S.'s flu season.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"If we look at what they've been seeing in Australia, and we use the Southern Hemisphere to predict what our next season is going to be, they've had a quieter flu season,\" Dr. Kristin Englund, an infectious diseases expert at the Cleveland Clinic, said. \"We think that's because people have been using measures to prevent COVID-19.\"\n\nDr. Christopher Ohl, a professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that \"there is a little bit of hope that the flu season will a little less severe this year.\"\n\nIf infection control measures -- including travel restrictions, hand-washing, physical distancing and mask wearing -- work for COVID-19, Ohl said, they're \"going to work for flu, too.\"\n\nThat said, there are plenty of reasons experts remain concerned about the upcoming flu season. Unlike the coronavirus that hasn't shown seasonal patterns, influenza is sure to make a comeback as the weather turns colder. And it can have devastating effects on the nation's health care system, filling both emergency rooms and intensive care units.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that during the 2019-20 season, there were as many as 56 million flu illnesses in the U.S., resulting in up to 740,000 hospitalizations.\n\nCoupled with COVID-19, the flu will \"put significant strain on how many people are in emergency department, how many people are admitted to a hospital, how many people need a ventilator,\" said Dr. Marybeth Sexton, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta.\n\n\"We really need to prevent having both of those illnesses hit at the same time.\"\n\nOne way to lower the risk of flu is to get a flu shot, and indeed, many pharmacies are already advertising flu vaccines for the upcoming season. Last week, Dr. Brett Giroir, who oversees coronavirus testing for the Trump administration, told NBC News that the federal government has ordered extra flu shots this year.\n\nSome infectious disease experts maintain, however, that August is too early for most people to get the shot.\n\n\"We're recommending people wait until October,\" Englund said. \"If people get the flu vaccine now, protection may not extend throughout the entire flu season.\"\n\nStill, expect a major public health push for flu vaccines within the next few months, even though it does not prevent a majority of influenza illnesses. Studies have shown the vaccine can help lessen the severity of the flu.\n\n\"We're all scrambling and frantic to try and get a COVID-19 vaccine. Why not use the vaccine that we currently have available to protect ourselves?\" Englund said.\n\nComplicating matters for physicians is that symptoms of the flu and COVID-19 can overlap: fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, body aches.\n\n\"It's very hard to tell them apart,\" Sexton said. \"And they have different incubation periods, different recommendations about when it's safe to return to work or normal activity after you have them.\"\n\nThe coronavirus \"is proving exceptionally difficult to stop. It's difficult to recognize; it's difficult to distinguish between it and other syndromes unless you have adequate and immediate testing,\" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of the World Health Organization's health emergencies program, said during a news conference Monday.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThat means quick and accurate testing for both flu and COVID-19 will be critical this fall. According to Giroir, point-of-care tests for the coronavirus, like rapid flu or strep tests, should be readily accessible within the coming months.\n\nHe added that he anticipates such tests would be administered in conjunction with flu tests, using the same samples.\n\nEnglund was not as optimistic. \"What may happen is that you get ruled out in the doctor's office for influenza, and are told the sample will then be sent off for COVID testing,\" she said.\n\nIn addition to getting a flu vaccine within the next few months, Ohl said there are several things people can do now to slow the spread of all respiratory viruses: wear a mask, wash your hands and avoid large gatherings.\n\n\"If we do all of those things,\" Ohl said, \"we can hopefully dampen down COVID, the flu and all of those other nasty cold viruses that you can get this time of year.\"",

    "'Disaster inside a disaster': California wildfires and COVID-19 form twin crises": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NAPA, Calif. -- The California LNU Lightning Complex fire has charred more than 350,000 acres, destroyed more than 900 structures, claimed the lives of at least five people and forced thousands more to flee their homes as it rampages in all directions.\n\nBut the destructive walls of flames -- spanning parts of normally lush Sonoma, Lake and Napa wine counties, north of San Francisco -- are not the only crisis in this fragile region.\n\n\"We've had a four-fer, with COVID, a heat wave, wildfires and the threat of roving power outages,\" Janet Upton, a spokeswoman for Napa County and a former deputy director of Cal Fire, said.\n\nThe spread of the coronavirus across the Bay Area makes the already very challenging acts of firefighting and evacuating far more difficult. What's more, according to experts from the Washington State Department of Health, breathing in wildfire smoke may worsen the symptoms of COVID-19, make people more susceptible to general respiratory infections, and put strains on overall mental health.\n\nThis year's fire season is one of the most active in state history: more than 7,000 blazes have torn through some 1.4 million acres, fueled in part by dry conditions. But because fire is only one part of the problem, health experts, firefighters, emergency responders and local leaders all report that they are grappling with a multilayered crisis of overwhelming scale, putting enormous burdens on people on the front lines.\n\nIn the town of Sonoma, where air quality continues to be unhealthy because of wildfire smoke, retired San Francisco firefighter Bob Cuff, who has asthma, is staying inside. \"I don't go out much when the air is bad. Just a quick run to the grocery store. But that's also because of COVID. I'm trying to stay away from other people,\" he said.\n\nIn recent days, he's felt his throat and lungs get congested, and doesn't go anywhere without his inhaler.\n\n\"I'll be 68 in December. I smoked until I was 50. I was a fireman: I smoked sofas!\" Cuff, who served in the San Francisco Fire Department for 27 years, said with a throaty laugh. \"I'm compromised in so many different ways like that.\"\n\nZac Unger, a firefighter who has been with the Oakland Fire Department for 22 years, said crews were \"stretched incredibly thin\" and in some cases working more than 100-hour shifts.\n\nUnger, who said he had been on call for 120 hours straight, patrolling for new fires, noted firefighters were doing all they could to contain the inferno while staying safe from COVID-19 infection.\n\n\"It is manifestly an unsafe situation both as it relates to fire and as it relates to COVID,\" he said.\n\nIn what he described as \"another risk on top of the other risks,\" firefighters are also assisting people who have COVID-19.\n\n\"I've got a wife and three kids, and that's the hardest part. My kids are scared to hug me on days when I treat COVID patients,\" Unger said. \"There's a bit of distance that our job has created between us and our families. It breaks your heart when you can't give your little kid a hug.\"\n\nThe disruptions caused by the fires have raised concerns about an increased risk of COVID-19 transmission, as evacuees and rescue workers might cluster together.\n\n\"Whenever we have people who are in constant contact with one another that don't normally live together, there's definitely a risk of transmission of COVID,\" Sonoma County Health Officer Dr. Sundari Mase said at a press briefing Monday.\n\nNapa County has provided shelter services to some 313 people since the fires broke out last week due to widespread lightning strikes, according to Upton. The county has been scrambling to help residents amid what she described as a \"disaster inside a disaster.\"\n\nThe plans include a shelter inside the Crosswalk Community Church, just off Highway 29 in Napa, where hundreds of residents forced from their homes have sought refuge in recent days. The church has served as the primary evacuation center for decades; this year is starkly different.\n\nThis summer, the cots inside the church's sanctuary are only being used as temporary places to rest instead of places to sleep overnight.\n\n\"Because of COVID, people who are verified evacuees ... are being put up at hotels locally,\" said Peter Shaw, the senior pastor, who has worked at the church for 20 years and helped with local disaster relief for two earthquakes, two floods and three fires.\n\n\"We can usually get a couple hundred people in here, but now we're down to about 50 [cots],\" he said, gesturing to rows of empty green fabric cots carefully spaced apart to allow for social distancing.\n\nShaw said the church hands out $2,000 in gift cards every day to people affected by the blazes, most of which are donated by locals.\n\n\"Everything dropped off here must be disinfected,\" he said, surrounded by volunteers and staffers checking in new arrivals and hunched over laptops at folding tables, making phone calls in English and Spanish.\n\nOutside the church, under a beige sky thick with smoke, a steady stream of people trickled in and had their temperatures taken, part of screenings for COVID-19. Upton said people who tested positive for COVID-19 or who had been under self-quarantine were moved to a separate space at the shelter.\n\nIn addition to converting its sanctuary to a temporary rest stop, Crosswalk has dozens of cots set up -- always six feet apart -- inside its gym. County staff members and volunteers from the Community Organization Active in Disaster, or COAD, keep the operation running around the clock in two 12-hour shifts.\n\nBut for some residents, the already traumatizing threat of having to evacuate is even more stressful because of the coronavirus. Sonoma County has seen cases spike in recent weeks.\n\nMichelle Petersen, a resident of Santa Rosa and a private duty nurse who works in home care, believes a shelter would not be feasible for her family. She has two developmentally disabled children, ages 18 and 21, one of whom is immunocompromised. Her husband is currently undergoing chemotherapy to fight stage 3 colon cancer and spent June in a hospital. One child is diabetic, as is her husband.\n\n\"Because of my son and my husband, a shelter would not be good, because it's a breeding ground for diseases,\" she said. \"I'm worried all the time for my family,\" she added, noting that even limited contact with hotel staff and the logistics of being away from home concern her now.\n\nPeterson said her family was evacuated during two previous California fires -- the Tubbs fire and the Kincade fire in 2017 and 2019, respectively. This year, she began making an evacuation plan for the new blaze as soon as it broke out Aug. 17. For the time being, the Petersons are staying at their home, windows closed, to prevent smoke from getting inside.\n\n\"We only go out if we have to go out, and it's usually me who goes out, like for medication,\" she said.\n\n\"We just try to go with the flow and make the best we can of our situation. There's not much we can do to change anything, so we just hope for the best. You just never know.\"",

    "'They keep me alive': Prescription drugs delayed by Postal Service put thousands at risk": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Jan Stowe saw countless patients go through withdrawals during her 40-year nursing career, but last month she experienced it herself when the U.S. Postal Service failed to deliver her medication for chronic back pain and muscle spasms.\n\nA nurse for combat veterans during and after the Vietnam War, Stowe said she could identify her own symptoms but couldn't do anything but wait in her Traverse City, Michigan, home.\n\n\"I was jittery. I was anxious. I wasn't able to concentrate. I was pacing. I was feeling nauseous. I was sweating. It was all the symptoms,\" Stowe said of last month's experience. \"I mean, I've never taken heroin, but I've taken care of drug addicts. Now I know what it feels like.\"\n\nStowe, whose back problems forced her into retirement, is among thousands of Americans who have missed their prescription medications because of Postal Service delays. A dramatic decrease in on-time deliveries since the beginning of July has put lives in jeopardy as a growing number of people depend on getting their prescriptions by mail.\n\nThe Postal Service manages 1.2 billion prescription drug shipments a year -- or about 4 million each day, six days a week -- the National Association of Letter Carriers reported earlier this year. That number has grown during the pandemic, and many recipients are accusing President Donald Trump and the White House of orchestrating mail delays to undermine mail-in voting. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said last week that he would suspend any operational changes to the Postal Service until after the election to avoid any impact on voting by mail. But that doesn't address secondary effects, such as delayed prescriptions and the economic fallout on small businesses.\n\nErin Fox, a pharmacotherapy professor at the University of Utah, emphasized that most prescriptions fulfilled through the mail treat chronic conditions, rather than short-term prescriptions, like a course of antibiotics.\n\nShe said these medications often treat cholesterol or high blood pressure -- and without them, patients could have heart attacks or strokes -- but also consist of inhalers, insulin and anti-rejection medicines for people who have had organ transplants.\n\n\"Delays with the postal system is very concerning because patients may not be able to access the chronic medications that they need,\" she said.\n\nFor Ray Carolin, an Air Force veteran and former Secret Service agent who lives in Lafayette, Indiana, delayed medications can be the difference between life and death. When the Postal Service doesn't deliver the medications sent by the Veterans Administration, which fulfills 80 percent of its prescriptions by mail, Carolin is left scrambling to find the drugs he needs and forced to pay out of pocket.\n\n\"Those drugs are pretty important to me -- they keep me alive,\" Carolin said. \"And on one occasion I had to drive 60 miles to go over to the VA hospital in Indy because I hadn't received some heart medicine. And on another drug that I had to have, I had to go to CVS Pharmacy locally here in Lafayette as opposed to driving over to Indianapolis, and I had to go buy my medicine because I didn't get it from VA.\"\n\nSens. Bob Casey and Elizabeth Warren, of Pennsylvania and Massachusetts, respectively, are attempting to bear down on the issue by reaching out to the companies that actually fulfill the prescriptions.\n\nThe two Senate Democrats sent a series of letters to the top five mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers -- including Cigna's service, CVS and Walgreens -- about the delivery delays of prescription drugs sent to older people, veterans and millions of other Americans, who, they wrote, face \"grave risks if President Trump's efforts to degrade the mail service results in delays and disruptions.\"\n\nCasey told NBC News that he had received more than 97,000 letters from constituents about the policies instituted by DeJoy, a longtime Republican ally and former logistics executive who admitted during a congressional hearing Friday that his changes had caused some of the delays.\n\nSen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, pressed DeJoy about prescription drugs on Friday, telling him of the \"heartbreaking stories\" he's heard, sharing the anecdote of a veteran with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who reached out to his office after enduring a long wait to receive his inhaler.\n\n\"We are working here feverishly to get the system running, add stability and also to hire more workers to handle the delivery process,\" DeJoy said. \"We all feel bad about the dip in our service level.\"\n\nConstituents from all 67 of Pennsylvania's counties have reached out to Casey's office, from \"veterans missing medications in Clarion County to small-business owners in Wexford who depend on reliable postal service to deliver their products to their customers,\" Casey said.\n\n\"I've heard from young families with immunocompromised children waiting for days for mail to refill their empty prescriptions in the suburbs of our major metro areas,\" the senator added. \"The Trump administration's sabotage at the USPS is felt across Pennsylvania, but we know that it is particularly harmful to rural communities.\"\n\nWhat many may not realize is that the insurance industry has forced or heavily incentivized a lot of prescriptions to be sent via mail, Fox said. All of the major insurance companies have a mail-order system, which tends to be cheaper and easier for patients -- especially as they don't always have to remember to refill their prescriptions themselves.\n\nBut if patients run out of medications and try to switch to a local pharmacy, they may run into a number of stumbling blocks.\n\n\"In some cases, the insurer just really may not allow it, and then they may charge them a lot more,\" Fox said. \"Logistically, it's a hassle. They're going to have to make phone calls and try to get things switched, and it's not an easy process to do that.\"\n\nIt's also an especially fraught time to be dealing with these issues, as many at-risk Americans with pre-existing conditions have turned to mail delivery for prescriptions because they want to avoid public spaces during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMax Cooper, a Pennsylvania doctor who works outside Philadelphia, said he got his in-laws three months' worth of prescriptions when COVID-19 began to sweep across the country because they were vulnerable to the disease. Mail delivery has helped, as well.\n\nBut after hearing about these mail delays, Cooper -- a veteran of the war in Afghanistan who now works with the Committee to Protect Medicare -- said he quickly thought of the people he treated right after they came off the battlefield in Helmand Province, one of the most dangerous regions in Afghanistan, and those he helped in Philadelphia at the VA hospital where he volunteered.\n\nAll of them likely depend on the VA for their prescription drugs, and most receive their medications by mail.\n\n\"Every single shift that I was there, there was a veteran in some sort of psychiatric crisis where they were struggling because they couldn't get the antidepressants or anti-anxiety medications that they clearly needed to treat their service-related psychiatric disorders,\" he said of his time working at the VA hospital. \"I saw veterans having strokes, suffering from diabetes and heart issues.\"\n\n\"This is just one more way to prevent these folks from getting the drugs that they so critically need,\" Cooper added. \"That means more veterans are going to have heart attacks, strokes and die early lives full of unneeded suffering.\"\n\nCasey said the mail crisis highlights the need for USPS to receive additional funding, though Trump has previously threatened to veto any bill that included dollars earmarked for the federal agency. Nevertheless, Congress continues to debate whether to provide the Postal Service with $25 billion to help it through the pandemic.\n\nThe Pennsylvania senator plans to \"keep pressing the administration to increase the funding for USPS and reverse the harmful policies that caused the service delays.\"\n\nFor patients like Stowe, that pressure is necessary to avoid \"the misery\" she said she experienced, which kept her from being able to turn her head or neck. While her pain medication was life-altering, she said, there are many others who need their medications to survive.\n\n\"We've just got to get the Postal Service funded because so many people do rely on it for their medication,\" Stowe said. \"Without it, people are going to die.\"",

    "'They put us all in danger': UNC-Chapel Hill students outraged after quick shift to virtual learning": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill students scrambled on Tuesday to move out of their dorm rooms, make decisions about their academic futures and demand tuition refunds, they had one message for administrators.\n\nWe told you so.\n\n\"Everybody told the university not to reopen, and it was only a matter of time,\" said Nikhil Rao, a student government senior adviser who has participated in online meetings with provost Bob Blouin every month since April along with other student leaders. \"I would be shocked if I didn't know this was going to happen.\"\n\nThe university, which disregarded concerns from faculty members, staff workers, Black student leaders, student campus leaders and local county health officials to become one of the largest campuses in the country to reopen for students amid the coronavirus pandemic, announced Monday that it was shifting to fully remote learning after reporting 135 new COVID-19 cases and four clusters.\n\nAll of this after one week of classes.\n\nNow faced with both a literal and figurative \"clusterf---\" -- which is how the college newspaper, The Daily Tar Heel, described the situation in an editorial headline -- many students told NBC News that the university's attempt to scramble together an \"off-ramp\" plan have left them feeling outraged and disrespected.\n\n\"Why did we wait until everybody's lives were in jeopardy?\" Rao said. \"They put us all in danger.\"\n\nSince the campus closed in March, Blouin met online regularly with student leaders such as Rao and student government senior adviser Raleigh Cury to discuss plans to reopen the campus.\n\n\"There was a consensus among all student leaders who were involved in those meetings that remote learning was the best and only option,\" Cury said. \"The only exception was for students who needed to be there due to lack of internet access, or any other barrier that wasn't conducive for academic success at home.\"\n\nEven with preventative measures, it would be unrealistic to expect thousands of young adults in their late teens and early 20s to properly socially distance, student leaders told Blouin since April, Cury said. The flagship campus at UNC has close to 30,000 students, including graduate students.\n\n\"It's not the fault of young adults to do the things young adults want to do,\" she said.\n\nUNC-Chapel Hill's Provost Office did not immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment.\n\nIn an emergency meeting Monday between the university administration and faculty's council committee, Blouin said that had infection rates tapered off during the summer, the university would have had a \"high shot of making this.\"\n\n\"I don't apologize for trying to give this campus the opportunity to return to its mission on behalf of the people of North Carolina,\" Blouin said, according to Inside Higher Ed.\n\nChancellor Kevin Guskiewicz and Blouin said in a statement that spiraling case counts had created an \"untenable situation.\"\n\n\"As we have always said, the health and safety of our campus community are paramount, and we will continue to modify and adapt our plan when necessary,\" they said.\n\nThe announcement to shift to virtual learning came less than an hour after the university updated its CV-19 dashboard, which tracks metrics like tests conducted, positive cases, and quarantine and isolation capacity.\n\nFor the week of Aug. 10 to Aug. 16, the dashboard reported 135 new COVID-19 cases -- 130 students and five employees. Most students have mild symptoms, according to the university.\n\nThe cumulative rate of positive COVID-19 test results is 10.6 percent, according to the dashboard -- higher than the statewide rate of 7.5 percent. And out of the 954 tests conducted that same week, 135 positives, or 13.6 percent, were reported -- a spike from 2.8 percent the previous week.\n\n\"We are working with the UNC System office to identify the most effective way to further achieve de-densification of our residential halls and our campus facilities,\" Guskiewicz and Blouin said in the statement.\n\nBefore the university's about-face, less than 60 percent of residence halls were occupied and less than 30 percent total classroom seats were taught in-person. The university's student-athletes will attend online classes but continue their fall sports seasons.\n\nUNC-Chapel Hill's decision to go remote is a pattern many other universities are likely to follow, education and health experts say. Hundreds of colleges in recent weeks have already backtracked on reopening for in-person instruction. The University of Notre Dame on Tuesday suspended in-person classes after 146 students and one staff member tested positive for COVID-19, while Ithaca College announced it was extending remote learning and not welcoming students back for the fall semester.\n\nTo make matters worse for UNC-Chapel Hill students, \"Monday's announcement came one hour and 15 minutes before the 5 p.m. deadline for fall tuition cancellations,\" said Lamar Richards, a student chairperson on the Commission on Campus Equality and Student Equity at UNC.\n\n\"It's painstakingly clear that it's never been about the students,\" said Sadie Tice, a sophomore. \"Every decision they have made has been about money, and announcing it a mere week after classes start and an hour before tuition is due is almost cruel.\"\n\nRichards said that the commission, which polled over 1,000 students about how the university should handle the transition to virtual classes, found that the majority wanted extensions on deadlines for tuition refunds and a school-wide pass-or-fail option for courses this fall.\n\nA university spokesperson said that more information about tuition reimbursement will be made in consultation with the UNC system and will be released in the coming days.\n\nStudents and the wider campus community have not had a moment to rest, Rao said. \"We've been here for a little more than a week, and now students have to wait until the weekend for their parents to send them home,\" he said. \"It's absurd how chaotic this has been. There are so many questions about funding, about refunds, about what students should do.\"\n\nTice hopes that other universities are paying attention -- and considering UNC-Chapel Hill's struggles before reopening campuses for the fall semester.\n\n\"UNC leaders have had the tools and the information they need to have made the right decision the entire time and they chose not to,\" Tice said. \"The only thing that has changed in this last week is we have proven the predictions of what would happen to be true.\"",

    "'What happens to me if I get sick?' Pandemic complicates high-risk job for federal firefighters": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Federal firefighter units tasked with putting out some of the nation's biggest wildfires are grappling with the reality of a fire season coinciding with a pandemic.\n\nAs historic wildfires have spread through much of the West this summer, firefighters organized within the Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture's U.S. Forest Service are testing positive for COVID-19 -- having to, at times, learn on the fly how to mitigate the spread as virus spikes hit various fire camps assigned to active blazes.\n\nWildland firefighters are sometimes considered the last defense, called in after local resources are stretched thin. Federal crews spend the fire season crisscrossing state borders as they are sent to fight the latest burning blaze. And that constant traveling, as well as the close working proximity, have offered a challenge to COVID-19 mitigation, especially as firefighting methods like holding the line can require elbow-to-elbow teamwork.\n\nIn a normal year, the coordination between the Interior Department's bureaus and the Forest Service, who compile the federal wildfire response, is complex. COVID-19 has added another element of complication.\n\nArizona's Bush fire was one of the first major fires this season, and was one of the first to test out the dual challenge of firefighting during a pandemic. The blaze, first started by a car fire in the state's Sonoran Desert, burned nearly 200,000 acres, ultimately becoming the fifth largest fire ever in the state.\n\n\"We kind of live for this. This is a mission of ours. You know, we become firefighters because we want to protect the land and serve the people,\" said Eric Solomon, a Forest Service public affairs officer for the Tonto National Forest, where the Bush fire was. \"At the beginning of this fire season, COVID was still something that we really didn't understand. So, there was definitely an element of fear there that, 'What happens to me if I get sick?'\"\n\nAt one point, as many as 855 firefighters were assigned to fight the Bush fire. In late June, eight members of an Oregon-based Bureau of Land Management fire crew working to fight the fire tested positive for COVID-19 just days after arriving at the camp. They had to be quarantined at hotels with nine others that they came in contact with. The cluster of cases was considered to possibly be one of the largest COVID-19 exposures to firefighters so far this year, according to a report by John Szulc, fire risk management officer in the Pacific Northwest/Alaska region.\n\nThe incident was just one of many virus exposures that have so far taken place this fire season, with agency coordinators anticipating the number to grow. Fear of spread is especially heightened as experts warn breathing in wildfire smoke could worsen the symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\"COVID has added another logistical layer on top of an already complicated logistical situation where you are providing for personnel safety, saving homes, and now providing for reducing spread amongst hundreds or thousands of firefighters on one incident,\" a spokesperson for the National Interagency Fire Center, which organizes national fire response across the agencies, said.\n\nState and federal fire crews have had months between the onset of the pandemic and the anticipated fire season to prepare for the collision of the two, and many lead with the working assumption that crews would inevitably test positive.\n\n\"The reality is you're going to see positives in camp, that's just the era we are in globally,\" Mariana Ruiz-Temple, Oregon's chief deputy fire marshal, said. \"Knowing that and not being afraid of that, is what's important.\"\n\nA joint study published this month by the Forest Service's Rocky Mountain Research Station and the Colorado State University that modeled potential COVID-19 spread among fire camps, found that in the worst case scenario, more than 5 percent of all fire crew would be infected on the job, with it proving fatal for 1 percent.\n\nThe number of positive COVID-19 cases in federal firefighting crews is not being tracked on the national level. Instead, individual bureaus are responsible for counting and publicly sharing that data.\n\nTo date, 45 Bureau of Land Management firefighters, 122 Forest Service firefighters and one U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service firefighter have tested positive for the virus, according to each agency respectively. A seasonal firefighter working for the Bureau of Land Management in Fairbanks, Alaska, died Aug. 13 shortly after testing positive for COVID-19 while on the job. So far, 54 firefighters within the Bureau of Indian Affairs have tested positive for COVID-19, a source told NBC News, and the bureau confirmed five agency firefighters are currently positive with the virus. The National Park Service would not provide the total number of its fire staff who had tested positive, despite multiple requests.\n\nTo counter the virus's spread, crews have changed many aspects of their on-the-ground fire response including organizing smaller sleeping camps, suspending buffet lines, adopting Zoom-based morning check-ins and wearing masks during transport. But the adaptation has still offered challenges.\n\nIn one June incident, several firefighters across three states tested positive for the virus after a member of a fire helicopter, or helitack, team contracted COVID-19. The person on the helitack team for the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest started experiencing fever and chills while fighting the breakout of the Murphy fire in Nevada. That crew member self-isolated, but none of the 13 other members of the crew went for testing or were isolated, according to a report by the safety officer for Humboldt-Toiyabe.\n\n\"This was the third helitack crew member to be tested in the last couple weeks. Therefore, the apparent regularity of this process may have introduced a relaxed mood within the crew, not to mention the two previous negative test results,\" the author of the report wrote.\n\nDays later, those crew members were assigned to a fire at Colorado's San Juan National Forest. One crew member and another dispatcher later tested positive, which ultimately led to the suspension of helitack operations for 14 days. Two Forest Service firefighters from Georgia's Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest who had been detailed to the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, later also came down with COVID-19.\n\n\"Managing COVID-19 in the wildfire suppression environment is an exercise in trade-offs,\" the safety officer wrote. \"The threat of community impact from a wildfire has been deemed more significant than the threat of community spread from a potential exposure to COVID-19. What size of outbreak or degree of hospitalization will it take to change this dynamic? It's not a matter of 'if it will happen.' It's a matter of 'when.'\"\n\nSolomon is more positive about the learning curve firefighters have had to deal with, when considering the balance of doing their jobs and being safe. He said wildland crews this year have largely been able to quickly learn how to best mitigate risks.\n\n\"I think we're just adaptable. This is different. People just realized we just needed to do things a little differently this year,\" he said. \"It's just a new normal for us now.\"",

    "1 death among 53 coronavirus cases linked to Maine wedding reception": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "At least 53 cases of the coronavirus have been traced back to an Aug. 7 wedding and reception in Maine that violated attendance limits, state health officials said. A local hospital said Friday one person whose infection has been linked to the event has died.\n\nAbout 65 people attended the reception at the Big Moose Inn Cabins and Campground in Millinocket, about 70 miles north of Bangor, the Maine Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. The Maine governor's executive orders limit gatherings to 50 people indoors, 100 people outdoors and fewer if the space cannot accommodate five people per 1,000 feet.\n\nOf the 53 cases linked to the reception, 13 were secondary and 10 were tertiary, Maine CDC spokesman Robert Long told NBC News. In other words, it spread to people who did not attend the wedding or reception, but had close contact with individuals who did.\n\nThe inn did not immediately return a request for comment Monday. It was cited for what was called an imminent health hazard, which Long said carries no fine but can result in harsher penalties if state officials determine the venue violated health rules again.\n\nThe outbreak affected individuals from 4 to 98 years old, officials said.\n\nThe Maine CDC advises anyone who attended an event at the inn on Aug. 7, and who has symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, to contact their health care provider.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Millinocket Regional Hospital CEO Robert Peterson said one patient who had been linked to the reception had died. The statement did not identify the patient.\n\n\"Our thoughts and sympathies are with her family as they cope with this difficult loss,\" he said.\n\nThe hospital tested 366 people who attended the reception or came in contact with those who did, Peterson said.\n\nAll positive patients have been notified, given care instructions, and told to quarantine, the hospital said. Because of the outbreak, the hospital is closed to visitors.\n\nThe Maine CDC noted that social gatherings -- such as weddings and receptions -- pose an elevated risk for virus transmission.\n\n\"The possibility of COVID-19 transmission increases as the number of attendees increases, even when some attendees are indoors and others are outdoors,\" it said in a statement. \"This is because outdoor attendees may reasonably be expected to come indoors and interact with others, increasing the possibility of COVID-19 transmission.\"\n\nIndoor gatherings pose extra risk compared to outdoor gatherings, because of the challenges of ensuring adequate social distancing and ventilation, the Maine CDC said.\n\nMore than a dozen guests who attended a wedding June 20 in The Woodlands, Texas, about an hour outside Houston, tested positive for the coronavirus days later, The New York Times reported this month.\n\nOver the last several months, concerns about the spread of the coronavirus at large gatherings has prompted many couples to cancel or postpone their weddings.\n\nThere have been at least 4,356 cases of the coronavirus in Maine as of Monday, with 131 deaths, according to state health data.\n\nPeople who attend social gatherings should wear face coverings other than when eating or drinking, the Maine CDC said.\n\nThe investigation into the reception at the Big Moose Inn is ongoing, health officials said.",

        "body": "Fifteen adults have been poisoned after drinking hand sanitizer that contained methanol, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday.\n\nMethanol, or wood alcohol, is a toxic chemical that can lead to hospitalization or death if ingested.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration first warned of hand sanitizers with possible methanol contamination in June, citing nine products from Mexico. Since then, the list has grown to 115. The CDC recommends hand sanitizers that contain either ethanol or isopropanol, which are also alcohols, but not methanol. Hand sanitizer should never be ingested.\n\nThe CDC report included 15 cases of methanol poisoning in New Mexico and Arizona that occurred in May and June. The average age was 43, and 13 of the cases were in men. Several of the cases were among American Indians/Alaska Natives, though the report does not detail the exact number. All 15 individuals were hospitalized, and four people died. Another three developed vision problems, a known side effect of methanol poisoning.\n\nAll of the cases detailed in the report had had blood tests to confirm the presence of methanol. Additionally, all of the individuals reported past hand sanitizer ingestion.\n\nIn one case highlighted in the CDC report, a 44-year-old male sought care after developing vision problems. The man said he had drank an unknown quantity of hand sanitizer in recent days. The man was hospitalized and experienced seizures. He was later discharged with \"near-total vision loss,\" the report said.\n\nOther individuals sought care because of gastrointestinal or vision problems. Some lost consciousness. One individual sought care because of media reports of methanol-contaminated hand sanitizers.\n\nThe report noted that cases of methanol poisoning that occur when someone applies the chemical to skin is rare, though it can occur. Any individuals who have been exposed to hand sanitizers contaminated with methanol should seek medical care immediately if they develop concerning symptoms, the report said.",

    "75 years after Hiroshima, they're still feeling its impact": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Regular nosebleeds, three bouts with cancer and blinding cataracts.\n\nIt's been 75 years since the U.S. dropped an atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima -- marking the end of World War II and the dawn of the nuclear age -- but survivors like Masaaki Takano still live with the consequences.\n\n\"I'm mentally trying hard to pretend I'm OK,\" Takano, 82, told NBC News by telephone from Japan in Japanese.\n\nFor decades Takano quietly lived with his ailments. He was not recognized as a \"hibakusha\" -- a survivor of the bombing -- because he was not within the immediate radius of the blast that killed an estimated 140,000 people, vaporizing them instantly or poisoning them slowly.\n\nBut last week, a Japanese court finally acknowledged that he and 83 other plaintiffs had been exposed to dangerous radiation from \"black rain\" -- the nuclear fallout that poured from the skies in the aftermath of the explosion.\n\n\"We are doing this because we want to deliver the truth,\" Takano said of the suit filed in 2015. \"It's too late to stand up after everyone dies.\"\n\nAlthough the case has renewed public consciousness of the bombing, and the technology that made it, some worry that the world hasn't heeded the dangers of nuclear weapons. And today, the awesome and terrifying destructive power unleashed by \"Little Boy,\" as the Hiroshima bomb was known, still haunts the world in the form of vast stockpiles of nuclear weapons.\n\nAnd as the aging Hibakusha die, many fear their stories will fade from the world's memory.\n\nTakano was at school about 12 miles from the bomb's hypocenter, or detonation point, on Aug 6, 1945. He still recalls seeing a flash \"bigger than lightning\" and hearing a \"massive explosion -- bang!\"\n\nHe was sent home while debris fell from the sky. Seven years old, Takano said he tried to catch some of the objects as they showered down.\n\nIn the following days, he had a high fever and diarrhea. Although he recovered, Takano later endured many illnesses because of the exposure to radiation. He also lost his mother to cancer 19 years after the bomb dropped.\n\nFor those closer to the hypocenter, the damage came faster.\n\nTetsushi Yonezawa, who turns 86 on Sunday, was traveling on a busy train just 820 yards from the bomb.\n\nOnce on the military truck that rescued him and his mother, he recalls seeing people with broken bones protruding from their flesh and blood flowing from their ears.\n\nOne elderly woman \"held an eyeball with her hand to avoid it falling out completely.\"\n\nThe effects lingered.\n\n\"I think the next day the war ended,\" Yonezawa said. \"When I woke up, I saw my pillow had turned black. Looking carefully, I noticed that it was covered with my hair. I was so surprised, I touched my hair and it fell onto the sheets. I ran to my mother and she had also lost her hair. Both of us lost all our hair on the same day.\"\n\nHis mother's symptoms worsened -- including bleeding gums and purple spots all over her skin. She was dead less than a month later, Yonezawa said.\n\n\"I think that the sad thing is that that legacy has died somewhat,\" said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. \"There are now a number of developments happening in the nuclear arms field, which are seeming to receive no public attention whatsoever.\"\n\nThere are an estimated 13,400 nuclear weapons in existence globally, according to the institute. The vast majority of them belong to the United States and Russia, with more than 6,000 weapons each.\n\nAlthough it's far fewer than the peak of about 65,000 weapons in the 1980s -- a product of the Cold War -- warheads today are far more powerful.\n\nAn exchange of fewer than 1,000 nuclear weapons could kill as many as 100 million people in a matter of hours, said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the nonpartisan Arms Control Association, based in Washington.\n\n\"A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought,\" he said. \"It's in everyone's interest to reduce the risk of this ever happening.\"\n\nYet global tensions are at their highest since the end of the Cold War, Kimball said. Recent years have seen mounting threats among the U.S., Russia, North Korea and China. One nonproliferation treaty between the U.S. and Russia is also set to expire in February.\n\nEven countries with smaller arsenals, such as India and Pakistan, with fewer than 200 warheads each, have increasingly been at odds, Kimball said.\n\n\"There needs to be a combination of leadership and creativity to head off additional competition and arms racing,\" he said.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nYet, the U.S. has committed more than $1.7 trillion in the coming years to upgrading its arsenal, and Russia has similar plans, experts say.\n\nThe argument for the investment is less about the practical defense the weapons offer and more about technological developments and support for the economy, said Robert Jacobs, a history professor at the Hiroshima Peace Institute.\n\n\"These are militarily useless weapons,\" Jacobs said. \"The risks of starting down that path are uncontrollable.\"\n\nAmid the global economic challenges sparked by the coronavirus pandemic, experts say that now may be the moment to question whether governments should be funding military technologies designed for crises of a previous generation.\n\n\"No matter how much money we spend to harden our infrastructure against a terrorist threat, that does nothing to defend us against a tiny invisible virus,\" Kimball said. \"I think this is the time to seriously rethink the role of nuclear weapons.\"",

        "body": "A 97-year-old woman in North Carolina recovered from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, after spending three weeks in the hospital.\n\nRosa Tyson, who was diagnosed with the virus in June, said that she is now healthy and happy to be with her family. \"I feel good,\" she told NBC News.\n\nDaniel Haddock, 69, Tyson's son, said that he never gave up hope that his mom would recover. \"I knew she was a fighter and I knew how strong she was,\" he said.\n\nTyson first showed symptoms in late June, experiencing a fever, chills, and loss of appetite, taste and smell. Tyson's family quickly realized that she was exposed to a relative who had the virus, and said that she needed to get tested.\n\nAfter testing positive for COVID-19, Tyson was quarantined and treated at a local hospital near her home in Greenville, NC for a few days, and then was discharged too early, according to Haddock.\n\n\"She was really dehydrated,\" said Haddock, who later placed Tyson at Novant Health Rowan Medical Center in Salisbury, NC where she was treated with IV fluids.\n\nHaddock said that he was determined to help Tyson battle the deadly virus and, with permission from her doctor, he visited her three times a day for three weeks to feed and take care of her. During visits he was required to wear personal protective equipment, like a mask and gloves, according to Haddock.\n\nNovant Health Rowan Medical Center did not immediately respond to NBC News' requests for comment.\n\nOver the span of three weeks, Tyson gradually recovered from the virus and on July 24 she was discharged.\n\nHaddock's fianc\u00e9, Val Robinson, who is a retired nurse, said that it is crucial for patients to have family support and credited the hospital for saving Tyson's life.\n\n\"I knew it was a blessing that she recovered at her age, it was phenomenal,\" said Robinson.\n\nHaddock added, \"Do all you can to go in there to see them because when you turn the older people loose they lose faith. Their family is the one that keeps them going.\"",

    "A Latino father and essential worker died of COVID-19. He was afraid of losing his job.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Alisha Alvarez, 28, said a final goodbye to her father at his funeral service Friday, still wondering if she could have done more to convince him that he didn't have to go to work if he feared contracting coronavirus.\n\nJos\u00e9 Roberto Alvarez Mena, her dad, was one of thousands of essential workers who showed up to work as California saw a surge in coronavirus cases after partially reopening its economy earlier this summer. Alvarez Mena working as the head of maintenance for Mission Foods Corp. in Commerce, California, when he tested positive to COVID-19 on June 28.\n\nAlisha's mother and older sister, both of whom who lived with Jos\u00e9 Roberto, also tested positive for the virus during the same time period. While both women recovered, Jos\u00e9 Roberto's symptoms worsened. On July 4, he was hospitalized after struggling to breathe.\n\nHe was then admitted to the hospital's intensive care unit on the following day. Jos\u00e9 Roberto, known to people in his Los Angeles community as \"Beto Mena,\" spent two weeks connected to a respirator until he died on July 20. He was 67.\n\n\"It's the most painful thing, especially because you can't see them in person, you can't say bye. People have to remember that, when they say they don't want to wear masks,\" Alisha told NBC News. \"This is not a political issue. This is harming people and ruining their lives.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Roberto, who was an engineer by profession, emigrated to the United States from El Salvador in the 1980s \"to work and provide for his kids,\" said Alisha, adding that he was the family's sole provider. \"That's why work was always the most important thing to him.\"\n\n\"My dad never said no to helping people. He was always there for any family member no matter what. He was the kind of guy who would go into work on his days off because his boss would call him for help,\" said Alisha.\n\nAlisha and her siblings helped their mother move out of the house last weekend \"just because there's too many memories.\" Alisha's parents were together for about 35 years.\n\nThe Los Angeles Public Health Department ordered the temporary closure of Mission Foods Corp. on July 29 for failing to report a COVID-19 outbreak that sickened at least 40 of their workers; they also closed two other food processors. The company was allowed to reopen its facilities one day later.\n\nCounty officials were investigating the deaths of two Mission Foods Corp. employees, including Jos\u00e9 Roberto's, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe family has criticized the company for failing to protect Jos\u00e9 Roberto. Alisha said their actions were \"straight up negligent.\" The family says that one month before Mission Foods' closure, Jos\u00e9 Roberto told them he was hearing rumblings at work of people getting sick.\n\n\"He would come home and tell my mom that so-and-so is sick or someone else is down,\" said Alisha. \"But nothing was officially told to my dad.\"\n\nAlisha said the company's behavior was inconsistent with what her father had experienced back in May when he received an official letter from Mission Foods warning about potential COVID-19 exposure at work after an employee contracted the virus. At the time, both of her parents tested negative to the virus.\n\n\"There are a lot of essential workers and Latino workers at Mission Foods, who are there providing for their families, who do not want to speak up because they are afraid,\" said Alisha.\n\nMission Foods affirms that their \"company-wide health and safety measures meet or often exceed the requirements of health authorities\" and that they are hand-delivering a note to each employee in their respective facility when the company is made aware of a confirmed case.\n\nAs California began seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases, Alisha and her siblings started to worry about their father's exposure to the virus at work, especially because he suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure.\n\nAlisha and her siblings would tell Jos\u00e9 Roberto, \"you have rights\" and encourage him to disclose his preexisting health conditions to his employer in order to return to work at a later time when coronavirus cases weren't increasing.\n\n\"But he was afraid to lose his job or be replaced by someone younger,\" said Alisha. \"And on our part, we didn't take the time to research what his rights would have been. I wish at that time, I would have gotten a lawyer -- that would mean that he would still be here with me alive.\"\n\nThe Alvarez family held Jos\u00e9 Roberto's funeral service Friday. About two dozen people showed up to a cemetery wearing face masks. People sat on every other chair to keep physical distance as a priest gave a mass in Jos\u00e9 Roberto's name. About 40 people tuned into the service via a Zoom video conference.\n\n\"We had to put a limit on people attending the funeral and we are a big Latino family, so it's been challenging,\" said Alisha. \"But in a way, it has also allowed us to mourn in a more intimate way.\"\n\nThe family recently created the Beto Mena Foundation to honor Jos\u00e9 Roberto's memory. Alisha hopes the nonprofit will help Latino families struggling to survive the pandemic, as well as other communities of color. So far, they have been able to send basic medical supplies and thermometers to families with no access to COVID-19 testing in El Salvador, Jos\u00e9 Roberto's native country.\n\nUltimately, Alisha hopes that the foundation can help essential workers access bilingual labor lawyers and host food drives as well as other community events around Los Angeles and Orange County in partnership with other foundations.\n\nThe coronavirus has killed at least 5,136 people in Los Angeles County, half of them are Latino.\n\n\"These aren't just numbers. These are people. They're mothers, fathers, siblings, uncles that are not with us anymore,\" Alisha told Telemundo in Spanish last week",

        "body": "At 83, Houston boxing coach Hector Rocha finally met his match -- outside the ring.\n\nAfter a six-week battle with COVID-19, Rocha lost the fight and died on Aug. 15.\n\n\"Dad would open his big arms to anyone who had a willingness to learn,\" said Hector Rocha Jr., Rocha's son. Rocha Sr. is survived by Rocha Jr., two daughters from his second marriage, Yvonne Rocha-Contreras and Zamieleth Villasana, and his wife, Maria Elena Aviles.\n\nRocha Sr. owned Rocha's Boxing Gym, on the north side of Houston, where hundreds of kids learned how to throw and dodge punches for over 40 years.\n\n\"Boxing runs in the family. It's in our blood,\" his son said.\n\nThe ability to throw a left hook was one of the few things Rocha brought with him when he immigrated from Monterrey Mexico to Houston in the 1970s.\n\n\"He started out as a pro fighter with his brother before transitioning to coaching,\" Rocha Jr. said. Coaching allowed Rocha to mentor young people, particularly those who grew up in underserved communities.\n\n\"He wanted to be that point person for kids without direction,\" his son said.\n\nEven as an octogenarian he was still doing what he loved most: mentoring, coaching and being in the ring. A tough but kind spirit, his father always made his family and the gym his priority, Rocha Jr. said.\n\nAfter experiencing symptoms that worsened over the course of a week in June, he was admitted to St. Luke's Vintage Hospital in Houston on June 30. He would not set foot in his gym again.\n\nWith his death, Houston lost a local boxing legend, and his students and family lost a man they adored. He was a doting father, grandfather and father figure to many in the boxing community.\n\n\"He was always active, healthy and in good shape,\" Rocha Jr. said. \"No one saw this coming.\"\n\n\"My dad embodied the lessons he took from boxing -- the many fights you endure in life and how to tackle challenges head-on, without fear or hesitation,\" Rocha Jr. said. \"That's who he was.\"",

    "Buying a digital thermometer? Here's what one doctor recommends.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Donald Ford, MD, board-certified family physician, Cleveland Clinic\n\nFord says doctors are interested in a patient's core body temperature when trying to determine if they have a fever or not. What is a fever, then? Medical professionals measure a fever as a temperature that is 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or above. Ford says many viruses can raise your internal body temperature a little bit, including the common cold. If it's not 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher, he added, it's not considered a fever.\n\nAs listed by the CDC, a fever is but one symptom of the coronavirus. However, Ford urges people to understand that you can still test positive for the coronavirus if you do not have a fever. \"A fever is just one of many ways the coronavirus presents itself,\" says Ford. \"It is not the whole story, however.\"\n\nFord also notes that daily variation in one's temperature is very common with most viruses, as are variations within the day: You may be fine in the morning and then spike a fever in the afternoon or evening. This fluctuation is often seen in COVID patients, he added, encouraging COVID patients to anticipate changes in their temperature throughout the day and to keep track of when they usually spike a fever, useful information can be helpful in determining when to take medication like Tylenol to keep a fever down.\n\nFord says gone are the days of mercury thermometers -- digital thermometers are now the way of the world. According to Ford, virtually all digital thermometers equip similar technology and function similarly. But just like with phones and computers, you can get high-quality technology and you can get cheap technology when it comes to thermometers -- you get what you pay for, Ford argues. Pricier thermometers may be more reliable and durable than lower priced options -- and may give better temperature readings.\n\nThermometers come in a variety of designs, from ones designed for your ear or mouth to those that measure from a distance. Ford says doctors tend to rely on thermometers that read as close to the core body temperature as possible, noting that under-tongue thermometers tend to give the most accurate readings, and are used widely by doctors. However, Ford noted non-contact thermometers are also useful, especially during the pandemic. His practice uses them to run temperature screenings for both patients and staff.\n\nOverall, Ford says he relies on thermometers that go under the tongue for at-home use. They can be cleaned easily with alcohol and give a clear digital reading. If you have kids, though, it might be hard to get them to sit still while you're taking their temperature. In this case, Ford recommends using a thermometer that goes in the ear, or a forehead thermometer.\n\nNon-contact infrared thermometers have become increasingly popular during the pandemic, Ford said:\n\nIn terms of accuracy, Ford notes the temperature reading from a non-contact infrared thermometer may be affected by factors other than your temperature. These factors include ambient light and temperature, and what a person was doing before they had their temperature taken. For example, if your temperature is taken with an infrared thermometer after you walk down the street, it's going to be higher than if you were just sitting in an air conditioned building -- physical activity increases the heat emanating from the skin. Using a non-contact infrared thermometer properly also contributes to how well it reads one's temperature. The FDA outlines how to use this type of thermometer, and Ford says there are often instructions listed on thermometers' packaging.\n\nAccording to Ford, infrared thermometers tend to read a bit low, noting a single degree's margin of error. He added that non-contact infrared thermometers are consistent. \"People just have to be aware that there might be a little bit of variation depending on other circumstances,\" says Ford.\n\nOverall, taking your temperature is a good practice to get in the habit of during the pandemic. The CDC suggests monitoring your health daily as a way to protect yourself from contracting the coronavirus, or spreading it if you start to show symptoms. The CDC states that monitoring symptoms is especially important if you are running errands, going to the office or school, or in settings where it's difficult to maintain six feet of physical distance. People may not perceive when they're starting to show COVID symptoms, and asymptomatic COVID carriers can spread the virus.\n\nPandemic or not, Ford encourages people to have a thermometer in the house. He says we never know what we're going to be facing -- as the coronavirus has proven. This is especially relevant as we head into flu season. If investing in a thermometer is on your to do list (like it is on mine), here are some of the best and most highly-rated options on the market. Many can be used on those of people of all ages, but some brands also make thermometers specifically for kids and babies.\n\nAmazon's No. 1 bestselling health care thermometer uses infrared technology to read one's temperature from about 3 centimeters (or about 1.2 inches) away. Aim the probe at the center of your forehead, press the measurement button to start the test and the thermometer will vibrate once the reading is complete. In addition to a temperature sensor, the thermometer features distance and environmental sensors that adjust the readings for accuracy. It's designed to deliver a reading in about one second, showing readings in large, white LED lights that can be seen in dark environments.\n\nThis thermometer is equipped with the brand's Fever Insight, designed to help you understand the meaning of a temperature reading using a color-coded display.\n\nThe thermometer also recalls the last reading it performed, making it easy for you to compare your temperature throughout the day. This thermometer can be used orally, rectally or under the arm, and it's waterproof.\n\nYou can take your temperature two ways using this thermometer:\n\nThe top of the thermometer relies on infrared to take your temperature when held against your forehead. When it's removed, it reveals an ear probe that can be used for babies, children and adults. This thermometer features a backlit screen for easier reading and performs a reading in about one second. It can store up to 35 readings. The thermometer also includes a fever warning system -- it displays a green light for a normal temperature, an orange light for light fever, and a red light for high fever. The thermometer also equips an alarm that goes off if a fever is detected.\n\nGreat for traveling or for students to keep in their backpacks, this thermometer is compact and comes with a storage case. It delivers a temperature reading in 10 to 20 seconds and can recall its last reading. The thermometer can be used with or without probe covers, and it's easy to clean with alcohol. It can be used orally, rectally or under the arm.\n\nThis thermometer has sensors that measure the radiation emitted by your eardrum or forehead to read your temperature. Hold the thermometer up to your or your child's forehead or use the attached ear probe for infants who are at least six months old. A reading is delivered in one to three seconds and it can store up to 20 readings. The thermometer will sound three beeps and show a red warning light if a fever is detected or a green light if it reads a normal temperature.\n\nKeep this thermometer on hand in households with multiple people. It's a no-contact option that uses infrared technology to measure the temperature of the skin surface over the forehead. It displays large and easy-to-read numbers and beeps when a temperature reading is complete. It also has a fever indicator that shows a frowny face if a temperature over 100 degrees Fahrenheit is detected. The thermometer will shut off when it's not in use and it can store up to 10 readings, along with the date and time that the reading was done.\n\nSelect your age group -- or that of the person whose temperature you're taking -- to get a more precise reading from this thermometer. You can choose from three age groups: 0-3 months, 6-36 months and 36 months to adult. The thermometer's screen also lights up green for a normal temperature, yellow for a raised temperature and red for a fever. It features a pre-warmed ear probe for increased comfort and comes with single-use probe covers. A light flashes and the thermometer beeps when the ear probe is in the right position and it performs a temperature reading in seconds. This thermometer can recall the last nine temperatures it read, too.",

    "CDC reverses COVID-19 guidance, says testing may not be needed after exposure": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention quietly tweaked its guidance on COVID-19 testing Monday, making a change that could result in fewer people being tested and hinder contact tracing efforts.\n\nThe guidance now states that healthy people who have been exposed to COVID-19 \"do not necessarily need a test,\" as long as they don't have symptoms. That's a reversal from previous advice that clearly recommended testing for all close contacts of infected individuals, regardless of whether they had symptoms.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"It seems as though this new guidance is actively discouraging people from seeking testing, even if they have a known exposure,\" Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia Public Health in New York City, said. \"We need more testing, not less.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been outspoken about his belief that the United States has the most COVID-19 cases in the world because of the number of tests it carries out.\n\nBut \"testing, even for asymptomatic people, is critical to keeping community transmission low since we know that presymptomatic transmission drives much of the spread of SARS-CoV-2,\" Rasmussen said, referring to the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nAn exposure is considered spending more than 15 minutes in close contact -- meaning closer than 6 feet -- with a person who has COVID-19. The new recommendation excludes vulnerable individuals, such as older adults and people with chronic medical conditions, who should still be tested after exposure. It also says that state and local health officials may still recommend a test.\n\n\"It's like they're saying we don't have enough tests,\" said Dr. Michael Saag, an infectious disease physician and associate dean for global health at the University of Alabama, Birmingham.\n\n\"In my opinion,\" he said, \"if a community or municipality has sufficient testing, they should continue to use the testing and ignore this recent update.\"\n\nNot all experts saw the guidance in a negative light.\n\n\"I agree that reflex testing of anybody with a significant exposure is unnecessary and not the best policy. Those individuals with significant exposures should self-quarantine for 14 days,\" Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said.\n\nSelf-quarantining, however, is not mentioned in the CDC's new guidance. But the agency does address when to quarantine on a different part of its website, specifically recommending self-quarantining for 14 days after close contact with someone with COVID-19.\n\nThe CDC declined a request from NBC News to answer questions about the change on the agency's website, referring all media queries to the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the department, who oversees coronavirus testing for the Trump administration, said in an emailed statement that the guidance \"has been updated to reflect current evidence and best public health practices.\"\n\nIt is unclear what evidence he was referring to.\n\nGiroir also said the guidance emphasizes testing for those people who have symptoms, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath, after an exposure.\n\nThat includes \"residents and staff in nursing homes or long term care facilities, critical infrastructure workers, health care workers and first responders, and those individuals (who may be asymptomatic) when prioritized by public health officials,\" he said.\n\nResearch has shown COVID-19 indeed can be spread via asymptomatic people. And easing up on testing of those patients would have massive implications for a standard practice in controlling infectious disease outbreaks: contact tracing.\n\nThat means testing \"anyone who's been in close contact with a known positive so that we can find out for sure whether the contact is also infected,\" Saag said. \"That's important, not only for the individual's health, but also for their contacts.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nSuch a situation is occurring in Danbury, Connecticut. The Connecticut Department of Public Health recently reported a \"significant spike\" of 178 COVID-19 cases in Danbury during the first two weeks of August. The previous two weeks saw just 40 new cases in the town.\n\n\"This is a serious outbreak in Danbury, and we really need an all-hands-on-deck approach,\" Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner for the Connecticut Department of Public Health, said in a statement. \"We are urging anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to get tested as soon as possible.\"",

        "body": "People who have recovered from COVID-19 can safely interact with others for three months, according to a recent update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- suggesting that immunity to the virus may last at least that long.\n\nThe recent change is part of the agency's guidance on quarantining. It states that people should quarantine if they've been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19, \"excluding people who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months.\" People who have tested positive for the virus don't need to be tested again for up to three months, as long as they don't develop symptoms again.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe CDC previously acknowledged that people who have recovered from COVID-19 can test positive for the virus for up to three months, though these positive results don't mean that a person is still sick. Instead, the test may be picking up fragments of the virus's genetic code. Dr. Brett Giroir, the undersecretary of health who leads coronavirus testing for the White House, has advised people against being tested again after they recover.\n\nHowever, the updated guidance goes one step further, suggesting that people who have recovered can't spread the virus to others for at least three months.\n\nThe update, which was posted on the CDC's website on Aug. 3, is consistent with CDC's earlier guidance not to retest patients within 90 days of an initial infection, Dr. Annie Luetkemeyer, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, said. Although some doctors and patients have raised concerns about the possibility of being reinfected with coronavirus, there have been no confirmed reports of reinfection.\n\nDr. Joshua Barocas, an assistant professor of medicine at the Boston University School of Medicine, said the CDC's update \"aligns with the idea that it is unlikely that people can be infected within a three month time frame.\"\n\n\"Of course, unlikely doesn't mean it is impossible to get reinfected,\" Barocas said, adding that people should be cautious and quarantine \"unless it's a crystal clear case.\"\n\nHe noted that the CDC's guidance shouldn't be over-interpreted \"an an indication that we have or could soon achieve herd immunity.\"\n\n\"We are not there and we shouldn't rely on that as it will cause a significant amount of mortality.\"",

    "COVID-19 antibodies may last for at least 4 months, Icelandic study suggests": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "People may have antibodies for at least four months after they get COVID-19, a study published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine suggests.\n\nThe study pulled from a massive dataset from Iceland, looking for the presence of antibodies in more than 30,000 blood samples. The samples came from three groups of people: those with confirmed COVID-19 cases, those who had been exposed to the virus but weren't necessarily infected, and those who had no known exposure.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe researchers focused on a small subset of 487 people who had had more than one antibody test, which allowed researchers to see whether antibody levels remained stable or faded over time. In this group, the researchers found, antibody levels increased in the first two months after diagnosis and remained stable for the next two months.\n\n\"There is no evidence of any slight decrease,\" said a co-author of the study, Dr. K\u00e1ri Stef\u00e1nsson, founder of the Icelandic biotech company deCODE genetics.\n\nStef\u00e1nsson said the study detected antibodies in a significant number of people who had been asymptomatic and were never tested for COVID-19.\n\nNot everyone developed antibodies after infection, the authors wrote, suggesting that some people might have weaker immune responses to the virus. It's possible, however, that those people had false positive diagnostic tests and were never sick in the first place.\n\nThe researchers noted several other interesting trends. Antibody levels were higher in older patients and in those with more severe disease. Women also had lower antibody levels compared to men, and smokers had lower antibody levels than nonsmokers.\n\n\"What they're seeing here is that they're inducing a pretty strong immune response,\" said Jason Kindrachuk, an assistant professor of medical microbiology & infectious diseases at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.\n\nBut while the data suggest that antibody levels remain stable for at least four months, questions remain.\n\n\"What we don't know is really the million-dollar question: How do these antibodies reflect immunity against this virus and inhibition of this virus,\" said Kindrachuk, who wasn't involved with the research. \"Just because you see antibodies being produced, it doesn't tell you that those antibodies are going to act specifically against the virus.\"\n\nIn other words, it's unclear whether the antibodies will protect people from being reinfected.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nConfirmed cases of people being reinfected with the coronavirus are exceedingly rare. Last week, it was reported that four people were reinfected, the only such instances out of more than 25 million cases worldwide.\n\nIn August, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed its quarantine guidelines, saying people with confirmed COVID-19 didn't need to be tested again for three months if they didn't develop any symptoms.\n\nThe study isn't the first to show that antibodies can stick around for some time after infection.\n\nThe data in the new study are in line with those in a July preprint article showing that antibody levels were stable for at least three months in patients who had recovered from the virus in New York City, said Elitza Theel, director of the infectious diseases serology laboratory at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.",

    "COVID-19 may have lasting effects on some children's brains": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- Nia Haughton, 15, occasionally struggles to find the right words, and her memory can be patchy, but as she describes her lengthy treatment in a London hospital as she sits on a low wall beside her home, her account still has the power to shock.\n\nIn early April, the British teen had been battling a cough and a high temperature for about 10 days, but when her condition significantly deteriorated her mother, Justina Ward, called for help.\n\nAfter the emergency dispatcher heard Nia having difficulty breathing, an ambulance arrived within minutes. The first emergency room to admit her swiftly recognized that her illness was both acute and complex, and transferred her to one of central London's top children's hospitals. Soon after her arrival there with several recognizable COVID-19 symptoms, she was sedated and placed on a ventilator inside an intensive care unit, where she remained for two weeks.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nFor days, her lungs labored to stave off collapse until the medical staff tried \"proning\" her for 16 hours a day. During proning, Nia was turned to lie on her front at a slight incline, but kept on ventilation with the help of an anesthesiologist. This approach allows oxygen to be blasted to the back of a patient's lungs, and has been beneficial for many COVID-19 sufferers.\n\nEventually, Nia turned a corner and was able to breathe again unaided. But after several days in recovery, her condition worsened once again. This time, it was her brain rather than her lungs that was affected. Awake night after night, she began hallucinating, seeing and hearing people in the hospital who were not really there.\n\n\"I couldn't tell what was real,\" she said. \"It was really scary. I could hear voices. It was very traumatic.\"\n\nAfter repeated, violent seizures that left her exhausted and sleeping for long periods, she was taken back into the ICU.\n\nWatching the illness attack her daughter's lungs and then her mental capacity was terrifying, Ward told NBC News, particularly since Nia's doctors were struggling to understand what was happening inside her nervous system and brain.\n\n\"I don't know which was scarier, her being on the ventilator not being able to breathe, or the fact that she came out of it with a completely different personality,\" Ward, 42, said.\n\nDuring this period, Nia's voice and behavior appeared to regress to a younger version of herself. Pediatric neurologist Dr. Ming Lim of the Evelina London Children's Hospital diagnosed her with encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain.\n\nLim, a soft-spoken but animated clinician with a long professional interest in childhood inflammatory disorders, said Nia's diagnostic and antibody tests had both come back negative, but he had seen other patients with the same \"COVID picture\" of symptoms who had tested positive.\n\nHe said the unreliable nature of testing on many early patients, and the specificity and chronology of her symptoms, gave his team no reason to diagnose her with anything other than COVID-19.\n\nHe considered Nia's neurological symptoms as a late-onset, secondary inflammatory illness associated with COVID-19.\n\n\"I think that COVID has taught us that every time we feel complacent, that we know the spectrum, a new spectrum sort of evolves,\" Lim said.\n\nHe and his Evelina colleagues have successfully treated a handful of COVID-linked cases, but he remains focused on the future neurological implications for children.\n\n\"We worry that the long-term effect would be in essentially brain growth,\" he said, a particular concern among children and young adults whose brains are still developing.\n\nA series of four similar cases were detailed in a recent study published by JAMA, spearheaded by doctors at the Great Ormond Street Hospital, London's other leading pediatric facility.\n\nThe children were part of a larger cohort of 27 young patients who had suffered from the recently recognized multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C. They developed new-onset neurological symptoms, in the absence of other respiratory symptoms.\n\nThe study's lead author Dr. Omar Abdel-Mannan, a pediatric neurology specialist at Great Ormond Street, said that children, in general, had \"rarely been affected and been so sick.\" And in these particular cases, the children affected had actually made \"a pretty remarkable recovery.\"\n\nBut he and several neurologists in the United Kingdom and the United States who spoke to NBC News said the vast scale of this pandemic -- with confirmed cases in the U.S. topping 4 million -- could translate into thousands of patients with neurological complications associated with COVID-19, with some of those potentially focused on the children who suffered the multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n\n\"The virus has surprised us in many, many ways,\" Abdel-Mannan said. \"It does need really good quality longitudinal assessments and studies that will include looking at the cognition of these children, looking at their longer term psychological and psychiatric health.\"\n\nWhile there is evidence of higher rates of coronavirus infection among Black and Hispanic communities in the U.S., doctors say there isn't yet enough data to confirm the relationship between race and the neurological side effects of COVID-19 in children.\n\nThe data available for adults is currently much clearer, experts said. Two recent British studies, one that looked at the neurological impact of COVID-19 on 43 patients ranging between the ages of 16 and 85, and another published in the Lancet examining 153 patients, ages 24 to 93, found that in those cases symptoms were varied but severe.\n\n\"They can have seizures, fever, they can have hallucinations that could be very disturbing for them or their family members, psychotic symptoms,\" said Dr. Mike Zandi, a lead author of one study, co-author of the other and a consultant neurologist at Britain's National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery. \"It can be very hard to distinguish what is psychiatric disease from medical disease.\"\n\nResearch into the neurological effects of COVID-19 is still in its early stages, he said, but the adult patients included in the studies were infected by the coronavirus first, then exhibited a similar pattern of inflammation, allowing for \"no other reasonable explanation.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nOther neurologists in the U.S. share this elevated level of concern about the long-term implications and the multiplying impact of the pandemic on neurological health.\n\n\"When you have so many millions of people who are suffering from acute infection, I think it's only going to be a matter of time before we see more and more of these cases,\" said Dr. Arun Venkatesan, a neurologist specializing in infectious diseases, who directs the John Hopkins Encephalitis Center. \"We've certainly seen some, and I fear that we are just at the beginning.\"\n\nHis Johns Hopkins colleague Dr. Robert Stevens, a critical care neurologist, predicted \"a sort of secondary pandemic of people\" who might experience problems further down the road.\n\n\"A fair number of people who get this disease wind up with some neurological manifestations, and these range from very mild to severe life-threatening conditions,\" he said. \"People who survive will recover from the respiratory failure, they'll recover from the kidney disease, but the imprint on the brain is likely to be much more long-lasting.\"\n\nHe outlined several possible mechanisms by which the virus could be causing damage inside the brain, but said more data and research would be required to determine the causation more precisely.\n\nThat uncertainty is particularly pronounced among young patients, said Dr. Jennifer McGuire, a pediatric neurologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who has also noticed a recent uptick in patients with neurological symptoms.\n\n\"I would say headache and fatigue and a little bit of confusion are pretty common,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not totally clear yet as to if those things are happening just because these kids are so systematically sick with SARS COVID-2,\" she said, or whether it is the consequence of either \"the post-infectious multisystem inflammatory syndrome,\" or if these cases are \"directly attributable to the neurological involvement of the virus.\"\n\nA large-scale study organized by the international Neurocritical Care Society, involving 96 treatment centers in 25 countries, is now underway. The goal is to identify and improve possible treatments relating to the brain and COVID-19. The doctors involved in treating patients like Nia -- who weeks later suffers from flashbacks and significant memory problems -- say they want to develop more precise and personalized approaches to the expanding neurological impact of this virus.",

    "COVID-19 outbreaks at college campuses: Fauci warns about sending students home": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Only a few weeks into fall semester, colleges and universities across the country are urgently trying to control clusters of COVID-19 infections on their campuses. Thousands of cases have been reported nationwide, forcing universities to switch to virtual classes and either quarantine or, in some cases, send students back home whether or not they're sick.\n\nThe situation has become serious enough that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, is urging colleges: If at all possible, do not send students home.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"It's the worst thing you could do,\" he said Wednesday on NBC's \"TODAY\" show. \"When you send them home, particularly when you're dealing with a university where people come from multiple different locations, you could be seeding the different places with infection,\" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nOn Monday, Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, cautioned governors on a call that college students could become a source of outbreaks beyond campuses.\n\n\"Sending these individuals back home in their asymptomatic state to spread the virus in their hometown or among their vulnerable households could really re-create what we experienced over the June time frame in the South,\" Birx said, according to a source on the call.\n\nNationally, two of the biggest outbreaks have occurred in Iowa, in the counties home to the largest universities in the state: Iowa State University and the University of Iowa.\n\nIowa State reported a spike in cases the second week of school, with a 28.8 percent positivity rate among students tested for COVID-19. And according to the University of Iowa's COVID-19 dashboard, nearly 1,000 students have tested positive within the past two weeks.\n\nBoth colleges are still holding some in-person classes, usually as long as they do not exceed 50 students.\n\nWednesday, a group of students and faculty members at the University of Iowa planned a \"sickout\" in a show of solidarity over concerns about \"the rampant spread of COVID-19\" on campus.\n\n\"As students and educators, we have seen firsthand that there is no safe way to hold classes in person during this pandemic,\" the group wrote online.\n\nAt James Madison University in Harrisonburg, Virginia,more than 400 cases of the coronavirus were reported less than a week after school started. University President Jonathan Alger announced plans to shift temporarily to online courses primarily and asked most students to leave campus by next Monday.The University of Notre Dame in Indiana has nearly 600 cases. Classes there switched to online only for two weeks, and the university is resuming in-person learning. Many students at North Carolina State University in Raleigh must move off campus this week.\n\nClusters were not unexpected. Put people in their late teens and early 20s into close quarters in dormitories and contagious illnesses are bound to spread, experts said.\n\n\"The college housing experience was not built for plagues,\" said Art Caplan, a professor of bioethics at NYU Langone Health. \"They're going to wander. They're going to visit each other. They're going to go into town. They're going to sneak off and have a party. This is what they do.\"\n\nWhat universities do next is critical, according to experts -- their decisions could stop the spread of COVID-19, or keep it going.\n\n\"Some colleges have the capability of a dorm or a couple of floors of a dorm where they could keep people who are infected,\" Fauci said. \"Keep them at the university in a place that's sequestered enough from the other students so that you don't get a cluster in the university, but don't have them go home, because they could be spreading it in their home state.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIndeed, many colleges have come up with plans to isolate sick students, with designated areas on campus for infected students who are not sick enough to be hospitalized.\n\nThe University of Wisconsin-Madison has set aside such housing for sick students to keep them in Madison. \"The concern about sending all these college kids back home is that we potentially increase transmission in many communities,\" said Dr. Jeff Pothof, an emergency medicine physician who is the university's chief quality officer.\n\nIndeed, sending all students off campus -- not just those confirmed to be infected -- carries the risk of sending asymptomatic students home, where they could expose vulnerable family members.\n\n\"You potentially have a ton of people who don't even know they have disease,\" said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and an infectious disease physician at the Massachusetts General Hospital. \"Five days later, they're going to come down with symptoms -- or maybe even not -- and now they're living with their parents.\"\n\nIt's been established that older adults and people with underlying health problems are at greater risk for more severe forms of the coronavirus, compared to children and younger adults.\n\nCaplan suggests a different approach, at least when it comes to infected students.\n\n\"I think sending them home is better,\" he said, explaining that students' movements may be easier to control at home and that they may have better access to medical care depending on where they live.\n\nWhat's more, keeping students on campus increases risks to instructors, cafeteria workers and other support staff members, even people who deliver food to the dorms.\n\nCaplan acknowledges that it is a complex situation, without a single answer for all universities.\n\nNorth Carolina State freshman Kathryn Livoti is preparing to move home Saturday, even though she has been doing everything possible to reduce her risk for COVID-19.\n\n\"We just do homework all the time. It's pretty much all we do,\" said Livoti, 18. \"I don't want to blame people who want to go out, because I want to, too. I just wish everybody had the mindset that if we want to stay on campus, we have to be careful.\"",

These could be exceptions, but do exist and it's not just one,\" Van Ranst said. \"It's not good news.\"\n\nVan Ranst said that in cases such as the Belgian woman's in which the COVID-19 symptoms were relatively mild, the body may not have created enough antibodies to prevent a rinfection, although they might have helped limit the sickness.\n\nThe findings are likely to be significant for scientists who have been working on treatments using antibodies from recovered coronavirus patients, and those who have been scrambling to develop a safe and effective vaccine, though it's too soon to draw any firm conclusions.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A Nevada man appears to be the nation's first confirmed case of COVID-19 reinfection, researchers say.\n\nThe case involves a 25-year-old man living in Reno, Nevada, who first tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-April. He recovered, but got sick again in late May. The second time around, his illness was more severe, the case report said.\n\nResearchers at the University of Nevada, Reno School of Medicine and the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory reported that genetic sequencing of the virus revealed that he had been infected with a slightly different strain, indicating a true reinfection.\n\nReinfection with the coronavirus appears to be rare. This is the first case reported among the nation's nearly 6 million cases so far.\n\n\"The evidence so far suggests that if you've been infected and recovered, then you're protected for some period of time,\" Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, said. \"We don't know how long, and we're going to find individual cases of people for whom that's not true.\"\n\nIndeed, on Monday, a case of COVID-19 reinfection was reported in Hong Kong -- the first such confirmation of reinfection during the pandemic. Two European patients, one in Belgium and one in the Netherlands, were also reported earlier this week to have been reinfected with the virus.\n\nBut in those instances, the patients did not get sick the second time around, or they developed much milder forms of the illness than their first infection.\n\n\"You'd expect the second time around people to have much milder or ideally no symptoms,\" Jha said. That's because the immune system should be able to mount a more robust response, and the Hong Kong case was \"completely consistent with that.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIn the Nevada case, however, the man got sicker the second time. When he was first infected, he had typical symptoms for the coronavirus: headache, cough, sore throat, nausea and diarrhea. Within about 10 days, the symptoms cleared up, and he tested negative for the virus.\n\nBut a month later, on May 28, he started feeling sick again, experiencing dizziness as well as the previous symptoms.\n\nThe illness did not clear up quickly this time. Within a week, his blood oxygen level fell dangerously low. He needed help breathing, and was hospitalized. Once again, the man tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\"That's very concerning,\" Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, said.\n\n\"If this sort of reinfection is common, then we have to worry about how strong the protection will be that we get vaccines,\" Schaffner said.\n\nIf reinfection were common, however, \"we would have seen it,\" Jha said. \"There's so much disease in our country.\"",

    "COVID-19 tracking differs across colleges as students return to campus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Students returning to their dorms at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill have a new tool to help them navigate campus this semester: a COVID-19 dashboard.\n\nUpdated weekly, the CV-19 dashboard tracks numerous metrics, including the number of tests conducted, the number of positive cases, school isolation and quarantine capacity and the percentage of courses being taught in-person, remotely or a mix of both.\n\n\"Campus leaders wanted to make sure the Carolina community had a resource for monitoring a range of data points,\" Leslie Minton, a university spokesperson, said. \"The dashboard was created with input from Carolina's infectious disease and data experts, emergency management services, UNC Health and our local health department.\"\n\nAs of Aug. 4, when the dashboard was last updated, UNC-Chapel Hill had recorded 175 infections: 139 in students and 36 in university employees.\n\nThe decision to reopen campuses, and how widely, has generated national debate. Students, faculty and staff members have criticized UNC-Chapel Hill's initial plan to reopen in spite of the county health department's recommendation to go virtual for its first five weeks of the semester.\n\nThe university has since readjusted its reopening plan to limit classroom occupancy to 30 percent and increase its testing capacity, frequency of public transportation and on-campus parking.\n\nThere is no existing standard of reporting coronavirus cases or deaths on campuses, nor is that information being publicly tracked on a national scale. A New York Times survey revealed at least 6,600 cases tied to roughly 270 colleges.\n\nUniversities have taken various approaches to sharing coronavirus updates with students and faculty.\n\nSome schools beyond UNC-Chapel Hill, such as the University of Wisconsin -- Madison, plan to launch their own COVID-19 dashboards to raise the curtain on operational decisions. Colleges elsewhere are employing different methods, such as West Virginia University publishing daily test results collected across its university system.\n\nBut others, such as Arizona State University, refuse to publish any campus-wide data. Some cite privacy concerns, which forces students and faculty to rely on a state's publicly available zip code and county COVID-19 data.\n\nA number of schools are also using coronavirus symptom-tracking apps to screen large groups of people.\n\nEfforts like UNC-Chapel Hill's new toolkit allow students to make better-informed decisions about returning this fall, one health expert said.\n\n\"Information and data are vital to make healthy decisions,\" Todd McGee, Orange County Health Department spokesperson, said. \"The dashboard will keep the UNC community informed about the status of coronavirus on campus and guide the administration should they need to make adjustments to their operations.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Minton said the university shifted the dashboard from daily to weekly updates out of privacy concerns for students and employees -- a move that was seen by the community as \"unannounced, unexpected and alarming,\" said James Sadler, a doctoral student at UNC-Chapel Hill's school of education.\n\nCarlos Lopez, an M.D.-Ph.D. student in microbiology and immunology at UNC-Chapel Hill, understood the privacy concerns shared by the university. \"But moving to weekly updates inherently causes a delay in our awareness of the on-the-ground situation,\" he said.\n\n\"You don't notice increases in transmission at the population level until about two to three weeks after it actually starts rising,\" Lopez said. \"Adding an extra week delay on top of that on the dashboard, already on top of dayslong backlogs on test results, and that easily adds up to a monthlong delay in our knowledge of what is going on in the community.\"\n\nThe \"curious timing\" of the dashboard change, Sadler said, follows weeks and months of students and staff members urging the university to operate online during the pandemic.\n\nOn July 29, the county health department recommended UNC-Chapel Hill go virtual for its first five weeks of the fall semester -- a memo that was largely ignored and undisclosed to the public until a week later.\n\nA group of tenured faculty members wrote an open letter expressing their fears that reopening campus \"too quickly and completely\" would have dire consequences.\n\n\"We recognize that some of you will have to live on campus this fall semester for financial or personal reasons, and we want to help ensure that campus is safe for you,\" the professors wrote in the open letter published in the Charlotte Observer last week. \"We implore the rest of you to stay home this fall.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, dozens of students and faculty staged a \"die-in\" protest against the university's transparency and efforts to protect its community from an outbreak.\n\n\"It's impossible to trust the motives of UNC when every decision they've made thus far has gone against the majority of what health officials, students and faculty think what safety looks like,\" Sadler said.\n\nIn May, the university created a \"roadmap\" website to navigate how to operate during the school year, including an \"off-ramp\" plan for removing students when cases spiked -- the number of cases to reach that threshold, however, was unspecified.\n\nThe roadmap also relies on students to follow preventative measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"There are limitations in enforcing expectations,\" Robert Blouin, executive vice chancellor and provost of UNC-Chapel Hill, said during a press conference Thursday. \"We emphasize to our students that the community standards that have been identified by this university extend beyond the walls of the campus.\"\n\n\"We are expecting our students to stay faithful to those standards,\" Blouin said.\n\nOrange County -- which houses the campus -- as of Aug. 7 has experienced 1,329 cases of COVID-19 and 47 deaths, according to state health data. The cumulative rate of positive test results at the school is 10.6 percent -- higher than the statewide rate of 8 percent.\n\n\"What this signals to me is that there's a huge potential for outbreaks and deaths,\" Sadler said.\n\nFor universities, there is a delicate balancing act between weighing financial and community concerns with public health guidance -- all while facing the grim reality that without a vaccine, no matter how classes are held, positive cases are bound to occur.\n\n\"Inevitably, there's going to be an outbreak, regardless of whether classes are in-person or online,\" Sadler said.",

        "body": "McFARLAND, Calif. -- Xiomara Valderrama usually spends her days picking grapes in California's Central Valley, where one-quarter of the U.S. food supply is produced. But she has been unable to work since she learned that her 5-year-old son may have been exposed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, at his day care.\n\nValderrama will need to wait up to two weeks for the boy's test results -- which means two weeks without income to cover the rent and pay for other basic necessities.\n\n\"It's going to be a stress to get that money,\" Valderrama said.\n\nFor more on this story watch NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nThe chief executive of California Grapery is trying to make sure workers get paid for missed hours. But for thousands of vulnerable, predominantly Latino undocumented workers across this sprawling agricultural region, there is immense fear and reluctance to self-report possible COVID-19 infection -- even with some doctors promising confidentiality.\n\nThe United Farm Workers union estimates up to 70 percent of farmworkers in this region are in the U.S. illegally, which means they do not have access to federal or state unemployment benefits, and they cannot risk losing their livelihoods. The pressure to work is forcing some laborers to potentially ignore their exposure to COVID-19.\n\n\"People are scared to go to the doctor. They're scared to go to the clinic. They're not going to their monthly doctor visits because they fear that the outcome is going to be COVID-19,\" said Hernan Hernandez, the executive director of the California Farmworker Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides services and resources to farmworkers.\n\nThe infection rate among Latinos has outpaced the rest of the U.S., and the community has also been disproportionately hurt by the economic downturn associated with the pandemic, Pew Research Center reported Tuesday.\n\nSalvador, a father of four who works in the fields, believes he might have been exposed to the coronavirus three weeks ago, around the time somebody who later tested positive visited his home. Salvador decided not to get tested because he was scared a positive result would mean being sidelined from work, unable to make money for his family.\n\nThe roughly $500 Salvador and his wife bring home every week barely covers their bills, so he kept working. He said he did not inform his boss of his possible infection because he was not showing symptoms. Instead, he and other workers who thought they might be infected quietly warned one another to keep their distance.\n\nErnestina, who works alongside hundreds of others at a pistachio packing plant, said she became infected with the coronavirus and stayed at home for a month, missing out on two weeks of pay. But before getting sick, she said, she witnessed other workers hiding symptoms, holding in coughing fits for as long as they could.\n\nHarjeet Brar, the president of the Good Samaritan Hospital in Bakersfield, told NBC News that his medical staff are not asking patients about their immigration status.\n\n\"That is not the intent at all. We're here to help,\" Brar said, adding: \"We just want you guys to get tested so we can protect your family.\" (Good Samaritan, through partnership involving the California Farmworker Foundation and Kern County, has worked to provide a mobile testing unit to farm communities in the state.)\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has pledged $52 million to the Central Valley to help with coronavirus testing and contact tracing, with the broad goal of slowing the spread of the virus in the region. In mid-April, Newsom said the state would partner with philanthropic groups to provide disaster relief to undocumented immigrants grappling with the coronavirus who are not eligible for other pandemic assistance programs.\n\n\"We feel a deep sense of gratitude for people who are in fear of deportation but are still addressing the essential needs of tens of millions of Californians,\" Newsom said at the time, adding that many undocumented immigrants work in essential sectors such as health care, agriculture and food services.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Cases of a polio-like condition in children, called acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, may start to spike again starting this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned Tuesday.\n\nBut, because doctors believe AFM is caused by respiratory viruses, it's unclear whether recent measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 might have an impact on the outbreak of AFM predicted this fall.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe coronavirus is not known to lead to AFM, but other viruses called enteroviruses, specifically D68 and A71, are strongly suspected. They spread the same way COVID-19 does: close contact with infected people, and by touching surfaces that have the virus on them, and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes.\n\n\"With all of the social distancing measures, mask wearing and improved hand hygiene, I hope that that will really decrease enterovirus circulation,\" Dr. Janell Routh, the AFM team lead in the CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, said.\n\nAFM affects the nervous system and causes limb weakness, most often in young children. It is rare: 633 cases have been confirmed in the United States since the CDC started tracking them in 2014.\n\nThough cases have been reported every year since then, larger outbreaks of AFM have followed an every-other-year pattern, spiking in 2014, 2016 and 2018.\n\nThat's why scientists are predicting another significant rise in cases in 2020.\n\n\"We normally see cases between August and November. About 86 percent of our cases fall between those months,\" Routh told NBC News. \"But this year is unprecedented. Anything can happen.\"\n\nWhat's more, enteroviruses \"will be circulating at the same time as flu and other infectious diseases, including COVID-19,\" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said during a call Tuesday with reporters.\n\nSo far in 2020, 16 cases have been confirmed in the U.S. One of those patients, who was over age 18, died of the illness.\n\nAFM almost always starts with a mild head cold: cough, runny nose, fever. About a week later, the patient develops weakness in one or more limbs, and may have trouble walking. It's still unclear whether certain conditions may increase a child's risk, but cases are often reported in otherwise healthy children.\n\n\"AFM can progress quickly, and patients can become paralyzed in the course of hours or days,\" Redfield said.\n\nCases are confirmed with MRIs, which show lesions on the spinal cord. There is no specific treatment, other than supportive care and physical therapy to help patients regain strength.\n\nPatients can have a variety of outcomes. \"We definitely see children recovery their limb function,\" Routh said. \"But we also know that there are children who remain severely paralyzed and require ventilation and supportive nursing care around the clock.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nOn Tuesday, the CDC released a report on the 238 AFM cases recorded in 2018. Most patients were around age 5. Half of those young patients needed treatment in the intensive care unit, and nearly a quarter were placed on a ventilator.\n\nThere were a few significant symptoms just before the onset of weakness. Routh said kids tended to report a \"striking headache, and neck and back pain.\" Those may be early warning signs to call a physician, she said, even during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"We have seen a decline in emergency room visits and even parents taking children to pediatric visits,\" she said. \"With COVID on everyone's mind, it's particularly important to get this message out now.\"\n\n\"Limb weakness, accompanied by neck or back pain, particularly after a viral illness, should all be triggers to seek medical care immediately.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MEXICO CITY - When the coronavirus epidemic began to intensify in Mexico at the end of March, Doctor Jose Garcia said his bosses at a public trauma hospital in Mexico City denied his request for masks, gloves and disinfectant.\n\nThey argued such protective equipment was only necessary for those working directly with coronavirus patients, Garcia said. Unconvinced, he bought it himself.\n\nThe hospital's director disputes this, saying all staff received protective equipment. Either way, Garcia had already contracted the virus and infected his wife and one-year-old daughter.\n\nGarcia is one of over 70,000 medical workers to catch the coronavirus in Mexico, where the pandemic death toll is now the third-highest worldwide, behind the United States and Brazil.\n\nGovernment data indicates that healthcare workers' risk of dying is four times higher than in the United States, and eight times higher than in Brazil.\n\n\"The coronavirus has hit health workers all over the world, but it's been especially bad in Mexico,\" said Alejandro Macias, an epidemiologist who spearheaded Mexico's response to the 2009 swine flu pandemic.\n\nStaff have had to buy their own equipment, often in informal marketplaces and of substandard quality, Macias said.\n\nThe government has said there were shortcomings in equipment provision early on but says it has worked hard to protect workers and flown in vital equipment from China and the United States. It also accuses past administrations of letting the health service deteriorate.\n\nMexico's deputy health minister and coronavirus czar, Hugo Lopez-Gatell, said in July that many of the nurses and doctors who died of the virus had pre-existing medical conditions, and that some did not use protective gear in \"optimal fashion.\"\n\nIn Mexico, 19 percent of confirmed infections are of medical staff, almost three times the global average, according to figures from the International Council of Nurses and the Mexican National Association of Doctors and Nurses.\n\nThe plight of health workers is complicating efforts to contain the outbreak, which has killed close to 50,000 people in Mexico, battered the economy and cost millions of jobs.\n\nGarcia, 48, said in an interview that he believes he was one of about a dozen medical staff indirectly infected by a patient who arrived at the Lomas Verdes hospital with coronavirus symptoms and later died.\n\n\"They've been very irresponsible with us,\" he said, referring to his employer and its alleged failure to provide protective equipment.\n\nThe hospital's director, Gilberto Meza, said that 213 Lomas Verdes staff had contracted the virus. Citing an epidemiological study he said the hospital had conducted, he said that all were infected outside the facility.\n\nHe said all staff had received goggles, face shields and masks. He declined to say when they were provided.\n\nGarcia and his family survived and he is now back at work. But the two weeks they had coronavirus symptoms were, he said, \"hell\": headaches, fever, diarrhea and shortness of breath.\n\nAs of July 24, 72,980 Mexican medical staff had caught the coronavirus, and 978 died, government figures show.\n\nIn the United States, which has a population 2.5 times that of Mexico, 123,738 medical personnel have tested positive for coronavirus and 598 have died, according to the most recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) figures.\n\nThe health ministry of Brazil, which is about two-thirds more populous than Mexico, had reported 189 deaths of medical practitioners by end-July. Some private data in Brazil give higher figures, but still well below Mexico.\n\nOver a dozen nurses and doctors interviewed by Reuters said they got the virus in part because they did not receive timely information or protective equipment.\n\nMany have protested about having to reuse disposable gear and launched petitions for better kit.\n\nIn one public hospital in northern Mexico, medical workers told Reuters in April their managers told them not to wear protective masks to avoid unsettling patients.\n\nZoe Robledo, head of Mexico's main public health service, IMSS, said in April that it had suffered equipment shortages, as well as \"delays, oversights, and errors that needed correcting.\"\n\nMexico's spending on health as a share of gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the lowest in the 37-member Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).\n\nA recent study by the OECD put Mexico's health spending at 5.5% of GDP, compared to 9.1% in Chile and 7.3% in Colombia in 2019. In Brazil it was 9.4%, though the latest data available were from 2017.\n\nNurses often work in multiple hospitals to supplement wages of about 8,500 pesos ($377) per month, according to Mexico City's government. Movement between hospitals heightens the contagion risk, said Oliva Lopez, the city's health minister.\n\n\"Our health personnel combine multiple jobs and are exposed in multiple spaces,\" Lopez told Reuters, saying her ministry had gone to great lengths to get staff protective equipment, and blaming previous governments for \"pauperizing\" the profession.\n\nMore than 600 nurses had died by the end of June in some 30 countries surveyed by the Geneva-based International Council of Nurses. Mexico accounted for 160 of the deaths, or over a quarter.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, one nurse at a Mexico City public hospital said she felt \"abandoned\" by authorities.\n\n\"But we can't say: 'Now I can't work, or don't want to',\" she said. \"This is what we trained for.\"",

        "body": "MIAMI -- For a Florida family, COVID-19 has struck hard after two doctors, a father and son, passed away from COVID-19 just over one month apart from each other.\n\nDr. Carlos Vallejo, 57, practiced internal medicine at his private practice in Miami Lakes; he passed away August 1st.\n\n\"My dad was an incredible guy,\" said his son, Charles Vallejo Jr, 26, \"He cared deeply about his patients and they saw him like family.\"\n\nCarlos Vallejo was hospitalized on June 27 -- the day his father, retired obstetrician Dr. Jorge Vallejo, 89, died from COVID-19.\n\nCharles Vallejo, who is following in his father and grandfather's footsteps and is a medical resident, believes his father may have contracted the virus while treating his patients who were in rehabilitation centers and nursing homes. Some were COVID-19 positive.\n\n\"My dad had no underlying health conditions. He was very healthy. It's a huge shock. Out of everybody, he is the last I would have thought would die from COVID,\" said Charles.\n\nHe recounted how he and his family would plead with his dad to be careful around infected patients, maintain a safe distance and wear protective gear.\n\n\"He would tell us he would protect himself as much as he could, but would say, 'I have to go in there and see my patients,'\" said Charles Vallejo. \"He would touch them and listen to their lungs.\"\n\nHe said his grandfather, who was healthy and strong for his age, was cautious about the virus and stayed home most of the time during the pandemic.\n\n\"The week before he got COVID, I was walking my dog and I saw my grandfather cutting a tree,\" said Charles Vallejo.\n\nBut his grandfather decided to join the family at a restaurant to celebrate his 89th birthday and he may have inadvertently contracted the virus from his son, Carlos, who began to show symptoms the following day.\n\nFlorida has been grappling with one of the country's worse surges in coronavirus cases that started in late June and July. Miami-Dade County accounted for the highest amount of cases and Hialeah, a blue-collar city, was at the heart of the outbreak.\n\nIt was in these communities that the two doctors served, where many knew the family and recognized their last names.\n\nBlanca Mourino, 68, was a patient of both Carlos and Jorge Vallejo since she moved to South Florida from New York in 1995 and has fond memories of both. He mother was a patient as well.\n\n\"He was an angel on earth and is now my angel in heaven,\" said Mourino about Carlos Vallejo through tears.\n\nShe said that when she was sick, she would often describe her symptoms over the phone and Carlos Vallejo would call in the medication to the pharmacy, saving Mourino a trip to his office and money for the visit.\n\n\"I loved him so much. I cannot go back to the office knowing he won't be there,\" Mourino, a retired postal worker, said.\n\nCarlos Vallejo is survived by his wife, a psychiatrist, and three children. He and his wife met in medical school and had been married for 33 years. He loved to travel the world and go diving and skiing during his time off from work.\n\nJorge Vallejo was born and raised in Guantanamo, Cuba where he became an outspoken critic of the late Fidel Castro's revolution. By 1965, he fled the island with his wife and two sons, ages two and three, and settled in the largely Cuban-American city of Hialeah.\n\nAfter passing his medical board exams he began to practice at Hialeah Hospital and delivered thousands of babies throughout his years in practice. In 1992, Jorge Vallejo delivered what was believed to be the smallest baby in the U.S., born at 22 weeks and weighing less than a pound.\n\n\"My grandfather would see people from all walks of life from recent immigrants to celebrities,\" said Charles Vallejo, who added his grandfather once saw the legendary 'Queen of Salsa,' the late Celia Cruz.\n\nHe practiced medicine until he was 74, when his wife passed away. He lived alone, across the street from his son and family and remained active, even driving an hour and a half to the family's summer home in the Florida Keys.\n\nCharles Vallejo will now continue his father's and grandfather's tradition -- entering a profession that is now losing some its members succumb to the deadly virus.\n\n\"One of the proudest moments of my life, and his life,\" said Charles Vallejo about his father Carlos, \"was when I finally got my white coat from medical school. He was there and so was my grandfather.\"\n\n\"He was a great father,\" said Charles, \"and a role model for me.\"",

    "Coronavirus missteps from CDC and FDA worry health experts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Stephen Hahn, the embattled head of the Food and Drug Administration, offered an assurance Monday: Any vaccine for public use will be approved \"on the basis of science and data.\"\n\n\"We will not make that decision on the basis of politics,\" he said in an interview with CBS Evening News. \"That's a promise.\"\n\nHahn's pledge comes after a series of recent public missteps involving the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- the two federal agencies that are critical to the U.S. coronavirus response -- that have damaged their reputations at a time when they are needed the most, according to seven prominent doctors and scientists who spoke to NBC News. They say that the recent events are clear signs of political interference from the White House and have shaken their trust and confidence in the leadership of the agencies.\n\n\"It's an enormous scandal,\" said Carl Bergstrom, a biologist at the University of Washington, who has become an outspoken critic of the U.S. pandemic response and has written extensively about misleading health information. \"What it looks like at this point is you have a White House altering public health advice to improve election chances to the detriment of American lives.\"\n\nIn an interview published Sunday in the Financial Times, Hahn said the FDA could fast-track a coronavirus vaccine by issuing emergency use authorization before the end of Phase 3 clinical trials. The comments were met with outcry from public health experts, prompting him to clarify in the CBS interview that a vaccine will not be politicized.\n\nBefore that, Hahn misrepresented data about convalescent plasma, leading him to subsequently apologize for overstating the potential treatment's benefits. He also subsequently ousted the agency's chief spokesperson over the fiasco, according to The New York Times.\n\nThe CDC sparked its own crisis when it inexplicably changed its guidance on COVID-19 testing in a way that ran contrary to the best available scientific evidence, according to Bergstrom. The updated recommendations,posted on the agency's website Aug. 24, suggested that people exposed to the coronavirus \"do not necessarily need a test\" unless they exhibit symptoms, are older or have existing medical needs that make them especially vulnerable to the virus.\n\nBut it's been known that infected individuals can be contagious before they experience symptoms, and people can also spread the virus even if they remain asymptomatic.\n\nCDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield later backtracked and issued a statement saying that \"all close contacts of confirmed or probable COVID-19 patients\" may consider getting tested.\n\nLoren Lipworth, an epidemiologist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, said the recent developments are troubling because they undercut the CDC's mission.\n\n\"As epidemiologists, the CDC has always been who we turn to for guidance and for the data,\" she said.\n\nBergstrom said that anything that compromises clear public health messaging could be very damaging, especially because scientists do learn new things about the virus and its effects on humans as a pandemic evolves. Roughly eight months into the worst pandemic in more than a century, research has shown that staving off the coronavirus relies on three pillars that work in concert with one another: testing widely, social distancing and wearing a mask.\n\n\"If you don't trust the agencies that are telling you to do this, then you don't have your key weapons to fight against a pandemic,\" he said.\n\nWith the FDA commissioner's blunder, Lipworth said it's particularly important for the person leading the agency responsible for overseeing the development of potential coronavirus treatments and vaccines to convey information correctly.\n\nThat situation has only furthered concerns that the federal agencies are now politicized. The spokesperson who was let go from the FDA was previously a reporter for One America News Network, a far-right media outlet that has been a staunch supporter of President Donald Trump.\n\nBeyond the obvious dangers of mischaracterizing data on a potential treatment, Lipworth said, it's still too early to know if convalescent plasma is, in fact, beneficial for patients. While the therapy has been shown to be safe, clinical trials are ongoing -- including at Vanderbilt University -- to test its effectiveness.\n\n\"The evidence is certainly not conclusive whether or not Dr. Hahn communicated it correctly,\" she said. \"But even if he had, we're still not at a point where we can say there's conclusive evidence of the benefits.\"\n\nAll of the doctors and public health experts who spoke to NBC News expressed concern that Hahn's misrepresentation could tarnish the FDA's reputation. As the agency tasked with evaluating the safety and effectiveness of vaccine candidates, this erosion of trust could be especially problematic, according to Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa.\n\n\"It's a real worry, especially when we have people who don't trust the government and don't want vaccines and barely believe that this virus is causing a problem,\" he said.\n\nDr. Steven Goodman, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at Stanford University, said the recent incidents may cause people to question the motivations of the federal agencies that respond to public health emergencies.\n\n\"It reduces confidence that they are without political influence,\" he said. \"Any statement that the FDA makes that they have to amend or qualify, or any hint that they are lowering their standards, makes future statements more suspect in the eyes of the public.\"\n\nAnd while public health has been shaped by politics throughout history, the recent events raise a different sort of red flag, according to Dr. Carlos del Rio, executive associate dean of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, who is serving as an investigator for Moderna's coronavirus vaccine clinical trials.\n\n\"Politics has always played a role in public health -- think about HIV, for example -- but it should not be partisan,\" del Rio said. \"It should never favor one party over another.\"\n\nThe missteps add frustration to scientists and public health experts who are already operating in a politically charged environment rife with misinformation.\n\n\"I've been concerned before, but this elevates it to angry,\" Goodman said.\n\nDr. David Dowdy, an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, called the recent events a \"tremendous blow\" to the credibility of the CDC and the FDA, but added that he hopes the damage isn't permanent.\n\n\"Long term, I hope that this is not something that will tarnish them too greatly,\" he said, \"if and when we have a political situation where science is not a political issue anymore.\"",

        "body": "A county health department in North Carolina has issued an alert after learning that approximately 10 people infected with the coronavirus were among the mourners at a funeral and memorial service last month.\n\nHealth officials in Chatham County, about 35 miles west of Raleigh, said in the public notice that the infected people were found to have attended a memorial service at Bonlee Recreational Park on July 25 and a funeral service at Emmaus Baptist Church in Pittsboro two days later.\n\n\"The positive test results came after the events, though others who were in attendance may have been exposed to the virus,\" the notice said.\n\n\"Our understanding is that between 70 to 100 people were at the memorial service and more than 200 were at the funeral,\" Zachary Horner, a spokesman for the county health department, told NBC News on Wednesday.\n\nThe church that held the funeral told officials that everyone who attended was required to wear a mask and sit six feet apart, the health department notice said. Masks were provided to people who did not have one.\n\n\"These measures likely helped reduce the risk of spread at the service,\" the notice said.\n\nThe health department said it has been in communication with the attendees who tested positive for the virus and with others who may have been in close contact with them.\n\n\"If you attended either or both of these events, please monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 and be sure to practice social distancing, especially around those who are at higher risk of serious illness such as older adults and people with underlying health conditions,\" the notice said. \"If you were told that you were in close contact with someone who tested positive, quarantine at home and stay away from others for at least 14 days.\"\n\nThe statement notes that large gatherings, especially where social distancing could not be maintained and face coverings were not consistently worn, have led to many coronavirus clusters around the state and country.",

        "body": "A Florida father whose battle with COVID-19 led his wife to publicly plead for young people to take the coronavirus seriously was released from the hospital Thursday.\n\nJohn Place and his entire family tested positive for the coronavirus after his 21-year-old son fell ill and learned that a friend he had hung out with was infected, Place's wife said in a Facebook Live video in June.\n\nPlace, who is diabetic, got sick the day after Father's Day and suffered the most serious symptoms in his family. He was hospitalized and placed on a ventilator after his condition worsened.\n\nOn Thursday, family and friends gathered outside Westside Regional Medical Center in Plantation, about six miles west of Fort Lauderdale, to celebrate his release.\n\nIn a Facebook Live video shared by his wife, Michelle Zymet, Pharrell Williams' \"Happy\" blared in the background as the group -- all wearing face masks -- eagerly awaited Place's arrival. When he was wheeled outside, the crowd erupted in cheers.\n\nPlace, wearing a T-shirt that read \"I'm Alive,\" appeared to get emotional as he waved to the crowd and hugged his family.\n\n\"I want to thank all the doctors and nurses and health care professionals here at Westside Regional Medical Center. They saved my life,\" he said outside the hospital. \"And to all the nurses and doctors out there, you're doing an amazing job. Thank you so much. I feel great!\"\n\nFollowing Zymet's Facebook Live video last month about her husband's plight, she said in an interview with MSNBC that she had pleaded with her son not to go out because she was concerned about the family getting sick.\n\n\"The younger generation, they just don't get it. They don't care; they don't think. I'm not quite sure what it is they don't get,\" she said on MSNBC. \"Our son, he was cooped up for a while and when the state lifted up and you could get out again and we weren't in quarantine, he decided he wanted to go out and hang out with his friends.\"\n\nShe said she decided to share her story to encourage younger people to take the virus seriously.\n\n\"We are trying to open everyone's eyes that by not wearing a mask, washing your hands frequently and by not social distancing you are putting yourself at risk and of those at home that you love ... each and every day,\" she wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nPlace told NBC Miami that he has a lot of things planned now that he's out of the hospital.\n\n\"This is a life-changing experience,\" he said. \"I'm going to make the best of it. I have new plans and things that I'm going to do to hopefully make a difference. First thing I want to do is donate plasma as soon as I can because somebody helped save my life with their plasma.\"",

No other facility reported even close to as many cases as La Palma did on Friday, with most detention centers seeing single-digit increases.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are detained at La Palma, but overall there are more than 21,000 people being held in ICE custody on civil immigration violations nationwide.\n\nICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe said in a statement that the agency recently expanded virus testing at La Palma, testing 1,000 detainees. Most were asymptomatic.\n\n\"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is firmly committed to the health, welfare and safety of detainees in our care, and this is one of the agency's highest priorities,\" Pitts O'Keefe wrote.\n\nThe Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, an advocacy group that provides legal services, said the high number of infections underscores the need to release immigrants from detention.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe organization says its clients at La Palma report that large sections of the detention center are locked down and that they're being fed cold, boxed meals three times a day.\n\nAdvocacy groups across the country have filed several lawsuits seeking to release vulnerable populations during the pandemic, and ICE has on some occasions released detainees who have health conditions that make them susceptible to getting seriously sick from the coronavirus.\n\nThe agency reported 850 new positive cases nationwide on Friday for a total of 5,300 overall cases since the pandemic began.\n\nFor most people, COVID-19 causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a few weeks.

        "body": "Actor and former wrestler Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson said Wednesday that his family recently tested positive for the coronavirus and are now implementing stricter rules on socializing amid the pandemic.\n\nJohnson, 48, posted a video to his Instagram and shared that he, wife Lauren and two young daughters all tested positive for COVID-19 about three weeks ago. The \"Jumanji\" and \"Baywatch\" actor said that his daughters had only mild symptoms, but that the illness was much harder on the adults.\n\n\"I could tell you that this has been one of the most challenging and difficult things we have ever had to endure as a family,\" Johnson said. \"And for me personally too as well, and I've gone through some doozies in the past.\n\nJohnson said the family is now \"on the other side\" of the virus, doing well and no longer contagious.\n\n\"We're all counting our blessings because we're well aware that it isn't always the case that you get on the other end of COVID-19 stronger and healthier,\" Johnson said. \"...Some of my best friends lost their parents, their loved ones, to this virus that is so incredibly relentless and unforgiving, and it is insidious.\"\n\nFriends unaware that they were infected apparently spread the illness the Johnsons when they visited the family's home. Johnson said that the close family friends felt terrible and that he has since implemented new rules about guests.\n\n\"Having your friends over, having your family members over, your loved ones, of course, you want that because you want that connection and you want to be with the people who you love and care about\" and have a good time with, he said. \"My takeaway here isn't necessarily keep them away, I'm not saying that, but what I am saying now is apply an even greater discipline to having people over to your house.\"\n\nJohnson said that any trusted family and friends who come to his house will be tested for the virus before being allowed over. The actor also said he's spoken to numerous doctors and experts on how the family can boost their immune systems and general wellness.\n\n\"When you have a boosted immune system and your immune system is strong and not compromised, then you got a shot,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe actor told his fans that they should \"stack the deck\" in their favor so as to decrease the likelihood of contracting the virus and increasing the chances of recovery should they get it. Johnson also rejected the idea that wearing a mask was a political act, encouraging his fans to don facial coverings to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\"Wear your mask. It is a fact, and it is the right thing to do,and it's responsible thing to do,\" Johnson said.",

    "Educators feel trapped between bad options as the school year begins": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As a nurse at two elementary schools, Michelle Lally of Rockford, Illinois, is used to looking after children's health. And she's not squeamish about being around sick students.\n\n\"On a good day before COVID, I'd get spit at, chewed on and bopped around by the kids all the time,\" said Lally, 64.\n\nBut Lally is dreading the coming school year, as the school district is giving parents the option of full-time in-person learning for elementary school students and two days in class for older students. Among her fears: that class sizes will be too large to observe social distancing and that the rules will be too vague or difficult to enforce.\n\n\"Some days I get anxious and teary. Other days I'm all over the place,\" she said. \"I want to see the kids in person, but if there aren't any guidelines in place, we shouldn't go back. We aren't prepared as a nation.\"\n\nLally isn't the only one concerned. In interviews, educators and school staff members described intense fears about the virus's spreading among children, parents and staff members, as well as doubts that their districts are being given the tools to protect them.\n\n\"My parents are older. I don't live with them, but I see them a lot, and I'd be worried to accidentally spread something to them,\" said Jamie Wong, 33, a high school and middle school English teacher in Somerset, New Jersey. Her school, which is offering a blend of in-person and remote learning, has already had its opening pushed back a week.\n\nWong said she's worried that schools won't be able to follow through on a plan for long without first controlling the outbreak nationally.\n\n\"I've talked to a few students whose parents have chosen\" remote learning, Wong said. \"They're saying, 'What's the point of going to school since we'll all be back and home as soon as someone tests positive?'\"\n\nAs schools open around the country, many educators sounded trapped between bad options: either return to facilities they don't feel are safe during an alarming national wave of new cases and deaths or return to remote learning, which they fear would leave students falling further behind.\n\n\"I'm torn, because teachers do the magic in the classroom, and you're right there to help the kids, but for me it's not worth the risk,\" said Mary Walther, a high school German teacher in Phoenix.\n\nWalther gave her district high marks for having prepared its online-only reopening plan in advance, but she has also had to play unofficial IT consultant for teenagers and teachers alike in the first week as they work out the kinks. A colleague called her crying asking her to help set up an older computer.\n\nAccording to an independent analysis by MCH Strategic Data, an institutional marketing data company, most school districts that have announced reopening plans will offer at least some classes in person, with about half opting for a \"hybrid\" of in-person and virtual learning.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nManuel Rustin, 40, will return virtually to teaching history, government and a course on hip-hop to high school students in Pasadena, California, this week after Gov. Gavin Newsom decided to start the year online. While Rustin said he agrees with the plan given safety concerns, he worries that the decision was made far too late to give teachers and students time to prepare.\n\n\"We're going into the fall essentially with the same model we had in the spring, and I don't know anyone who said the spring was a success,\" he said. \"I just feel like the summer's been squandered, because teachers like myself would have really appreciated having more guidance in what effective online teaching looks like.\"\n\nLast semester, Rustin's students struggled to get online and stay engaged while often looking after younger relatives or taking on paid work to help their parents through financial struggles related to the pandemic. With the state still working to improve support services like day care programs, he's worried that the same patterns will hold.\n\n\"Sometimes I'd be in contact with a student and then not hear from them for two weeks and then hear from them again,\" he said. \"I'm super concerned that more students will fall through the cracks without having that daily interaction with teachers and counselors.\"\n\nSome teachers are glad to be back in person. Lisa Geller, a college counselor at a boarding school in Maine, said she was \"very comfortable\" with her school's safety plan even though she is in a high-risk health category herself.\n\n\"I'm not being Pollyanna, but I think we've taken precautions,\" she said. Cases are low in the area, students are tested before they arrive and are housed in individual rooms, and there's a separate building to quarantine any positive or suspected cases going forward.\n\n\"Before the students came, I had a lot of anxiety,\" she said. \"I've read some articles about college students not complying with safety guidelines, but our kids have been very compliant.\"\n\nA teacher at a private school in Brooklyn, New York, who asked that her name not be used for fear of retaliation, said pressure from parents to reopen this semester had created tensions with staff members who were more reluctant to return. While she's glad to be teaching young students in person again, she's worried that it's \"virtually impossible\" for them to follow social distancing rules.\n\n\"I know it is extremely negative thinking, but I don't feel appreciated by the parents who demanded we get back to work during a pandemic with seemingly zero regard for how we felt about it,\" she said. \"I feel as if teachers are the sacrificial guinea pigs.\"\n\nEducators have emerged as a powerful voice against some of the more aggressive reopening plans, with many complaining that their safety isn't being fully taken into account.\n\nIn Washington, D.C., teachers dropped body bags outside Mayor Muriel Bowser's office ahead of her decision on a reopening plan. Shortly afterward, Bowser announced that classes would take place remotely to start the school year, following adjoining districts in Virginia and Maryland. In states that are moving forward with in-person classes, like Florida, teachers have prewritten their obituaries in protest.\n\nChildren are far less likely than adults to suffer serious consequences from COVID-19, but researchers are still working to determine how likely they are to transmit the virus to one another and to more vulnerable adults. While public health experts have largely cautioned against reopening in coronavirus hot spots, some have argued that schools in places with lower infection rates may safely reopen.\n\nA report by the American Academy of Pediatrics, which has advocated for in-person classes if feasible, found that over 97,000 children were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the first two weeks of July. Twitter and Facebook recently blocked a campaign video in which President Donald Trump falsely said children are \"almost immune\" to the virus.\n\nBradley Marianno, a professor of education at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, who has been tracking the response of teachers unions to the crisis, said unions have frequently demanded protections like temperature checks, regular testing and staff and space to accommodate reduced class sizes.\n\nBut with state and local budgets already under strain from the pandemic, meeting those goals has been difficult. In Marianno's state, Nevada, the governor and legislators approved cuts in school funding amid a drop in tax revenue, which inflamed the reopening debate. The Clark County Education Association, which represents educators in Las Vegas, put out a $14 million proposal to test all staff members before returning to full-time in-person classes, among other safety measures, but it ended up endorsing remote learning along with local school officials.\n\n\"It's an impossible budget situation in Nevada in particular,\" Marianno said. \"I think that's part of why the decision was made in Clark County school districts to move toward distance learning to start, because it was becoming clear that, given rising case counts, it would be next to impossible to implement all of the demands that the union wanted to ensure their staff was safe.\"\n\nSome teachers suggested that the development of a COVID-19 vaccine was needed for them to feel truly comfortable returning.\n\nOthers named a variety of safety measures they hoped might at least help address their concerns. Among them: mask requirements, which some schools don't have, smaller classroom sizes, upgraded ventilation systems and staff members to check for symptoms at the door.\n\nThe White House and Congress have yet to approve a new round of funding for school reopening plans, and talks have broken down between Republican and Democratic leaders. The Democratic-led House passed a bill in May that would have approved $58 billion for K-12 schools, while Trump and Senate Republican leaders backed a $70 billion plan in July but also pushed to make large tranches of aid contingent on schools' reopening with in-person classes.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nThe American Federation of Teachers last month authorized potential strikes by local chapters as a \"last resort\" if officials try to send them into schools they don't consider safe.\n\nIn addition to demanding at least $116 billion to implement new safety measures, they've asked districts to set benchmarks for COVID-19 transmission, including 14-day declines in cases and rates of positive tests below 5 percent, before even considering in-person classes.\n\nBut some teachers say even that standard is inadequate. A movement of educators called Refuse to Return went viral with a petition demanding that counties go 14 days without any coronavirus cases at all before reopening schools, with local chapters popping up to adopt its message.\n\nHarley Poston, a high school history teacher in Oakland, California, who started the petition, said he feared that officials had become too willing to accept the spread of the coronavirus compared to other countries in a way that endangered staff.\n\n\"We just didn't see in the national debate the priority of eliminating this disease,\" he said.\n\nAnd while he has concerns about remote learning for his students, \"I would rather deal with that challenge than deal with the threat of being sent to my death,\" he said.",

        "body": "Educators gathered Monday in demonstrations across the country addressing twin concerns of asafe and equitable school environment amid the COVID-19 pandemic and the nationwide reckoning around racial justice after the killing of George Floyd.\n\nThe demonstrations, held in dozens of cities, including Chicago, New York and Los Angeles, were part of the National Day of Resistance, organized by a coalition of teachers unions, social justice organizations and the Democratic Socialists of America. They took place in a combination of socially distant rallies and car caravans.\n\nEducators who planned to participate in the day of action spoke to NBC News' Social Newsgathering team in advance of the rallies. Many explained that their major concerns centered around the disproportionately negative impact COVID's new distance-learning modules had on students of color and low-income students, their concern about equitable access to online learning and, ultimately, concern about the lack of clarity in plans to reopen schools safely amid the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nNina Hike, a high school chemistry teacher who works in the Chicago public school district, said she is nervous about her district's plan for the new academic year, which she described as a hybrid model involving a combination of remote and in-person instruction. It's a plan teachers feel puts students and teachers at risk, and fails to take into account the challenges of equitably distributing resources to students in her district.\n\nOn July 17, the Chicago district released its plan, noting that it was rooted in science and in accordance with the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Illinois State Board of Education.\n\nThe plan states that schools will accommodate only 50 percent of the student population on any given day, and that teachers and students will undergo daily symptom and temperature checks. All teachers, staff and students will wear mandatory face coverings. Students will also be assigned to pods of approximately 15 students with a designated group of teachers. The district said that the pod model will reduce possible viral transmission and allow for rapid contact tracing in case of infections.\n\nBut Hike said she does not feel comfortable returning to the classroom in the midst of the pandemic. Chicago has seen over 61,000 cases of COVID-19 and nearly 2,800 deaths, according to data from the city published in August. Further, the city is heading in the wrong direction: the 7-day rolling average of COVID cases the last week of July was up 8 percent over the previous week.\n\n\"I don't feel safe because in the past, we've had issues with cleanliness inside the school. And to now know that, you know, the pandemic is raging ... it's just really hard for me to feel safe going back into the school,\" she said. \"What kind of learning do you think can take place if teachers and students are concerned about their lives?\"\n\nCecily Myart-Cruz, the president of the United Teachers Los Angeles, the union representing Los Angeles' teachers, said she's spoken with teachers in her district who are eager to be back in the classroom, but only when it's demonstrably safe.\n\n\"If and when science and data supports it ... our educators want to be back,\" she told NBC News. \"There's not one educator that does not want to be back with their students, not one.\"\n\nLos Angeles and the state of California are currently seeing surges in COVID-19 cases. The state has reported more than 500,000 cases, the highest among any state in the country, and more than 9,300 deaths. Los Angeles County has reported more than 192,000 cases and more than 4,600 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\n\"There's no way, in good conscience, I could say I would support educators going back if the science and the data doesn't support it,\" Myart-Cruz said.\n\nThe superintendent for the Los Angeles Unified School District agreed with the union's push for distance learning due to the continued threat of COVID-19. On July 13, the district, in a joint statement with the San Diego Unified School District, announced it would begin the school year fully online and continue to plan for a return to in-person learning when public health conditions allowed.\n\nBut while a resumption of a distance learning model is the safest solution for both students and educators, teachers and experts are also worried about how remote learning will affect students, especially low-income students and students of color.\n\nStudents of color face a multitude of challenges when it comes to remote learning and are at a much higher risk of falling behind educationally than their white peers, according to the Urban Institute, a progressive think tank based in Washington, D.C. These risk factors include being linguistically isolated, in other words, living in a home where parents do not speak English and thus cannot support English-language education, living in poverty, and crowded conditions. Further, a lack of access to necessary technologies such as the internet and computers demonstrably distances these students from their peers.\n\nThis is what happened to Hike's students in Chicago; they struggled with distance learning because many did not have access to the internet or computers. Many resorted to using cellphones to complete their school work.\n\nFurther, people of color, who already face gaps in health care and housing access, have been disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. While Black Americans make up only 13.4 percent of the U.S. population, they comprised 19.8 percent of COVID-19 cases and 22.1 percent of COVID-19 related deaths, according to the CDC. Hispanic/Latino Americans make up 18.5 percent of the U.S. population, yet comprise 31.8 percent of COVID-19 cases. The Chicago Public School district is 82.5 percent Black and Hispanic, according to data from the district.\n\n\"I think that the Black Lives Matter [movement], in conjunction with the pandemic, it kind of illuminated all of the inequalities that take place in the black community with all of the lack of resources, the disinvestment in communities of color, and then, now just the lack of resources even to get [an] education,\" Hike said. \"Nothing about being in a pandemic is normal. Nothing about dealing with racism is normal.\"\n\nMyart-Cruz echoed this sentiment, explaining that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated divides between white students and students of color in the Los Angeles Unified School district. According to data from the 2019-2020 school year, the district is comprised of 90 percent students of color.\n\n\"We can't go back to the status quo and I think this is what this National Day of Resistance really begins to harken where we need to go,\" she said. \"We must move forward and we must have a new vision of how we do business inside of the classrooms and outside of them.\"\n\nPart of this vision includes more support systems for students, including mental health resources, more school nurses and ethnic studies programs, Myart-Cruz explained.\n\n\"We have a duty to be anti-racist educators,\" she said. \"Everywhere there's systemic, structural, institutional racism, it's our job to root it out from its very foundations. That means looking at the institutions, programs and policies to really break those, those barriers down. Our students are asking for that and it is incumbent upon us to do that work.\"",

    "Europe watches in alarm as U.S. tops 5 million COVID-19 cases": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ROME -- With confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. hitting 5 million Sunday, by far the highest of any country, the failure of the most powerful nation in the world to contain the scourge has been met with astonishment and alarm in Europe.\n\nPerhaps nowhere outside the U.S. is America's bungled virus response viewed with more consternation than in Italy, which was ground zero of Europe's epidemic. Italians were unprepared when the outbreak exploded in February, and the country still has one of the world's highest official death tolls at over 35,000.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nBut after a strict nationwide, 10-week lockdown, vigilant tracing of new clusters and general acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing, Italy has become a model of virus containment.\n\n\"Don't they care about their health?\" a mask-clad Patrizia Antonini asked about people in the United States as she walked with friends along the banks of Lake Bracciano, north of Rome. \"They need to take our precautions. ... They need a real lockdown.\"\n\nMuch of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical know-how to treat the virus that the continent itself didn't have when the first COVID-19 patients started filling intensive care units.\n\nMore than four months into a sustained outbreak, the U.S. reached the 5 million mark, according to the running count kept by Johns Hopkins University. Health officials believe the actual number is perhaps 10 times higher, or closer to 50 million, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40 percent of all those who are infected have no symptoms.\n\n\"We Italians always saw America as a model,\" said Massimo Franco, a columnist with daily Corriere della Sera. \"But with this virus we've discovered a country that is very fragile, with bad infrastructure and a public health system that is nonexistent.\"\n\nWith America's world's-highest death toll of more than 160,000, its politicized resistance to masks and its rising caseload, European nations have barred American tourists and visitors from other countries with growing cases from freely traveling to the bloc.\n\nFrance and Germany are now imposing tests on arrival for travelers from \"at risk\" countries, the U.S. included.\n\n\"I am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention,\" German Health Minister Jens Spahn said last week.\n\nMistakes were made in Europe, too, from delayed lockdowns to insufficient protections for nursing home elderly and critical shortages of tests and protective equipment for medical personnel.\n\nHard-hit Spain, France, Britain and Germany have seen infection rebounds with new cases topping 1,000 a day, and Italy's cases went over 500 on Friday. Some scientists say Britain's beloved pubs might have to close again if schools are to reopen in September.\n\nEurope as a whole has seen over 207,000 confirmed virus deaths, by Johns Hopkins' count.\n\nIn the U.S., new cases are running at about 54,000 a day -- an immensely high number even when taking into account the country's large population. And while that's down from a peak of well over 70,000 last month, cases are rising in nearly 20 states, and deaths are climbing in most.\n\nIn contrast, at least for now Europe appears to have the virus somewhat under control.\n\n\"Had the medical professionals been allowed to operate in the States, you would have belatedly gotten to a point of getting to grips with this back in March,\" said Scott Lucas, professor of international studies at the University of Birmingham, England. \"But of course, the medical and public health professionals were not allowed to proceed unchecked,\" he said, referring to President Donald Trump's frequent undercutting of his own experts.\n\nWhen the virus first appeared in the United States, Trump and his supporters quickly dismissed it as either a \"hoax\" or a scourge that would quickly disappear once warmer weather arrived. At one point, Trump suggested that ultraviolet light or injecting disinfectants would eradicate the virus. (He later said he was being facetious).\n\nTrump's frequent complaints about Dr. Anthony Fauci have regularly made headlines in Europe, where the U.S. infectious-disease expert is a respected figure. Italy's leading COVID-19 hospital offered Fauci a job if Trump fired him.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nTrump has defended the U.S. response, blaming China, where the virus was first detected, for America's problems and saying the U.S. numbers are so high because there is so much testing. Trump supporters and Americans who have refused to wear masks against all medical advice back that line.\n\n\"There's no reason to fear any sickness that's out there,\" said Julia Ferjo, a mother of three in Alpine, Texas, who is \"vehemently\" against wearing a mask. \u202aFerjo, 35, teaches fitness classes in a large gym with open doors. She doesn't allow participants to wear masks.\n\n\u202a\"When you're breathing that hard, I would pass out,\" she said. \"I do not want people just dropping like flies.\"\n\nAnd health officials watched with alarm as thousands of bikers gathered Friday in the small South Dakota city of Sturgis for an annual 10-day motorcycle rally. The state has no mask mandates, and many bikers expressed defiance of measures meant to prevent the virus's spread.\n\nDr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who is leading a team seeking treatments for COVID-19, decried such behavior, as well as the country's handling of the virus.\n\n\"There's no national strategy, no national leadership, and there's no urging for the public to act in unison and carry out the measures together,\" he said. \"That's what it takes, and we have completely abandoned that as a nation.\"\n\nWhen he gets on Zoom calls with counterparts from around the globe, \"everyone cannot believe what they're seeing in the U.S. and they cannot believe the words coming out of the leadership,\" he said.\n\nAmid the scorn from other countries, Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien, newly recovered from a bout with the virus, gave an upbeat picture Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n\"We're going to fight like heck. We're working hard on vaccines. We're working hard on testing machines that are portable and fast. ... We're working on therapeutics,\" he said. \"I'm so impressed with our scientists and our doctors and our first responders and the folks who are attacking this disease, and God bless them all.\"\n\nMany Europeans point proudly to their national health care systems that not only test but treat COVID-19 for free, unlike the American system, where the virus crisis has only exacerbated income and racial inequalities in obtaining health care.\n\n\"The coronavirus has brutally stripped bare the vulnerability of a country that has been sliding for years,\" wrote Italian author Massimo Gaggi in his new book \"Crack America\" (Broken America), about U.S. problems that long predated COVID-19.\n\nGaggi said he started writing the book last year and thought then that the title would be taken as a provocative wake-up call. Then the virus hit.\n\n\"By March the title wasn't a provocation any longer,\" he said. \"It was obvious.\"",

    "Extra credit for masks? With no mandates at their schools, teachers urge students to wear them": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "When classes start Thursday in Checotah, Oklahoma, Lawrence E. \"Train\" Lane, a government and world history teacher, will be wearing a mask emblazoned with his school's mascot. For extra protection, he will also wear a plastic face shield on top of the mask while in his classroom.\n\nLane's students -- six classes of 18 or so high schoolers whom he will teach in person, five days a week -- will not have to wear face coverings. That is of concern to Lane, 72, a prostate cancer survivor who is vulnerable to complications if he catches the coronavirus.\n\n\"If you care anything about me and my life, you'll wear a mask,\" said Lane, who plans to offer extra credit to students who keep their masks on for the duration of his class period. \"I would like to stay around a little longer.\"\n\nHe anticipates some pushback. Most parents in the small rural town about 65 miles southeast of Tulsa do not support forcing students to wear masks, Lane said.\n\nThe state has been no help, either: Last month, Oklahoma's State Board of Education voted to recommend, but not require, masks for students, leaving it up to school districts to mandate them if they so choose. Checotah is strongly encouraging students to wear masks, but it has stopped short of making it a requirement.\n\nLane's district is one of a handful across the country that will be opening in person without empowering teachers to enforce the use of masks among their students. From Nebraska to Georgia, anxious teachers in these districts are questioning whether their schools are doing all they can to protect students and staff from an illness for which there is still no vaccine or reliable treatment.\n\nResearch has found masks to be effective against transmission of COVID-19, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has provided only a basic framework when it comes to children and masks. In schools, like most everywhere else, the CDC favors their use, but it has acknowledged that \"face coverings may be challenging for students (especially younger students) to wear in all-day settings.\" Masks for students are most essential when physical distancing is not possible, the agency added.\n\nThat is nearly all the time for Allison, 50, a high school history teacher in a rural district in central Tennessee who asked that her last name not be used out of fear of career repercussions for speaking out against her school's mask policy.\n\nAllison will have up to 35 students in her classes when school starts Monday and no way to space out desks to the CDC-recommended 6 feet. While masks will be optional for students, she plans to wear one every day: She has diabetes and chronic lung issues, and her son, 15, has multiple heart conditions. She wishes masks were required for everyone.\n\n\"It's just science that there's going to be the spread of germs, and a mask would help to prevent that,\" she said, adding that she has purchased a medical-grade air purifier for her classroom.\n\nMany school districts around the country do not have to worry about how or whether to require masks at the moment. As coronavirus hot spots have bubbled up across the United States, more and more schools have chosen to begin the year fully remotely, said Dan Domenech, the executive director of AASA, The School Superintendents Association, an advocacy organization for the 14,000 superintendents in the U.S.\n\nBut for those welcoming students back in the coming weeks to their buildings -- many of which were already considered overcrowded before the pandemic -- masks on adults and their pupils will be a crucial tool to limit outbreaks, experts say.\n\n\"Students absolutely have to wear masks,\" said Dr. Emily Landon, an associate professor and infectious diseases specialist at the University of Chicago Medicine. \"Think of all the sacrifices we have to make for COVID. That's not the biggest one. We need to stop fussing about it.\"\n\nHaving everyone wear masks can be particularly critical in staving off the spread of illness in asymptomatic and mild cases of COVID-19, when infected people are not aware that they are sick. Research is still emerging on children and the coronavirus, but it has found that kids, particularly elementary school-age ones, generally have milder symptoms than adults do -- although there have been rare fatal pediatric cases.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, like the CDC, recommends face coverings for kids when feasible, and it has said it \"strongly advocates\" having students physically present in school. The group believes the benefits of attending school in person outweigh the risks, given some evidence that children may be less likely to spread the infection.\n\nBut that may apply mostly to younger children. A large study in South Korea found that children ages 10 and up spread the virus as well as adults do, suggesting that school reopenings could lead to outbreaks.\n\nAnd even the idea that young children do not spread the virus is up for debate. A small study published July 30 in the journal JAMA Pediatrics found that children under 5 can carry just as much of the virus in their noses as older children and adults can. It is unclear what that means in terms of their ability to transmit the coronavirus, but it leaves the possibility open that they could be as contagious as adults, even if they do not seem very sick.\n\nTo Landon, the solution to all the unknowns is simple: Have all school-age children, along with everyone else, wear masks. If parents are worried that their young children will not keep them on all day, build up to it, she advised, by practicing for a short time period that gets longer each day leading up to the start of school.\n\n\"I think we should not underestimate our adaptability to adjust to certain circumstances,\" she said. \"Certainly, we get used to wearing pants. We get used to wearing bras. We can become used to wearing masks.\"\n\nBut compliance is not the only hindrance. Cost is also a factor. An average-size district that reopens for in-person learning is expected to dole out about $490 extra per student for new health and safety protocols, according to an analysis by AASA and the Association of School Business Officials International. Besides personal protective equipment, other costs include daily sanitization procedures, more school buses to enable social distancing and the hiring of school nurses.\n\nJessica Peterson, a fifth grade teacher at John Harris Elementary School in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, will have 24 students in her class for five days a week of in-person learning starting at the end of this month. In her classroom supply list for the coming school year, she has asked parents to include a mask for each child.\n\nBut she has no ability to enforce the request, and, while her school district supports it, leadership from the state has not. In a news conference about reopening schools held from Peterson's classroom July 28, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem said she would not require masks for students, declaring that children \"almost never transmit the disease to someone else\" and prompting the ire of a state doctors group.\n\nPeterson said Noem's announcement was disappointing.\n\n\"She's given the power to the school districts to decide what we need, and I understand that,\" she said. \"But it's most powerful when your governor says, 'Yes, we should be wearing masks.' And she didn't.\"\n\nPeterson has taken it upon herself to add more protection in her classroom. Her students sit at small group tables, and Peterson and her husband have built plexiglass partitions to put in the middle of the tables as barriers.\n\n\"I'm doing my best to get my room ready to keep my students as safe as possible,\" she said. \"There's definitely not the same excitement that I normally have as a teacher about going back to school. There's some anxiety that comes with it. But I really do want to get back into my classroom.\"\n\nOther teachers share that dedication to their students.\n\nAllison, the Tennessee teacher, said many of her students live in poverty and do not get enough food or attention when they are at home. She worries about them when they are not in school and wants to be there to support them.\n\n\"I do think it's very, very important to be back in school, but I just want to make sure we're doing it safely,\" she said. \"I was hoping that we would have smaller class sizes, and that would have eased my mind a lot, but that's not the case.\"\n\nLane, the high school teacher in Oklahoma, said he never considered not returning to the classroom, even though his age and the semiannual treatments he still gets for prostate cancer put him in a high-risk category.\n\n\"I love being there. I love working with those kids, and I feel like I've made a great impact on the lives of the students I've taught,\" he said.\n\nThere will be some precautions. Lane's high school plans to take students' temperatures twice a day. His district has provided him with two clear shower curtains to hang in his classroom -- one at his desk and one in the front of the room near the interactive whiteboard he teaches at -- to shield him from the virus should an infected student come in. And the district is offering remote learning, although Lane's high school expects at least 80 percent of students to return in person.\n\nStill, teachers are scared, said Lane, who is a zone director for the Oklahoma Education Association. In recent weeks, up to 20 teachers a day across the state have asked the Oklahoma Education Association for assistance writing out their wills; last year at this time, only about two teachers a month were using the service, he said.\n\nLane said that if there were a hard requirement for students to wear masks in classrooms, he would feel a little safer.\n\n\"We know that masks work,\" he said. \"I don't know if politics have gotten in the way of science and people don't believe in masks, or maybe they think it's going to detract from their looks or whatever, but we know that masks work.\"",

    "FDA: Don't use rapid COVID tests on people without symptoms": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "People without symptoms of COVID-19 who haven't been exposed to the virus shouldn't get rapid tests to see if they are infected, according to guidance Friday from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe guidance, added to the agency's website, says that instead, highly sensitive tests, known as PCR tests, should be used for such individuals -- if turnaround times are fast enough. These lab-based tests are known to be more accurate, but take hours to complete. Recent backlogs across the country have left some people waiting upward of 10 days for results.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"This is a sound strategy and is generally how these tests have been promoted by the FDA,\" said Dr. Joseph Petrosino, director of molecular virology and microbiology at Baylor College of Medicine. \"It is not, however, how I've seen them used in some settings.\"\n\nRapid or point-of-care tests, which take just minutes to run and are done in a doctor's office, have come under fire in recent weeks because they are typically not as sensitive and may give false negatives.\n\nAccording to the new guidance, if rapid tests are being used and patients test negative, then doctors should consider adding a different test or collecting new samples on a different day to confirm the results.\n\n\"The general concern here is that the cost of rapid tests are generally no lower than PCR, so it gets expensive to repeat test people,\" Petrosino said. \"I think we will see some new tests soon that are more cost effective on the rapid test front that can help change the game here.\"\n\nThe guidance comes at the same time that the Trump administration is pushing for more rapid testing. In an interview last week with NBC News medical correspondent Dr. John Torres, the administration's testing czar, Dr. Brett Giroir, said that there would be 23 million rapid tests on the market by September.",

If you purchase something through our links, we may earn a commission. Pricing and availability are accurate as of publish time. Learn more about Shop TODAY.\n\nAs some restaurants, salons and other businesses welcomed back their customers in August, NBC News Shopping readers continued to invest in face masks, filters and thermometers. While students geared up to return to online or in-person classes, our visitors showed an increased interest in back-to-school related items: kids face masks, Wi-Fi routers and other tech to create an at-home classroom. With increased time spent at home, NBC News Shoppers continued to purchase products to improve their homes, including vacuums, ergonomic chairs and exercise bikes, as well as grooming essentials such as trimmers and razors. After you check out the above shopping guides and recommendations, we've also rounded up the most popular home, tech and wellness products that readers gravitated towards last month. Here are the most purchased products we covered in August.\n\nInserting a filter into your cloth face mask should increase its effectiveness to filter out dust and other particles, according to Nidhy Varghese, MD, a pediatric pulmonologist in Texas. However, she previously told NBC News Shopping that adding an extra filter not necessarily make it more effective against coronavirus. These OUBA disposable filters are made of five layers of activated carbon made and non-woven material. They come in sets of 20 and filter out 99 percent of exhaust, pollen, smoke and other air particles.\n\nExperts recommend keeping a thermometer at home since the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists fever as one COVID-19 symptom. Although there are many thermometers to choose from, this digital one by iHealth is Amazon's No. 1 bestseller in health care thermometers. It uses infrared technology and allows you to take one's temperature from about three centimeters away. It's also equipped with distance and environmental sensors for more accurate readings. You get results in about one second and the thermometer features large, white LED lights so you can easily read the temperature in dark environments.\n\nThe GermGuardian AC4825 includes a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter, charcoal and PCO filter, UV-C sanitizer and TIO2 treatment to reduce and capture odors, mold and other particulates in the air. It is Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM) approved and features a cleaning capacity of 167 square feet for most medium to large rooms. It also includes three-speed settings and a filter replacement indicator. While readers mostly purchased this air purifier, they also ordered air purifiers from Levoit and Blueair.\n\nThese kid-friendly, dual-layered cloth face masks by Crayola come in packs of five, allowing your child to wear a different one for each school day in a week. They feature colorful adjustable ear loops that create a snug fit and can help you and your students form better habits around wearing them daily. Aside from this Craymoji design, the masks also come in six other styles, including Crayola Stripe and Tip Faces. Each mask sports a tiny name tag and you'll receive a mesh laundry bag with each purchase.\n\nThe Casio F91W-1 watch features a simple-yet-vintage design. It's Amazon's No. 1 bestseller in men's wristwatches and is, according to the editor of NBC News Shopping, \"virtually invincible.\" It is also water-resistant so you can take it to the pool or beach as you enjoy the last stretch of summer. Plus, it includes a 24-hour clock option, features an alarm and stopwatch, and is equipped with a nighttime backlight.\n\nIf you're looking for a trimmer for your face, hair or body, consider the Philips Norelco Multigroom 7000. It's equipped with a five-hour rechargeable battery and features 23 attachments, including a nose and ear trimmer, foil shaver and extra-wide hair trimmer to cover all your needs. This stainless steel, multipurpose tool also includes self-sharpening blades that can last up to five years.\n\nExperts argue it's important that you invest in essential grilling tools and accessories for a better grilling experience. The stainless steel Misto Brushed Aluminum Oil Sprayer is Amazon's No. 1 bestseller for oil dispensing oil sprayers. It's easy to use and features a pump style cap. Being a reusable, non-aerosol sprayer, it doesn't use chemical propellants and offers an environmentally-friendly alternative. Although the end of summer is near, there's still time to get out the grill and have a socially-distant picnic.\n\nThe Shark Navigator Lift-Away is a lightweight, upright vacuum. It includes a HEPA filter plus an Anti-Allergen Complete Seal that work together to capture dust and allergens, while preventing them from escaping back into the air. It also features swivel steering to clean around furniture, as well as Lift Away technology so you can detach the canister and get hard-to-reach places.\n\nIf you're looking to upgrade your home workstation, consider investing in a new ergonomic keyboard, mouse and office chair. NBC News Shopping visitors seemed to gravitate towards this budget-friendly option by Modway. For comfort, it features a breathable mesh back and plush vinyl seat cushion. It is also height-adjustable, includes lock functions and tilt tensions plus a 360-degree swivel. While the black offers a sleek design, it also comes in Blue, Gray, Red, Green and Brown.\n\nIf you're looking for a new router to keep up with sharing the Wi-Fi between online schooling and working from home, consider the TP-Link AC1750. Our readers like this budget-focused option featuring theoretical top speeds of up to 1,300Mbps for an individual device or 1,750Mbps across multiple devices. It's dual-band, includes parental controls and has Amazon Alexa compatibility.\n\nAlthough Peloton is a well-known exercise bike company, other brands offer stationary bikes with similar functionality at power price points. NBC News Shopping visitors like this Sunny Health & Fitness option. It's relatively budget-friendly, offers an adjustable resistance knob and doesn't require a membership fee. It also includes an adjustable seat and handlebars, transportation wheels and a bottle holder.\n\nFashion brands, such as Athleta are selling face masks to help curb the spread of coronavirus. According to Jana Henning, head of product at Athleta, the Made to Move Mask is lightweight and made to stay on your face while you exercise. It features soft elastic and is made of two layers of the Gap brand's patented featherweight stretch fabric: A polyester and spandex blend with a combination mesh and polyester blend liner for comfort and breathability.\n\nThis mini dehumidifier by Pro Breeze holds up to 52 ounces of water and is convenient for small spaces. After consulting experts, we ranked this \"whisper-quiet\" dehumidifier as the best basic dehumidifier of 2020. Certified mold inspector Jennifer Nitrio of Mold Help For You previously said this device is \"portable and lightweight with an auto shut-off feature. Although it doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles, it is a workhorse in small spaces with only minor moisture concerns.\" If you're looking for a larger option with more functions, consider the highly rated Frigidaire 30-Pint Dehumidifier with Effortless Humidity Control.\n\nMichael Schmidt, PhD, a professor with the department of microbiology and immunology at the Medical University of South Carolina, previously told NBC News Shopping \"We take a shower to remove the microbes affiliated with our skin. The only thing that microbes like better than human skin is plastic and glass.\" PhoneSoap products can kill 99.99 percent of the bacteria that's been accumulated on your device in just five minutes. The PhoneSoap 3 includes two charging ports, fits smartphone and most cases and comes in a variety of colors including Aqua, Black, Periwinkle and Gold.\n\nThe Billie Razor features five nickel- and rust-free blades for a smooth and sensitive skin-friendly shave. It includes charcoal shave soap for comfort and cleaning and an ergonomic handle with a matte rubber back, available in DreamPop, Coral, Cool Blue and Blush, to prevent slipping. Additionally, Billie products are vegan and gluten- and cruelty-free.",

    "Fauci says he 'has some concern' about change to COVID-19 testing guidelines": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The nation's leading infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, expressed concern about changes to COVID-19 testing guidances, which were finalized by the White House Coronavirus Task Force when he was undergoing surgery.\n\nDr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department for Health and Human Services, told reporters Wednesday that the decision to change the testing guidance came Thursday, August 20, the day Fauci had surgery to remove a noncancerous polyp on his vocal cords.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nFauci recalls \"quickly reviewing a version of the guidelines\" that had circulated previously, according to a spokesperson from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, which Fauci leads. \"At the time he was not struck by the potential implications of this particular change in the version he reviewed.\"\n\n\"Now reading them carefully, he has some concern that the revised guidelines could be interpreted as lessening the importance of asymptomatic spread of virus in the community,\" the spokesperson said, adding that \"if people who come into close and prolonged contact with a documented case of COVID-19 become infected and are asymptomatic and are not tested and given results in a timely fashion, then asymptomatic spread to others could occur.\"\n\nThe updated guidance states that healthy people who have been exposed to COVID-19 \"do not necessarily need a test,\" as long as they don't have symptoms. That's a change from previous advice that recommended testing for all close contacts of infected individuals, regardless of whether they had symptoms.\n\n\"It truly makes no sense,\" Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore health commissioner, said. \"The CDC itself estimates that 40 percent of people with coronavirus are asymptomatic. And if we are unable to identify asymptomatic individuals, we cannot stop this pandemic.\"\n\n\"We should be dramatically ramping up our testing capacity, not limiting the people who should be getting tests,\" she said.\n\nDr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, suggested the guidance was \"dangerous.\"\n\n\"If we're not testing these people, they will infect others, and the viral transmission and outbreak will only get worse over time,\" he said.\n\nThe fallout over the new testing recommendations has been caught in a back-and-forth between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and HHS.\n\nOn Monday, the CDC quietly posted the new guidelines. When asked about the changes, CDC officials refused to answer questions, instead directing inquiries to HHS.\n\nThe department volleyed the responsibility back to the CDC on Wednesday. \"Let me tell you right up front, that the new guidelines are a CDC action,\" Giroir said.\n\nHe later said during the same call the change was an \"evidence-based decision driven by scientists and physicians\" and that the White House task force members, including CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield, Dr. Deborah Birx, and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, were involved.\n\n\"We worked on this all together to make sure that there was absolute consensus that reflected the best possible evidence and the best public health for the American people,\" Giroir said.\n\nHowever, neither the CDC nor HHS provided any new evidence to show why less testing for COVID-19 would be beneficial to public health.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, President Donald Trump has been outspoken about his desire to slow down testing, citing a belief that the United States has the most COVID-19 cases in the world because of the number of tests it carries out.\n\nThe CDC guidance is just that; it does not set laws or mandate testing. Each state or locality has the authority to make its own decisions of who should be tested and when.\n\nIn North Carolina, for example, the state's Department of Health and Human Services sent a letter to its physicians Wednesday, acknowledging the change in testing recommendations from the CDC, but stated it would not alter any state guidelines.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo also weighed in, tweeting, \"This is not science. It's politics. Politics that are dangerous to public health. It's indefensible.\"\n\nThe Washington Department of Health, too, pushed back on the testing change, writing in a press release that \"more people need to get tested at the right time if we're going to make the progress needed to find infections and stop the spread of this virus.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nDoctors on the front line acknowledged that testing people too early after an exposure could provide a false sense of security.\n\n\"Even if you get a negative test result, it doesn't get you out of quarantine,\" said Dr. Christopher Ohl, a professor of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. He and other public health experts encouraged people to quarantine for the full 14 days after being in close contact with an infected person.\n\nHe explained that testing people without symptoms too early might be harmful if it means they will move freely in the public without proper protection. Just because a person tests negative on day four after an exposure doesn't mean they won't develop the illness on day 10.",

    "Fear and empathy at LA funeral home serving Black families": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- When people began dying from the coronavirus in the United States, for a few weeks funeral home owner Candy Boyd declined to receive the remains of such patients.\n\nThere were too many unknowns, and Boyd didn't feel like her employees had the training or equipment to safely handle the remains of people who may have active COVID-19 infection in their bodies. But the calls kept coming. Desperate families said other funeral homes were also not receiving people who died of the virus.\n\nBoyd, 53, decided she had to make it work. She reminded herself that she got into the funeral home business more than 10 years ago after running a construction company because she wanted to help people in their most vulnerable state. And the communities her funeral home serves, Black people and others of color in South Los Angeles, were clearly being hard hit.\n\n\"It tugged at my heart strings,\" said Boyd. \"To hear some of the stories I've heard in the last three months has been incredible. People having to say goodbye through an iPad, a window.\"\n\n\"Many have not seen their family members in 30 days. The next time they see them is in a casket,\" she said.\n\nWith some other homes still not taking bodies, Boyd said her facility's workload has increased by 40 percent while constantly adapting to changing state and local regulations.\n\nThe first months, she had trouble sleeping and eating. Her 32-year-old daughter, who also works at the funeral home, persuaded her to stop watching the news.\n\n\"When the pandemic first started, I had nightmares, I would wake up in a cold sweat thinking about this,\" said Boyd.\n\nBoyd is among many funeral home directors and morticians with misgivings about whether to accept those felled by the virus. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nCarol Williams, executive director of the Georgia-based National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association, said many of its 1,200 members have struggled to get high-grade protective equipment and decided not to.\n\n\"When you have somebody pick up a COVID case, they can catch the disease,\" said Williams. \"As an embalmer, you need a surgical mask, the same thing that doctors have in the hospital.\"\n\nToday at the Boyd Funeral Home, workers and visitors wear masks at all times. Visitors have their temperature checked at the door. When making arrangements, only two people are allowed in the office. For casket viewings, only five people are allowed in the chapel at a time. They can't congregate, must maintain physical distance and are not allowed to linger. Until a few weeks ago, funeral services were limited to 25 people. Now those services must be held outside.\n\n\"I've gotten a lot of push back from families,\" said Boyd. \"We had one lady who said she was going to punch me in the eye because she couldn't stand in the chapel.\"\n\nFounded in 1963 by Boyd's husband, Reginald Boyd, the funeral home is in Westmont, an area of South Los Angeles that has historically had many Black residents and today also has large numbers of Latinos. Both communities have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, which has killed more than 165,000 people in the U.S.\n\nBoyd has close relationships with many families in Los Angeles. Workers recently handled the remains and organized the service for the 34-year-old daughter of family friends.\n\nNot long before she died in the hospital, the woman told her mother, \"I think COVID has got the best of me. If something happens, please tell Ms. Candy to come and pick me up,\" Boyd recalled the mother telling her.\n\n\"I've seen heads decapitated, legs taken off. I've seen everything. I can't say I've ever seen anything like this,\" said Boyd. \"What bothers me is that they keep saying that a lot more people are going to die.\"",

    "Fever checks are a common but flawed way to screen for COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Fever checks have widely become the first level of coronavirus detection as businesses, stores and schools try to reopen, but a new study cautions that relying on them as a single screening tool could lead to a false sense of security.\n\nFever is generally the first symptom of a coronavirus infection, according to a study from the University of Southern California, followed by cough, nausea, vomiting and lower gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea.\n\nFor the study, researchers used World Health Organization data, which included information on nearly 60,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, to model the order of symptoms. Limitations of the study, published last week in a public health journal, include that the cases were almost all from China during the early days of the pandemic, before other types of symptoms were recognized.\n\nWhile a temperature check can detect people who are showing symptoms, there are a significant number of people who could be contagious that don't develop a fever, said study co-author Peter Kuhn, a professor of biological sciences, medicine and engineering at USC.\n\nA temperature of 100.4 F is considered a fever by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nWith more than 21 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide, public health officials have learned that the infection can cause a wide range of symptoms, from barely noticeable sniffles and headaches to difficulty breathing and chest pain. The CDC currently lists the following possible symptoms, but says there may be others:\n\nStudies have shown that children are more likely to have milder symptoms, which could be mistaken for a different illness. A new loss of smell and taste is a common early symptom for milder cases, and is more common among younger patients and women.\n\nSymptoms can appear anytime between two to 14 days, although about five to six days after exposure is the average. While many people never show signs of infection, even those who eventually do become symptomatic could spread the disease for days prior to developing a fever, said David Paltiel, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\n\"If you're using signs and symptoms as a basis for moving ahead, it's like the fire department waiting until a house has burned down before springing into action,\" said Paltiel, who published a study in July on bringing college students back to campus in JAMA Network Open.\n\nAt the UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital in Pittsburgh, all visitors are screened with temperature scanners, said Dr. Joe Suyama, chief of emergency services.\n\n\"They are not the technological safety net that most people expect them to be,\" he said. \"However, most institutions, hospitals and schools are implementing some form of screening.\"\n\nSuyama and others hope that, along with blocking entry to people with symptoms, the screening stations will remind people that no one can let their guard down. Fever checks need to be a part of other protocols that include masks and social distancing, infectious disease experts say.\n\n\"Because screening for the virus is so imperfect, it's better not to count on it,\" said Dr. David Thomas, a professor of medicine and director of the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Medicine. \"It's not that we don't believe in testing and screening, but we don't trust them entirely.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A 17-year-old in Georgia lost both of his parents to COVID-19 four days apart.\n\n\"I know they're watching me from above,\" Justin Hunter told NBC affiliate WXIA of Atlanta. \"They're the ones that are going to give me strength to get through all of this.\"\n\nHunter and his parents, Angie and Eugene, tested positive last month for COVID-19 -- the disease caused by the coronavirus -- and quarantined.\n\nHunter, the couple's only child, could not immediately be reached for comment by NBC News.\n\nAfter his parents' symptoms worsened, they were admitted to Emory Johns Creek Hospital, Hunter told WXIA.\n\n\"I never really thought about them even passing,\" Hunter said. \"That never crossed my mind.\"\n\nEugene Hunter died July 26. He was 59.\n\n\"The hospital, they called me and they had to break the news to me,\" Hunter said.\n\nAfter his father died, Hunter said, it was even more difficult not being able to see his mother.\n\nWhen he spoke with her by phone, she told him she would keep fighting to get better and return to their home, he recalled.\n\nBut four days later on July 30, Hunter received another call from the hospital.

    "He went to the U.S. for the American Dream. Then coronavirus hit. His ashes came back to Mexico.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "PUEBLA, Mexico -- There were 105 square boxes, each weighing just 4 pounds, wrapped in black fabric that gleamed in the hot sun. Arranged side by side, they contained the ashes of 105 people from the Mexican state of Puebla who at some point in their lives migrated more than 2,500 miles to pursue the American Dream in New York City.\n\nNow, their remains were back home, in small square boxes in the hot sun, after they lost their lives to the coronavirus.\n\n\"Those ashes are all we have left of him, but we had to have them,\" Mar\u00eda Fernanda Arg\u00fcello said about her brother Marcos Arg\u00fcello Ortiz, who had left Mexico 12 years earlier and died in a New York City hospital on April 24, at age 34, when doctors disconnected him from his respirator.\n\nPuebla Gov. Miguel Barbosa Huerta -- who is remembered for his false claim that the poor are \"immune\" to COVID-19 -- asked for forgiveness for his remarks in a brief ceremony July 14.\n\nDuring the official ceremony in Puebla, the deceased were described as heroes.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThose who died in New York City had crossed the border to work in the U.S. as drivers, gardeners, dishwashers, cooks, deliverymen, workers, maids, waitresses, cleaners or janitors. Although they were undocumented, their work was considered essential, so they continued to show up even as the coronavirus infected more than 4.6 million people in the U.S. and killed over 156,000.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the family was taking Arg\u00fcello's remains to La Providencia, two hours away, where he was born and raised.\n\nIn New York City, Ricardo T\u00e9llez, who is also from Puebla, remembered Arg\u00fcello.\n\n\"He was always happy and supportive. He did not forget you, nor did he leave you alone at a soccer game,\" T\u00e9llez said, remembering how Arg\u00fcello loved to cycle quickly through Manhattan, dodging cars and zigzagging streets with a smile as he delivered food for a Mexican restaurant.\n\n\"April was a terrible month, like hell,\" said T\u00e9llez, who also got the coronavirus around that time. After T\u00e9llez felt better, he reached out to Arg\u00fcello -- who was in the hospital -- through Facebook.\n\n\"I came because the cough was going to kill me,\" he said Arg\u00fcello wrote to him. \"I hope to get out of this nightmare soon.\"\n\nLatinos have been disproportionately affected by the pandemic; of the more than 18,900 people to have died in New York City, nearly a third were Latino. According to the Mexican Foreign Ministry, at least 1,863 Mexicans have died in the U.S. from the coronavirus. New York tops the list with 760 deaths.\n\nImmigrants like Arg\u00fcello, who often have little access to medical resources and can sometimes suffer from other health conditions, \"cannot keep a healthy distance because they usually rent houses where up to 12 or 15 people live\" to save money, said Ricardo Andrade, president of Fundaci\u00f3n Pies Secos, a nonprofit. \"There is always contact with others in the kitchen, the living room or the bathrooms. Unfortunately, there are cases in which entire families were infected.\"\n\nEsmeralda Vel\u00e1zquez, another friend, helped take care of Arg\u00fcello when he first got ill in late March and recalled how he deteriorated. \"He had come many times to my house, but on that occasion he got lost. He told me that he didn't know where he was, that he was disoriented, so I went downstairs and saw him -- going the other way,\" Vel\u00e1zquez said.\n\nThey went up to her apartment, and they isolated him in a room, but he kept coughing. The echo of his breathing could be heard in the house, and his nose began to bleed; he vomited blood clots. \"I thought his lungs were bursting. I was scared,\" Vel\u00e1zquez said. \"So I dressed him, and around 5 in the morning, we took him to the hospital because he could hardly walk.\"\n\nSoon after, she and her husband, Rub\u00e9n Castellanos, as well as their six children, began to show symptoms of the virus. She said she felt remorse because they all got better -- but not her friend.\n\nVel\u00e1zquez had the opportunity to say goodbye to Arg\u00fcello at the hospital. She pulled on her protective suit and, between sobs, was able to speak to him one last time while the machines kept him alive.\n\n\"You are going to be with your dad who you always cried for. I am going to show this to your godchildren,\" she told Arg\u00fcello about the last video she has of him. \"It is the only thing they are going to have now.\n\nArg\u00fcello's friends in New York described the delays and frustrations over obtaining his remains so they could send them to Mexico. \"We paid about $1,800 for the cremation, and they gave it to us in a cardboard box,\" said T\u00e9llez, who along with other friends created a GoFundMe campaign to defray expenses.\n\nIxelt Romero Morales, director of the Poblano Institute for Assistance to Migrants, said that is what many relatives and friends are going through as they work to bring coronavirus victims' remains back home.\n\nArg\u00fcello's New York City friends finally received his ashes on May 27, more than a month after his death. The next day, they celebrated his 35th birthday with a small gathering of relatives who ate aguachile and cake and prayed the rosary for his soul. They listened to the cumbia and northern music that Arg\u00fcello liked so much.\n\nAlmost a month later, on June 22, Arg\u00fcello's friends were able to deliver his ashes to the Mexican Consulate in New York, where the government of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador launched a program to fly back coronavirus victims' remains, also offering aid of up to $1,800 for funeral expenses.\n\nThe remains of Arg\u00fcello and 250 other people from Puebla, Oaxaca and Veracruz arrived in Mexico on July 13.\n\nArg\u00fcello dreamed of returning to his homeland to marry and start a family. He had already told his mother that he would visit her this year, and he joked that he would knock on the door when she least expected it.\n\n\"He could never come in all these years, and now what we have are his little ashes,\" Carolina Ortiz, 57, his mother, said tearfully.\n\nDressed in black, with a faraway demeanor, Ortiz recalled the long conversations with her son, his good humor and the adventures he recounted about life in New York, delivering orders.\n\nThe ashes had arrived the day before, and her humble home had become the center of attention in La Providencia, a small town of just 800 inhabitants very close to the border with Veracruz.\n\nWhen she turned to look at the wooden box with the photo of her son, surrounded by flowers, figures of the virgin and candles, her voice broke and she cried: \"He left because my husband died in a traffic accident. He was the youngest, and he was brave, because here they pay almost nothing. It was not enough for us. I see his photos, and they make me want to cuddle him, to feel him, but now we'll have to fight to keep going on.\"\n\nPuebla is the Mexican state with the third-highest number of immigrants in the U.S., about 56,000, the majority in New York. Last year, they set a record, sending $1.7 million in remittances to their loved ones back home.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe last day of Marcos Arg\u00fcello's long journey started very early for his relatives.\n\nHis two brothers and several cousins went to the churchyard, on the outskirts of town, to dig the grave. \"He could never come anymore, with this problem of the epidemic. We realized that he was ill, and they put him in the hospital, but he could no longer leave,\" said his brother Miguel Arg\u00fcello, 40.\n\nTaking a breather and sitting on a grave, he pointed out the surrounding fields and remembers when he worked in the fields with his brother. They planted corn, potatoes, whatever they could, but it was not enough. It is the tragedy of La Providencia, of fertile deep black lands that one cannot live on anymore.\n\nThat is why people emigrate, whether or not there is a pandemic, which also exists in Mexico.\n\n\"It is always scary that the epidemic will hit you, but you have to get out. I have my children. They have to eat, and I have to go out to work for them,\" Miguel Arg\u00fcello said.\n\nMois\u00e9s Arg\u00fcello, Marcos' other brother, was keeping track of the preparations: the depth of the pit, the cooking of the carnitas over low heat in the patio of the family home, the beginning of prayers and the mariachis. \"Here we are all doing well, thank God. No one has gotten sick. The only bad thing is that there is almost no work,\" he said.\n\nMore than 60 people gathered during the funeral, but none wore masks or maintained social distancing.\n\nThe mariachis arrived, and the family burst into tears when they heard the words of a popular and heartbreaking song, \"M\u00e9xico lindo y querido,\" which means \"pretty and beloved Mexico.\"\n\n\"If I die far from you / Let them say I'm asleep / And bring me back here,\" the song says.\n\nHis sister Cleotilde sobbed silently. She had to leave Mexico City with her two daughters because of the pandemic, and now she lives in Texcoco, in the state of Mexico. She lost her job as a cleaning person, and her husband, who is a bricklayer, is also unemployed.\n\n\"He left so that we never lacked anything. He sacrificed himself very hard, and we are going to miss him very much,\" she said of her brother.\n\nAt noon, more than 60 family and friends began the slow, mile-long procession to the churchyard. Once the ashes were placed on a table at the pantheon, they lined up to hug the wooden box, touch it and kiss it, look at his photograph or simply cry. There are no priests, only his family and friends -- those who ran and played soccer with him in those rustic streets, danced at the patron saint festivals and worked alongside him in the fields -- now saying goodbye.\n\nAt 1 in the afternoon, they buried him several meters underground, next to his father. His 12-year journey north and back was over.\n\nAn earlier version of this story was first published in Noticias Telemundo.",

    "Hong Kong man becomes first patient to be reinfected with coronavirus, researchers say": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A man in Hong Kong has become the first confirmed patient to be infected with the coronavirus a second time, according to researchers at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nThe finding suggests that some patients who recover from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, may have only short-lived immunity from reinfection. The case will likely also be significant for scientists who have been working on treatments using antibodies from recovered coronavirus patients, and those who have been scrambling to develop a safe and effective vaccine, though it's too soon to draw any firm conclusions.\n\nBut the research is not necessarily cause for panic. Reinfection is common with other coronaviruses. Akiko Iwasaki, a professor of immunobiology at Yale University, tweeted shortly after the study was released that the study did not show anything unexpected.\n\n\"This is no cause for alarm - this is a textbook example of how immunity should work,\" she wrote.\n\nThe 33-year-old man in Hong Kong developed mild symptoms in late March when he was first diagnosed with COVID-19, the researchers at the University of Hong Kong wrote in a study that has been accepted for publication by the medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases. The patient was hospitalized March 29, but his symptoms subsided and he was discharged April 14, according to the study.\n\nThe second infection occurred more than four months later, reportedly after the man returned to Hong Kong from Spain, via the United Kingdom. The patient tested positive on Aug. 15 and was hospitalized but remains asymptomatic, according to the study.\n\nThe researchers compared the virus' sequenced genomes after both infections and found that the second infection appears to be a slightly different virus strain from the initial one. The scientists said this confirms that the case is a true reinfection, rather than a positive result due to a lingering first infection.\n\nMicrobiologist Brendan Wren, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in the U.K., called the reinfection a \"rare example\" and said it's not unusual to find different virus strains as the pandemic evolves.\n\n\"We do expect, as with all viruses, that they do mutate over time,\" he said, but added that it's too soon to know what those mutations mean, such as whether the changes mean the coronavirus is becoming more or less virulent.\n\nStill, Wren stressed that with more than 23 million confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide, the newly identified reinfection should not derail global vaccine development efforts.\n\nEarly research on coronavirus antibodies had found that their levels waned after a few months, which could suggest that any potential immunity to the virus may not last long. But it's not yet well understood whether antibodies do, in fact, provide immunity to the virus and more research is needed.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and is the top infectious disease expert in the United States, has previously said that immunity to other known coronaviruses, including those that cause the common cold, typically lasts only three to six months.\n\n\"It may be completely different with this coronavirus,\" he said in an interview with the medical journal JAMA. \"It may be that people induce a response that's quite durable. But if it acts like common coronaviruses, it likely is not going to be a very long duration of immunity.\n\nDr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa, said it's encouraging that the patient was asymptomatic after the second infection, which could suggest that the man's immune system was at least able to protect him from becoming ill a second time.\n\n\"We could look at this and say that the person had enough immunity that he didn't have a severe infection the second time, that it was so mild he didn't have any symptoms at all,\" Perlman said.\n\nWhat's not yet known, however, is how contagious a reinfected patient could be, he added. This factor, particularly with regards to asymptomatic spread, could have important consequences for communities still dealing with high rates of transmission.\n\nPerlman said the new findings are not necessarily bad news, and it will take more than one case to truly understand what reinfections could mean for the evolution of the pandemic.\n\n\"We don't know what the future will hold,\" he said, \"but this is really a glass half full situation in my mind.\"",

    "Hospital workers in California call for new rules to protect them from coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In late June, Mailinh Nguyen worked two 12-hour shifts as a certified nursing assistant at Fountain Valley Regional Hospital in California's Orange County, looking after the same patient each night. After the second shift, Nguyen said, a supervisor told her that the patient had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nNguyen worried that she'd been exposed, because the only personal protective equipment she wore during those shifts was a surgical mask. However, she said, the hospital instructed her to continue working as usual, until she developed symptoms of COVID-19 two days later. Then the hospital placed her in quarantine but told her that she couldn't get tested for the coronavirus at the hospital -- she had to go to a community testing site, instead, she said.\n\n\"After that, I didn't get paid for over two weeks I was quarantined,\" said Nguyen, who returned to work after having tested negative.\n\nWorkers at Fountain Valley have repeatedly raised alarms in recent weeks about hospital practices they fear leave them vulnerable to the coronavirus -- including lack of testing, reuse of personal protective equipment and subpar infection controls -- by writing to the CEO, calling lawmakers and staging two demonstrations outside the hospital. In July, the National Union of Healthcare Workers, which represents employees like Nguyen, submitted a complaint to the California Department of Public Health, which the union said prompted an investigation that continues. (The department said that complaints are confidential and that it couldn't comment on any investigations.)\n\n\"It's pretty crazy that major league baseball players have access to testing every other day, but nurses, certified nursing assistants, respiratory therapists -- folks that are really in it caring for people that have COVID -- can't get tested at all,\" said registered nurse Jessica Early, a patient policy advocate for the union.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIn a statement, Fountain Valley disputed the union's account, but did not address specific employees' complaints. The hospital said it has followed state and federal guidelines to protect workers and patients and that it asks staff members to fill out a daily COVID-19-related screening questionnaires. The hospital confirmed that it sends employees to community testing locations rather than allow them to get tested at the hospital, which is not a public testing site.\n\n\"We take immense pride in the extraordinary professionalism and dedication our physicians, nurses and other staff have demonstrated every day in caring for our COVID-19 patients,\" the hospital said in a statement. \"This work has not been easy, but they have risen to the challenge.\"\n\nAt least 29,260 health care workers in California have contracted the virus, and 143 of them have died; nationally, there are 138,626 confirmed cases and 637 deaths among health care workers, according to tracking by the state and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nUp and down California, where COVID-19 cases spiked through July and into August, health care personnel in hospitals say they're facing working conditions that leave them vulnerable to the coronavirus. Health care workers and their unions have tried to improve their situation facility by facility -- one even held a five-day strike at a Santa Rosa hospital last month -- but they have made little headway. Six months into the pandemic, they say they are still forced to reuse protective equipment and are denied testing by their own hospitals. Now, many say they need government intervention.\n\nThe National Union of Healthcare Workers has asked the state government to issue new rules requiring testing of all newly admitted hospital patients for COVID-19, as well as baseline and exposure-driven testing of health care personnel. Sal Rosselli, the union's president, said it presented its plan recently to Gov. Gavin Newsom and other top state officials, who seemed receptive. (Newsom's office didn't respond to a request for comment.)\n\n\"No provider was ready for this pandemic -- it was chaos, and it continues to be very chaotic,\" Rosselli said. \"But the fact that workers that treat these patients every day or clean their rooms can't get tested even when they have symptoms, or even when they're exposed, is the demonstration that this industry is driven by profit and not by providing adequate care.\"",

        "body": "In February, five months before she became known as \"QAnon Karen,\" there was no one more terrified of the coming pandemic than Melissa Rein Lively.\n\n\"I bought the N-95 masks. I bought the hazmat suit,\" she said. \"In my mind, a zombie movie was imminent.\"\n\nAt the time, Rein Lively said her career was at its peak. Her self-owned marketing company had just helped launch the high-end restaurant Nobu in Scottsdale, Arizona. Hyatt Hotels had signed on for marketing help.\n\nBy July 5, she had gone into a Target store and trashed the mask section, streaming her rage in a viral post that drew over 10 million views. Before the police closed in on her garage, she livestreamed her own mental breakdown on her company's Instagram account, telling police to \"call Donald Trump and ask him\" why she shouldn't be arrested for her actions.\n\nShe was, she told the police, the \"QAnon spokesperson.\"\n\nRein Lively's experience is one that researchers recognize.\n\nWhile QAnon bubbled on the fringes of the internet for years, researchers and experts say it has emerged in recent months as a sort of centralized hub for conspiracy and alternative health communities. According to an internal document reported by NBC News this week, Facebook now has more than 1,000 of these QAnon groups, totaling millions of members.\n\nUsers like Rein Lively who started off in wellness communities, religious groups and new-age groups on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram during the pandemic were then introduced to extremist groups like QAnon, aided by shared beliefs about energy, healing or God -- and often by recommendation algorithms.\n\nAnd while anti-mask sentiment has surfaced in a variety of ways for a number of reasons, viral videos of anti-mask confrontations have become causes for celebration in conspiracy circles, embraced as examples of people taking the fight against their shadowy enemy into the real world.\n\nRein Lively followed a similar path as a growing community of conspiracy theorists, radicalization experts told NBC News.\n\nCooped up inside her home and losing work due to the pandemic in the weeks before her outburst, Rein Lively filled the time she would've spent hanging out with friends and emailing clients by diving down conspiracy-fueled rabbit holes on Facebook and Instagram, worsening her feelings of isolation and fear.\n\nSome find themselves believing in elaborate conspiracy theories about Bill Gates, 5G wireless technology, vaccines and masks, which researchers say are in part pushed by an algorithm and shared community members that group all of the theories together.\n\nWithin days, they begin to believe that President Donald Trump is waging a secret war to save trafficked children from a cabal of Satan-worshipping baby eaters who control the United States government.\n\nThen, responding to the positive in-group reaction, some users take their anger and confusion out on essential workers in the real world -- and livestream it for their followers to see.\n\nRein Lively said her viral outburst was in part a product of a depressive episode, a symptom of the bipolar disorder she was diagnosed with last year.\n\n\"It's really intense for a few weeks when you're going through the mania part,\" she said. \"Then what happens is the depressive episode, in which, for all intents and purposes, I destroyed my own life.\"\n\nBut in the moment, Rein Lively believed she was doing a public good, speaking for the fellow followers of Facebook groups and Instagram pages who spoke out against masks, calling them \"muzzles\" and a form of slavery.\n\n\"There's just such a lack of human connection right now,\" Rein Lively said. \"That engagement that you're getting on social media, it's addictive.\"\n\nRein Lively wasn't particularly political on social media before COVID-19, and neither were some of the new-age groups that focused on the Earth's energy, which she read voraciously.\n\nShe said she was most active in a 20,000-member Facebook group called \"THE EVENT/THE SHIFT,\" a group focused on how the world is set for a dramatic \"shift\" because of frequencies and energies.\n\n\"I've always been the type of person where I'm very natural health oriented -- all of the, you know, hippie stuff,\" Rein Lively said. \"I am a very spiritual person who believes we are on the precipice of a new era of humanity.\"\n\nGroup members shared conspiracy theories about an accessible fifth dimension, beliefs that frequencies were changing for the better across the Earth, and offered advice on how to \"ascend.\" But over the last several months, members of the QAnon community began to seep in. President Trump, they claimed, is a \"light worker,\" working to save the world and bring about the energy shift.\n\nRein Lively started to see suggestions for other Facebook groups, including one with the name \"The Great Awakening.\" She, along with the group's 43,500 members, became entrenched in the world of QAnon.\n\nRein Lively began to internalize the conspiracy theory. She started to believe that locals she knew were in on the plot to traffic children. She accused one nearby couple, former acquaintances, of covering up crimes as part of the \"Deep State\" in her Instagram Stories. She bragged that, in the world of QAnon groups, she was about to be famous.\n\n\"Literally all I did was doomscroll all day,\" she said, using a word that has become popular during the pandemic for constantly absorbing bad news online. \"The algorithm leads you to some weird groups, and I would say I'm in some weird groups that are really just looking for something hopeful.\"\n\nThe Facebook algorithm's proclivity for leading users toward increasingly extreme groups is no surprise to researchers who have studied radicalization during the pandemic.\n\nErin McAweeney, a senior research analyst at Graphika, a New York-based social media analysis company, discovered that some alternative health, religious and anti-vaccination communities appeared to become singularly focused on COVID-19 health misinformation right as the pandemic was beginning to ramp up in the United States.\n\n\"Over the months we saw these networks fully refocus to produce and communicate solely on the impact of the pandemic and the differing government responses,\" McAweeney said.\n\nBut even more dangerously, many of the recommended groups seemed to converge around one community: QAnon. Since QAnon has become something of a catch-all conspiracy for an omnipotent power keeping society down, the details are vague enough to offer a \"bridge\" to all sorts of beliefs.\n\n\"The strongest bridge we found between QAnon and non-QAnon communities was spirituality and religion,\" McAweeney said. \"This content isn't inherently problematic, but people are often most vulnerable when seeking spiritual information online and more susceptible to alternative and extreme views.\"\n\nAt the end of Rein Lively's slide down Facebook's conspiracy rabbit hole, she eventually came to the same conclusion as many other QAnon followers: She wasn't just watching the Awakening. She was part of it.\n\n\"I hate to say the word 'Awakening,' but I thought I was 'it,'\" Rein Lively said. \"And I just completely went off the rails.\"\n\nRein Lively's example is an extreme version of what experts who study radicalization said has become a distinct pattern during the pandemic: People with time on their hands, looking for answers, are led down a radical path by niche interests and the internet's tendency to feed their darkest curiosities.\n\nThose communities have in turn been energized by the viral tantrums that now appear almost weekly, pushing conspiracy theories and talking points from fringe websites and QAnon Facebook groups onto strangers in real life.\n\nOne anti-mask tirade from a North Hollywood Trader Joe's, in which a woman called a customer a \"Democratic pig,\" received 14 million views in one Twitter post. In a video from Whitefish, Montana, from last week, a maskless woman recorded with her phone as she coughed on passersby outside of a supermarket. In a Minnesota Walmart, two customers wearing swastika bandanas told shoppers \"if you vote for Biden, you're gonna be in Nazi Germany.\"\n\nAt a now notorious Palm Beach County Commissioners meeting in Florida about mask mandates in June, Cristina Gomez drew national attention when she railed against a laundry list of conspiracy theories common on Facebook: 5G towers, Bill Gates, pedophiles. \"Citizens' arrests are already happening,\" she said, because \"we the people are waking up,\" a frequent catchphrase for QAnon followers.\n\nGomez, who did not respond to repeated requests to be interviewed, wrote on her Facebook page a month before the meeting that she had just started looking into QAnon in early May.\n\n\"I have to admit I was wrong about Donald Trump,\" she wrote. \"Donald Trump is on our side and he is secretly putting together a plan to arrest all the pedophiles.\"\n\nWhen a friend told her to look up QAnon, she said she had just finished a 10-part YouTube series about it. \"It had me in tears the whole thing,\" she wrote.\n\nShannon Foley Martinez, a reformed neo-Nazi who now works to deradicalize extremists, said there's been a substantial uptick in people approaching her during the pandemic, asking for ways to reach family members who have become consumed by extremist content on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and TikTok.\n\n\"I believe that we actually are living amidst another pandemic -- a trauma pandemic,\" Foley Martinez said. \"America right now is very unstable. It feels precarious. People are carrying huge amounts of stress, both financial and personal.\"\n\n\"People in these situations want something that has very clear rules, where there's a very clear definition of enemies; friends and foes,\" Foley Martinez added. \"There's an allure to it, a feeling of empowerment when people are feeling abjectly disempowered.\"\n\nIn a QAnon world, where those enforcing mask mandates are perceived as part of a movement that includes Satanic child sacrifices, that good-versus-evil narrative can provide a strange sort of comfort. Doing the opposite of public health advice can give conspiracy theorists a sense of control.\n\nAnd that conspiracy world can also provide community and maybe even fame.\n\nIn the days after her speech at the Palm Beach County Commissioners meeting, Gomez basked in her newfound celebrity online. While she was mocked on late night shows, she was praised in anti-vaccination and 5G conspiracy groups on Facebook. She bragged on her Facebook page that she was invited onto InfoWars, a far-right media outlet.\n\n\"I got my point across perfect. I don't need facts to back up my feelings,\" Gomez wrote on her Facebook wall after the meeting. \"I had the audience backing me up.\"\n\nFor many wannabe anti-mask influencers, the confrontation is the point. While comedians poke fun at the viral rants, anti-mask conspiracy theory communities on Facebook cheer them on, often in private groups with tens of thousands of members.\n\nRenee DiResta, the technical research manager at Stanford Internet Observatory, which studies information technologies and social media, said that staging confrontations for niche online audiences was cribbed directly from the anti-vaccination movement.\n\nDiResta said that the point of these outbursts can be for attention, money, or both, but ultimately \"they're performing for the audience at home,\" not the people at the supermarket or the town meeting.\n\n\"They're getting tons of likes, positive feedback and positive reinforcement. It helps to inspire donations, as well as to inspire other people to go and do this within their own communities,\" DiResta said.\n\nThere are, however, human beings on the other side of the tirades.\n\nLast week, a woman claiming to be part of the \"Freedom to Breathe Association\" stalked an Orange County, California, supermarket with a clipboard, telling workers they were \"putting themselves in major legal liability\" for enforcing rules about masks. A companion of the woman was recording it, the resulting clip clearly meant for an online audience.\n\nThe \"Freedom to Breathe Association\" is not a federal agency, but people claiming to be part of the group sell fraudulent medical cards on Facebook, falsely claiming it gives purchasers exemptions from mask mandates.\n\nThe employee in the video, Liz Chavez, posted a separate video of the exchange recorded by her co-worker on her TikTok account with a caption: \"This is what it's like to be an essential worker.\"\n\nChavez said she and her colleagues are regularly berated by customers who refuse to wear masks, but realized this exchange was different when she saw someone else recording it.\n\n\"So at that point, you're like: 'They wanted this. They were prepared for this because they were just there with their clipboard and their paper,'\" said Chavez.\n\nSometimes after speaking to a customer about wearing a mask, Chavez said, her co-workers sound like they're going to cry.\n\n\"They can be brutal sometimes. There are teenagers who work here who don't know what to say,\" said Chavez. \"After they leave, they just get upset. They're like, 'Oh my God, I can't do this anymore.'\"\n\nRein Lively said she was \"craving connection\" in the weeks before the Target video, that she \"couldn't just go and sit with a table of people and have a glass of wine like I'm used to.\"\n\nHer audience on Instagram was providing a stand-in for that personal attention.\n\n\"My audience should've been a lot bigger before I flew into it,\" she joked. \"I thought I was like some guru. It was insane, it was insane, it was insane.\"\n\nRein Lively is off social media \"for a long time,\" she said, because her husband convinced her she couldn't handle it. Her clients are gone. She's not sure where she can work now.\n\n\"I don't think people understand what the reality is. Overnight, my life was over,\" she said.\n\nBut Rein Lively is getting better treatment for her bipolar disorder now, she said. She's learning to become a better advocate for herself, and receiving better medicine to deal with it. She's writing a book about the whole experience.\n\n\"The words are flowing like you would not believe, which is great, but I also feel like I'm not going to go trash Target. I've got the impulsivity under control,\" Rein Lively said.",

    "How the University of Arizona used No. 2 to solve its No. 1 problem": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The University of Arizona made a bold claim this week: It stopped a coronavirus outbreak before it started.\n\nUniversities around the U.S. have struggled with outbreaks as they attempt to start the fall semester. But at the Likins Hall dorm, just across the street from the University of Arizona's recreation center, two students were found to have contracted the coronavirus -- and they were asymptomatic.\n\nThe university said it pulled this off by combining more common forms of coronavirus mitigation, swab testing and contact tracing, with a more exotic one: analyzing sewage.\n\nThe university had implemented a campus-wide initiative to conduct what's known as wastewater-based epidemiology. This effort, which involves analyzing sewage samples for traces of the coronavirus, gave the university a way to quickly and repeatedly look for traces of the virus in discrete groups of people -- in this case, dorms -- as part of an early warning system to catch cases of COVID-19.\n\n\"From one test, we get the prevalence of the virus within the whole community,\" said Ian Pepper, an environmental microbiologist who is leading the wastewater testing effort on campus.\n\nThe idea is catching on. Researchers in the United Kingdom launched a program in July to conduct cross-country wastewater surveillance. In Israel, scientists who collected sewage samples nationwide in March and April heralded the effort as an effective, noninvasive way of tracking outbreaks across geographic regions.\n\nAt the University of Arizona, Pepper said this type of testing is especially useful for finding and isolating infected individuals before they have a chance to spread the virus widely. The two cases that have been identified at the university were both asymptomatic, and Pepper said wastewater testing could be sensitive enough to detect the coronavirus up to a week before a person develops symptoms.\n\n\"So, you have seven precious days in which you can undergo intervention,\" he said.\n\nPepper's team is conducting regular tests of sewage from 20 buildings across campus, including dorms and the university's student union center.\n\nIf a sample comes back positive for the coronavirus, the school's protocol is to then test everyone who lives or works in the building using traditional nasal swabs or antigen tests that are designed to detect viral proteins. Infected individuals are then quarantined, according to Dr. Robert C. Robbins, president of the University of Arizona.\n\nWastewater testing is designed to catch fragments of the virus that are shed from the body in fecal matter. Pepper's team has been collecting sewage samples from buildings twice a week around 8:30 a.m. -- a time that Pepper said is, \"after people got up and typically go to the bathroom.\"\n\nIf there are positive results, the sampling can be done more frequently, he said, but the researchers also found that bits of the virus tend to linger in wastewater rather than being dispersed immediately.\n\nRobbins said wastewater-based epidemiology is a crucial part of the school's \"test, trace and treat\" protocol and is a valuable tool that allows for more precise testing.\n\n\"What we're trying to find are those asymptomatic individuals who can be unknowing vectors infecting people,\" Robbins said.\n\nBut this type of sampling can also be done at the neighborhood and community level, according to Pepper. In addition to studying sewage on campus, scientists at the University of Arizona have been analyzing samples from wastewater treatment plants across the country, including New York and Los Angeles.\n\nIn addition to finding potential hot spots, wastewater testing can help public health officials measure the severity of viral transmission in communities. In Arizona's Pima County, for example, wastewater samples taken six weeks ago, when the state was dealing with a significant spike in cases, were found to have \"sky-high\" concentrations of the virus, according to Pepper. In the last two weeks, those concentrations, along with the number of new cases, \"have dropped dramatically,\" he said.\n\nPepper said he and his colleagues are hoping to publish the results of their research in a peer-reviewed journal, but for now, they are just pleased that this testing method is proving to be effective.\n\n\"They're all jazzed. Everyone is really hyped up,\" he said. \"It's a great case study.\"",

    "In tiny llama antibodies, researchers see hope for a coronavirus treatment": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As the world waits for a vaccine to help bring about the end of the coronavirus pandemic, scientists in Northern California have been at work on a different approach -- one that takes cues from llamas and their unique antibodies.\n\nLlamas, like all mammals, have antibodies that protect them from viruses. But llama antibodies are different -- they're tiny. Their diminutive stature gives them the unique ability to bind to proteins on the outside of the coronavirus that are crucial to its spread.\n\nNow, scientists say they hope to harness the power of these llama antibodies to stop the coronavirus from infecting humans. At the University of California, San Francisco, researchers created a lab-made molecule inspired by llama antibodies that they say is surprisingly effective at neutralizing the coronavirus.\n\n\"It binds to the virus' spike protein with an unmatched affinity -- we've never seen anything like this in my lab before,\" said Peter Walter, a molecular biologist and biochemist who is part of a team working to develop a potential coronavirus treatment using the llama-inspired compound. \"It was absolutely beautiful to see.\"\n\nBut don't put the cart before the llama. Walter and his team of researchers have a long way to go before any treatments are ready for use. But his work highlights how the scientific community is drawing on a wide range of recent discoveries in an attempt to create ways to fight the coronavirus -- most of which have never been used before.\n\nIn London, scientists are experimenting with small pieces of RNA to jump-start the immune system. Researchers in Syracuse, New York, are evaluating the safety of treating patients with antibodies from genetically engineered cows. Another group is looking at Alpaca antibodies. And others are investigating whether patients who were asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms have something in common that could play a crucial role in the development of treatments or a vaccine.\n\nWalter and his team are building on discoveries that are just a few years old. Xavier Saelens, a virologist at Ghent University in Belgium, who is not involved with the UCSF project, has been studying llama antibodies since 2016 to develop potential treatments for other known coronaviruses, such as SARS and MERS.\n\nIn lab tests, Saelens found that the llama antibodies that could protect against severe acute respiratory syndrome were also able to block the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Those findings were published in May in the journal Cell.\n\nSaelens said he hopes these antibodies have prophylactic applications but more research will be required and there are no definite plans yet to proceed with human clinical trials.\n\nThe UCSF project, dubbed AeroNabs, goes a step further by taking inspiration from llama antibodies to produce lab-made versions that function similarly to fight infections. The hope is that the synthetic molecules could be administered as a nasal spray or with an inhaler as an early intervention to keep newly diagnosed patients from getting seriously ill, or as a preventive measure to stave off infections altogether.\n\n\"We have this period where an inhalable drug that can catch the virus before it ever enters the cells could provide a bridge or a stopgap measure to help until an effective vaccine can provide a long-term solution,\" Walter said.\n\nThe engineered molecule works by binding tightly to viral proteins from the spikes that coat the outside surface of the coronavirus. Since viral proteins can only bind to certain other proteins in the human body -- similar to a lock and key -- the synthetic compound essentially runs interference and prevents the virus from infecting cells.\n\nThe researchers designed the molecule to mimic how llama antibodies function.\n\n\"The idea is we want to take the tiny architecture of antibodies found in llamas and try to recapitulate what's normally found in these animals but synthetically,\" said Dr. Aashish Manglik, a structural biologist at UCSF, who co-led the research with Walter.\n\nThe molecules are stable enough to be made into a dry powder and aerosolized, which means the antibodies could be administered at home through a nasal spray or with a nebulizer similar to what's used to treat asthma patients. Additional research is needed to test how long the protection lasts, but Manglik estimated that the nebulizer approach would likely need to be used daily.\n\nHe said the treatment could be most effective as an early intervention, given to patients shortly after they are diagnosed with COVID-19. This type of early approach could prevent some patients from developing severe symptoms or needing hospitalization.\n\nPreliminary results of the UCSF research were posted last week to the preprint server bioRxiv, but the findings have not yet been peer-reviewed.\n\nSheena Cruickshank, an immunologist at the University of Manchester in England who was not involved with the research, called the results \"interesting,\" but added that the project is a long way from being ready for clinical trials.\n\n\"More investigations are needed to validate it and confirm it will work in the body and to see how durable it will be,\" she said.\n\nCruickshank said the llama-inspired antibodies show promise as a tool to fight infections but raised concerns about whether the synthetic molecule would itself be seen as a foreign intruder, thereby triggering the body's immune system against it.\n\nWalter said he and his colleagues tried to prevent this from happening by \"humanizing\" the molecule, a process that effectively kept the scaffold of the molecule intact but then \"made it look like a protein that naturally occurs in humans.\"\n\nThe researchers recognized the need for more research and added that they hope future tests will be able to investigate the molecule's effectiveness in humans and its safety.\n\n\"We think the probability of any safety concerns is low, but it's critical to do safety studies because you can't anticipate everything,\" Manglik said.\n\nWalter said he is also acutely aware of the need to temper expectations, particularly in a highly politicized climate where misinformation about the coronavirus and potential treatments can proliferate wildly.\n\n\"I feel pressure to move effectively forward and fast because we have over 5,000 people dying every day, so any day lost is measurable in death,\" he said. \"But on the other hand, we don't want to overpromise.\"\n\nStill, he hopes his research, and others like it, will give people hope that scientists are working hard to find a solution.\n\n\"I hope it shows that we're doing our best to try to help humanity and society come back to some state of normalcy,\" Walter said. \"But does it make me nervous? Of course.\"",

    "Latino health threatened by coronavirus misinformation and distrust": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- When Claudia Guzman suspected she had caught the coronavirus, her friends and family were full of advice: Don't quarantine. Don't get tested. A homemade tea will help cure you.\n\n\"They were saying, 'Don't go to the hospital,' because supposedly, if you are admitted into the hospital, they administer the virus into your body,\" said Guzman, who was born in Chicago to parents from Mexico and now lives in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nFalse claims and conspiracy theories, ranging from bogus cures to the idea that the virus is a hoax, have dogged efforts to control the pandemic from the beginning. While bad information about the virus is a problem for everyone, it can pose a particular threat to communities of people of color who already face worse outcomes from the virus.\n\nAmong Latinos in the U.S., misinformation around the coronavirus has found fertile ground because many in their communities have higher levels of distrust in government, less access to medical care and may need to be reached by Spanish-language public health resources. It's a dangerous mix that could discourage people from taking precautions, participating in contact-tracing efforts, or getting treatment.\n\n\"There isn't much evidence-based information in Spanish for them. And this is a new disease, so the science is evolving every day,\" said William Calo, a Pennsylvania State University researcher who studies Hispanics and public health. \"We are struggling with providing good information in English -- just imagine adding a second language.\"\n\nWith a population of 60 million, Hispanic people in the U.S. are now four times more likely than non-Hispanic white people to be hospitalized because of COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other studies also show Latinos in some areas are also twice as likely to die from the illness. (Native Americans and Black people face similarly stark disparities.)\n\nThese vulnerabilities have many causes. Among them are the fact that many Latinos are less likely to have health insurance or access to quality health care -- sometimes because they can't afford it and sometimes because of their immigration status. Many work in industries that are deemed essential and cannot be performed remotely, such as food service, sanitation, meat packing, construction and retail. And many live in larger, multigenerational households where social distancing is difficult.\n\nAdded to this already dangerous mix is a higher level of distrust in authority among Latinos -- as is the case for other minority communities -- that is helping fuel the spread of misinformation about the virus.\n\n\"If I'm hearing something from the government, from people who I, for a variety of reasons, don't trust, then I'm not going to do anything,\" said Monica Feli\u00fa-M\u00f3jer a Puerto Rican native and Harvard-trained neurobiologist who works to encourage Latinos to pursue science careers. \"But if I hear this from my friend who I believe in, and who I trust, then it's more likely that I'm going to act on that information.\"\n\nFor many, the reluctance to get tested or seek treatment stems from fear of deportation in a community with a significant percentage of immigrants. That may be particularly true under President Donald Trump, said New York State Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat who represents a largely Hispanic district in the Bronx. Trump ran on promises to crack down on both illegal and legal immigration and has repeatedly painted immigrants -- especially nonwhites -- as posing a public health and safety danger.\n\nThat distrust could discourage people from getting treatment or from cooperating with government contact tracers trying to identify who an infected person had come into contact with.\n\n\"It's a real concern,\" Rivera said of the worries some Latinos have about contact tracing. \"We need to secure that information, and there needs to be a guarantee of its privacy.\"\n\nLanguage barriers make the situation even worse. Many areas face a shortage of Spanish-speaking health care workers, and most of the accurate online information about the virus in the U.S. is in English. That forces some Latinos who need information in Spanish to rely on less-trusted sources like social media. And while a growing number of fact-checking organizations are trying to identify and correct false claims spreading online, very few publish their work in Spanish. The Associated Press publishes some of its fact checks in Spanish.\n\nAll of this means Latinos may not receive good information about how to slow the spread of the virus -- and may not act on it if they do. Guzman, for instance, thinks she contracted the virus at a vigil last month for her grandfather, who died of cancer soon after. Many of the people there either weren't wearing facial masks or didn't have them on correctly. About 10 family members subsequently were diagnosed with the coronavirus.\n\nGuzman, who is a medical assistant, knew to push back when friends and relatives passed along false claims and theories. For example, her parents suggested she wouldn't have to quarantine if she drank a homemade tea of lemon, honey and ginger.\n\n\"I had to tell them, 'No, that's not true. In order to stop spreading it, you have to stay home,'\" said the 27-year-old, who had mild symptoms that lasted a few days. She spent time in quarantine before returning to work.\n\nHer boss, Venezuela-born Dr. Pedro Velasquez-Mieyer, is the chief medical officer of two clinics in Memphis that serve mainly Latino and Black patients. He said he's heard from patients who won't wear masks, or who liken COVID-19 to the chicken pox and say they want to get infected so they'll develop immunity.\n\n\"They are part of their own network of misinformation, and nobody is actually saying, 'This is false, this is not reliable,'\" he said. \"They keep sending the message.\"\n\nFeli\u00fa-M\u00f3jer says it's just as important to control rumors as it is to control the virus.\n\n\"Just like people can stay home and wear masks and wash their hands and keep their physical distance to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, people can also take simple steps to prevent the spread of misinformation,\" she said.",

    "Many COVID-19 patients lose their sense of smell. A new study may point to why.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A study published Tuesday sheds light on one of the more curious symptoms of COVID-19: the loss of smell.\n\nThe coronavirus infects cells by binding to a receptor found on their outer surface, called ACE2. Cells in the nose that help us detect smells are particularly rich in this receptor, according to the research released in the European Respiratory Journal -- and that could make them a clear target for the virus.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIn the study, Johns Hopkins University researchers examined tissue samples from the noses of 23 patients. The samples had been obtained during medical procedures for conditions unrelated to COVID-19, such as tumors or chronic rhinosinusitis, an inflammatory disease of the nose. None of the patients in the study had been diagnosed with the coronavirus. The researchers also took samples from the trachea, or windpipe.\n\nThe samples were then taken to a lab where fluorescent dyes were used to show where the ACE2 receptors were located.\n\nThe researchers found the highest concentration of ACE2 receptors in the cells lining the olfactory epithelium, the area of the nose that detects smells. In this region, levels of ACE2 receptors were between 200 and 700 times higher than levels seen in other parts of the nose and trachea.\n\nFurther research is needed to see if the coronavirus is, in fact, binding to the receptors in this part of the nose.\n\nIf confirmed, it could explain why COVID-19 patients lose their sense of smell, Dr. Andrew Lane, a professor of otolaryngology at Johns Hopkins and the lead author of the study, said.\n\nLoss of smell, or anosmia, is not a strange symptom in and of itself. Patients with colds or the flu may complain of the loss of smell, for example, Lane said. But in those cases, the symptom is usually caused by a stuffy nose.\n\n\"I think what's unusual about COVID is that you don't really see a lot of nasal symptoms like congestion and runny nose, which we usually associate with the loss of sense of smell,\" he said.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nWith a cold or the flu, Lane said, the nose gets stuffy, there is less airflow, and then the sense of smell is lost. That doesn't typically happen with COVID-19.\n\nHe said he's seen a handful of patients in his practice who have complained about a loss of smell from COVID-19. Fortunately, most of his patients regain their sense of smell within weeks after recovering, he said.\n\nDr. David Gudis, an ear, nose and throat doctor at the Columbia University Irving Medical Center, said he's also seen plenty of patients with smell loss associated with COVID-19. His patients complain of a spectrum of symptoms, from partial or total loss of smell, to even smelling foul odors that aren't there, a phenomenon known as phantosmia.\n\nGudis, who was not involved with the research, praised the new work as \"outstanding,\" adding that it could potentially lead to treatments to limit how the virus enters cells and how it's spread to others.\n\nA treatment that coats the lining of the nose could block the receptors, and therefore block the virus from entering cells, Lane said, adding that much more research is needed to support that concept.",

    "Multiple sclerosis drug to be studied for COVID-19 treatment": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Large, ongoing studies of remdesivir are set to enter a new phase of research, in which doctors will test the impact of combining the drug with a medication already approved to treat multiple sclerosis, the National Institutes of Health announced Wednesday.\n\nThe multiple sclerosis drug, called interferon beta-1a, is sold under the brand name Rebif. It's been approved for use in the U.S. since 1996.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThis latest phase of study builds on previous research that found the antiviral remdesivir can reduce the number of days COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, from 15 to 11, on average.\n\nJust one other drug, a steroid called dexamethasone, has also been shown in clinical trials to benefit COVID-19 patients in a significant way. A British study found the steroid can reduce deaths by about a third in the sickest patients with the coronavirus.\n\nDespite the promise of both remdesivir and dexamethasone, it's clear they will not be enough to control the pandemic that's now sickened more than 4.8 million people in the U.S., killing nearly 160,000.\n\nWhat's more, remdesivir is given intravenously, which means patients usually must be in a medical facility to receive it. And it's costly. Gilead, remdesivir's manufacturer, announced in June that it will charge more than $2,000 per person for a typical treatment course of the drug. (Dexamethasone, while much cheaper, is only helpful in very sick patients, and could in fact be harmful when given in mild COVID-19 cases.)\n\nA large clinical trial, sponsored by the National Institutes of Health, will now study the effects of combining remdesivir with interferon beta-1a.\n\nAn earlier study, posted to the preprint server medRxiv, suggested the interferon drug might help patients clear the virus more quickly.\n\nInterferon is a molecule that's found naturally in the body, and it helps to fight a variety of viruses. COVID-19 patients tend to have a deficiency of the molecule, especially in their blood and lungs, Dr. Andre Kalil, a principal investigator for the trial at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, said.\n\n\"If we replace the interferon in conjunction with an antiviral [remdesivir], maybe we can prevent the progression of the disease,\" Kalil said. \"That's the hypothesis.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nAbout 1,000 patients hospitalized with COVID-19 worldwide will be included in the trial. Half will receive remdesivir plus shots of interferon beta-1a, four times every other day. The other half will get remdesivir plus placebo shots.\n\nInterferon is known to come with side effects, such as flu-like symptoms, joint pain and fever, Kalil said, adding that most of those symptoms come after prolonged use of the drug.\n\nKalil's team is also wrapping up studies of remdesivir plus an anotther drug, an anti-inflammatory called baricitinib, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nBaricitinib, manufactured by Eli Lilly and marketed as Olumiant, is what's known as a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It blocks an enzyme that helps produce chemicals that lead to inflammation.\n\n\"It's a race to collect all the data, and make sure everything is correct,\" Kalil said. Those results aren't expected for about another month.\n\nBut, if the research finds that baricitinib offers a significant benefit for the sickest COVID-19 patients, the drug may be added to the trial with remdesivir and interferon beta-1a.\n\nThe plan is to continue zeroing in on a variety of treatments to find the best combination of medicines that would have the biggest impact on COVID-19.\n\nResults on interferon beta-1a are expected sometime this fall.",

    "Obesity, race play roles in severe COVID-19 illness among kids": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Black and Hispanic children are disproportionately affected by COVID-19, according to two Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports published Friday.\n\nThe CDC reports come just days after President Donald Trump told Fox News that children are \"almost immune\" to the coronavirus, an assertion proven to be untrue.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nAs of July 31, more than 338,000 children in the United States have been diagnosed with COVID-19, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. That represents about 8 percent of the nearly 5 million cases reported so far in the U.S.\n\nAnd pediatric cases appear to be rising. One of the CDC reports released Friday found that between March 21 and July 25, \"weekly hospitalization rates steadily increased among children.\" Overall, Black and Hispanic children were most likely to require hospitalization.\n\nAbout a third of those children were sick enough to be admitted into a hospital's intensive care unit. That's equal to the proportion of adults with COVID-19 who have required critical care, even though children in general are less likely to be as severely impacted by the virus as adults.\n\nForty-two percent of the 208 children in the CDC analysis had at least one underlying condition, usually obesity.\n\n\"Childhood obesity affects almost 1 in 5 U.S. children,\" the CDC authors wrote, \"and is more prevalent in Black and Hispanic children.\"\n\nIt's unclear how obesity might affect the severity of COVID-19 outcomes, but the link has also been noted among adults with the virus.\n\n\"There's something about obesity that causes an underlying inflammatory state that we don't understand that much about,\" said Dr. Josh Denson, a pulmonary medicine and critical care physician at the Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans. Denson treats severely ill adult COVID-19 patients, and has recently published research on the link between the coronavirus and obesity in the African American population.\n\nAlso Friday, the National Institutes of Health announced it's launching a project called PreVAIL kIds that aims to identify which children might be most at risk for COVID-19 complications.\n\nThe study will analyze, in part, biomarkers found in blood samples taken from children with COVID-19, so scientists can determine how the virus impacts young people, as well as which ones might be most at risk.\n\n\"This is a new virus, and it's really critical to understand what it does to children long term,\" said Dr. Bill Kapogiannis, a senior medical officer with the NIH's National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.\n\nThe main goal of the project is to learn more about one of the most severe COVID-19 complications among kids: multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C.\n\nWilliam Lantry, 10, of Pittsburgh, who was diagnosed with MIS-C in June had no idea he'd even been infected with the coronavirus.\n\nHis mother, Tacia Brentley, noticed he seemed a \"little off,\" and had a sore neck. When his temperature soared past 104 degrees Fahrenheit, she took him to the emergency room.\n\n\"It didn't really feel like I had been sick,\" William said, but added that the day his mother took him to the hospital, his neck pain stretched from his head down his shoulder, and he was vomiting.\n\nPhysicians suspected the child had meningitis, and put him on oxygen. Later tests revealed he'd had the coronavirus.\n\nWilliam has since recovered, but remains on steroids to help his breathing.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe second report published Friday by the CDC looked specifically at MIS-C.\n\nOut of 570 such cases, 364 -- nearly 64 percent -- needed to be put in intensive care. Ten young patients died, the CDC reported.\n\nSymptoms of MIS-C included fever, rash, eye infections, gastrointestinal problems and heart damage, and tended to show up nearly a month after being exposed to the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nDr. Kevin Friedman, a pediatric cardiologist at Boston Children's Hospital, said he and his colleagues have treated nearly 40 such cases.\n\nSymptoms of MIS-C are \"occurring somewhere between three and six weeks after acute COVID exposure or infection,\" he told NBC News. \"In some cases, children don't even know they had COVID and had no acute symptoms.\"\n\nThere is no specific treatment for MIS-C or less severe cases of COVID-19 in children. Friedman said doctors are treating patients with anti-inflammatories and supportive care to boost their heart and lung function.\n\nAs with severe COVID-19 cases, racial and ethnic disparities are common for MIS-C, as well. About 60 percent of children with MIS-C in Massachusetts, Friedman estimated, have been Black or Hispanic.\n\nIndeed, the CDC report found that overall across the country, MIS-C tended to be more prevalent -- 73.6 percent -- in racial minorities.\n\nBrentley wants parents to remain alert for unusual symptoms in children. \"The very second you see something that isn't normal, just go. Go straight to the hospital.\"",

        "body": "Fall semester classes at Oklahoma State University began Monday with the entire Pi Beta Phi sorority under quarantine after 23 members tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nOnly one Pi Beta Phi member was showing symptoms and none of her sorority sisters were being allowed to leave the off-campus house, officials said.\n\n\"At this point, no members have been hospitalized and any who are ill are experiencing minor effects of the virus,\" Pi Beta Phi strategic initiatives director Shawn Eagleburger said in a statement.\n\nThe sorority sisters who moved into the Pi Beta Phi house between Aug. 2 and Aug. 6 all tested negative for COVID-19, Eagleburger said.\n\nBut as Pi Beta Phi embarked on a virtual recruitment drive to attract new pledges, some of the sorority sisters let their guard down.\n\n\"Eager to reconnect with friends, on August 11, a small group of members who reside outside of the facility joined the chapter for a short, informal gathering at the facility,\" Eagleburger wrote. \"On August 12, the Chapter President was informed one of these members was experiencing symptoms of COVID-19; the member later confirmed she had tested positive. On August 14, members who since began experiencing symptoms were tested; many tested positive.\"\n\nUniversity spokeswoman Monica Roberts said the campus was bracing for this possibility of mass infections.\n\n\"This was expected,\" Roberts told The Daily Oklahoman on Saturday. \"When you bring back 20,000 students, there will invariably be more cases related to campus. We've prepared for this for five months and have protocols in place to manage the situation. Our priority is the safety and well-being of our campus community and transparency in communications.\"\n\nThe lockdown at Pi Beta Phi came as Oklahoma has seen a surge in new COVID-19 infections, averaging close to 800 new cases per day in the last four weeks, according to an NBC News analysis of available figures.\n\nAmong those infected last month was Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, a Republican and ally of President Donald Trump who was criticized for his cavalier approach in the early days of the unfolding crisis. So far, Oklahoma has reported 48,342 cases and 661 COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic.\n\nNationally, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases was nearing 5.5 million and the death toll as of Monday morning was over 171,000, according to the NBC News numbers. The U.S., which leads the world in both categories, has accounted for roughly a quarter of the 22.5 million cases and 776,000 deaths across the globe.\n\nMost of the new cases and deaths in the U.S. have been in Southern and Sun Belt states that reopened at the urging of the Trump Administration as the numbers of new COVID-19 cases were starting to climb.\n\nThe American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living said in an updated report Monday that there has been a \"major spike in new COVID cases\" that has now surpassed the previous peak level on May 31 and that 78 percent of them are in Sun Belt states.\n\nWhile nursing home deaths from the coronavirus had been declining, they are on the rise again and 69 percent of deaths in late July occurred in Sun Belt states, the report concluded.",

        "body": "A 56-year-old man with the coronavirus attending a single church service in Ohio led to the infection's spread to at least 91 other people across five counties.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine posted a graphic to his Facebook page Wednesday detailing how the virus spread over a three-week period from the date of the church service on June 14 to July 4.\n\n\"It spread like wildfire,\" the governor said at a news conference Tuesday where the graphic was displayed. \"Very, very scary.\"\n\nDeWine noted on his Facebook page, \"All it takes is one person to cause tremendous #COVID19 spread.\"\n\nHe wrote that while this case of community transmission stems from an Ohio church, \"it can happen anywhere. I continue to encourage everyone to wear masks and social distance whenever you gather -- including at worship services.\"\n\nOn Thursday, DeWine's office disclosed in a statement that he has tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe Republican governor took a test Thursday as part of standard protocol before meeting President Donald Trump at an airport in Cleveland, the statement said. His office said DeWine was asymptomatic and that he and his wife were returning to Columbus where they would both be tested. DeWine \"plans to follow protocol and quarantine at his home in Cedarville for 14 days,\" the statement said.\n\nIn the case of the virus spreading from a church service in June, all 91 others infected showed symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, the governor said. Fifty-three of them had been at the same church service in Ohio County as the 56-year-old carrier, according to the graphic shared by DeWine.\n\nEighteen of the 53 infected at the service spread the virus to at least one other person, the graphic shows. The man's wife, a son and a daughter also got sick.\n\nDeWine in a series of tweets on Tuesday also provided other examples of the virus' spread within family and friend groups.\n\nIn one case, a son living with his father who was in hospice care developed a cough and believed he had bronchitis. Family members came to visit to pay respects to his father. Five family members later tested positive for the virus, including a great-nephew, the governor said.\n\nSeparately, a man who had COVID-19 symptoms attended his brother's wedding and reception. Now, 15 people are sick, including the bride, groom and one of their grandfathers.\n\nAnd in another outbreak, a person who tested positive for the virus attended a bridal shower, leading to others becoming infected. \"There are now six confirmed cases and six households impacted by this outbreak,\" DeWine said.\n\n\"None of us want to stay away from our families and of course, it's natural to want to show affection when you see them,\" he tweeted Tuesday. But this virus is \"lurking,\" he wrote. \"Please try to remember that you are showing love by protecting them.\"\n\nRachel Feeley, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Department of Health, declined on Thursday to release the name of the church where the virus spread or any details on the other cases. \"We are not releasing additional information about these examples to the general public, in order to protect private health information,\" she said.\n\nFeeley said that anyone who may have come into contact with people who had tested positive in these examples were notified through normal contact-tracing protocol.",

    "Opinion | Back to school? Not so fast. A COVID-19 checklist for parents and teachers": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As states around the United States weighed whether schools should reopen, children began testing positive for the coronavirus in alarming numbers. Across the country, there was a 40 percent increase in pediatric cases, according to a study looking at the last two weeks in July. Florida, a COVID-19 epicenter, reported a 137 percent rise in school-age children in July, including a 105 percent uptick in hospitalizations. On Monday, Florida teachers won a legal battle against Gov. Ron DeSantis, who wants to reopen schools by the end of this month. Under the ruling, school districts will not be forced to re-open en masse, even if they think the situation is unsafe.\n\nIt's a small reprieve for Florida teachers. And yet, President Donald Trump, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are still aggressively pushing for reopening schools with in-person instruction nationwide. In rationalizing this return to classrooms, Trump has falsely claimed that children are \"almost immune\" and DeVos has incorrectly called students \"stoppers\" of the virus.\n\nWith insufficient guidance for educators, the CDC supported this push to return to in-person classes, posting essays on the \"Importance of Reopening Schools\" in the fall and guidelines like this one. Redfield even made the push in testimony before Congress.\n\nEven without a pandemic, public schools are a vital piece of the public health puzzle. Schools teach much more than reading, writing, history, math and science. Children learn to socialize and play sports, nurturing their emotional and physical well being. Many millions of students eat breakfast in addition to lunch there.\n\nEducators, like my mother, groom the next generation of workers. During the pandemic, many parents have gained a new appreciation of teachers as partners in raising children and allowing them to work. But balancing work and family when everyone is stuck at home is a massive challenge -- and remote learning has become an additional stressor.\n\nIn other words, the stakes for reopening schools in the fall have never been higher. When can students go back to school safely? If so, how?\n\nAnswers to when and how begin with where you live. Is the transmission rate low in your county? Can you easily access rapid coronavirus tests and results? Does your health department have a robust system to identify individuals infected with COVID-19 and track down their contacts for testing and quarantine, known as track and trace?\n\nCheck your county at covidactnow.org. This website monitors community transmission using five indicators or numbers: new cases, infection rate, degree of testing, hospital capacity and contacts traced. The website also created a warning system building on an early monitoring system developed by the White House coronavirus task force. Government officials categorized areas from low to high rates of infection, known as green, yellow or red zone. Media outlets have also worked hard to create a variety of great tools. The New York Times, for example, breaks down hot spots by country.\n\nThis information is valuable, although some sites are volunteer run and not always 100 percent accurate -- be sure to check how often and recently sites are updated. But this is part of the problem -- there is no easily accessible, federal website that could provide up-to-date information for school districts and parents. Just as bad, the federal government is not tracking outbreaks at K-12 schools -- some states are simply not acknowledging them at all.\n\nIf infection rates are high in your area, schools should not reopen. If they drop, teachers and parents should still remain vigilant for signs of the virus. The CDC's school reopening checklist is sadly incomplete. While it rightly includes information about social distancing and decontamination, it doesn't address issues like how to stop the spread of air droplets. The checklist below is meant as an additional -- although not comprehensive -- guide for teachers, parents and administrators.\n\nMasks. Teachers, staff and school employees should be fitted for KN95 or N95 masks. These masks block 95 percent of particulate matter when properly fitted. Students must always wear masks, except when they are eating or drinking. But teachers and parents need to emphasize the importance of keeping the mask on and not fidgeting with it. Taking off and putting on a mask throughout the school day may contaminate the mask and child.\n\nAir flow. Like in hospitals, schools should install and use HEPA filters. Ideally, schools should keep windows and door open, letting fresh air reduce the concentration of indoor contaminants, such as virus particles. High-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters work in a similar way, but won't create problems for children with allergies or asthma. Removing viruses from the air reduces the potential for exposure.\n\nPods. Students should be divided into groups or pods of 10 to 15 students. The pod learns, eats and exercises together the entire school day. This way each student can stay 6 feet from their peers while seated at their desk. A pod also helps identify and contain a potential outbreak.\n\nDrinking fountains. Schools must replace water fountains with bottled water. Using a water fountain brings hands, mouths and noses close to a high traffic surface. A student infected with COVID-19 may shed the virus on the on/off knob, water source and other parts of the fountain. Closing a fountain eliminates a potential source of contamination.\n\nOutdoor education. Students should eat and exercise outdoors as much as possible. Intense activities require more inhales and exhales. This can increase the number of virus droplets in the air, leading to greater exposure to COVID-19. Conducting both activities outside allows fresh air to reduce the concentration of viruses.\n\nMovement. Hallways are one-way corridors, moving students in one direction. One-way hallways reduce the chances of face-to-face contact, which increases the likelihood of transmission.\n\nCleaning. Classrooms and buses are cleaned twice a day. Depending upon the surface, COVID-19 can live on surfaces for hours to days. Cleaning is necessary to destroy the virus in common space surfaces, such as bathrooms, lockers and buses.\n\nTesting. Schools must be vigilant. Surveillance systems should be set up to periodically test sewage, heating air conditioning and ventilation systems and compressors to help in the early detection of an outbreak.\n\nExtracurriculars. School should stop chorus, band, wrestling, football and other contact sports. Social distancing is impossible with these group activities. Singing and playing wind instruments aerosolize the virus. A two-hour choir practice with one symptomatic singer in Washington state resulted in 87 percent of the group becoming infected.\n\nIn sum, these protective measures require more space, equipment, teachers, cleaning staff and additional funding. Not every school will be able to do this.\n\nAnd the stakes are high than some politicians would like you to believe. Although initially it was believed children could not spread coronavirus to adults, we now know this isn't true. In a large study of pediatric COVID-19 cases in 82 health care institutions across 25 European countries, 3 out of 4 patients were healthy children without known pre-existing conditions before becoming infected.\n\nPediatric patients in the study experienced symptoms which resembled the flu or a cold. More than 6 in 10 children had a fever and over half had an upper respiratory infection. School age children frequently suffer sniffles and aches. Are parents prepared to test their daughters and sons each time they have one of these common symptoms? Do public health officials have enough tests to separate influenza or common cold patients from COVID-19?\n\nAs the rates of infection drop in cities around the U.S., it is possible for some schools to reopen safely. But this will only be possible if intense cleaning, social distancing and testing protocols are carried out. And if an outbreak does occur or rates begin to rise again, schools may have to close again. The process will be neither cheap nor easy. Will it be worth it?",

    "Opinion | How neuroscience explains the people who don't take COVID-19 seriously": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "By Edward Wasserman, professor of psychological and brain sciences, The University of Iowa and Thomas Zentall, professor of psychology, University of Kentucky\n\nHumans have achieved many remarkable things -- we have voyaged to the moon, developed technology to communicate over vast distances, and created wonderful art, music, literature and philosophy -- all because our unique human brain allows us to delicately balance prospective gains with immediate needs.\n\nYet, those more urgent survival needs (believed to be mediated by older brain systems that we share with many other animals) mean that we still engage in impulsive behaviors. And those behaviors, which once promoted our survival and reproductive success, are now suboptimal because we live in an environment in which long-term contingencies play an increasingly important part in our lives. The conflict posed by immediate versus delayed consequences requires reconciliation by multiple brain systems -- a reconciliation that all too often discounts or devalues delayed prospects over immediate demands.\n\nScience suggests that, despite our ability to give considerable weight to future consequences, we evolved to weigh the immediate and future unequally. For instance, if we spot food, then our brains still tell us that we should respond rapidly because it may not be there if we wait. In our modern world, however, the future is more stable -- so although we may value a healthy diet for future well-being, we may nonetheless succumb to the immediate temptation of a sugary doughnut. And, although we don't need (and may not be able to afford) a new smartphone, we are attracted to the immediacy of its bells and whistles.\n\nAll of these immediate temptations, and our tendency to succumb to them, result from a phenomenon known as delay discounting: Delayed consequences are discounted compared to immediate ones. Being healthy is a remote goal, but the sweetness of the doughnut is an instant pleasure. I can have the new smartphone now, but its cost will only appear on my credit card statement next month.\n\nIn a related fashion, immediate costs are also often given greater weight than much greater delayed costs. Benjamin Franklin found it difficult to convince Colonial Philadelphians of the need for establishing a group committed to firefighting to help prevent a catastrophic, city-wide fire. His ultimately successful argument: \"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\"\n\nDelay discounting is also responsible for another human foible: procrastination. When we have something onerous to do, doing it now would be unpleasant; putting it off for the future effectively \"discounts\" the discomfort.\n\nSo, although the human brain can rationally plan for the future, the \"fierce urgency of now\" often causes us to act impulsively. When we do, however, we often regret it later.\n\nThe tendency to give undue weight to the here-and-now also helps to explain the two most irrational and infuriating aspects of the COVID-19 outbreak: our sporadic and insufficient preparations for a pandemic despite decades of stern warnings from the highest levels of government; and our counterproductive efforts to return prematurely to our \"normal lives,\" despite obvious historical evidence showing that doing so would feed the virus even more hosts, thereby extending how long we must live abnormally.\n\nFor instance, it is estimated that the funding needed to prevent the next pandemic is $22.2 billion to $30.7 billion. Although that is a lot of money, it pales in comparison to the expected $8.1 trillion in losses to the U.S. economy from the current pandemic. An ounce of prevention, in this case, would be worth about 16 pounds of cure. (The cost in human lives both during this pandemic and a future pandemic is incalculable.)\n\nOur brains also have another problem adjusting to the coronavirus because we evolved to deal with \"clear and present\" dangers; evolution did not prepare us for dealing with the all-but-invisible danger that COVID-19 represents. We can't see it; we don't immediately get sick from it; and, when people do fall ill from it, considerable time may elapse for symptoms to signal danger.\n\nFurthermore, the consequences of becoming infected with the coronavirus are not absolute or evenly spread across the population. And, although we hear that death is a real possibility, the statistics indicate that the actual probability of dying is not very high; so we dismiss that consequence as not applying to us -- a phenomenon known as \"probability discounting\" -- even though it is increasingly apparent that the infection can take a long-term toll even on those people who don't show severe symptoms.\n\nBoth the lack of immediate symptoms and the (relatively) low probability of death mean that our brains do not take the threat as seriously as we should.\n\nBeyond that, when it comes to issues of national importance -- such as pandemics -- we expect to be able to rely on scientists and health authorities to tell us the facts, and on our government to provide the leadership and policies to help us cope with it. Without clear guidance from government, many of us will regrettably revert to being controlled by our individual desire for immediate rewards -- the pleasure of a party or social gathering, the sense of normalcy from an uncovered nose and mouth -- and ignore the potential delayed consequences -- possible infection and death of ourselves and others -- of going mask free and frequenting crowded places.\n\nYet, understanding how our brains evolved to promote impulsivity and judgment biases can also help us -- as scientists, as policymakers, as individuals -- be more effective in our efforts to combat the coronavirus and to make more rational choices. We should all focus more on the long-term effects or rewards for our behavior than on its short-term effects or pleasures.",

    "Opinion | I'm an ER doctor. Here's why some patients ignore my COVID-19 advice.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As an emergency doctor, I'm noticing a troubling trend among some of my patients when it comes to scientific recommendations around COVID-19. Despite rising deaths around the country and spikes across the South and the West, Americans are not all on the same page. Because the health community's conclusions and findings are adapting as we learn more about the virus, some Americans believe they shouldn't trust the science, on the grounds that \"it was wrong before\" or that \"the advice keeps changing.\"\n\nObviously, the U.S. response to the coronavirus hasn't been perfect. And it's important that doctors and officials acknowledge their mistakes. But it's also a teachable moment. Doctors aren't infallible, but our commitment and ability to constantly learn and update our findings are precisely why science is so valuable.\n\nScientific data doesn't come to us in a tight package. It's messy. It can even be contradictory. This is all part of the process of arriving at the best information for public health. The difference with the coronavirus outbreak, however, is that the process usually plays out over years and behind the scenes. This time, it's playing out on TV and social media, over days and weeks.\n\nAs a doctor for over two decades, I have seen the practice of medicine change in many ways. As physicians and scientists learn new information, medical workers try to do better for our patients. For instance, the evidence-based treatment of heart attacks and strokes has evolved to save increasingly more lives and reduce suffering.\n\nBut no matter how they happen, scientific discoveries, built painstakingly on foundations of data and proof, are never easy or straightforward. The evolving message on masks is particularly instructive.\n\nIn late January, Dr. Nancy Messonnier of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said: \"We do not currently recommend the use of face masks for the general American public. This virus is not spreading in your communities.\" She said this a day after the first U.S. human-to-human COVID-19 transmission was confirmed.\n\nThen, a month later, some health experts said telling people to wear masks would encourage a false sense of security and discourage social distancing. In March, the World Health Organization said only people with COVID-19 or who were caring for patients needed to wear masks.\n\nSince then, we have accumulated more data. And now, the scientific research is unequivocal: Mask-wearing reduces person-to-person transmission and helps bring down community infection rates. In a study of mandatory mask policies in 15 states and Washington, D.C., researchers found that infection rates were lower compared to states that didn't mandate masks, with as many as 450,000 people spared COVID-19 infections. In countries where wearing masks was policy or a cultural norm, deaths were lower compared to countries with neither.\n\nA New England Journal of Medicine study demonstrates how masks stop oral and aerosolized droplets dispersed when people speak normally. One study emphasizes the value of mask-wearing in reducing transmission of COVID-19 to other people, especially from people with no symptoms, who account for as many of half of all people with COVID-19. With the abundance of evidence in favor of masks, the CDC is wholeheartedly urging Americans to wear masks now.\n\nBut let's be clear: The CDC's earlier reluctance about masks was understandable. At the time, it had little data about the effectiveness of masks. Public health experts worried that front-line health workers wouldn't have enough surgical and N95 masks, which were already in short supply because the Trump administration was so unprepared for the pandemic.\n\nNow, the scientific consensus tells us that masks can save lives. Together with staying at least 6 feet apart from one another and diligent hand-washing, masks are a cheap, effective way to reduce the spread of COVID-19, especially when in indoor spaces and when social distancing isn't possible.\n\nMany of the actions needed to curb the coronavirus will cost money or require political negotiation. Yet the one thing we can all do easily, with little cost, minimal discomfort and no disruption to our daily lives, is to listen to the science and wear a mask. We now know that those pieces of fabric covering noses and mouths can reduce infections and take us one step closer to allowing workers to return to work and students to school more safely.\n\nNot long ago, a patient walked through our emergency department without a mask. Politely, I asked him to wear one. Unlike businesses that can refuse service, my oath to \"do no harm\" and the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act meant I couldn't kick him out. I sighed inwardly and suited up with full personal protective gear: N-95, face shield, gown, gloves. With potential for COVID-19 aerosol and airborne spread, I was at risk of exposure to an asymptomatic carrier. And so were my care team and others in the emergency department.\n\nScience is real, built on foundations of evidence, testability and repeatability. COVID-19 is real, and so are the over 160,000 deaths this disease has caused in the U.S. in just six months.\n\nUniversal mask-wearing is a simple step toward reclaiming the freedom Americans have lost to COVID-19. And it's backed by a vital weapon that doesn't care about politics or spin: science.",

    "Opinion | Only a vaccine ends the pandemic. Partisanship and skepticism may stymie that.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "By Chris Jackson, senior vice president and lead, Ipsos Public Polling and Sarah Feldman, data journalist, Ipsos Public Polling\n\nThe presence of a vaccine to protect against COVID-19 could make daily life closer to the pre-pandemic normal than it is for most Americans right now. But the obstacles of getting Americans to accept COVID-19 vaccinations may be even greater than those in getting one developed in record time to fight this novel, contagious and deadly virus.\n\nFor one, Americans' distrust in scientific experts and institutions was percolating long before COVID-19 was a global issue -- and the strong anti-vaccine movement is one of the starkest symptoms of that growing distrust. The refusal to take vaccines had already been spreading across the country over the past decade; that movement has not missed its moment during the pandemic. Wild, unfounded allegations that the pandemic was in fact a \"plandemic\" were spearheaded by an organized group of anti-vaxxers online, determined to sow misinformation about the novel coronavirus.\n\nMeanwhile, skepticism and political division plagued the country's initial response to the pandemic; those same issues, plus uncertainty about how successful a vaccine may actually be, promises to be an uphill battle in vaccinating against COVID-19.\n\nThere are some signs that a COVID-19 vaccine is already politicized and partisanship significantly colors people's trustin any vaccine: Fifty-two percent of Democrats would be very interested in getting a COVID-19 vaccine approved by the FDA, while only 38 percent of Republicans and 28 percent of independents hold that same level of interest.\n\nThat same survey found that 1 in 5 Republicans and the same percentage of independents are not at all interested in receiving any vaccine.\n\nDistrust outside of the confines of partisan politics among anti-vaxxers core demographic -- mothers -- is borne out in data as well. Gender brings out stark differences among parents in their enthusiasm for a COVID-19 vaccine. Half of fathers would be very interested in getting an FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine. Only a third of mothers with children under 17 feel the same way.\n\nEither poses potential problems for the efficacy of any potential vaccine's roll-out because, ultimately, how many people get vaccinated could be a crucial step in ending social distancing. New studies show that herd immunity is a function of the efficacy of a vaccine and how many people take it are intertwined; if a vaccine is less effective, then more people need to take it in order to contain the virus. Many experts, including Dr. Fauci, believe the research community will likely end up developing a vaccine with lower efficacy levels due to the nature of the coronavirus.\n\nBeyond that, preventative strategies -- mask wearing, contact tracing and vaccines -- rely on the trust between officials and the public. But Americans' response to the pandemic is clearly being stymied by their lack of faith in the information they get from public officials.\n\nFor instance, a recent Axios-Ipsos poll shows that only 11 percent of Democrats believe the information they get from the administration is accurate, while 63 percent of Republicans have a \"great deal\" or a \"fair\" amount of trust in information they receive from the White House.\n\nScientific institutions are also subject to large gaps in trust from the American public: Forty-four percent of Democrats trust the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \"a great deal\" to provide them with accurate information, while only 17 percent of Republicans feel the same way.\n\nThe World Health Organization -- a body that the president threatened to terminate the United States' relationship with in May -- sees similar trust gaps between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe president, of course, is a powerful political communicator to his base, but he is a divisive figure outside of that core group of supporters, which poses a unique problem for rallying the country around singular action.\n\nFor instance, Republican mask wearing trailed the rate of mask use among Democrats for the better part of the spring , as the issue became subsumed in the culture war. Mask use only began increasing among Republicans once the president wore a mask in public.\n\nA partisan repeat of this same pattern for a vaccine could put the country further behind in its quest to get COVID-19 under control.\n\nFinally, it is clear that who develops and champions a vaccine could be just as important as the science behind it in convincing people to inoculate themselves.\n\nCurrently, over 30 vaccines are in human trials. Russian President Vladimir Putin has already claimed vaccine victory with one he's calling Sputnik-V -- a Cold War nod to the former Soviet Union's success with satellites that supercharged the space race. The U.S. has, in the meantime, signed a $1.5 billion deal for a vaccine with Moderna, a U.S. health care company.\n\nWho is ultimately able to produce an effective vaccine at scale and distribute it to wide swaths of the public -- and how that gets read into America's culture wars -- will be a major driver in how the public chooses to trust a vaccine.\n\nAll to say, there is no silver bullet for solving a pandemic, even when a vaccine is developed.\n\nBut as we wait, half of Americans now already know someone who tested positive for COVID-19, and 1 in every 4 COVID-19 patients around the world today is American. Our skepticism of science has already proven dangerous once; we have perhaps yet to see how dangerous it will truly end up being.",

    "Opinion | Parents who want schools reopened risk putting themselves before their kids": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Keeping students physically safe does not guarantee students' psychological well-being. Bee Johnson / for NBC News\n\nSchool has never been just about the curriculum. It's also about students' health and development. As the nation debates reopening schools during the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus has been on creating physically safe environments through social distancing, mask wearing and hand washing. But keeping students physically safe does not guarantee students' psychological well-being.\n\nIn fact, though many advocates of returning to in-person schooling maintain that it should be done precisely for children's psychological health, they are failing to appreciate how the significant changes necessitated by the pandemic will render schools nearly unrecognizable. No lesser authority than the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is urging schools to reopen in order to provide \"the development of social and emotional skills\" and a \"safe environment for learning.\" But schools can't fill those needs while an epidemic is raging. It is quite possible that reopening schools could actually be worse for children.\n\nThe first thing to recognize is that students will not be returning to the traditional school settings they are familiar with, which itself can be disorienting and distressing. After spending the past six months restricted to a small group of people, entering or reentering a school with perhaps hundreds of people in masks, plexiglass partitions and one-way signage is going to feel uncomfortable at best. Adults and children alike comment on watching movies and feeling viscerally nervous at seeing people in large crowds.\n\nAdditionally, asking elementary school children not to hug their friends or teachers, not to share crayons and not to socially interact is unnatural. Asking high school students not to participate in extracurricular activities and remain socially distant from their friends is going to deprive them of important components of adolescent development as well as a key outlet for the stresses of high school. One patient in my practice said to me, \"Why would I send my kid to prison [i.e. school] to wear a mask for six hours, sit in isolation and only go to the bathroom on a schedule?\"\n\nEven explaining the need for the extreme measures to students could do damage. We've learned that after schools initiated active shooter drills to keep children physically safe, the drills had negative psychological consequences for some participants. How we explain such threats to children impacts their ability to feel safe in school, and in the larger world as well.\n\nSimilarly, the protocols necessary to protect against the spread of COVID-19 in school may be frightening unto themselves, especially to younger children. Children who don't feel safe, even if they are physically, are not going to be ready to learn. There is a truism in psychology that anxious people can't listen; anxious children certainly won't be able to pay attention to instruction. This problem is compounded by the fact that there is little agreement among adults about what is responsible behavior, and the issue has even become politicized, the ability to communicate what to do and why in a consistent and reassuring manner seems far-fetched.\n\nAnother significant challenge to children's mental health will be to manage their fear and guilt if someone they know at school gets sick or, worse, dies. They are being instructed to protect themselves from people they know and are supposed to trust. Is that a burden we really want to put on children, regardless of their age? It is inevitable that some children, and perhaps some adults, will blame themselves if someone gets sick.\n\nOutside the family, they could be shamed for testing positive for COVID-19. Thus, returning to school will pit children against each other and the adults around them. Even the child who merely manifests the symptoms of a benign illness but causes a classroom to quarantine for 14 days or close school altogether while awaiting test results is subject to a heavy psychological toll. Are we creating a modern-day \"Scarlet Letter\" for children who get sick that will cause deep emotional scars?\n\nSadly, the emotional distress for students returning to school can extend beyond the fear of making others sick. Acts of bullying and discrimination are common, particularly during middle school, and the anxiety and uncertainty of the pandemic provide fertile ground for such behavior. A patient of mine who's a middle school teacher told me that just before her school went remote in March, some of her Asian students were bullied and accused of having started the pandemic. \"There is no way I can protect all the kids in my class every minute of every day,\" she said with frustration. \"Even if there is no recess and they eat lunch in the classroom, kids find ways to tease and torment other kids.\"\n\nFurthermore, children with pre-existing mental health concerns and special education needs could have particular difficulty adapting to the changes necessitated by COVID-19. One patient in my practice is worried that her son, who exhibits Obessive-Complusive Disorder, will spend his day correcting other students -- and perhaps worse, teachers -- who are wearing their face masks wrong. She suspects his anxiety will spike and he will be ostracized by his peers. Another parent that I see has a son with ADHD. \"The only reason my son goes to school and works to pass his classes is so he can play football,\" he told me. \"Without football, I don't see him making it in school.\"\n\nBeing able to trust others is the foundation of good mental health. But returning to schools amid a pandemic creates the opposite type of environment. As a guidance counselor said to me, \"If we are telling the kids it's safe to come to school, but I won't be able to give you a high five, or worse yet, we may be closed tomorrow if someone gets sick, how are they going to trust us?\"\n\nInconsistent messaging in particular breeds anxiety and mistrust. Like children caught in a custody battle between warring parents, students are being asked to bear the brunt of conflicting messaging about what is safe. Teenagers in particular are attuned to inconsistencies from adults in their world.\n\nAnother patient of mine talked about how bitter her teenage daughter is. She sees the adults all around her being hypocritical, not going into their offices but seeing friends for cocktails without wearing their masks. She asked, \"Why am I supposed to go to school, but stay away from my friends?\" Creating school environments that meet the needs of these burgeoning young adults is critical to stem an increase in mental health issues.\n\nIt's understandable that many children want to return to school to see friends and engage in class activities. It's understandable that parents want to see their kids in a normal school setting with the higher level of instruction it brings, even in the face of uncertainty. The limitations of remote learning are well documented, and keeping children and teenagers cooped up is also potentially damaging. And of course, many parents are desperate for the child care and space schools provide.\n\nBut those benefits are sadly not available to us now, much as we wish they were. And the premature effort to regain them could well make things worse, as schools will likely need to close at a moment's notice. Given the length of time children have been out of school, the hurried way that schools closed, and the uncertainty about how safe it is to be in a school building, the erratic school schedule may increase incidence of school phobia, not decrease it.\n\nAs each school, district and state struggles with the question of how to reopen safely, we must remember that behind the protocols and plexiglass, there are children counting on us to get it right so that when they do go to school, they can feel emotionally as well as physically safe, and be ready to learn.",

    "Opinion | What do Depression-era poultry and male pattern baldness have to do with COVID-19?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The news today is filled with reporting on groundbreaking scientific studies, from those diagnosing the symptoms of COVID-19 to those tracking how it spreads to those exploring novel treatments and vaccines. It's clear that we'd have no hope of combating the pandemic and returning to a state of normalcy without the research being done right now.\n\nBut most of the time, scientific coverage is much lower on the totem pole, and usually comes in two less valued types. The first makes you think, \"That's pretty cool,\" and the second makes you ask, \"How is that remotely useful to know?\" The latter generally breaks down into two more types: hopelessly esoteric research that appears to be of no practical use, and research that searches for incredibly obvious results.\n\nFor all the articles hailing major advances yielding fantastic benefits to humanity, from airplanes to telephones to lifesaving medical procedures, there have been others that received Golden Fleece Awards, given out by the late Sen. William Proxmire to ridicule what he saw as wasteful government spending. One federal grant recipient investigated why prison inmates want to escape, while another looked at the pugnaciousness of sunfish under the influence of different types of alcohol. (The study examined gin and tequila, so if you catch a bluegill while fishing and have a beer handy, we might really learn something).\n\nBut while it's easy to scoff at such research, science works by layering discovery on discovery -- and without having foundational studies that verify obvious sounding but often faulty assumptions, the whole structure can collapse. Discoveries also work like puzzle pieces, and ones that seem insignificant on their own can fill in important information when combined with others. That's why it's important that we recognize the contributions of studies no matter how strange they may be, and don't ignore them -- or cut their funding -- once we have defeated COVID-19 and lose our focus on the importance of research.\n\nPerhaps the best way to think of research, however, is as a pyramid, with each study a different brick. At the top are practical results that we celebrate, like saving a species from extinction. But in order to get there, the bottom and the middle of the pyramid have to be filled in with lots of other bricks, many of which aren't overly useful on their own. To save a species, we need to know how many individuals currently exist, where they live, what they eat, what eats them, how they interact with people and more. These bricks of research build a structure that can hold the weight of the capstone, the desired result.\n\nOur investigation into COVID-19 illustrates this well, with its starting point a seemingly frivolous investigation of farm animals. In 1931, a year when the nation was in the depths of the Great Depression and tuberculosis alone killed over 81,000 Americans, there were scientists studying disease-stricken chickens in North Dakota. They had the first coronavirus ever identified.\n\nLike COVID-19, the first coronavirus was deadly -- but it only infected poultry. Thankfully, scientists continued to study coronaviruses, and by the 1960s, the first coronaviruses that could infect humans were identified. Though at that time they only caused the common cold, this research likely provided scientists with important baseline information about how coronaviruses spread.\n\nEven new studies on COVID-19 can at first glance seem frivolous. Early observations from hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Spain found that a high number of patients were men with male pattern baldness. This sounds like something straight from Trivial Pursuit: Respiratory Illness Edition, but it actually provides important information on who might be at greater risk from the virus.\n\nIt turns out that male pattern baldness is associated with higher levels of male hormones, and this along with several other observations suggests that male hormones like testosterone may make it easier for the virus to enter cells. In order to quickly determine whether hospitalized male patients have a higher rate of male pattern baldness than the general population, we needed to have completed studies that answered questions like, \"How many guys have male pattern baldness?\" and even, \"How do you classify hair loss?\" (Apparently the most commonly used classifications are the Hamilton-Norwood system for men and the Ludwig system for women.)\n\nIn many cases, a \"brick\" of research can be part of two pyramids of scientific exploration at once. The technology used to determine what the face of a prehistoric man found in a bog looks like is the same technology used to determine what the face of a cold-case victim looks like. And scientists often don't know what pyramid a new brick will be a part of because it didn't exist at the time it was made.\n\nBack in the 18th century, Carl Linnaeus believed that God created each type of animal as generally unchanging entities and lived a century before Charles Darwin introduced the theory of evolution. Despite this, binomial nomenclature, the method he created to categorize life, is still used today by biologists, as are many of the thousands of species he named, including Homo sapiens -- human beings.\n\nFor a more recent (and much more expensive) example, we can look to NASA. The Apollo program spent over $260 billion in 2019 dollars to beat the Soviets to the moon and get that one giant leap for mankind (and 800 pounds of moon rocks and soil). But much of the technology NASA used was then applied here on Earth. Freeze-dried foods, heat-resistant clothing for firefighters and digital flight systems for aircraft all come from the Apollo program -- and more innovations are yet to come, including car tires that won't burst. Since 1976, NASA has cataloged nearly 2,000 commercial products that are derived from technology developed from the space race.\n\nThis isn't to say that all scientific research is ultimately beneficial and worthwhile, but given how difficult it is to discern the usefulness of the outcome until years if not decades later, our best strategy is to continue to cast a wide net rather than only support research with immediately tangible results.\n\nTo counter the contempt and misunderstanding spread by the Golden Fleece prizes, the Golden Goose Awards were established to celebrate valuable achievements from odd-sounding research. Studying bacterial infections in horseshoe crabs led to a test for bacterial infection of medical devices now performed about 70 million times a year to help ensure the safety of lifesaving medical equipment. Scientists that massaged baby rats to increase enzyme levels pioneered infant massage therapy that saves the lives of premature babies and more than $4 billion a year. A lack of computing power to model black hole collisions led to the creation of the first Internet browser. And the Golden Goose Awards are already preparing to honor unusual research that helps us understand COVID-19.\n\nSo the next time you hear a sound bite about a \"useless\" study, consider a phrase attributed to Aristotle, who laid one of the first bricks of the pyramid of science thousands of years before it was completed: \"The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Alisha Bradshaw doesn't know what it's like to be pregnant without the added worry of a global health crisis.\n\nShe had her first child, a healthy baby girl, during the summer of 2016, when a single mosquito bite could mean transmission of Zika -- a virus known to cause devastating birth defects.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nFour years later, Bradshaw, 44, of Brandywine, Maryland, was pregnant with her second child. This time, it was during the COVID-19 pandemic. While a can of insect repellent gave her a measure of control to protect against Zika, the coronavirus left her feeling particularly vulnerable.\n\n\"There were so many unknowns,\" Bradshaw said. \"You just don't know who has it and who doesn't. You can take all the right precautions to keep your family safe, but you just don't know.\"\n\nUnlike Zika, there is no evidence that COVID-19 infection during pregnancy directly impacts the growing fetus.\n\nBut the stress of being pregnant during the pandemic might.\n\n\"There is a lot of literature that supports the idea that stressors during pregnancy can have a deleterious effect on fetal brain development,\" said Charles Nelson, a professor of pediatrics and neuroscience at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nNelson explained that during times of extreme distress, the body releases a cascade of hormones into the bloodstream. Those stress hormones, which include cortisol, have the ability to cross the placental barrier between mother and baby.\n\nSome areas of the fetal brain are quite receptive to stress hormones. One of those areas is the hippocampus, which plays a major role in learning and memory. A study published earlier this year in JAMA Pediatrics found marked differences in the growing fetal brains among pregnant women who were psychologically distressed.\n\n\"Among those pregnant women with high levels of stress,\" said study author Catherine Limperopoulos, \"we could see negative impacts on the fetal brain,\" including a disruption to the brain's biochemistry.\n\nThe study findings were limited to pregnant women whose babies had developed congenital heart disease in utero, which can be a major source of stress for women during pregnancy.\n\nLimperopoulos, who is also the head of the Center for the Developing Brain at Children's National Health System in Washington, D.C., has surveyed pregnant women about their stress levels regularly since 2014. Based on 163 responses from before the pandemic, 18 percent reported moderate to high levels of anxiety; 12 percent reported symptoms of depression; and 26 percent said they felt stressed.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, her team repeated the survey with 35 pregnant women. The results were striking, doubling and nearly tripling those percentages.\n\nAmong the 35 responses, 50 percent had moderate to high levels of anxiety; 35 percent felt depressed; and 71 percent were moderately to highly stressed.\n\n\"Even in the setting of a low-risk pregnancy, where the mom has no risk factors and the baby is developing well,\" Limperopoulos said, \"there really is an alarming prevalence of mental health problems reported by these women.\"\n\nKeri Toner, 33, of Washington, D.C., said the pandemic added an unprecedented level of stress. Her daughter, Lennon, was born a month ago.\n\nIt was her first pregnancy, which was \"already a stress-provoking time,\" Toner recalled. \"Then pandemic hit. You really feel like you've lost control.\"\n\nFor Bradshaw, of Maryland, the sources of COVID-19-related stress during her pregnancy were staggering. Six people in her family, including her husband, became ill with the coronavirus after attending a funeral in March.\n\nAt least three family members had to be hospitalized. Two of those loved ones died, including Bradshaw's father-in-law. Hospital rules prohibited family from being with him when he died. He did not live to meet his grandson, Immanuel, who was born in June.\n\nThe experience \"was devastating,\" Bradshaw said. It's unknown whether she, too, was infected. Her doctor declined to test her because she had no symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nThe coronavirus has disproportionately impacted racial minorities, particularly Black Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that the proportion of Blacks with severe COVID-19 is greater than whites. Pre-existing conditions such as Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity are all more prevalent in Black communities and all increase the risk for COVID-19 complications.\n\nBradshaw and Toner must pay close attention to their mental health now that they're both in the postpartum phase. Even under normal circumstances, the extreme exhaustion and physical toll of having a newborn can be particularly daunting.\n\nArmed with the previous research that showed a link between maternal stress and impaired fetal brain development, Limperopoulos and her team at Children's National are now focusing on ways to alleviate stress during pregnancy.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"Stress is a modifiable risk factor,\" she said. The group has begun a study called Project RESCUE, which aims to enroll up to 500 women.\n\nStudy participants will be randomized to different programs, such as mindfulness, yoga, breathing techniques and sleep health.\n\nThe research project will follow the women and their babies through age 3. \"Our hope is to show that reducing levels of stress and anxiety can also have a positive effect on the development of the baby,\" Limperopoulos said.\n\nBradshaw has relied in part on friends who let her vent her frustrations -- virtually, of course. (Even Bradshaw's baby shower had to be done through Zoom.)\n\nBut Bradshaw said her faith and the practice of meditation have helped the most.\n\n\"Even if it's only 10 minutes,\" Bradshaw said, stepping away to meditate \"can help you gain some sort of stability when your day feels chaotic, just being able to breathe through it.\"\n\n\"I may be stressed,\" she said, \"but I don't need to let stress overtake me.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "An indigenous tribe on India's Andaman Islands, whose population hovers just over 50 people, is now threatened by the coronavirus and experts fear uncontacted people on nearby islands could be next.\n\nAt least 10 people from the Great Andamanese tribe have tested positive for COVID-19 as of Friday and were being monitored in hospital, according to Anvita Abbi, a New Delhi-based linguist and social scientist who in contact with the community.\n\n\"It is spreading like fire,\" Abbi told NBC News by phone. \"What I gathered from them was that none of them had really serious symptoms. In fact, they all seem to be asymptomatic.\"\n\nThose who are appearing to be ill are younger -- in their late teens in some cases -- and live in the archipelago's largest city of Port Blair, she said. But concerns are rising over the possible exposure of the tribe's elders who live on remote Strait Island, which has some contact with the general population.\n\nAt least 3,160 people have tested positive for the virus across the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, according to local officials. Located southeast of Myanmar in the Bay of Bengal, they have a combined population of more than 400,000,\n\nCases are on the rise with 28 more cases confirmed on Tuesday. Forty-six people there have died during the pandemic so far.\n\nDr. Avijit Roy, who is leading the fight against the outbreak in the islands, told Reuters last week that tests given to the Great Andamanese living on one of the coral-reef islands confirmed four men were positive.\n\n\"They have been moved to hospital,\" Roy said. Officials believe the men may have traveled to the main Andaman islands and caught the disease.\n\nIndia's Ministry of Health and Tribal Affairs Ministry did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nSurvival International, a British-based charity advocating indigenous rights worldwide, also said it received reports that at least five people among the Great Andamanese were infected.\n\n\"It's a huge concern because they're so vulnerable, they've got so many already existing health problems,\" said Sophie Grig, a senior researcher for Survival International.\n\nThe tribe's population has significantly dwindled from an estimated 5,000 people when the British colonists arrived in the 1850s, said Grig. Exposure to new illnesses such as influenza, measles and syphilis that came with colonization decimated their numbers.\n\nThe community continues to struggle with cases of tuberculosis, she added.\n\n\"They've already lost so much as a community,\" she said.\n\nThe tribe along with their ancient language and culture are at risk, and losing them means losing a window into human history, Abbi said.\n\n\"They represent one of the most ancient civilizations,\" she said.\n\nThe ancestors of the Great Andamanese traveled from Africa to settle off the Indian coast some 70,000 years ago, Abbi said. Other tribes in the archipelago have similar ancient roots, and unlike the Great Andamanese, they are not integrated.\n\nThe nomadic Jarawa tribe of an estimated 400 people live relatively isolated in forests. But they risk being exposed to the virus by poachers, travelers and even welfare workers encroaching on their territory, according to Survival.\n\nDespite being among the most isolated tribes in the world, the uncontacted Sentinelese are also at risk of exposure by poachers fishing off their remote island of North Sentinel. Survival International is calling for strict protections to ensure outsiders remain away from their territory -- which linguist Abbi agreed with.\n\n\"The best thing is to leave them alone,\" she said.\n\nThere's no evidence yet to suggest any ethnic group is at greater risk of complications from the coronavirus because of a lack of immunity since the virus is new to all humans, said Dr. Jehan El-Bayoumi, founding director of the Rodham Institute at the George Washington University.\n\nBut other social and economic factors -- such as nutrition, access to healthcare and poverty -- do increase the risk of complications in indigenous and minority communities, El-Bayoumi said.\n\n\"We know that 80 percent of the outcomes related to any illness actually has nothing to do with access to health care, it is really the social determinants of health,\" she said. \"Those include water that you drink, the air that you breathe, the food that you eat, your education, your economic background, (or) systemic racism.\"\n\nSimilar concerns can be seen around the world from increasing infections among indigenous groups in Brazil to starvation due to the pandemic's disruption on food supplies for indigenous communities in Bangladesh, according to the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization.\n\nWhat's needed is better adherence to public health guidance as well as more representation from indigenous communities at all levels of government, so they can advocate for their needs, said Ralph Bunche, general secretary of the organization.\n\n\"All too often, indigenous communities are suffering from greater impacts from things like coronavirus,\" Bunche said. \"It's just showing to a greater extent these imbalances that have had already existed.\"",

    "School employee says she contracted coronavirus on job and faces firing after asking to work from home": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In late March, Jennifer Mazzotta-Perretti, a public school administrator on Long Island, New York, was in a hospital with a 103-degree fever discussing end-of-life plans with her domestic partner.\n\n\"I couldn't breathe. I was really in and out of consciousness,\" she said. \"I was sweating profusely. And just really feeling out of my body.\"\n\nMazzotta-Perretti, who donated a kidney to one of her students in 2009, so was particularly at risk from COVID-19, said she had contracted the coronavirus two weeks earlier at work. She still suffers from recurrent fevers, fatigue, migraines and other lingering symptoms, according to letters from her doctor that she provided to NBC News.\n\nShe renewed her contract over the summer with the Massapequa School District, where she had worked for two years and was overseeing 1,200 special education students. On Aug. 7, after she gave her supervisor a letter from her doctor saying she needed to work remotely until at least Sept. 7, she was told she was being recommended for termination.\n\nHer supervisor said it was because she forwarded work emails in 2018 and 2019 to a personal email account she shares with her partner. She said she did so to be able to work on cases at nights and on weekends and was unaware it was not allowed. She believes that she was retaliated against for requesting to work remotely.\n\n\"I received stellar reviews and a new contract and only after requesting accommodations did they search for a reason to terminate me for emails from two years ago,\" Mazzotta-Perretti said in a telephone interview Wednesday. \"The only thing that changed was I got sick and I needed help.\"\n\nThe school district declined to comment but denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\"As this is a matter of personnel, the district has no comment,\" Superintendent of Schools Lucille Iconis said in a statement Tuesday. \"However, the district unequivocally denies any and all allegations of discrimination, misconduct, and/or wrongdoing made against any district personnel.\"\n\nMazzotta-Perretti's lawyer, Isaac Nesser, said he's hopeful that the Massapequa Board of Education \"will do the right thing and realize it is crazy to fire her.\" If not, she plans to sue to get her job back.\n\nMazzotta-Perretti was an executive assistant for pupil personnel services. She was lauded by her supervisor as \"an ethical, compassionate, empathetic and student-centered administrator\" in her 2019-20 review.\n\n\"She is passionate and enthusiastic about helping students and supporting families,\" it said. The review noted that she's been in the education field for 23-plus years, 18 of which \"she has served as a special education administrator.\"\n\nHer supervisor did not immediately respond to phone and email requests for comment Friday.\n\nHer role requires that she be available on nights and weekends, and she said that she had difficulty accessing work emails from home on the Chromebook the district gave her. So she would sometimes forward work emails to her personal Gmail account.\n\nAfter a March 10 work meeting, Mazzotta-Perretti said she began to feel sick.\n\n\"I started reaching out on March 16 to my direct supervisor to let him know that I had fever and difficulty breathing -- symptoms that we were hearing at that time about COVID-19,\" she said.\n\nThe same day, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed an executive order directing all schools statewide to close for at least two weeks to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The governor announced May 1 that schools throughout New York would remain closed through the end of the school year. He said it was impossible to reopen schools \"in a way that would keep our children and students and educators safe.\"\n\nMazzotta-Perretti donated a kidney after a writing assignment about doing good deeds without expecting anything in return led to a discussion about a student's need for a transplant. She has one child, an 18-year-old son who has high-functioning autism.\n\nShe said the worst of her symptoms lasted through the end of April.\n\n\"My kidney doctors were concerned that if it went into the one kidney I have, it could be deadly because I do need a kidney to live,\" she said. \"It also lowers my immune system in terms of being susceptible.\"\n\n\"And that's why they think COVID-19 hit me so hard,\" she said.\n\nIn July, after she received her review and a new contract for the 2020-21 school year, Mazzotta-Perretti said the school district reopened for administrators.\n\n\"When I had to go back to work, I failed their employee health screening because it asked if you've had symptoms for any of the things associated with COVID-19,\" she said. She stated she was still exhibiting symptoms and was sent home, which she says upset her supervisor.\n\n\"He told me, 'You're the only one who answered yes to any of these questions'\" and that it would require he speak with human resources, she said.\n\nAfterward, her doctor wrote another letter saying \"special allowances should be made to accommodate her\" working from home \"as needed throughout the 2020-2021 school year\" when she experiences symptoms.\n\nApproximately three weeks later, she said she received an email informing her she needed to appear in a video conference call that could result in disciplinary action. In that meeting, she learned she was placed on administrative leave and faces termination.\n\n\"We're in the middle of a pandemic and to put me out with no health insurance, for myself and my son and my ability to have a paycheck, it's heartless,\" Mazzotta-Perretti said.",

    "Sickened by COVID-19, low-wage workers lose jobs. Others are denied paid leave.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The full version of this article was originally published by the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit newsroom based in Washington, D.C.\n\nLucie Joseph started to feel sick on April 28 as she rang up customers at a Shell gas station in Delray Beach, Florida.\n\nJoseph said her boss wouldn't give her time off without a doctor's note. But the owner of the gas station, Sun Gas Marketing and Petroleum, didn't offer her health insurance, so she didn't go to the doctor. Joseph, a single mother with a 10-year-old son, kept working -- seven more shifts over 10 days.\n\nJoseph's symptoms worsened, so she decided to get tested for COVID-19. On May 9, Joseph learned she had tested positive, and a nurse told her to quarantine. Over the next six weeks, Joseph tested positive twice more and texted the results to a manager. As instructed, she didn't return to work until she had two consecutive negative tests. On June 15, however, she was fired.\n\n\"I was stunned,\" said Joseph, who showed the Center for Public Integrity images of the text messages with her employer and a document indicating she'd tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nJoseph, who earned $13 an hour, didn't realize she had a legal right to job protection.\n\nTwo months before she was fired, President Donald Trump signed the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which requires certain small and medium-sized businesses to pay a worker's full salary for two weeks if they become infected with COVID-19 and prohibits businesses from firing employees for taking leave.\n\nBut Joseph, who was eventually paid two weeks' wages, didn't know about the law until she consulted a lawyer. Many other workers are equally uninformed.\n\nSun Gas owner Richard Vogel did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of U.S. businesses have been cited for illegally denying paid leave to workers during the pandemic, according to documents obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request. As of June 12, nearly 700 companies had violated the law's paid-leave provisions and owed back wages to hundreds of employees, according to Labor Department records. Violators include six McDonald's franchises and the franchise owners of a Comfort Suites, Courtyard by Marriott and Red Roof Inn.\n\nIn all, the businesses owe $690,000 in unpaid wages to 527 employees, who are not identified in the documents. Most of the workers are low-wage earners in the construction, hotel and food industries. It's likely many more companies have broken the law because workers such as Joseph aren't aware of their rights and therefore haven't filed complaints.\n\n\"Workers with low wages are most in need of paid leave,\" said Tanya Goldman, a former Labor Department policy adviser who's now an attorney at the nonprofit Center for Law and Social Policy. \"They literally cannot afford to stay home and take a sick day if they get COVID.\"\n\nRed Roof Inn's corporate office said it was trying to track down the employee involved but didn't give further comment. A spokesperson for Choice Hotels, which owns the Comfort Suites brand, said the hotel is owned by a franchisee and did not comment on the violation.\n\nEileen Arslan, comptroller for the Courtyard by Marriott in Fort Walton Beach, Florida, which was cited for a violation, said hotel staff members were confused at first about who was covered under the new law. As soon as they heard from the Labor Department, they paid the employee the wages owed, Arslan said.\n\nCongress is considering another stimulus bill that would extend paid sick days to workers not covered under the current law, such as health care workers, first responders and employees at companies with more than 500 workers. Establishments with fewer than 50 workers are exempt if they show paid leave would seriously hurt their businesses.\n\nBut the bill is tied up in the Senate as Republicans and Democrats fight about how much aid to give workers.\n\nAbout a third of U.S. workers don't receive paid time off from their employers. Most of them work in low-wage jobs. Others, such as Joseph, get only one or two days of paid time off a year. Others get a bit more, such as Angely Rodriguez Lambert.\n\nRodriguez, who works as a cashier at a McDonald's restaurant in Oakland, California, gets up to five sick days a year under state law. But that wasn't enough to pay her bills while she recovered from COVID-19.\n\nRodriguez was one of 11 employees at the McDonald's in the East Bay neighborhood of Temescal who tested positive for the coronavirus in late May. Forced to quarantine, Rodriguez asked if she could get paid while she recovered at home. Probably not, her boss said, adding that she would check with her supervisor. Rodriguez said she never got a response.\n\nRodriguez, who earns $14.14 an hour, didn't realize she had the right to get paid for two weeks during quarantine.\n\n\"Imagine living here without any money,\" Rodriguez said in Spanish. \"I can't stay in my home if I don't pay the rent, and I need to eat and send money to my family.\"\n\nRodriguez and five co-workers are suing the franchise owner, VES McDonald's, for allegedly breaking local labor laws, including a temporary Oakland ordinance that requires employers to give workers two paid weeks off if they get sick during the pandemic.\n\nRodriguez said she eventually was paid for 60 hours but is owed another 20. The company said it eventually paid all workers in mid-June who asked for leave, according to court records.\n\nRodriguez's employer, McDonald's franchise owner Valerie Smith, did not respond to a request for comment. In court documents, her lawyers said the franchise has complied with the law.\n\nA spokesperson for McDonald's Corp. said the company asks employees who are sick to stay home.\n\n\"We're confident the vast majority of restaurant employees impacted by COVID-19 are getting paid sick leave through existing franchisee and corporate policies, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, CARES Act and state and local regulations, and McDonald's USA requires its franchisees to comply with all applicable laws and regulations,\" the spokesperson wrote.\n\nRodriguez and Joseph are the types of workers the Families First law was supposed to help: low-income earners who aren't paid if they are sick or don't get enough paid leave to quarantine for at least two weeks.\n\nThe law also guarantees working parents 10 weeks off at two-thirds pay if a worker's child care provider closes because of the pandemic. Employers get a tax credit to cover the cost.\n\nData from the Labor Department's Wage and Hour Division, which enforces the paid-leave law, shows that businesses with a large number of low-wage workers are breaking the law more often than others.\n\nMost of the violators are construction and renovation companies, hotels, restaurants, grocery stores and manufacturers.\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service has the most violations: 57. It owes workers nearly $100,000, Labor Department records show.\n\nSandra Capkovic, who delivers mail in the Tampa, Florida, area, said a supervisor denied her request for 10 weeks of paid leave to take care of her 7-year-old son, whose babysitters have been unavailable during the pandemic. Capkovic said her supervisor told her the paid-leave law covers only parents whose children's schools and day care facilities are closed, and she would have to use the 10 days of annual leave she had accumulated.\n\nThe Families First law covers working parents whose \"child care provider\" is unavailable, but doesn't specify whether that includes babysitters.\n\nCapkovic said she didn't file a formal complaint because she didn't know if her supervisor had violated the law.\n\nA spokesperson for the postal service said the agency began educating employees about their rights as soon as the law was signed by the president.\n\n\"Significantly, the number of violations cited (57) is a very small fraction of the Postal Service workforce, which is comprised of more than 630,000 employees,\" she wrote.\n\nTwo former Labor Department officials said the 692 paid-leave records obtained by the Center for Public Integrity likely reflect only a fraction of employers who are breaking the law.\n\n\"It's very challenging for an employee, in a time of increasingly high unemployment and instability in the labor market, to have the courage to make a complaint,\" said Michael Hancock, an employment lawyer and an assistant administrator for policy in the Wage and Hour Division during the Obama administration.\n\nJoseph, meanwhile, is now receiving unemployment pay and looking for work. She's preparing to sue Sun Gas, claiming it broke the paid-leave law.\n\n\"Bosses need to know that we're human, that we have a family too,\" she said.\n\nClick here to read the rest of this story.",

    "Southern Asian Americans lack COVID resources found in larger ethnic enclaves like N.Y. and L.A.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Every week, roughly 100 Asian immigrants and refugees pull up to a health center in metro Atlanta to get tested for COVID-19. But the drive-through site, operated by a local nonprofit, provides more than just nasal swabs.\n\nSince mid-June, when the number of cases in Georgia began to spike, testing requests have grown substantially, especially from low-income seniors with limited English skills and knowledge about the disease. At the Cosmo Health Center, operated by the nonprofit the Center for Pan Asian Community Services, they receive a one-page informational flyer, translated into their native language, on how to practice prevention and deal with symptoms. Bilingual health care providers, sometimes with help from interpreters, then walk clients through the testing process and conduct follow-up calls once the results are out.\n\n\"The people we serve aren't seeing PSAs on national media,\" Victoria Huynh, the vice president of CPACS, told NBC Asian America. \"So we've become interpreters and translators who help bridge immigrant communities to mainstream services.\"\n\nThe organization is representative of Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in the South that lack proper resources. Nearly 4 million AAPIs, roughly a quarter of the group's total population, live in the 16 Southern states, making them the fastest-growing Asian cohort anywhere in the country. But compared to residents of bigger, older enclaves in Los Angeles and New York, Southern Asians tend to be first-generation immigrants and refugees who face greater language and health care barriers. Due to a lack of media attention and political power, they are often neglected by elected officials, some of whom have churned out a steady stream of anti-immigration laws.\n\nThe CPACS-run Cosmo Health Center is one of the only federally qualified clinics in the South focusing on underprivileged AAPI residents. In the area of mass-testing, it has filled a critical coverage gap: more than a third of Atlanta's quarter-million Asian residents have low English proficiency. Many people, as a result, have no idea how widely the virus has spread, where to get tested or how much it would cost. CPACS conducts phone outreach to clients and advertises its free testing program in ethnic media, where older residents get their information.\n\n\"The immigrant and refugee community we serve are getting the crumbs of funding that's coming to Georgia,\" Huynh said. Cosmo Health Center could not scale testing capacity even as requests rose, she noted, because the state prioritizes supplying testing kits and personal protective gear to hospitals and bigger clinics over smaller ones based in AAPI neighborhoods.\n\nFor social services groups, combating anti-Asian hate and addressing language needs have become critical as coronavirus cases have exploded across the region. Because AAPIs are underrepresented and underheard, Southern states provide virtually no Asian-language assistance for public health, financial, and voting services.\n\nIn Gwinnett County, a region of Metro Atlanta that's home to Georgia's largest AAPI population, the language barrier has also affected the small business owners that CPACS serves. Since April, the group has organized two webinars, with the Small Business Development Center, to help people navigate the labyrinthine Paycheck Protection Program. During the livestreams, which drew more than 250 AAPI business owners, consultants explained the loan application and forgiveness process, and answered questions in English while CPACS staff provided real-time translations in Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese.\n\nThe share of AAPIs living in poverty has grown more quickly in the South than anywhere else in the country, according to a report from AAAJ. Part of this can be chalked up to the region's sizable refugee population from Southeast Asia.\n\n\"Asians here are pretty invisible, and they stay to themselves,\" said Jacqueline Thanh, the executive director of Vietnamese-American Young Leaders' Association of New Orleans. \"We have to band together to provide mutual aid.\"\n\nMany of the Vietnamese refugees who arrived by boat in New Orleans in the 1970s are farmers and fishermen. As the pandemic devastated the food supply chain, VAYLA collaborated with the VEGGI Farmers Cooperative to deliver fresh produce directly from Vietnamese farms to homes in the Village de L'Est neighborhood, a food desert where a large share of the city's 14,000 Vietnamese residents live.\n\nThe converging chaos of the pandemic and the mass protests against police brutality has put AAPI activists on the path to addressing both anti-Asian hate and anti-Black bias.\n\nLike in much of the country, race relations in New Orleans can be perilously fraught. An undercurrent of distrust and xenophobia runs through the Black and Vietnamese communities, two indigent minority groups that have, for decades, competed for resources, Thanh said. In May, VAYLA launched a series of storytelling workshops to facilitate community healing at a time of immeasurable economic loss and racial strife, and to encourage younger Vietnamese Americans to interrogate the anti-Black narratives embedded in their history.\n\nIn Texas, where 1.5 million Asian Americans live, there have been 63 reported incidents of anti-Asian hate from March to July, according to a report by the coalition Stop AAPI Hate. One assailant stabbed a family with two young children thinking they were carriers of the virus. Though the figure hasn't visibly accelerated since a tsunami of new COVID-19 cases slammed the state, AAPIs remain in a very vulnerable position, said Debbie Chen, executive director of the Houston chapter of OCA-Asian Pacific American Advocates.\n\n\"Houston is experiencing an impact from COVID-19 in two ways,\" she said. \"Everyone is experiencing the business and restaurant shutdowns, but we also have the drop in oil prices. That creates an environment where people are frustrated and it's easier to look for a scapegoat.\"\n\nThese compounding economic anxieties have contributed to a rise in racial tensions across industries. To protect Asian families and businesses against future attacks, OCA teamed up with various foundations and community leaders to launch 50 bystander intervention courses starting this month. The goal, Chen said, is to train 50,000 people, including college students, oil workers, corporate professionals and churchgoers.\n\nAt the same time, the organization wants to foster a greater understanding within the AAPI community about the intersectionality of racial justice and anti-Asian hate. Through next June, the group will be hosting virtual film screenings and panels every month to explore pivotal moments in U.S. civil rights history. Some chosen documentaries include \"The Chinese Exclusion Act;\" \"Delano Manongs,\" about labor organizer Larry Itliong and the Filipino farm workers who organized the Delano Grape Strike; and \"Freedom Summer,\" about the 1964 campaign to integrate Mississippi's segregated political system.\n\n\"We all carry these biases within ourselves,\" Chen said. \"We want to address colorism within our own community and spark a broader dialogue through art.\"",

    "Teen vapers up to 7 times more likely to get COVID-19: Stanford study": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Before coronavirus, pulmonologists, pediatricians and parents were busy battling a different nationwide health crisis: the \"epidemic\" of teen vaping. Last year, over five million high school and middle school students reported using e-cigarettes, inhaling mysterious nicotine-filled juices with little sense of the long-term effects.\n\nSo when an unfamiliar virus began sending scores of patients to the hospital with failing lungs, doctors wondered whether there would be consequences for the newly addicted generation.\n\nOn Tuesday, researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine published a study which may confirm the fears of parents and doctors across the nation. Vaping is not just a small risk for coronavirus. Among teens and young adults who were tested, those who had used e-cigs were five to seven times more likely to be infected than non-users.\n\nWatch Cynthia McFadden on NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt tonight for more on this story\n\n\"We were surprised,\" said Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, professor of pediatrics at Stanford University and the study's senior author. \"We expected to maybe see some relationship .... but certainly not at the odds ratios and the significance that we're seeing it here.\"\n\nThe study is the first national population-based look at connections between vaping and coronavirus in young people, based on surveys of over 4,351 participants ages 13 to 24 from all 50 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories. Among tested participants, young people who had ever used e-cigs were five times more likely to be diagnosed with coronavirus, while those who had used both e-cigs and regular cigarettes within the previous 30 days were 6.8 times as likely to be diagnosed with the disease.\n\n\"This is yet another piece showing that e-cigarettes are harmful to our health, period,\" said Halpern-Felsher.\n\nThere could be several reasons for vapers' heightened transmission risk. E-cigarettes can damage lungs and alter the immune system, making each coronavirus exposure more likely to trigger an infection, experts say. It is also possible that the aerosol emitted from e-cigarettes could have droplets containing coronavirus, Halpern-Felsher said, which could then be spread to another person or re-inhaled into one's lungs. Many vaping social norms -- hand-to-mouth contact, passing e-cigs between friends -- are also high-risk pandemic behavior. It's hard to exhale a cloud of smoke with a mask on.\n\nMore research is needed to understand the medical relationship between coronavirus and vaping, experts say. But the risk is clear, even when variables like race, sex, state COVID-19 rates and compliance with shelter-in-place orders are taken into account. The researchers say they hope these findings will prompt regulators to toughen regulations on these devices. Vaping is no longer just a personal risk, the study shows, but also a public health risk.\n\n\"Using e-cigs is sort of like the anti-mask,\" said Dr. Jonathan Winickoff, professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and MassGeneral Hospital for Children. \"If we can control vaping in youth, we've gone part of the way in helping curb the pandemic.\"\n\nSophia Beerel, one of Winickoff's patients, was 14 when she took her first hit of an e-cigarette -- a candy-sweet head rush with no warnings and seemingly few consequences. It started with an impulsive hit of a classmate's device during a science class bathroom break.\n\n\"I knew it was more than water,\" said Beerel, now 16. \"I knew it was a type of juice. I wasn't aware to the extent of how much nicotine was in it. I didn't even know what nicotine was at that point.\"\n\n\"I was like, whatever... better than cigarettes,\" she continued. \"That's what people were saying.\"\n\nSo began a multi-year battle with nicotine addiction. She ignored her parents' \"nicotine talk\" and lit candles at home to mask the smell of her exhales. At 15, she tried to quit and felt sick with withdrawal symptoms like jitters, nerves and shakes. It was only when she lost her luggage stocked with pods during a five-week vacation that she was forced to quit cold turkey.\n\nBeerel says she has mostly stopped using e-cigarettes, down from a pack of pods roughly every 10 days (equivalent to about four packs of cigarettes) to an occasional nostalgic hit. But when the pandemic began, Beerel wondered if her old habit was going to put her at additional risk.\n\n\"I think it's scary for everyone,\" said Beerel. \"I did have thoughts like how much of my lungs are compromised.\"\n\nIt troubles Winickoff, her doctor, as well. Over the past few years, Winickoff has seen kids he began treating as babies turn to e-cigarettes -- teenagers who lose their breath after a flight of stairs, athletes who have lost the stamina to play sports and many, many photos of damaged lungs. But he says he has never been more worried about teen tobacco use than right now.\n\n\"This is a dangerous convergence of two different crises -- the epidemic of youth e-cigarette use combined with the pandemic of COVID-19,\" said Winickoff.\n\nThe Stanford study sheds new light on just how problematic the mix could be. Participants who used cigarettes and e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days were also almost five times more likely to experience COVID-19 symptoms like coughing, fever, tiredness and difficulty breathing.\n\n\"I think our findings have a very strong message to health care providers, parents, and teens,\" Halpern-Felsher said. \"If you are vaping and smoking, this is yet another sign that these products are hurting your body and your lungs.\"\n\nAn FDA spokesperson could not comment on the specifics of the study but said the agency will review it. In a statement, the spokesperson noted that people who smoke cigarettes may be at increased risk of infection and worse outcomes due to COVID-19. They said it is not yet known whether the same is true for e-cigarettes.\n\n\"E-cigarette use can expose the lungs to toxic chemicals, but whether those exposures increase the risk of COVID-19 or the severity of COVID-19 outcomes is not known,\" the spokesperson said. \"However, many e-cigarette users are current or former smokers, and cigarette smoking increases the risk of respiratory infections, including pneumonia. Irrespective of COVID-19, e-cigarettes should never be used by youth, young adults, and pregnant women or adults who do not currently use tobacco products.\"\n\nThe Stanford study did not analyze a possible connection between COVID-19 diagnosis and use of conventional cigarettes for study participants. This may be because most nicotine-using youth either use e-cigs only or both e-cigs and traditional cigarettes, according to Halpern-Felsher, but few use conventional cigarettes alone.\n\nThe Stanford study focuses mainly on transmission, but experts' concerns regarding e-cigs extend beyond that. A July study from the University of San Francisco suggests smoking, including e-cigarettes, doubles young adults' risk of getting seriously sick with coronavirus -- the \"most prevalent factor\" in young adults' medical vulnerability for severe COVID-19 illness.\n\nIt's a factor that Colin Finnerty, 21, can't get out of his head. In March, Finnerty became one of the first people in his county to come down with coronavirus, he said. Doctors identified a small pneumonia infection in his bottom left lung, he said, and it spread to both sides in just two days. He spent six days on oxygen in the hospital, isolated, worried he was going to die.\n\n\"Being a 21-year-old, I should not be spending six days in the hospital for lung complications,\" Finnerty said. \"I was told so much that, statistically, I was in the clear. But I learned very shortly that was wrong.\"\n\nFinnerty looks nothing like the prototypical coronavirus patient. He is generally healthy, works at a ski resort and spends his free time swimming, skateboarding and snowboarding. But he has also been addicted to vaping since he was 17. For over three years, he was vaping from the second he woke up to the second he went to bed, he said.\n\nData is lacking on the medical connection between coronavirus and vaping. But Finnerty still worries that his e-cigarette addiction may have turned his coronavirus diagnosis into a battle for his life.\n\n\"It's just weird to think that maybe if I hadn't bought that first [e-cigarette] ... then maybe it wouldn't have happened,\" said Finnerty. \"Or at least not happened as brutally as it ended up happening,\"\n\nExisting research suggests that a smoker's lungs are especially ripe for coronavirus infection, according to Winickoff. Smoking can paralyze the lungs' cilia -- little hair-like fibers that sweep away mucus and pathogens -- making them less effective as guards against dangerous infections. It can also make it easier for coronavirus to bind in the lung, Winickoff said, so a smaller dose of virus is more likely to cause an infection.\n\n\"For smokers, it essentially takes less virus to cause disease,\" Winickoff said. \"And in general, the higher the viral load, the bigger the problems.... So it's really a one-two punch there.\"\n\nE-cigarettes can also weaken the immune system and appear to cause underlying conditions like asthma which may make it harder to fight the virus. And tobacco and nicotine are just the beginning, some worry. No one is systematically checking what's inside many of these devices, a large portion of which now come from factories overseas. Experts have found substances like carcinogens, heavy metals, herbicides, toxic chemicals and chemicals known to cause heart and lung disease.\n\nA fivefold increase in coronavirus susceptibility is a scary statistic for young e-cigarette users, but experts say it should also be troubling to regulators. Over one in four high school students reported current e-cigarette use in last year's National Youth Tobacco Survey. If schools reopen and teen vaping goes unchecked, transmission rates could increase, affecting teachers, parents and the community at large.\n\nThe results of the Stanford study underscore the need to clamp down on teen e-cigarette use, according to Halpern-Felsher.\n\n\"I honestly think that the FDA has taken its eye off the ball, really even before the pandemic,\" Halpern-Felsher said.\n\nHalpern-Felsher is not alone in this sentiment; regulation of e-cigarettes has been too slow and too limited for many advocates. This January, the FDA issued a ban on most flavored cartridges, including popular \"gateway\" flavors like mint and mango. But the ban gave exceptions to certain products, such as menthol and tobacco cartridges, flavored \"open tank\" e-juice and disposable e-cigarettes.\n\nA new cast of brands has already grown in these loopholes. Throughout the pandemic, there have remained a rainbow assortment of workarounds for addicted youth, in flavors like cotton candy, banana and green apple candy.\n\nIn July, the FDA sent warning letters notifying 10 companies to pull flavored disposables and youth-appealing e-liquids from the market. In a statement to NBC News, an FDA spokesperson said its top priority \"remains protecting youth from products that pose the greatest risk for initiation or use by minors.\"\n\n\"The FDA continues to prioritize enforcement against e-cigarette products, specifically those most appealing and accessible to youth,\" the agency spokesperson said. \"We are concerned about the popularity of these products among youth and want to make clear to all tobacco product manufacturers and retailers that, even during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA is keeping a close watch on the marketplace and will hold companies accountable.\"\n\nBut existing actions have not gone far enough, according to Halpern-Felsher.\n\n\"The cigarette market, it's the Wild Wild West,\" Halpern-Felsher said. \"As soon as you get one product off the market, the next one comes on. ... We need to stop the whack a mole, we need to regulate and stop the entire market of e-cigarettes.\"\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., who chairs the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer policy, sent a letter to the FDA on Tuesday, citing the new Stanford study. He previously wrote the agency in April regarding the potential of e-cigarettes to exacerbate the coronavirus pandemic, but the FDA then declined to act, citing lack of conclusive evidence on the topic.\n\n\"Today, we have the evidence that the FDA was waiting for, and it can no longer deny the danger e-cigarettes pose during the coronavirus crisis,\" wrote Krishnamoorthi. \"[I]t is evident that the youth vaping epidemic has combined forces with the coronavirus pandemic, creating a much deadlier foe that demands FDA action.\"\n\nSo far, patchwork regulation has shaken companies, but not addicts. E-cigarette brands may rise and fall, but the number of teen e-cigarette users has only risen in recent years.\n\nWhile Beerel and Finnerty feel compelled to speak out against e-cigarettes, they both have struggled to ditch the habit completely. Finnerty, who says he has been diagnosed with PTSD after getting out of the hospital, urged others to take all possible steps to avoid his situation, including avoiding e-cigarettes.\n\n\"Easier said than done,\" said Finnerty. \"But I just hope that people consider that they are putting themselves at a much greater risk.\"\n\nCoronavirus is the latest in a long list of risks incurred by teen vapers. But the results of the Stanford study feel especially shocking, Beerel said. It's not a distant risk. It's not a small risk. And for teenagers living with parents and interacting with the community, it's not just a personal risk either.\n\n\"It makes me at least really thankful that I haven't gotten it yet, and a little bit concerned for both myself and my peers,\" said Beerel. \"Because COVID-19 is a nasty disease...it's already so contagious. To think that it can be even more contagious based on vaping is really just shocking and scary.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The federal government appears to have backtracked on COVID-19 testing guidance, according to a statement released late Wednesday from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nControversial recommendations posted to the CDC website on Monday suggested people exposed to the coronavirus \"do not necessarily need a test\" unless they're having symptoms, are older or are otherwise medically vulnerable.\n\nIn the new statement, the CDC's director, Dr. Robert Redfield, now says that \"all close contacts of confirmed or probable COVID-19 patients\" may consider testing.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"Dr. Redfield appears to have walked back from that a little bit,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\n\nDespite Redfield's statement, the CDC's website had not changed as of Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe recommendation from the CDC was met with backlash this week, when it quietly reversed previous advice that anyone exposed to COVID-19 should be tested, even if they weren't symptomatic.\n\nRedfield said the CDC's latest guidance was an attempt to place \"an emphasis on testing individuals with symptomatic illness.\"\n\nTesting people who've been in contact with COVID-19 patients is a classic, tried-and-true method of infectious disease control. That includes infected people who don't feel sick.\n\n\"The biggest Achilles' heel of the disease is that about 40 percent of people out there who get infected with this virus are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic,\" Dr. Carlos Del Rio, executive associate dean at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. \"If they're still transmitting it and we don't know who they are, we're going to be in trouble.\"\n\n\"Everyone who needs a COVID-19 test, can get a test,\" Redfield said. \"Everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test.\"\n\nThe CDC does not mandate which people can or should be tested for the coronavirus. Those decisions are left to local and state health authorities, and are dependent, in some cases, on the availability of tests.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nA joint statement from the governors of Connecticut, New Jersey and New York called the new testing guidelines \"reckless,\" and said the states would \"continue to follow the advice of health experts to contain and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and therefore will not be changing our guidance that prioritizes testing\" for asymptomatic individuals.\n\nThe incubation period for COVID-19 is considered to be 14 days, meaning a person might become infectious and/or develop symptoms within two weeks after exposure.\n\nTherefore, it is possible, in some cases, to be tested too early. For example, a negative result on day four after an exposure could become a positive result on day 10.\n\nThat's why the CDC and many public health experts advise anyone who has been exposed to the virus to quarantine for those two weeks, taking extra precautions, such as physical distancing and wearing a mask.\n\n\"Asymptomatic spread is a reason behind the universal mask guidance,\" Schaffner said. \"Here I am feeling great, but I cannot assure you that I'm infection free, and you cannot assure me that you're infection free.

    "The Southern Hemisphere avoided a 'twindemic' of COVID-19 and flu. How will the Northern Hemisphere fare?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Winter is ending in the Southern Hemisphere and country after country -- South Africa, Australia, Argentina -- had a surprise: Their steps against COVID-19 also apparently blocked the flu.\n\nBut there's no guarantee the Northern Hemisphere will avoid twin epidemics as its own flu season looms while the coronavirus still rages.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"This could be one of the worst seasons we've had from a public health perspective with COVID and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we've had,\" Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press.\n\nU.S. health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu in record numbers this fall, so hospitals aren't overwhelmed with a dueling \"twindemic.\"\n\nIt's also becoming clear that wearing masks, avoiding crowds and keeping your distance are protections that are \"not specific for COVID. They're going to work for any respiratory virus,\" Redfield said.\n\nThe evidence: Ordinarily, South Africa sees widespread influenza during the Southern Hemisphere's winter months of May through August. This year, testing tracked by the country's National Institute of Communicable Diseases is finding almost none -- something unprecedented.\n\nSchool closures, limited public gatherings and calls to wear masks and wash hands have \"knocked down the flu,\" said Dr. Cheryl Cohen, head of the institute's respiratory program.\n\nThat not only meant lives saved from flu's annual toll, but it \"freed up our hospitals' capacity to treat COVID-19 patients,\" Cohen added.\n\nIn Australia, the national health department reported just 36 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths from January to mid-August, compared to more than 480 during the same period last year.\n\n\"The most likely and the biggest contributor is social distancing,\" said Dr. Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney.\n\nThe coronavirus is blamed for about 24 million infections and more than 810,000 deaths globally in just the first eight months of this year. A normal flu year could have the world's hospitals dealing with several million more severe illnesses on top of the COVID-19 crush.\n\nBack in February and March, as the worldwide spread of the new virus was just being recognized, many countries throughout the Southern Hemisphere girded for a double whammy. Even as they locked down to fight the coronavirus, they made a huge push for more last-minute flu vaccinations.\n\n\"We gave many more flu vaccinations, like four times more,\" said Jaco Havenga, a pharmacist who works at Mays Chemist, a pharmacy in a Johannesburg suburb.\n\nSome countries' lockdowns were more effective than others at stemming spread of the coronavirus. So why would flu have dropped even if COVID-19 still was on the rise?\n\n\"Clearly the vigilance required to be successful against COVID is really high,\" said CDC's Redfield. \"This virus is one of the most infectious viruses that we've seen.\"\n\nThat's in part because 40 percent of people with COVID-19 show no symptoms yet can spread infection, he said.\n\nFlu hasn't disappeared, cautions a World Health Organization report earlier this month. While \"globally, influenza activity was reported at lower levels than expected for this time of year,\" it found sporadic cases are being reported.\n\nPlus, some people who had the flu in Southern countries might just have hunkered down at home and not seen a doctor as the coronavirus was widespread, WHO added.\n\nBut international influenza experts say keeping schools closed -- children typically drive flu's spread -- and strict mask and distancing rules clearly helped.\n\n\"We don't have definitive proof, but the logical explanation is what they're doing to try to control the spread of (the coronavirus) is actually doing a really, really good job against the flu as well,\" said Richard Webby of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, who is part of a WHO committee that tracks flu evolution.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. and Europe didn't impose coronavirus rules nearly as restrictive as some of their Southern neighbors -- and in many cases are reopening schools and relaxing distancing rules even as COVID-19 still is spreading and the cooler months that favor influenza's spread are fast approaching.\n\nSo the U.S. CDC is urging record flu vaccinations, preferably by October. Redfield's goal is for at least 65 percent of adults to be vaccinated; usually only about half are.\n\nThe U.S. expects more than 190 million doses of flu vaccine, about 20 million more than last year. States are being encouraged to try drive-thru flu shots and other creative ideas to get people vaccinated while avoiding crowds.\n\nIn an unusual move, Massachusetts has mandated flu vaccination for all students -- from elementary to college -- this year. Typically only some health care workers face employment mandates for flu vaccine.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson likewise is urging widespread flu vaccination.\n\nTo be clear, the flu vaccine only protects against influenza -- it won't lessen the chances of getting the coronavirus. Vaccines against COVID-19 still are experimental and several candidates are entering final testing to see if they really work.\n\nBut for coronavirus protection, Redfield continues to stress vigilance about wearing masks, keeping your distance, avoiding crowds and washing your hands.\n\n\"Once one stops those mitigation steps, it only takes a couple weeks for these viral pathogens to get back on the path that they were on,\" he said.\n\nWhile the U.S. has been mask-resistant, most states now have some type of mask requirement, either through statewide orders issued by governors or from city and county rules.\n\nMeanwhile, countries where flu season is ending are watching to see if the Northern Hemisphere heeds their lessons learned.\n\n\"It could be very scary -- we honestly don't know. But if you're going to get the two infections at the same time, you could be in big trouble,\" said Booy, the Sydney infectious diseases expert.",

    "This governor wants schools reopened. Local officials say it's not safe.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- When the Iowa City Community School District decided in mid-July to start the academic year fully online, it seemed like the only logical choice to administrators. The county was averaging 26 new confirmed coronavirus cases a day, some days as high as 70, and no one knew what impact the return of University of Iowa students would have on the eastern Iowa town.\n\nBut three days after the school board vote, Gov. Kim Reynolds interrupted their plans.\n\nReynolds, a Republican, signed a proclamation on July 17 requiring schools to teach at least half of all classes in-person, unless the district receives a waiver from the state. Waivers would only be approved if a county's coronavirus positivity rate surpassed 15 percent. Last week, the state denied Iowa City's waiver request, saying the county's positivity rate was too low -- 6.26 percent -- to warrant remote instruction. Reynolds warned this month that students may not receive credit if their schools move online without state permission because it would violate a law enacted in June.\n\n\"The decision we made was in the interest of trying to put health and safety above all else,\" said Shawn Eyestone, the Iowa City school board president, \"and now we're in the position where we don't even get to do that. So we're just on edge -- the whole community is on edge.\"\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nDecisions on how to start the new school year in Iowa have come down to the wire in many cities and towns across the state, following new rules Reynolds laid out in recent weeks amid the COVID-19 pandemic. While states nationwide are grappling with whether to reopen schools, the impassioned debate in Iowa has resulted in car protests, resignations by longtime teachers and staff members, and some districts openly flouting Reynolds' orders.\n\n\"I believe we should all do everything we can to get our kids back in school in a safe and responsible manner,\" Reynolds said Tuesday at a news conference. \"We are doing everything we can, even providing flexibility through the proclamation, to help them comply and do the right thing in a safe and responsible manner,\" she added.\n\nMany educators have expressed concern that Iowa, which has the highest per capita rate of coronavirus infections in the Midwest and no statewide mask mandate, hasn't made enough progress controlling COVID-19 to return students to the classrooms.\n\n\"We don't want to pick a fight, but we do want to do what's best for family and staff,\" Eyestone said.\n\nOver the next week, the school boards for Iowa City and the state's largest district, in Des Moines, will both consider fall semester plans that would defy the state's reopening rules by starting the academic year entirely online. \"There is consensus that we need to do everything we can to limit and reduce in-person learning to start the year,\" said Phil Roeder, Des Moines Public Schools spokesman.\n\nThe board for the Urbandale Community School District, in a Des Moines suburb, voted unanimously on Aug. 3 to keep classes entirely online at one year-round elementary school for at least two more weeks. The next day, Reynolds said at a news conference that children may not receive credit if their districts don't follow state rules on in-person learning, and administrators could lose their licenses.\n\nThe Urbandale district decided Monday to implement a hybrid model, splitting students into two groups and having them switch days they attend class on campus.\n\nState guidelines released in late July say that schools can only suspend in-person classes if the 14-day average infection rate among those who are tested tops 15 percent in their county, and absenteeism among students reaches 10 percent. The Iowa Department of Public Health came up with those thresholds, but has declined to state how it arrived at them. The U.S. Surgeon General has recommended that a community get its positivity rate below 10 percent before resuming in-person teaching. Epidemiologists have suggested the rate should be 5 percent or lower.\n\nHowever, even if a school district's county hits that threshold, the state may still deny a request to go fully remote.\n\nReynolds has argued there'd be no need to shut down schools if a coronavirus outbreak in a county was largely contained to a nursing home or prison, and that context would be determined through contact tracing. She's also said that parents can enroll their children in online education, even though schools can't make it the default choice.\n\nThe Waukee Community School District, west of Des Moines, will bring most students back for in-person classes. However, the district also said it will not request permission from the state if the school board decides classes must be moved online due to the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nBrad Buck, Waukee's superintendent and a former head of the Iowa Department of Education, said they could not find any expert or other state using a threshold of 15 percent positivity rate. The district will instead rely on a 10 percent positive threshold.\n\nSeven counties currently have positivity rates of at least 15 percent, according to a state government dashboard. Another 19 counties have rates from 10 to 14 percent. Iowa's COVID-19 community testing effort is limited among the general public to those displaying symptoms or who have known exposure to the virus.\n\nMany bars, restaurants and gyms remain open in Iowa. It's not uncommon for people to grocery shop without a facial covering, or for employees at gas stations not to wear one. Reynolds has forbidden cities and counties from imposing their own mask mandates, though a handful have done so anyway.\n\n\"Some people are going about like nothing is happening,\" said Andrea Leigh Hileman, an elementary school music teacher in Waterloo, Iowa, \"and that is concerning -- what are they teaching their children?\"\n\nHileman, who will return to her school to teach music in person to hundreds of children, worries about replicating cases like the choir in Washington state where 45 of 60 singers contracted COVID-19 following a March practice.\n\n\"I really enjoy my job -- it's just not safe right now,\" she said.\n\nAt a news conference last week, Reynolds blamed these fears on \"scare tactics\" from the media. But some teachers are already quitting rather than stepping into full classrooms.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nSuzanne Yoder, 49, resigned from her job as a fourth grade teacher for the Mid-Prairie Community School District in eastern Iowa after it decided to bring everyone back for in-person classes.\n\n\"It was heartbreaking,\" said Yoder, a cancer survivor who has asthma. \"It was something I never figured I'd do. I anticipated retiring, not resigning.\"\n\nRhiannon Fogelman, 36, quit her job teaching preschool in Fort Dodge, Iowa, because she feared infecting her daughter, who has an immune disorder and will be schooled online this year.\n\n\"I feel selfish for even leaving,\" she said, \"but I had to do what's best for my family.\"",

    "Trial started for COVID-19 antibody treatment to prevent serious illness": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The National Institutes of Health announced the start of two clinical trials for a potential coronavirus treatment called monoclonal antibodies.\n\nTwo treatments -- remdesivir and dexamethasone -- have been shown to help severely ill COVID-19 patients, but this would be the first potential drug to help patients early in the disease.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"What we're dealing with now is trying to determine what works in early disease,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a press briefing Tuesday.\n\nMonoclonal antibodies are made in a lab to mimic the body's natural antibodies. Antibodies act by recognizing specific pathogens -- in this case, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 -- and harnessing the immune system to fight them off.\n\nThe NIH trials will use a monoclonal antibody developed by Eli Lilly, called LY-CoV555. This antibody was isolated from a COVID-19 patient in Washington state in the early months of the pandemic, Fauci said. It works by binding to the virus's infamous spike protein, interfering with its ability to infect cells.\n\nGigi Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said that there are good reasons to be optimistic about monoclonal antibodies. Early data from Regeneron, another drugmaker working on monoclonal antibodies, found that the drug was effective in both treating and preventing infection in animals. Those findings were published Monday on the preprint server bioRxiv.\n\nIf monoclonal antibodies are shown to work as a treatment in the clinical trials, that would give a lot of promise for their use as a preventive medicine, as well -- one that would likely be available before a vaccine, Gronvall, who is not involved with either drug trial, said.\n\nThe clinical trials are part of the NIH's Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Intervention and Vaccines program, or ACTIV.\n\nOne trial, ACTIV-2, focuses on patients early in the course of the disease, who have not been hospitalized but have tested positive within seven days and have had symptoms for no more than 10 days. A total of 220 patients will be enrolled in the phase 2 stage of this trial; half of whom will receive the experimental treatment and half of whom will receive the placebo.\n\nThe goal of the trial is to determine whether the treatment reduces the duration of a patient's symptoms through 28 days, as well as if the treatment increases the proportion of patients who test negative for the virus at various points during the trial period.\n\nIf things go well, the trial will transition to phase 3, enrolling an additional 1,780 patients for a total of 2,000, Fauci said. These patients -- some of whom are at high-risk for severe illness, including older individuals -- will be monitored to see if the monoclonal antibody treatment reduces the risk of hospitalization and death.\n\nThe treatment is given intravenously and takes about an hour to deliver, the NIH said in a statement.\n\nThough the trial is enrolling nonhospitalized patients, it's possible that these individuals may need hospitalization later on; the trial will determine whether the treatment reduces these odds.\n\nThe second trial, ACTIV-3, will include sicker patients: those who are hospitalized with COVID-19, but do not have end-stage organ failure. Notably, these patients are not sick enough to receive drugs such as remdesivir or dexamethasone, Fauci said. Three hundred patients will initially receive treatment or placebo in the phase 2 trial, and in phase 3, another 700 will be included for a total of 1,000 patients. The goal of the ACTIV-3 trial is to determine whether patients continue to recover for 14 days at home after they are released from the hospital.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nFauci said that results from the trials should be available sometime in October, and if the treatments are shown to be successful, the drug would be available to Americans \"pretty quickly thereafter.\"\n\nDr. Dan Skovronsky, chief scientific officer at Eli Lilly, said that the company is currently working on manufacturing large quantities of the drug, and will have more than 100,000 doses available by the end of the year.\n\nHowever, he noted, \"production capacity for monoclonal antibodies in general is limited in the world,\" and the 100,000 doses is \"still not enough.\"\n\nOn Monday, Eli Lilly announced another phase 3 clinical trial with the same monoclonal antibody candidate. That trial, which will include participants who live and work in nursing homes, aims to determine whether the drug works prophylactically, to prevent coronavirus infection.",

    "U.S. economy gains 1.8 million jobs as recovery loses momentum": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The U.S. economy added 1.763 million jobs in July, adding to economists' fears that the labor market recovery is flagging, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep through large swaths of the country.\n\nThe unemployment rate fell from 11.1 percent to 10.2 percent, according to the monthly jobs report released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n\"We are seeing evidence that the economic recovery is losing steam. It's not reversing, but it looks like growth is flattening out,\" said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor. \"It seems like the recovery has slowed down and appears to be getting stuck in the doldrums.\"\n\nWith millions of Americans still out of work, there is a growing concern that temporary job losses are becoming permanent -- even as the safety net for the jobless is shrinking.\n\n\"Right now we're doing curbside only, so I'm pretty much answering phones,\" said Casey Mason, who was hired in March by a Wilmington, N.C.-area yacht club to manage events. \"I started only to be shut down and then be laid off twice,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm only down to two weeks left of my unemployment,\" Mason said, but she added that she was reluctant to look for another job because her hourly wages at the club were higher than what she could earn elsewhere.\n\n\"Regular minimum wage is $2.13 for servers,\" she said. \"When I came to college here and started bartending, the pay was $2.13 an hour. And that was 30 years ago. So unless you have customers, you can't live.\"\n\nA new analysis by the California Policy Lab found that a staggering 57 percent of people who filed for unemployment in the state since the pandemic began have subsequently either lost their jobs again or had their hours slashed.\n\nTill von Wachter, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who co-authored the analysis, said the second wave of layoffs was concentrated in leisure and hospitality, retail and healthcare and social services -- all industries that have been hard-hit by the coronavirus, and which provide employment for financially vulnerable populations.\n\n\"That also tells us about who's being affected by these repeated layoffs,\" he said. \"These sectors predominantly hire women, younger workers, lower educated workers, Hispanic and Black workers. Many of these workers have very low earnings and very low benefits,\" he added.\n\nWithin the ranks of the jobless, von Wachter said systemic racial disparities are rising to the fore. And many, he predicted, face an acute financial crisis with the expiration of the expanded $600 weekly unemployment benefits.\n\n\"We broke it out by race and it's clear that those expectations are always lower for Blacks. They either don't expect to be recalled or they work for businesses that are less likely to be reopened or that are generally less likely to recall workers.\"\n\nThe end of aid to small businesses is equally worrisome.\n\n\"We found about 12 percent of businesses that had been closed and reopened had been asked to re-close. It's not a small number,\" said Eric Groves, co-founder and CEO of small business tech firm Alignable.\n\nWith the Paycheck Protection Program and other aid funding drying up, Groves said he feared the situation would get worse for small businesses. \"In late June, we found that the number of people who reported they were going to be out of cash within a month was going to be close to 50 percent. Among the ones who didn't receive PPP funds, it was closer to 69 percent.\"\n\nThe unpredictable trajectory of the disease is another powerful force interrupting people's ability to get -- and keep -- employment, and some families have seen their fortunes reverse with devastating speed.\n\nAs recently as March, Alexis Hlavacek thought her family's finances were finally going to improve. Her husband Andrew's nursing background had yielded multiple job offers at hospitals in the Phoenix area where the family lives, but those offers were rescinded when both employers implemented hiring freezes in the early days of the pandemic.\n\nHlavacek, who suffers from an autoimmune disorder, is a stay-at-home mom to the couple's two children. When her husband finally landed a new job in July, it was on the front lines of a rapidly swelling health crisis, she said. Within days, he was sent home with COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nDelays in obtaining test results and his short employment tenure have stymied the family's ability to get any kind of financial relief.\n\n\"He's on a probation period of 30 days for anything he'd get, benefit-wise. He hasn't been able to get into any of the unemployment or CARES Act stuff,\" Hlavacek said, adding that she resorted to setting up a GoFundMe to try and defray some of the family's bills.\n\n\"At this point, we're behind three months on the mortgage, we're behind three months on our power and water, we owe registrations for our car so we have no tags... At this point we probably owe pretty close to 10 grand.\"\n\nEconomists fear these kinds of stories will only become more common. \"Already we know that in the U.S., there's a large group of families living on very low income, and these low wage jobs lead to uncertain lives,\" von Wachter said.\n\nThese households risk losing what precarious financial stability they do have the longer the Congressional stalemate drags on -- and minority.\n\n\"The share of workers reporting that they expect to be recalled just continues to drop,\" he said.",

The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Notre Dame converted to virtual learning after an influx of new cases within a few weeks of students' returns.\n\nProfessors told NBC News' Social Newsgathering team last month that they held serious anxieties about returning to in-person learning amid the pandemic. Laura Crary, an art history professor at a liberal arts college in South Carolina, told NBC News that she is a single parent who also cares for her parents.\n\n\"All it's gonna take is one really bad case -- student, faculty or staff -- and the whole house of cards is going to come crashing down,\" Crary said. \"And I don't want that case to be me.\"\n\nThe response to the pandemic has also been heavily politicized as the virus becomes a dominant issue in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election. Both parties mentioned the pandemic during the conventions earlier this month, though the candidates offered dueling perspectives on the matter.\n\nPresident Donald Trump boasted of the country's response in his speech during the Republican National Convention just days ago, claiming that scientists would have a vaccine by the end of the year. He offered no evidence to support the statement.\n\nFour vaccine candidates are in clinical trials in the United States, with one from Moderna being furthest along, but it's impossible to know whether they will prove effective, according to NBC News' fact check.\n\nJoe Biden, former vice president and the Democratic nominee for president, called the U.S. response to the virus \"the worst performance of any nation on Earth\" at the Democratic National Convention.\n\n\"The president keeps telling us the virus is going to disappear,\" Biden said in his address. \"He keeps waiting for a miracle. Well I have news for him, no miracle is coming.\"\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, some have said that mixed messages from the federal government and its agencies on safety guidance have hurt Americans.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance that states that healthy people who have been exposed to COVID-19 \"do not necessarily need a test,\" as long as they don't have symptoms. Previously, guidance suggested testing for all close contacts of infected individuals because asymptomatic carriers could still spread the virus.\n\nA spokesperson for National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, led by infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, told NBC News that Fauci had some concerns about the new guidance.\n\nDr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department for Health and Human Services, told reporters that the decision to change the testing guidance came Thursday, Aug. 20, the day Fauci had surgery to remove a noncancerous polyp on his vocal cords.\n\n\"Now reading them carefully, he has some concern that the revised guidelines could be interpreted as lessening the importance of asymptomatic spread of virus in the community,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe CDC's director, Dr. Robert Redfield, walked back the guidance on Thursday and said that \"all close contacts of confirmed or probable COVID-19 patients\" may consider testing.",

    "Why did the FDA authorize convalescent plasma, a potential treatment for COVID-19?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Trump administration's announcement Sunday of an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma left critical questions about the potential COVID-19 treatment unanswered.\n\nWhich patients will benefit? When should doctors administer the plasma? What is the correct dosage? And perhaps most crucial: Does it even work?\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nOnly randomized clinical trials, which compare a treatment to a placebo and are considered the gold standard of medical evidence, can provide answers. Now that the Food and Drug Administration has given the antibody-rich plasma emergency use authorization, or EUA, will patients be motivated to participate in such trials, in which they might not receive the real plasma?\n\n\"Investigators have had challenges enrolling patients to begin with, and this announcement will make it even harder, if not impossible,\" said Dr. Howard Koh, a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health who was assistant secretary of health and human services for health in the administration of President Barack Obama.\n\n\"It's a disservice, actually,\" Koh added.\n\nIn a livestreamed interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said Monday: \"The FDA's job is to license and, in this case, approve products that have shown to work and have shown to be safe. It's likely that plasma, for the most part, has been shown to be safe. But you have to show that it works. If you look at the data, they haven't proven that it works.\"\n\nConvalescent plasma is the antibody-rich blood product taken from patients who have recovered from COVID-19. In theory, infusing a sick patient with the antibodies would boost the person's immune system to fight off the virus.\n\nStudies have shown that convalescent plasma for COVID-19 is generally safe. And while other studies have hinted that the treatment shows promise, they aren't definitive answers about whether it's effective.\n\n\"Without data from clinical trials, we will not know if convalescent plasma works,\" Gregg Gonsalves, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine, wrote in an email. \"That's why we do trials, to keep from fooling ourselves.\"\n\nEven the FDA's guidance for the authorization acknowledged that more clinical trials are needed to determine whether convalescent plasma is effective, and it went on to say that the treatment shouldn't be considered a new standard of care for the disease.\n\n\"Given that the clinical evidence supporting this EUA was not obtained from prospective, well-controlled randomized clinical trials (RCTs), additional RCTs are needed. Convalescent plasma should not be considered a new standard of care for the treatment of patients with COVID-19,\" said the guidance, which was obtained by NBC News.\n\nHowever, during Sunday's announcement, President Donald Trump and the FDA's commissioner, Dr. Stephen Hahn, struck a different tone, saying the treatment has been shown to reduce mortality by 35 percent.\n\nThe statistic comes from a preliminary study of convalescent plasma from the Mayo Clinic. It was published online on the preprint server medRxiv and has not undergone peer review.\n\nAmong a subset of patients, those who received plasma with a higher level of COVID-19 antibodies were about a third less likely to have died within seven days, compared with those who received plasma with a lower level.\n\nThe study did not compare patients who received plasma to a control group who received a placebo.\n\nStill, Dr. Michael Joyner of the Mayo Clinic, who is leading the nation's expanded access program, which has allowed more than 70,000 COVID-19 patients to receive convalescent plasma, said the findings \"certainly meet the threshold\" for an emergency use authorization.\n\nThe FDA grants EUAs only during public health emergencies, and it allows a temporary use of unapproved medical products. Outside public health emergencies, medical products must go through the standard FDA approval process.\n\nWith an EUA for convalescent plasma, Joyner said, the Mayo Clinic's program will move to the FDA, and federal regulators will oversee how it is distributed.\n\nWhile it's expected that the EUA will cut down on paperwork physicians need to fill out to get the plasma for patients, it doesn't necessarily mean plasma will be widely available or easily accessible.\n\nFirst, the treatment relies on donors. Second, the EUA guidance for physicians says the plasma must contain \"high antibody titers,\" meaning high concentrations of COVID-19 antibodies. Not all plasma donors have high antibody titers.\n\nIt's unclear what might happen with plasma that's donated with lower titers. Again, only randomized clinical trials would be able to answer that question.\n\nDr. Todd Rice, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, was chosen to lead a federally funded, large-scale, randomized, controlled trial of convalescent plasma in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"We have found that people who have more severe symptoms tend to have higher concentrations\" of antibodies, Rice said. He said the trial, which is expected to enroll up to 1,000 patients, is expected to continue despite the EUA. But it's unclear whether efficacy data for plasma as a treatment will be available before a vaccine is approved.\n\n\"The fact is that our way out of this pandemic is with the vaccine,\" Rice said. \"The sooner we get a vaccine, the better off all of us are going to be.\"\n\nBut Sunday's news conference also sparked worry among scientists about political pressure on the FDA to rush the authorization of a vaccine.\n\n\"What you saw yesterday was the FDA being bullied by the president of the United States into approving something they didn't want to approve earlier because he wanted them to do that,\" Offit said.\n\nKoh said: \"We have to demand the highest level of rigorous science to guide these decisions. The health of a world is at stake.\"",

    "With largest share of migrant nurses, entire U.S. Filipino community hit hard by COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As of Aug. 24, at least 193 registered nurses in the U.S. have died of COVID-19 and related complications. Of those, about 30 percent were Filipino.\n\nAccording to National Nurses United, Filipinos account for 4 percent of registered nurses across the U.S. In California, they constitute nearly 18 percent of registered nurses. And the group has been hit hard by COVID-19.\n\nData compiled by National Nurses United found that as of Monday, at least 193 registered nurses in the U.S. have died of COVID-19 and related complications. The number is based on media reports, social media posts and obituaries, but the group says it's likely to be an undercount because many deaths aren't publicly reported. Of those, about 30 percent were Filipino.\n\n\"That's relatively high, knowing that only 4 percent of U.S. nurses are Filipino,\" said Zenei Cortez, president of National Nurses United and the California Nurses Association.\n\nCortez, who immigrated to the United States from the Philippines in 1974, attributes the deaths to several factors, specifically the shortage of personal protective equipment, raising nurses' risk of contracting COVID-19.\n\nShe also noted a lack of testing among front-liners: A survey conducted by National Nurses United found that 77 percent of nurses aren't being tested for COVID-19.\n\nIt's an experience Cortez endured after she requested a test from her employer when she developed a sore throat and a fever. Because she had only a few symptoms, her request was declined.\n\nA recent survey conducted by the University of California, Davis' Bulosan Center for Filipino Studies also revealed low rates of testing in the community, research director Roy Taggueg said. He said the reasons for the low rates of testing need more analysis, but he said they're linked to the model minority myth, the perception that all Asian Americans are successful and don't need extra resources.\n\nHe said about 40 percent of respondents reported that either they work in health care or have family members working in health care. And because Filipino Americans often live in multigenerational households, the community's risk of infection is increased.\n\n\"One person might be going out, but they definitely are bringing everything back with them when they come home from work, because they're forced to work out there on the front line,\" he said. \"We're talking about their parents, their kids, all of that. It's a very particular position to be in, and it's one that I think is unique to the Filipino and Filipino American community.\"\n\nAlexander Adia, a co-founder of and researcher with the Brown University Philippine Health Initiative for Research, Service, and Training, said that the effects of COVID-19 on Filipino Americans weren't unpredictable but that they were masked because of the aggregated collection of health data.\n\nData from American Public Media Research show that Blacks and Native Americans have suffered the highest rates of COVID-19-related deaths, while Pacific Islanders and Latinos have recently had their highest spikes in numbers of deaths. Meanwhile, Asian Americans, who account for 5.7 percent of the U.S. population, represent 4.2 percent of COVID-19-related deaths.\n\nBut in California, where Filipino Americans are about 25 percent of the state's Asian population, they represent at least 35 percent of coronavirus deaths in that group, according to data compiled by the Los Angeles Times.\n\nResearch by the Bulosan Center found that Filipino Americans are also more vulnerable to COVID-19 because of factors like the community's undocumented population, economic insecurity, lack of health insurance and high rates of pre-existing conditions.\n\nA study published this year by researchers at Brown University and UCLA highlighted that among some Asian subgroups, Filipinos appeared to be in the worst health, with a greater prevalence of high blood pressure, asthma and heart disease.\n\nWhile Filipino Americans' diet and lifestyle have been cited as the culprits, structural factors are also linked to those health behaviors, Adia said.\n\nFilipino Americans who work in health care, for instance, may have long commutes, stand on their feet for lengthy shifts and return home to care for members of multigenerational households, leaving little time and energy to exercise or cook healthy food, he said.\n\n\"The commentary on being sedentary and eating a high-fat, high-caloric diet -- these are products of stress. You don't have to be Filipino American to stress eat. But if Filipino Americans are bearing a lot of these stressors, then it's of course going to result in behaviors like that,\" Adia said.\n\nGiven the disparities, Taggueg said, it's crucial that information about COVID-19 is disseminated in a culturally sensitive way.",
