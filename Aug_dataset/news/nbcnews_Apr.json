    "\"You may have been exposed to the virus\": What to expect when a contact tracer calls you": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Legion of contact tracers work to track coronavirus cases and prevent spread\n\nFrom San Francisco to Massachusetts, local and state health departments across the country have begun rolling out efforts to stem the spread of the coronavirus by tracing the contacts of those who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease it causes.\n\nThe initiative, known as contact tracing, aims to first locate the infected person, log where they went and with whom they've been in contact, then follow up with those contacts to see how they are feeling, if they have been tested and to determine if they should quarantine.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe desired outcome: break the chains of transmission of the contagious disease, empower health departments to know where it resides in a community, and ultimately, use that knowledge to know where and in what capacity to lift isolation orders and reopen the economy.\n\nWhile contact tracing on a national level could cost in the billions of dollars and require hiring more than 100,000 people, public health experts say it's an important step, along with increased testing, to stopping the spread of the virus. To accomplish this, a combination of interviewing the infected -- whether by telephone, text or a mobile app -- and technology, including using smartphones, to track and monitor people will be needed.\n\nSan Francisco plans to use a workforce of 140 people, including medical students from the University of California, San Francisco, librarians and staff from the city attorney's office, to go through lists of people who have tested positive for the virus and interview them. Such laborious sleuthing has been done in the past to understand outbreaks of HIV, sexually transmitted diseases and other respiratory illnesses, including SARS.\n\nAs the 15th-largest city in the United States, with more than 880,000 residents, San Francisco currently has more than 1,100 COVID-19 cases and recorded at least 20 deaths as of Monday, comparatively lower numbers that reflect what officials say has been a \"flattening of the curve.\"\n\nEvery clinician in the city who cares for someone with COVID-19 and every laboratory that processes a positive test must report the case to the Department of Public Health, which is how San Francisco is building out its database of contacts.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe city's health department is employing software developed by Dimagi, a Massachusetts-based tech company. The firm says its real-time tool isn't tracking people through Bluetooth technology, as tech giants are proposing to do, but rather allows the contact tracers to follow a set of prompts during interviews and keep a queue of cases and the status for each.\n\nThe city's public health director, Dr. Grant Colfax, said that participation in contact tracing is voluntary and no one will be asked about their immigration status or for their Social Security number or bank details. While English and Spanish language options are available, he added that the system would also include Cantonese, Mandarin and Tagalog.\n\nWhile contact tracing will vary depending on one's local or state health departments, San Francisco's program is being eyed as a blueprint for other places ramping up the effort.\n\nContact tracers typically begin their work with a \"pending first case.\" The case is based on someone who tested positive for COVID-19 and provided the information of others they've identified being in contact with, which usually starts with a family member, roommate or partner.\n\nThe tracer attempts contact, usually by telephone, and will tell them, \"You are being called because you have been identified as a close contact to a person with a confirmed novel coronavirus infection. Do you know who that person might be? If so, please state their name.\"\n\nIf the contact does not know the name of the positive case on file, then the tracer must explain that \"nonetheless, we would like to ask you some questions since we think you may have been exposed to the virus.\"\n\nTo protect privacy, the contact is not told the name of the person who tested positive, although they usually have an idea of who the person is, Dr. Michael Reid, an infectious disease specialist in San Francisco who is running the contact tracing program, said.\n\nThe tracer then asks a series of demographic-related questions, including date of birth, preferred language, race and if they live with the person who tested positive. The tracer also asks if they've been tested for COVID-19, and if not, do they require help in getting a test, their occupation and what their living situation is: Do they reside in a single-family home or an apartment complex, homeless shelter or are incarcerated?\n\nKnowing a person's living situation is important so that the city can determine if they need resources to find an appropriate place to quarantine, Luc\u00eda Abascal, a contact tracer in San Francisco, said during a recent demonstration of the tool for reporters.\n\nTracers also assess a contact's current health, checking for physical symptoms, including shortness of breath, a sore threat and cough, if they're immunocompromised, which puts them at a higher risk, and if they have any underlying health conditions.\n\nA clinician would follow up with a person who is classified as high risk in seven to 14 days.\n\nTracers then ask for details about a person's potential exposure with the positive case. If the patient shows no symptoms, they will still be asked to quarantine for 14 days if they haven't started already.\n\nTracers inquire if the person has enough food and medication for those two weeks, and if not, they will be referred to the health department for help.\n\nThe contact can consent to receiving daily text messages, and they are then put into the system as either high or low risk. Any contact who yields a positive test result would then be followed up with to provide contacts whom they may have potentially exposed.\n\nFor San Francisco, Reid said, the \"ambitious goal\" is to create a case file for everyone who tests positive and build out their contacts from there.\n\n\"If we ever want to move beyond shelter-in-place,\" he told reporters, \"we have to accurately capture all of that contact information.\"",

    "'A race against time': Results expected soon on experimental coronavirus drug": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A sealed glass capsule of the drug remdesivir during a news conference at the University Hospital Eppendorf in Hamburg, Germany, on April 8, 2020.Ulrich Perrey / Pool via Reuters\n\nThe results of a highly anticipated study on an experimental coronavirus treatment for the sickest patients are expected any day.\n\nPhysicians leading the clinical trial for the drug, called remdesivir, say the fast-moving pandemic has compelled them to work with haste, all without compromising the scientific rigor necessary to prove whether the drug really works.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"We are in a race against time,\" Dr. Andre Kalil, a principal investigator for the trial at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, told NBC News. \"We're doing everything we can 24/7 to make this happen.\"\n\nPrevious research hinted at the promise of remdesivir, an antiviral drug that's thought to work by blocking the virus from replicating itself in the body. But those studies were either based on animal data or had major caveats, such as lacking a control group.\n\nA study published earlier this month in the New England Journal of Medicine found the drug improved breathing in some patients, but the study was small, with just 53 patients. And its authors did not compare their patients' outcomes with a control group of patients to know for sure whether the improvements were truly due to remdesivir, or whether they would have become better on their own, without treatment.\n\nThe ongoing clinical trial at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, in partnership with dozens of other sites globally, does have a control group.\n\nThe trial is sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. Gilead Sciences, which developed the drug, is also involved. Stock trading was briefly halted Thursday for Gilead, after a draft report said remdesivir disappointed in a recent drug trial in China. The ongoing trial at the University of Nebraska is unrelated to the trial in China.\n\n\"This is something that we have to do as perfectly as possible,\" Kalil said. \"You have to have reliable data. It's the soul of the whole study.\"\n\nResearchers must also carefully scrutinize any side effects that may be associated with the drug. Mild to moderate liver function abnormalities have been noted previously.\n\nIf remdesivir proves to be safe and effective against the coronavirus, Kalil said the trial will pivot to studying other drugs. The investigators would use remdesivir as the control, and see how well other drugs compare.\n\nOne treatment on deck is called baricitinib, an anti-inflammatory medication used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n\"There is hope that this medication can bring down inflammation and help prevent the spread of the virus from one cell to another,\" Kalil said.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nA drug that can reduce inflammation may be key. The immune system naturally sends inflammatory chemicals to the site of an injury or infection in an attempt to fight it. But sometimes the immune system overreacts and fires off far too many, damaging otherwise healthy tissue.\n\nResearchers are attempting to find the sweet spot of such inflammation -- prompting the immune system enough to fight off the virus, but not overdo it.\n\nClinical trials for other treatments for COVID-19, the illness that results from the novel coronavirus, have also begun.\n\nDrugmaker Alexion Pharmaceuticals has begun studies of Soliris (eculizumab), which is an immunosuppressant. And Roche is studying its arthritis drug, called Actemra (tocilizumab).\n\nAnother drug that has received attention is hydroxychloroquine, used to treat malaria. Trials studying the drug are underway, but the drug has not shown significant benefit so far in early studies.\n\nIndeed, newly released COVID-19 treatment guidelines from a panel of experts within the National Institutes of Health declined to recommend any treatment -- including remdesivir and hydroxychloroquine -- for routine use because the scientific data aren't available yet.\n\n\"At present, no drug has been proven to be safe and effective for treating COVID-19. There are insufficient data to recommend either for or against the use of any antiviral or immunomodulatory therapy in patients with COVID-19 who have mild, moderate, severe, or critical illness,\" the panel wrote online.\n\nProof that a treatment works for COVID-19 would be a \"game changer,\" Dr. Michael Saag, associate dean for global health at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said. Saag is not involved with any of the treatment trials.\n\n\"Once we know that, then we could mass produce it and have it available for every single person who starts showing symptoms, and then get it to them as soon as possible,\" he said.",

        "body": "\"It's not easy losing her mother and father, and she had high hopes her brother would recover,\" a cousin of Violeta Mayorga said.\n\nFamily and friends have been rallying to support and raise funds for a Miami woman as she lives through the unthinkable -- her father, mother and her older brother died as a result of COVID-19.\n\nVioleta Tita Mayorga, the Nicaraguan family's only survivor, is currently in isolation as she recovers from the illness. The family lived together, along with Violeta's eight-year-old son. She sent him to live with his father when the adults started getting ill.\n\nMayorga's cousin, Francisco Qui\u00f1onez, said she is \"devastated.\"\n\n\"It is not easy to lose your mom, dad and the one you had high hopes for, your brother,\" he said, explaining that Mayorga thought her brother would recover from the illness.\n\nAccording to family members, the son, Mario Mayorga Jr., 42, started feeling ill around mid-March. He was an operations manager for Roger's Cleaning Service, which cleans Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach.\n\nHis parents and sister then began to show symptoms and were admitted to a hospital in Kendall, south of Miami.\n\nThe first to lose the battle against the disease was the father, Mario Mayorga Tuckler, 72, who died April 10, the same day that Violeta was discharged. Nine days later, the mother, Esperanza Tapia, also 72, died.\n\nBoth parents had been teachers in the city of Masaya, in western Nicaragua, on the edge of the country's Masaya volcano. The couple immigrated to the United States in the 1980s and settled in South Florida.\n\n\"They were well loved in the Nicaraguan community and among their former students, and everyone noted the love they had for each other,\" Marcela Lastre, the couple's niece, said. The couple would have soon celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary.\n\nA few days after the mother's death, on April 26, Mario Mayorga Jr. died in intensive care -- the same hospital that his company cleaned.\n\nVioleta remains in isolation but has already tested negative for the virus in her latest tests, so she hopes to at least be able to reunite soon with her child.\n\nFriends and family started an online fundraiser to support her and her extended relatives with funeral expenses.\n\nIn the United States, over 1.1 million people have been infected with COVID-19 and at least 68,000 people have died. Florida has more than 36,000 cases and at least 1,399 deaths have been reported. Latinos, as well as African Americans, are among the groups hit the hardest by the pandemic.",

He spent eight days in the intensive care unit before doctors said he was well enough to go home.\n\nYo appeared on \"The Wendy Williams Show\" on Monday to give an update on his recovery, saying he is still having some breathing issues.\n\n\"I feel good now,\" he said via a video interview. \"I'm about 85 percent better. But at times, like right now, I still have to think to kind of catch my breath.\"\n\nThe actor, 45, said he started to feel sick about a week and a half after returning from a trip to New York. His symptoms began with a fever and then one day he woke up and \"couldn't breathe that well,\" Yo told Williams.\n\nHis wife called 911 to have him taken to the hospital.\n\n\"I got there and the doctor looked at me after they took my lung X-ray and I said, 'How's it gonna be? Am I gonna be OK?' And he goes, 'Well, we'll know in two days. It's gonna go really good or really bad,'\" Yo said.\n\nThe actor said while he was hospitalized he experienced headaches that \"felt like a migraine, times a million\" and had fever, chills and body aches. His fever climbed up to 103.5, he said.\n\nYo told Williams that he lost 13 pounds because he couldn't eat. \"It is the worst pain,\" he said.\n\nOne of the hardest things to deal with while hospitalized was seeing other sick patients die alone, Yo said.\n\n\"That was the worst thing,\" he said, encouraging people to wear masks. \"If you're walking around without a mask, you could be risking somebody's life in your family or somebody else's. And no one, no one Wendy, deserves to die alone.\"\n\nWilliams, who has been filming her talk show from home, got emotional and started to cry, saying the thought of someone dying alone \"is unbearable.\"\n\nIn his March 30 video, Yo thanked everyone for their support.\n\n\"I appreciate all the love, the prayers, man. It meant a lot. While I was in the hospital getting better, I was looking at the Ring cam and I saw a bunch of friends drop out stuff at the house for my family and that meant so much,\" he said, wiping away tears.\n\nAs of April 14, more than 580,000 cases have been confirmed in the U.S., based on NBC News reporting.",

Neither she nor her firefighter husband, Ebbie, have tested positive.\n\n\"This is something that has gotten out of hand, and we need to do something about it, and that's the reason why we're doing this interview,\" Ebbie Herbert said. \"To let people know that it doesn't matter what age you are, it's coming for you.\"\n\nAt first, Skylar's symptoms seemed more like strep throat, her mother said. The coronavirus never crossed their minds.\n\n\"She was being herself -- eating, drinking, playing for, like, the first couple of days,\" LaVondria Herbert said. \"But on that fourth day, she started complaining about the headache. And the fever -- I just couldn't break the fever.\"\n\nSkylar's oxygen levels were fine, and she didn't display any signs of respiratory distress, but she was diagnosed with a rare form of meningitis due to complications from COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus.

They were crying, too. It's hard on everybody.\"\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has received backlash from some conservatives over public health restrictions in the state, but the Herberts said they appreciate everything she's done to try to keep people safe.\n\n\"When you're dealing with a virus like this, we're learning, and even now,\" Ebbie Herbert said. \"It doesn't care what color you are. It doesn't care about your nationality. It doesn't care about your political preference.

She'll miss the mornings when she woke up to Skylar's kisses and her saying, \"I love you.\"\n\n\"She'd just climb in the bed, step on your back,\" LaVondria Herbert said. \"She was just, she would do so many things.

    "'We owe you,' Joe Biden tells meat processing and essential workers during a Latino town hall": {

        "body": "A worker hands off meat products to a customer at a grocery store in Dallas on April 29, 2020.LM Otero / AP\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, trying to amp up his Latino support, sent a message to essential workers, particularly those in meat processing plants, saying \"we owe you\" and stressing they deserve additional pay, protective equipment and coronavirus testing priority.\n\nBiden shared screen time with the children of meat processing plant workers who are infected with coronavirus and have brought their infections home from work. The virtual town hall was organized by the League of United Latin American Citizens, known as LULAC, one of the nation's oldest Latino civil rights organizations.\n\n\"These stories are heartwrenching,\" the former vice president said, after the young Latinos told their stories. \"There's nothing worse than worrying about a family member whether they're going to make it or not -- it's not a whole lot worse than ending up in the morning and knowing your son or daughter is in a war zone,\" said Biden, whose son Beau, who died of brain center, had served in Iraq. \"They basically are in war zones.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump used the Defense Production Act to compel meat processing facilities to stay open and to keep shelves stocked with meat, despite coronavirus outbreaks and deaths of plant workers. He has assured the companies protection from liability and his administration has said it would work with the Labor Department to keep workers safe.\n\nSome plants have closed temporarily following the deaths of workers. Workers have complained of being provided little protection in the facilities that require shoulder-to-shoulder work, of having no sick leave and of not getting information about the virus in languages other than English, among other issues that have been raised. Unions and advocacy groups have been pushing for better protections for workers as cases continue to rise.\n\nEdgar Ramirez, 27, said his father, Edgardo, who worked at a meatpacking plant in Iowa, is on a ventilator \"fighting for his life\". According to LULAC, his father started having symptoms, but thought they were allergies.\n\nAt the time, his employers were only taking temperatures and had not fully implemented CDC guidelines, LULAC stated. Although Edgar urged his father not to work, his father said the company wanted him to continue.\n\nRamirez, who works for the Center for Health Equity Transformation at Northwestern University, said his father brought the virus home and now his mother and younger sister are ill.\n\n\"My mother cries every night wondering whether she is going to see my Dad again. This has caused so much trauma to the Latino community especially, but also to immigrant communities across the country,\" Ramirez said. \"There's all these health inequities that exist, that have existed before this pandemic.\"\n\nBiden said the country can afford to tack another $13 hourly on to the pay of front line workers, including those in meat processing plants, who must work during the pandemic. He also said that regardless of immigration status, plant workers should get paid sick leave and free COVID-19 treatment, as well as be able to join unions and be shielded from deportation when they report an illness.\n\n\"This is the case I've been trying to make and so have my colleagues in the House, trying to make to people who have no idea of what this is about, who get advised on some of Trump's malarkey about immigrants are the problem,\" Biden said. \"They need the immigrant population ... and they should be treated with dignity and fairness.\"\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., chairwoman of the House Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on immigration and citizenship, said it is \"ridiculous that the president is ordering undocumented individuals into these hazardous plants, while denying them assistance, access to health care and letting them live in fear of the immigration enforcement.\"\n\nLofgren said Judiciary Committee Democrats are pushing a proposal for providing temporary protected status to the workers, Further details were not immediately available from her office.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, said with the executive order to keep the plants open, Trump could give Temporary Protected Status to the undocumented people who work in the facilities.\n\n\"That would send a strong signal that not only are you protecting a vital part of our economy, but we value what you are doing too,\" Thompson said. But he tempered hopes that such action would be taken, saying the Democrats and worker advocates pushing for such change \"would be the last people that President Trump would listen to.\"\n\nMonday's LULAC town hall followed an online \"Todos Con Biden\" (\"Everyone with Biden\") panel that his campaign held over the weekend. It featured civil rights and labor leader Dolores Huerta, actor and activist John Leguizamo, former Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Rep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas.\n\nBiden did not join in that conversation, but the two events served as a counterpoint to the Trump campaign's Latino outreach that among other things, has emphasized the community's low unemployment before the pandemic and entrepreneurship among Latinos.\n\nThe panel countered that the Trump administration had instead eroded Americans' safety net, including healthcare access, that could have been helped families as they lose jobs and the economy takes a hit during the pandemic.\n\nHuerta, 90, who coined the slogan \"S\u00ed, Se Puede,\" later translated to \"Yes, We Can,\" endorsed Biden last week, adding him to the list of Democratic presidential candidates she has backed and campaigned for during several decades.\n\n\"We can mobilize our Latino community,\" said Huerta, who co-founded the United Farm Workers. \"With our numbers we can be deciders. We have to make sure to do the work to get Joe Biden elected...Si, se puede.\"",

        "body": "Demonstrators hold a \"Rolling Car Rally\" in front of Democratic Governor Ned Lamont's residence while protesting the state's stay-at-home order to combat the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on May 4, 2020 in Hartford, Conn.John Moore / Getty Images\n\nAt the end of another long shift treating coronavirus patients, Dr. Hadi Halazun opened his Facebook page to find a man insisting to him that \"no one's dying\" and that the coronavirus is \"fake news\" drummed up by the news media.\n\nHadi tried to engage and explain his first-hand experience with the virus. In reply, another user insinuated he wasn't a real doctor, saying that pictures from his profile showing him at concerts and music festivals proved it.\n\n\"I told them: 'I am a real doctor. There are 200 people in my hospital's ICU,'\" said Halazun, a cardiologist in New York. \"And they said, 'Give me your credentials.' I engaged with them, and they kicked me off their wall.\"\n\n\"I left work and I felt so deflated. I let it get to me.\"\n\nHalazun, like many health care professionals, is dealing with a bombardment of misinformation and harassment from conspiracy theorists, some of whom have moved beyond posting online to pressing doctors for proof of the severity of the pandemic.\n\nAnd it's taking a toll. Hazalun said that dealing with conspiracy theorists is the \"second-most painful thing I've had to deal with, other than separation of families from their loved one.\"\n\nSeveral other doctors shared similar experiences, saying that they regularly had to treat patients who had sought care too late because of conspiracy theories spread on social media, and that social media companies have to do more to counteract the forces that spread lies for profit.\n\nDr. Duncan Maru, a physician and epidemiologist in Queens, New York, said he had heard from colleagues that a young patient had come into the emergency room last week with damage to his intestinal tract after ingesting bleach. The incident occurred just days after President Donald Trump suggested that \"injection\" of disinfectants should be researched as a potential coronavirus treatment.\n\n\"Folks delaying seeking care or, taking the most extreme case, somebody drinking bleach as a result of structural factors just underlines the fact that we have not protected the public from disinformation,\" Maru said.\n\nThe structural factors, in this case, include Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, which have struggled to contain the spread of misinformation, some of it coming from positions of authority.\n\nSocial networks have taken a variety of steps in recent weeks to thwart misinformation, such as providing dedicated portals for vetted information from public health officials and banning content related to conspiracy theories around 5G wireless technology.\n\nDespite those efforts, the distribution networks built up in recent years by fringe media personalities and activists on tech platforms and through websites have proven resilient.\n\nWhitney Phillips, a professor who studies the spread of disinformation at Syracuse University, said the coronavirus outbreak offers a look at how conspiracy thinking is now, in some ways, more organized.\n\n\"With conspiracy theories, the reason they're impervious to fact-checking is that they have become a way of being in the world for believers,\" Phillips said. \"It isn't just one narrative that you can debunk. It is a holistic way of being in the world that has been reinforced by all the other bulls--- that these platforms have allowed people to consume for years.\"\n\nOrganized harassment campaigns, lies and urban legends targeting doctors are a real-life symptom of what the World Health Organization dubbed the \"infodemic,\" as the coronavirus started to spread throughout the world earlier this year.\n\nHalazun has since stopped engaging with the trolls on Facebook, some of whom claimed that \"the hospitals are empty\" and that the virus was part of a plot to vaccinate or microchip U.S. citizens -- just two of the many conspiracy theories that have swirled around the coronavirus.\n\nBut he was still left with big questions: How can people believe this stuff? And do they understand the algorithms and opportunistic extremists that led them to believe it?\n\n\"It scares me more than anything that there are people who are basically controlled -- and in the same way they feel they're fighting against that control,\" he said. \"They go to YouTube where they're really being controlled, and they don't realize it. That's what's scary.\"\n\nMaru also said he felt that tech platforms need to do more to deal with disinformation, but acknowledged there is no easy fix.\n\n\"I do think it's a monumental task to hold these companies to account, but in the COVID case, they truly have blood on their hands,\" Maru said.\n\nBeyond emergency rooms and internet platforms, there are hints of how far some coronavirus misinformation has spread. Dr. Rajeev Fernando said that when he takes questions about the coronavirus on radio shows, one out of every two callers refers to 5G towers or conspiracy theories about labs in Wuhan.\n\nOn the phone, he said, sometimes they'll listen to reality.\n\n\"Some people have an agenda, and you can't help that,\" Fernando said. \"But for other people, I say, 'Let me try to answer your questions and see why you think this way, and why I think this is an appropriate answer.'\"\n\nStill, Fernando believes social media networks need watchdogs, including physicians, to identify disinformation before it once again becomes a public health crisis.\n\n\"We have to understand these [conspiracy theorists] are criminal organizations which really stop at nothing to get disinformation out,\" Fernando said.\n\nWell-organized, professional disinformation peddlers in the QAnon and anti-vaccination movements have gained new audiences during the coronavirus pandemic by coalescing around two primary boogeymen: Bill Gates and 5G towers.\n\nHalazun heard it all first-hand. He didn't know where it all began, or how to stop it.\n\n\"These anti-vaccination people were telling me I'm a sheep,\" Halazun said. \"Dr. Fauci this, Bill Gates that. And I don't really care what you think about Bill Gates. It doesn't affect me. But it does affect me when they tell me what we're doing is not real, and that the hospitals are really empty. It hurts.\"\n\nIn January, a well-known promoter of QAnon, the baseless conspiracy theory that President Donald Trump is secretly dismantling a pedophile-cannibal cabal that runs the United States government, pushed a conspiracy theory that Gates \"patented\" the coronavirus based on a mischaracterized public patent search.\n\nThe patent was created by a Gates-aligned research institute to research a vaccine, a common practice among researchers, and covered a previous coronavirus, not the one that causes COVID-19.\n\nStill, the tweet helped spark a focus on Gates that has now permeated the various conspiracy theory networks that have developed on the internet in recent years.\n\nThat same QAnon promoter later promoted a diluted form of bleach called \"Miracle Mineral Solution\" as a possible way to kill the coronavirus.\n\nSimilarly, the anti-vaccination movement has pushed a false conspiracy theory that 5G towers are weakening immune systems throughout the world, and that COVID-19 is a cover story for the colossal death tolls around the world.\n\nAfter a prominent anti-vaccination figure posted a video on Instagram of a man alongside a destroyed 5G tower, several arsons were committed on towers across Europe and Canada.\n\nBrian Keeley, a professor at Pitzer College in California who studies why people believe in conspiracy theories, said that some people in times of crisis look to far-fetched ideas with simple answers for complex problems.\n\nProviding a straightforward, extinguishable enemy -- whether it's a well-known celebrity like Gates, or a mysterious concept like the illuminati -- gives conspiracy theorists hope, agency and power in a time of chaos. In reality, those recognizable, often mortal figures are simply a scapegoat for an act of God.\n\n\"People are looking for these kinds of explanations to control something in their lives,\" Keeley said.\n\nKeeley, who's been researching conspiracy theories for over 20 years, said he's abandoned using Facebook because of the \"depression that comes from looking at that.\"\n\n\"It's sort of an informational quarantine,\" he said. \"You don't want to be exposing yourself to a different kind of virus.\"\n\nAfter researching why people believe in these conspiracy theories, Halazun has come to the same conclusion: Right now, it's not worth it for a doctor to spend any time on Facebook.\n\n\"We're limited in our emotional capacity. I'm not going to spend whatever I have left after a long day of work trying to convince a conspiracy theorist,\" Halazun said. \"They're immune to any evidence. You're not going to change their mind.\"\n\nAs Halazun stepped outside after his Facebook experience, he heard the bang of pots and pans and whoops and hollers. It was 7 p.m., and New York City residents were participating in their nightly salute to health care workers on the frontlines of fighting the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I just started crying,\" Halazun said. \"I thought, 'What do I believe here?' It almost made me question myself. Some people are out there who are sitting in their homes, going on these videos and then telling us it's fake while we're saving lives.\"",

    "'What is it about their immune system?' Rare complication seen in some kids with COVID-19.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The vast majority of coronavirus cases in children are mild. But for some, a dangerous complication can emerge.\n\nLast Friday, high school junior Jameela Barber called her teacher in Dallas County, Texas, to apologize for neglecting to turn in her school work.\n\nHer school's principal, Eleanor Webb, said Barber told her teacher she hadn't been feeling well.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"She said, 'As soon as I feel better, because I'm feeling really, really sick, I'm going to turn in my missed assignments,'\" Webb told NBC affiliate station KXAS.\n\nThe next day, Webb said, Barber died of complications from COVID-19. She was 17.\n\nBarber's case is rare; only a handful of pediatric deaths related to the coronavirus have been reported in the United States. However, the exact numbers for kids are hard to pin down: the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NBC News that it does not track COVID-19 deaths in children under age 18 the way it does for the flu.\n\nEarly data on pediatric COVID-19 cases suggested that, for the vast majority of children, the illness is relatively mild.\n\nRecently, however, reports of potential serious complications specific to children have begun to emerge in the U.S. and Europe: A handful of kids have developed dangerous inflammation around the heart and other organs. It's similar to a rare condition called Kawasaki disease, which causes swelling of the coronary arteries, primarily in children.\n\nEfforts to gather data on how the virus affects children are in their early stages. The Pediatric Infectious Diseases Transplant Network, in coordination with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital and other major children's hospitals across the country, have just begun to collect data on kids diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nIt's unclear why most kids appear to be spared. It could be that kids tend not to have the same chronic health problems, such as high blood pressure or Type 2 diabetes, found in the most serious COVID-19 cases in adults.\n\nIt could also be that children's immune systems don't react to this coronavirus infection with the same hyper-inflammatory response that's been documented in adults.\n\n\"This is very perplexing,\" Dr. Adrienne Randolph, a senior critical care physician at Boston Children's Hospital, said. \"What is it about their immune system and their immune reaction to this virus that is making it so they're really not getting sick?\"\n\nRandolph is leading a nationwide research project that aims to figure out why the virus acts differently in kids, and why a few, like Barber, have more serious and even deadly outcomes. The goal is to enroll 800 children and young adults up through age 25.\n\nA large amount of data focusing on COVID-19 risks among young people is important, Randolph said, \"because when a vaccine does become available, it's probably not going to be available for everybody right away.\"\n\nThat is, a vaccine would likely be prioritized for those most at risk for coronavirus complications.\n\nThe handful of children who have developed the Kawasaki-like complication reflect \"a new syndrome,\" said Dr. Jane Burns, director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center at the University of California, San Diego.\n\n\"The way this is affecting the heart is completely different than what we usually see in Kawasaki disease,\" Burns said. \"This is new because this is primarily the heart muscle that is failing,\" adding that it appears the immune system is attacking the heart, as opposed to the coronary arteries.\n\nIt's unclear how many children may have this condition. Doctors at the Columbia University Medical Center in New York reported treating three such cases in children ranging in age from 6 months to 8 years.\n\n\"What we have been seeing [is] there are some children who may have an inflammation of the blood vessels and are developing a toxic shock-like syndrome,\" New York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker said during a news conference Thursday.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nBut it may be too early to link this new type of inflammatory reaction to COVID-19, because only some of the patients have tested positive for the coronavirus infection. A few have tested negative, though they had been exposed to infected family members.\n\nThe development has perplexed physicians, who have scheduled a call with experts from around the globe this weekend to share information about cases.\n\n\"We are scrambling to put together a unified case definition,\" Burns said.\n\nThe World Health Organization is also now \"urgently\" investigating the potential link between this new problem and COVID-19.\n\nUltimately, COVID-19 remains uncommon in children; just 2 percent of kids tested for the coronavirus in the U.S. are positive. By far, most COVID-19 cases -- especially the most severe cases -- have been among adults.\n\nPediatric infectious disease specialists stress complications from the coronavirus are rare in children, a trend that's been observed in other countries, as well.\n\n\"We have data from China, we have data from Italy, and other parts of Europe, as well as now some preliminary data in the United States\" that most pediatric cases appear to range from asymptomatic to mild symptoms, Randolph said.\n\nPeople over age 65 tend to have significantly higher rates of complications and mortality.\n\nDr. Buddy Creech, director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, has noted the same thing.\n\nSymptoms in kids \"seem to consistently be much milder than the adults,\" Creech said. And there's a growing theory that fewer symptoms for a shorter amount of time might indicate kids may not be very good at spreading the virus.\n\n\"It's tempting to hypothesize,\" Creech said, stressing that the theory has not been proven.\n\nBut, he added, \"it would be interesting to at least consider the possibility that kids having milder symptoms and shorter illnesses might actually have fewer days of positive virus that they're shedding from their nose or their throat.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The survivors of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, spoke about their struggles in the hospital, days on ventilators and eventually learning they had recovered.\n\nThey are survivors of severe cases of the coronavirus, most of them had been hospitalized, some of them hooked up to ventilators for several days and none of them ever wanting to experience the misery, uncertainty and loneliness of the illness ever again.\n\n\"It really makes you not take anything for granted anymore, even the small things,\" Leah Blomberg, 35, of Muskego, Wisconsin, said Thursday during a Facebook Live hangout. \"Every moment I get with my husband, I cherish it.\"\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nNBC News spoke with Blomberg and four others who tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, to find out what it was like to have extreme cases and how they've recovered in recent weeks. While the number of infections and deaths continue to grow daily, most people do get better and some may have no symptoms at all.\n\nBut for those who have been hospitalized in intensive care units, the experience can be terrifying -- if they even remember it.\n\nBlomberg said she was put on a ventilator for a total of nine days, leaving her in a medically induced coma.\n\n\"It really is a humbling experience,\" she said of her time in the hospital.\n\nShe added that she was grateful she didn't know beforehand the grim statistics associated with being on a ventilator. One study in the Journal of the American Medical Association that looked at 5,700 coronavirus patients at 12 hospitals in New York City and Long Island found that about 21 percent of patients died, but for the 12 percent who were deemed extremely sick and in need of ventilators, the death rate was 88 percent.\n\nAndrew Coffield, 29, of Aurora, Illinois, said he was on a ventilator for seven days during his 13-day hospitalization. He was told he was unconscious for about five days, and his 2-year-old son would FaceTime with him, saying, \"Daddy, wake up. Daddy, wake up.\"\n\nBut as his situation deteriorated, with his vitals dropping and his fever spiking again, he had a sudden turnaround two days after coming off the ventilator, he said.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"I truly believe that God healed me,\" Coffield said, adding, \"The doctors and the nurses couldn't explain it. ... They just kept coming in and said, 'You're a miracle.'\"\n\nBeing in the hospital away from his family and then recovering at home without touching them were among the loneliest moments of his life, he added.\n\nAnother survivor, Jess Marchbank, 32, of North Devon, England, could relate.\n\nShe said she longed to touch her children, ages 2 and 4, even after she returned home from the hospital, but could not until she was completely virus-free.\n\n\"It's the most loneliest experience I think I will ever go through,\" she said. \"You don't get that contact, that touch, that love and nurture that we need to mentally get better, as well as physically.\"\n\nBut once she was able to hold her family, she said, it was \"so much better than Christmas morning.\"\n\nAll of the survivors say they still feel sapped of energy and wiped out.\n\nAlthough he wasn't hospitalized, Dwight Everett, 65, of Ventura County, California, said he decided to donate plasma after fully recovering as a way to help others afflicted by the disease.\n\nAs a possible treatment for very sick coronavirus patients, some hospitals are testing the injection of a \"convalescent serum\" based on the blood plasma of people who have recovered.\n\nEverett's plasma is going to people like the wife of Luis Meza, of Santa Maria, California. Meza said his wife is in a Los Angeles hospital after contracting the coronavirus from him.\n\nShe remains on a ventilator after 26 days in the hospital, he added.\n\n\"I would do anything to save my wife,\" Meza said of the plasma treatments. \"I'll sell anything I own to save my wife.\"\n\nHe said she has been slowly getting better, but must learn to move her hands and her legs again after the virus ravaged her body.\n\nThe idea that some people still don't take the coronavirus seriously or aren't following social distancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders is upsetting for him and the other survivors.\n\nBlomberg added that protesters have the right to demonstrate, but they're putting others at risk.\n\n\"A lot of the reasons that people are protesting are so shallow. 'I want a haircut. I want to get my nails done.' Really?\" Blomberg said. \"I can understand the small-business owners are hurting. But I'm sure that when the medical community has cleared things and say we're OK to go back to begin opening things up again, I'm sure our communities will rally around their small businesses and help bring them back.\"",

    "4 Georgia poultry workers dead from coronavirus, company says": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAVANNAH, Ga. -- Four employees of a major poultry producer's operations in rural southwest Georgia have died after becoming infected with the coronavirus, a company spokesman said Friday.\n\nTyson Foods spokesman Gary Mickelson said three of the employees worked at the company's chicken processing plant in Camilla, while the fourth person worked in a supporting job outside the plant. He declined to say how many workers there have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus.\n\nAmerican workers who process the nation's meat have proven especially susceptible to the new virus, as they work shoulder-to-shoulder on production lines. Several U.S. plants have closed because of outbreaks, including a large plant owned by Smithfield Foods in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, that produced roughly 5% of U.S. pork before it was shut down after more than 500 workers became infected.\n\nMickelson said two other Tyson Foods workers have died from the virus at its plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa.\n\n\"We realize everyone is anxious during this challenging time and believe information is the best tool for combating the virus,\" Hector Gonzalez, Tyson's senior vice president for human resources, said in a statement. \"That's why we're encouraging our team members to share their concerns with us, so we can help address them.\"\n\nGonzalez said the company has improved safety measures at the Camilla plant by checking employees' temperatures, requiring workers to wear face coverings, installing dividers at work stations and providing more space in break rooms. He said the company in March had \"relaxed our attendance policy to encourage workers to stay at home when they're sick.\"\n\nThe Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which represents 2,000 workers at the Georgia chicken plant, identified the three plant employees who died as women who had worked there for 13 to 35 years. A statement from the union said many plant employees are \"sick or in quarantine.\"\n\n\"It's too little too late here,\" Edgar Fields, president of the union's Southeast Council, said in a statement Friday.\n\nIn Georgia's rural southwest corner, where the Camilla plant is located, the rate of coronavirus infections and deaths have outpaced far more densely populated regions of the state. The union said many plant employees live in neighboring Dougherty County, which leads Georgia with 88 coronavirus deaths.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that usually clear up within weeks. For some, it can cause severe illness and be life-threatening.\n\nThe union has called on poultry processors to require employees to quarantine themselves for 14 days, and pay them sick leave, when they're exposed to co-workers testing positive for the virus. It also wants individual departments to be shut down for 72 hours and cleaned after a worker tests positive.\n\nThe Georgia Department of Public Health reported Thursday evening that 617 deaths statewide have been linked to the virus. Infections have been confirmed in more than 16,300 people. About 20% of them were hospitalized.",

    "7 Wisconsin coronavirus infections linked to Election Day, health official says": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Officials have identified seven people who appear to have contracted the coronavirus through activities related to the April 7 election in Wisconsin, Milwaukee's health commissioner said, and advocates worry that they could be just the \"tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nCommissioner Jeanette Kowalik said six of the cases involve Milwaukee voters and one involve a Milwaukee poll worker, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.\n\nOfficials hope to have additional information on the cases by the end of the week, including whether any of them were concentrated in any of the city's five polling places or whether any resulted in death, Kowalik said Monday.\n\nWisconsin proceeded with in-person voting only after a bitter partisan fight. The state's Democratic governor tried to shift the election to vote-by-mail and postpone it, but he was blocked by the conservative majorities on the Wisconsin Supreme Court and in the Republican-controlled Legislature, prompting the chairman of the state Democratic Party to warn that voters would die as a result.\n\nNow, Wisconsin Democrats worry that there may be more yet-to-be-reported cases, because Milwaukee officials say they have only about 30 percent of the data in yet and officials in other parts of the state have yet to release information on Election Day-related infections.\n\n\"I fear this is just the beginning,\" Democratic state Sen. Dave Hansen told reporters on a conference call Tuesday.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIn Florida, one of the last states to hold in-person voting before lockdowns went into effect in mid-March, at least two poll workers later tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nStill, state Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm said Monday that there were no signs yet of a surge in cases from the election, as some feared. Palm noted, however, that if cases do exist, symptoms may not have appeared yet.\n\nTuesday marks the 14th day since the election, which is a time frame during which health officials say symptoms typically appear. The coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death. To date, 230 people have died in Wisconsin, and nearly 4,500 have tested positive.\n\nAdvocates of voting by mail say Wisconsin's experience should be a warning to other states as the country grapples with how to hold an election during the pandemic.\n\n\"This was entirely preventable, but now Wisconsinites are paying a real price for the reckless disregard for their safety,\" said Sean Eldridge, who runs the liberal advocacy group Stand Up America. \"If Congress fails to provide states funding for vote-by-mail and other election assistance, then what we're seeing in Wisconsin right now could be the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who has been pushing Congress to make an expansion of voting by mail a part of the next coronavirus aid package, said the infections are a warning and suggested that President Donald Trump's objections to voting by mail are disingenuous.\n\n\"The tragic news of these cases in Milwaukee is further evidence of the immense public health crisis created when officials refuse to expand voting options so that Americans can safely cast a ballot,\" Klobuchar said. \"While those voters were standing in line risking their lives, the President was at home requesting a mail-in ballot. We need to plan for November, which is why we need to pass my legislation that will guarantee every voter access to a mail-in ballot and expand early voting to help voters avoid crowds and long lines.\"\n\nAlex Padilla, the secretary of state of California, where about two-thirds of ballots are now cast by mail, called news of the infections \"infuriating.\"\n\n\"These voters risked their health to be able to cast a ballot. They never should have been forced to make that choice,\" he said on Twitter.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nVoters who went to the polls in Milwaukee stood in long lines, many for several hours, to cast their ballots. Many had no protective gear. And thousands of Wisconsin voters stayed home, unwilling to risk their health and unable to be counted because absentee ballots they had requested never arrived.\n\nBut Judd Choate, the director of elections in Colorado, one of five states that vote entirely by mail, said he saw a silver lining in Wisconsin's ability to dramatically scale up absentee mail balloting.\n\nStates across the country are expecting a surge in demand for absentee ballots from voters who want to avoid the polls during the crisis, and Judd said Wisconsin showed it's doable, even if it wasn't pretty.\n\n\"They went from almost no vote-by-mail to over half vote-by-mail in a couple of weeks,\" Choate told reporters on a call organized by the National Vote at Home Institute. \"Yes, there were lines. Yes, there were these odd circumstances of people wearing masks and standing a great distance apart from each other. But that's the in-person part. The vote-by-mail part actually went pretty well.\"\n\nThere were still issues with the vote-by-mail part, including about 9,000 ballots requested by voters that were never sent. But the state still managed to process and count about 1.1 million absentee ballots, a more than fourfold increase from previous similar elections.\n\n\"I know there was a lot of concern about what happened in Wisconsin. I was actually encouraged,\" Choate said.",

    "A 46-year-old doctor with coronavirus was critically ill but made startling recovery": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Medical staff give a clap out as Karl Viddal is released from the hospital.Dignity Health\n\nA 46-year-old physician in Arizona with no prior health issues contracted the coronavirus and was so ill that his doctors feared he would die. But Karl Viddal ended his nearly two-month hospital stay on Friday after being put on a life-support machine that is not widely available.\n\nHis treatment illustrates how hospitals around the country are using a variety of methods to treat severely ill COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe Phoenix-area physician came down with flu-like symptoms soon after returning from a trip abroad in March, according to an account of his illness and recovery by the Dignity Health hospital system. As he began to feel worse and had trouble breathing, the father of three young children was admitted to a hospital in Gilbert, Arizona, on March 22.\n\nThat began a fight for his life that included 28 days in a medically induced coma, 34 days on a ventilator and a total of 55 days in the hospital. The disease caused a life-threatening pneumonia.\n\nViddal's condition steadily worsened, and he had to go on a ventilator at Dignity Health Mercy Gilbert Medical Center to keep him alive. With options dwindling and his doctors fearing he may not survive, Viddal was moved to another hospital, Dignity Health St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center, to try a measure of last resort.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe treatment, known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation or ECMO, is a form of life support that essentially takes the place of the heart and lungs, according to the American Thoracic Society. The machine connects to the veins and arteries in a patient's legs, neck or chest via a series of plastic tubes. The person's blood then flows through the ECMO system, which adds oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, before returning to the person's body.\n\nThe machine is only used after a person has been on a ventilator, and it carries a risk of kidney failure, stroke, internal bleeding or other life-threatening conditions.\n\nOnly a limited number of hospitals have an ECMO program. Viddal was the 32nd patient in the United States and the second in Arizona to be placed on this type of therapy for COVID-19, according to Dignity Health.\n\nThe life support system is also not a cure for the virus and far from a sure thing.\n\nThe medical director of the ECMO program at St. Joseph's said it's a highly specialized treatment that is only used after all other conventional treatments fail. In Viddal's case, it allowed doctors to give his lungs a rest.\n\nViddal also didn't only undergo ECMO. His doctors put him through multiple other prolonged treatments. He may be one of the most critically-ill patients in the U.S. to recover from COVID-19, the hospital system said.\n\nLike other patients who have been on such life-support systems, Viddal underwent therapy for rehabilitation after he was off the machines.\n\nOn Friday, he had enough strength and balance to walk again and to return home.\n\n\"It was hard comprehending what happened to me when I became conscious. I woke up and I was paralyzed, unable to speak,\" Viddal said. \"This virus nearly ended my life.\"",

        "body": "A person wearing a protective face mask as a precaution against the coronavirus walks past a shuttered business in Philadelphia on April 23, 2020.Matt Rourke / AP\n\nIn New Jersey, a 60-year-old programming language became the scapegoat for years of neglect after the state's unemployment website struggled to handle the flood of unemployment claims spurred by the coronavirus lockdowns.\n\nIn Florida, there have been extreme cuts over the last decade to the unemployment system. The state's onerous process seems designed to deter applicants, including eliminating in-person or phone options for applying for unemployment insurance and funnelling them through a badly designed and underfunded website. As a result, the state has struggled to handle the influx of claims.\n\nIn Ohio, the unemployment system hadn't recovered since the Great Recession. With almost a million new applicants over the last six weeks, phone lines have been clogged for hours and the website has been crashing or timing out. Some applicants reported that they were rejected because they didn't meet eligibility criteria that had been waived during the pandemic.\n\nSimilar situations are playing out across the country, including in Michigan, California and New York.\n\nNewly laid off workers have overwhelmed unemployment offices in numerous states, leading to frustration and delays in applying for and receiving benefits. Each state has its own story, but many share two themes: budgets cut by state legislatures and starved by the federal government, and old, inefficient systems that can often create more work for applicants and processors.\n\nBut the damage isn't limited to unemployment offices.\n\nDelays in unemployment benefits also indirectly affect other social services, such as Medicaid, and cash and food assistance, as workers lose employer-provided health insurance and income.\n\n\"It's the perfect storm,\" said Leo Ribas, a partner at the Change & Innovation Agency, which has helped several states modernize these social services. \"There are more families, overtaxed resources, a combination of bad processes and antiquated IT.\"\n\nHe described how the crisis has forced states to reconsider the way they deliver services to comply with social distancing guidelines, which means having employees process cases online or on the phone.\n\n\"They are building the plane as they fly,\" he said.\n\nUnemployment insurance is a temporary benefit program to help people who are out of work for reasons beyond their control, like being laid off because of the economic downturn resulting from the pandemic.\n\nTo qualify, applicants usually have to show that they worked at their last job for a certain amount of time and that they are actively looking for work, though with the current economic crisis, many states have waived certain eligibility requirements to help the millions of Americans suddenly thrown out of work. Normally, most states allow unemployment insurance for up to 26 weeks, but a recent relief package passed by Congress grants people an additional 13 weeks.\n\nWhile states have the biggest role to play in the system, the underfunding behind ailing unemployment systems isn't only a matter of state budgets. Although unemployment benefits are administered by states, the funding of the programs comes almost entirely from the federal government, and one of the main sources of that funding is the federal unemployment tax.\n\nThe last time that figure was adjusted for inflation was in 1983.\n\n\"Unemployment insurance provides a striking illustration of how defunding the administrative capacity of the program itself has really limited the sort of response that both the federal government and the state can provide in this economic crisis,\" said Alexander Hertel-Fernandez, a professor of public affairs at Columbia University who studies state political networks.\n\nDuring a typical year, the if-it-ain't-broke approach most likely wouldn't cause too much disruption to people receiving their benefits. However, the COVID-19 pandemic created a surge in demand for social services that has never been seen before, as the number of first-time unemployment claims soared to 33 million.\n\nNicole Rodriguez, research director at New Jersey Policy Perspective, a think tank, said the state's unemployment system is just one area that has been allowed to deteriorate.\n\n\"Over the last decade, every single New Jersey department was cut to the bone, and it's been hampering the state's ability to provide ordinary services and run programs people expect during normal times,\" Rodriguez said. \"Now in a crisis, we are seeing how bad those cuts were.\"\n\nRodriguez's organization has conducted research showing that although funding for the state's labor department has remained stagnant since the Great Recession, it's operating with 25 percent fewer employees than it was in 2008.\n\nThe backlog in processing cases means the real unemployment rate could be much higher than reported.\n\nAccording to a survey by the Economic Policy Institute, for every 10 people who successfully filed for unemployment insurance benefits over four weeks in March and April, an additional three to four people tried and failed to make claims.\n\nThe process for filing for unemployment benefits varies among states, but options include filing online, over the phone, via mail or in-person (or a combination of these). There have been plenty of technology failures, including crashed websites and clogged telephone lines, but in many cases the bottleneck is caused by the limit on the number of staff members trained to review cases.\n\nBut there's a stark difference between those states that have taken steps to modernize their systems -- not just in technology but also in the processes that can cause bottlenecks -- and those that have not.\n\nSome states, including Texas, Nevada and Washington, modernized the way they deliver Medicaid, cash and food assistance before the pandemic hit, but those programs are administered by different departments than the ones that handle uninsurance benefits. Still, thanks to recent upgrades, those states have been able to stay on top of their workload so far, Ribas said.\n\nThey have been successful because they redesigned the human workflow rather than just upgrading the technology to avoid automating \"a really bad process\" he said.\n\n\"You can put bots in place to answer your phone, but they are not going to tell you if you are eligible or not eligible for Medicaid,\" Ribas said. \"Agencies are trying to resolve the symptom, but in reality they need to focus on calculating benefit eligibility so that people don't need to call back three, four, five times.\"\n\nTechnology has emerged as something of a patsy for the broader problems of unemployment systems.\n\nWhen an unprecedented surge in applications for unemployment benefits in early April crippled New Jersey's ability to process claims, Gov. Phil Murphy blamed an ancient and clunky mainframe computer system and asked for help from any software developers familiar with a six-decade-old programming language called COBOL.\n\nMurphy's comments triggered a flurry of media reports decrying the absurdity of a state using such old technology. Hundreds of COBOL programmers came forward to offer their services.\n\nCOBOL, it turned out, did just fine. Weeks after Murphy's statements, NBC News couldn't find evidence of any COBOL volunteers being deployed to help New Jersey shore up its IT systems. A spokeswoman for the New Jersey labor department said that the call for COBOL programmers was done \"metaphorically\" to highlight the age of some of the systems in use.\n\nOverall the systems have performed \"very well\" apart from two outages in mid-March and one last Sunday, the spokeswoman said, and they seem to have been caused by capacity problems with the public-facing websites, as 930,000 residents -- one in five workers -- filed claims in the last six weeks.\n\nCOBOL may have been a victim of its own success, according to Mar Hicks, a technology historian.\n\n\"For many years these systems were stable enough to trundle along with little or no maintenance. So the people who maintained them were fired or laid off,\" said Hicks. \"It's a labor problem.\"\n\nNow is not the time to be making radical changes to legacy systems, said Todd Schroeder, Google's director of global public sector digital strategy.\n\n\"I don't think that's in anyone's best interest because that's just going to require more time and effort and isn't necessarily going to get us to serving this new population of folks that are eligible for these benefits quickly,\" he said.\n\nStates that haven't invested in the digital infrastructure that supports critical government functions should be looking at what's happening in the unemployment insurance system as a \"North Star,\" he said. Google is working with New York, Georgia, North Carolina and Illinois to ensure that state unemployment websites aren't paralyzed by the spike in demand.\n\n\"If we don't bolster the critical unemployment need, there will be other critical functions that span from that,\" Schroeder said.\n\nHicks warned that the finger-pointing at specific technologies or programming languages is being stoked by a range of interested parties, including the consulting firms who stand to benefit from lucrative digital transformation contracts as well as those who make money by maintaining the status quo.\n\n\"There's a great tradition in American society of profiting off a crisis, and we've been seeing an awful lot of that,\" said Hicks in reference to the technology companies currently pitching their services as a panacea. \"They would be remiss if they didn't try to take advantage of this opportunity by saying, 'We have the right answer and trust us to fix these systems.'\"",

    "A doctor didn't see her kids for weeks after husband said she posed coronavirus threat": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Sangeetha Setty after working a shift at an urgent care clinic in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.Saul Martinez / for NBC News\n\nAfter her shift at a Florida urgent care clinic on April 3, Dr. Sangeetha Setty pulled up to the gate outside her soon-to-be ex-husband's neighborhood and texted to let him know she had arrived. It was her evening to pick up their 6- and 8-year-old children.\n\nBut their father, Dr. Karthikeyan Sai, refused to bring them out. In a series of messages, he told Setty that he was worried that, because of her work as a physician, she would expose the children to the coronavirus. He also accused her of letting them play with neighborhood children the last time she had them, putting them at additional risk.\n\n\"Stay calm and go back, and let's keep the kids safe,\" Sai wrote. \"You can have them once this subsides.\"\n\nSetty protested, and after 45 minutes of waiting, she called the police. Two deputies from the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office arrived. Setty showed them a copy of her joint-custody agreement, which requires that she and her husband split time with the children. She pointed out that Sai, a physician himself, sometimes works at hospitals and therefore also faces a risk of coronavirus exposure.\n\nThe deputies spoke briefly with Sai, but he refused to release the children, according to a police report. He told the deputies that \"the children will get the virus\" if he allowed their mother to take them.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" one of the officers told Setty, advising her to argue her case in court. \"There's nothing we can do.\"\n\nShe cried as she drove away.\n\n\"I was heartbroken,\" Setty said in an interview. \"It's difficult to explain the pain that you feel as a mother when you're cut off from your children and you cannot even explain to them why it's happening.\"\n\nIn a statement, Sai's lawyer, James Cunha, said Sai attempted to work out an arrangement with Setty to minimize their children's risk of exposure, but she refused. Cunha said Sai was concerned not only about the health of his children, but also the safety of his parents, who are at higher risk of serious illness from the coronavirus.\n\nCunha wrote that Sai's parents are elderly and live with him, and he was concerned that Setty \"would use the children to spread the virus\" to them.\n\nAs parents across the country grapple with how best to protect their children from the coronavirus, a growing number of medical workers have been temporarily separated from their children after former spouses raised concerns about their exposure to the virus, according to news reports and interviews with families and lawyers. These parents say they should not be punished for doing their jobs and treating patients who are sick with COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Former spouses argue that their children's safety must come first, as well as the health of vulnerable family members.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nAt a time when most family courts are closed and are scheduling video hearings only for the most urgent matters, judges in some states lack clear guidance from higher courts on how to determine what's in a child's best interest in the midst of a pandemic. These decisions are complicated by the fact that there's still much to be learned about whether the coronavirus poses a threat to most children, though initial data suggests that serious illness in pediatric patients is exceedingly rare.\n\n\"It's really uncharted territory,\" said Rebekah Frye, a family lawyer in San Jose, California. \"This is the first time we've ever had to go through something like this. It's the first time we haven't had access to our courts when we've needed them for situations that parents would normally feel are emergencies.\"\n\nIn a case this month, Frye represented Dawn Polich, a respiratory therapist who fought to keep joint custody of her 10-year-old daughter after her ex-husband filed a motion arguing that her work at a hospital put the child in danger. During a court hearing, Frye argued that Polich, like most medical workers, was taking extensive precautions to prevent bringing the virus home from work, and that in these difficult times, the last thing the state should do is cut off a child from her mother.\n\nA week later, Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge Thomas Kuhnle sided with Polich. On April 15, he ordered that she and her ex-husband continue to honor their custody arrangement, despite the pandemic.\n\nEarlier in the month, a judge in Miami reached a different conclusion in a similar case, temporarily suspending the custody rights of Dr. Theresa Greene, an emergency room physician, until the pandemic subsided. Circuit Judge Bernard Shapiro approved an emergency motion filed by the doctor's ex-husband, Eric Greene, who had argued that his former spouse's work treating coronavirus patients would endanger their 4-year-old daughter.\n\n\"The suspension is solely related to the outbreak of COVID-19,\" Shapiro wrote.\n\nLast week, however, a Miami appeals court issued a stay of Shapiro's order, allowing Theresa Greene to maintain joint custody while the court considered her appeal. In an interview with WTVJ-TV, Greene said she was outraged at the judge's initial decision.\n\n\"I was just shocked that the judge would take this stance without talking to medical experts and knowing the facts and take it so lightly, take my child from me and not think of the effect on her, her mental and psychological well being,\" Greene said.\n\nThe American Medical Association and the American College of Emergency Physicians have each come out in support of physicians who've had their custody rights challenged due to the coronavirus, arguing that doctors should be allowed to stay with their families so long as they are taking proper precautions to prevent spreading the virus.\n\nDr. Kristin Moffitt, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School and a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Boston Children's Hospital, said she understands why many parents are scared for their children's safety. This month, a 5-year-old girl in Detroit died from rare complications of COVID-19, making national headlines.\n\nBut, Moffitt said, decisions should be driven by data, not anecdotes. All of the data to date suggests that young children are not at serious risk of dying or being hospitalized with COVID-19, Moffitt said. Unlike the flu, which is most dangerous for the very old and the very young, Moffitt said the coronavirus does not appear to pose the same risks to children, though they could still transmit it to older family members.\n\n\"What's so difficult with this pandemic is that there's so much more we don't know about it than what we do know, and that will change over time,\" Moffitt said. \"But in the absence of really clear data, it certainly is hard to resist the urge to sort of fill in those gaps with worst-case scenarios and a judgment that may not be totally data driven.\"\n\nSusan Myres, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, said that, rather than going to court, divorced parents should first attempt to find common-sense solutions to make everyone feel comfortable that a child is safe during the pandemic. They should set ground rules for social contacts and hygiene standards, Myres said, and make sure both parents stick to the plan.\n\n\"The No. 1 interest in any of these cases is what is best for these children,\" Myres said. \"And it is not just their physical health from contagions, but their psychological health. Is it important for these children to have time with their medical care provider parents? Generally speaking, the answer is going to be 'Yes.'\"\n\nAfter her husband refused to let her take their two children on April 3, Setty called her lawyer and asked her to file a motion. But with the courts closed, the lawyer said there was no guarantee a judge would schedule a hearing anytime soon.\n\nFor the next 19 days, Setty was separated from her children, unsure when she would see them. Over that time, she said she only spoke to them twice, once briefly by phone, and once by video chat. The pace of work at her urgent care had slowed significantly, in part because of the governor's lockdown order, and in part because -- despite her husband's concerns -- the clinic wasn't even treating suspected COVID-19 patients, but instead was screening them for symptoms and sending them elsewhere for testing.\n\nThat left Setty plenty of time to think, and worry.\n\nFinally, on April 14, her lawyer filed an emergency motion asking the judge to find Sai in contempt of court for violating their custody agreement and to order the children returned. A week later, Judge Dina Keever-Agrama scheduled a video hearing.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe lawyers argued about who had the children's best interests at heart. Sai's lawyer didn't mention his earlier concerns about Setty's work at an urgent care, but instead argued that she had been ignoring social distancing guidelines and had refused to answer Sai's questions about whether she had been having any symptoms of COVID-19. Setty's lawyer argued that Sai was wrong to withhold the children from their mother, regardless of his concerns.\n\nKeever-Agrama scolded both parents for seeming to put their personal squabbles ahead of what was best for their children, but ultimately, she concluded that the coronavirus wasn't an excuse to break a custody agreement.\n\n\"I don't understand why you are not following a court order,\" Keever-Agrama said, according to a recording of the hearing Setty made and shared with NBC News. \"I understand there's a pandemic and we're in uncharted waters. However, parenting doesn't change. Parenting should always be, 'How can we comply with the court order and serve the best interests of our children?' That's the bottom line here.\"\n\nThe judge ordered that Setty be allowed to pick up her children later that evening, and Setty quickly started making plans. She would cook their favorite Indian dish, she said. Maybe they would watch a movie, or set up a tent in the backyard and look at the stars.\n\n\"I don't know what we'll do,\" Setty said, her voice breaking, before the kids arrived. \"I have so many plans for them now that they are coming back to me.\"",

    "A new study offers a detailed look at the sickest children with COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Severe illness in children remains rare but the coronavirus can be detrimental to some.\n\nAs reports of soaring cases of the coronavirus -- first in China, then Italy -- first reached the United States, there appeared to be a silver lining: children seemed to be spared from the illness.\n\nAnd while adults have, by far, borne the brunt of the disease, it's become increasingly clear that children are indeed susceptible to the coronavirus, and in some cases, becoming sick enough to be hospitalized.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nNew research, published Monday in JAMA Pediatrics, is one of the first to offer detailed data on children impacted by the coronavirus.\n\nThe study, from researchers at the Texas Children's Hospital and the Baylor College of Medicine, focused on 48 children with COVID-19 who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units across the U.S. and Canada in late March and early April.\n\nThe majority -- 83 percent -- had underlying health problems, such as congenital heart disease, cerebral palsy or other illnesses like cancer that would compromise their immune systems.\n\nPhysicians describe these children as \"medically complex;\" that is, \"kids who are born [sick] or become very sick soon after birth,\" said study author Dr. Lara Shekerdemian, chief of critical care at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston.\n\nMany of the children had pre-existing illnesses that already required feeding tubes or tracheotomies.\n\nThe new research did not address children who have developed a mysterious illness likely linked to COVID-19, called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. That illness mirrors many of the symptoms of toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease, including severe inflammation affecting the coronary arteries.\n\n\"We don't believe that any of the patients would fit the classic Kawasaki-like illness, at least from the data that we have,\" Shekerdemian told NBC News. That illness appears to be a delayed inflammatory reaction that occurs several weeks after a COVID-19 infection. Shekerdemian's study looked at how the virus is impacting children in the acute phase of the illness.\n\nNearly three-quarters of the children in her research group had respiratory symptoms. And nearly a quarter developed failure in at least two organ systems.\n\nShekerdemian said there appeared to be no consistent treatment protocol for these sickest children with the coronavirus. Many received a combination of therapies, including the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic azithromycin (commonly known as a Z-Pak), the antiviral remdesivir and tocilizumab, a drug that is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nThe children in the study were treated before evidence emerged linking hydroxychloroquine to potentially dangerous heart complications. Researchers said this highlights the need for clinical trials for best treatment practices.\n\n\"We are throwing treatments at children because they exist, but we really need to study those systematically,\" Shekerdemian said. \"The last thing anyone wants is either ineffective treatments or adverse effects.\"\n\nEighteen of the 48 children in the study had to be placed on ventilators to help them breathe. Two children died.\n\nStill, the study reiterates that children are far less likely than adults to suffer the most dire coronavirus complications.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"We cautiously take comfort in the data available so far that children are less severely affected from COVID-19,\" said Dr. Buddy Creech, an infectious disease expert and the director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Creech was not involved with this latest study.\n\n\"We continue to understand more and more about this virus, about the types of people at risk for more severe or unusual disease, and the best ways to treat it,\" he said.\n\nShekerdemian said her group will continue to monitor children with complications of the coronavirus, including pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome which, just weeks ago, did not exist in the medical literature.\n\n\"This was clearly not the whole story for children,\" she said. \"Just when you thought you had it sorted out, this comes along. It's unsettling.\"",

        "body": "Vice President Mike Pence tours the General Motors/Ventec ventilator production plant with GM CEO and Chairman Mary Barra in Kokomo, Ind., on Thursday, April 30, 2020.Michael Conroy / AP\n\nDays after he was criticized for not wearing a mask during a tour of a hospital's coronavirus testing facility, Vice President Mike Pence sported one Thursday while touring a General Motors plant in Indiana that is now making ventilators.\n\nLike the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, which Pence visited on Tuesday, the G.M. plant in Kokomo has protocols in place requiring workers to wear \"medical grade protective masks.\"\n\nPence, who's the head of the White House coronavirus task force, thanked workers at the plant for their \"critical help\" in fighting the virus. He said the re-purposed plant has already made over 600 ventilators. \"I just wanted to thank you,\" the former Indiana governor said. \"It's an honor to be among the heroes in the Hoosier State.\"\n\nHe later took off the mask during a round-table discussion at the plant, where participants, including Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao, appeared to be sitting several feet apart. None of the attendees at the panel, including administration officials and GM executives, wore a mask.\n\nThe vice president had defended his lack of a face covering during the Mayo visit, telling reporters he wasn't concerned about spreading the virus because he has tested negative for it. \"Since I don't have the coronavirus, I thought it'd be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers, these incredible health care personnel, and look them in the eye and say thank you,\" Pence said then.\n\nDr. Vin Gupta told NBC News that that was a potentially dangerous attitude. \"The vast majority of individuals that we think are likely transmitters of the disease have no symptoms,\" Gupta said. \"You basically have a bunch of people feeling great who think they don't need to follow the rules.\"\n\nEarlier Thursday, Pence's wife, Karen, told \"Fox & Friends\" that her husband had been unaware of the Mayo Clinic's policy and did not mean to \"scare\" anybody.\n\n\"It was actually after he left Mayo Clinic that he found out they had a policy of asking everyone to wear a mask,\" she said. \"So someone who's worked on this whole task force for over two months is not someone who would have done anything to offend anyone or hurt anyone or scare anyone.\"\n\nThe clinic said it had alerted Pence's office about the policy before his visit.\n\nNBC News asked the vice president's office on Wednesday if he planned on following the GM plant's policy and got no response.",

    "After months of norovirus outbreaks at sea, the source is found. It was a smoothie.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "CDC investigators finally traced the norovirus -- not coronavirus -- illnesses last year back to a smoothie made with frozen raspberries.\n\nIt was a whodunit on the high seas: For several months in the summer of 2019, a handful passengers on 10 European cruises came down with acute stomach bugs.\n\nThe passengers were on different ships that departed from July to September. All of the patients, however, were on ships from the same cruise line and had the same symptoms: a rapid onset of vomiting and diarrhea that lasted about 24 hours.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report on the cruise ship outbreaks Thursday. The report did not name the cruise ship line.\n\nThroughout the summer, the cruise line investigated the source of the outbreak, extensively testing possible foods, but no culprit was identified, the report said.\n\nThat changed on Sept. 18, 2019, when the CDC was informed that one of the cruise ships was sailing into U.S. jurisdiction. The agency's Vessel Sanitation Program was informed of an outbreak that had sickened 117 passengers and eight crew members on a ship sailing from Germany to New York City. Stool samples revealed that the passengers and crew members were sickened with norovirus, a common stomach virus. However, the source of the virus remained unknown.\n\nOne month later, a second outbreak occurred on the same cruise ship, which, by that point was carrying different passengers and sailing from Montreal to New York City. At the same time, another ship, also from the same cruise line, also experienced a norovirus outbreak. This ship was sailing along the U.S.'s Eastern Seaboard, leaving from and returning to New York City.\n\nSick passengers were asked to fill out food questionnaires, and on the second ship, 80 percent said they had consumed a smoothie made from frozen fruits and berries. Further testing of the frozen fruit found that the raspberries, along with the tropical fruit cocktail and the berry mix, tested positive for norovirus.\n\nThe same berries were found on both ships, the CDC report concluded. In fact, further investigation revealed that the cruise line had purchased nearly 22,000 pounds of frozen raspberries from a single supplier in China beginning in June 2019. The findings led the World Health Organization to issue a recall for the frozen raspberries in November 2019.\n\nAfter the frozen raspberries were removed from the ships, no further outbreaks were reported.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "To help alleviate the stress, try to implement a routine and structure in your day-to-day life.mapodile / Getty Images\n\nIt turns out that ditching the commute and working from home in your sweats is not all it's cracked up to be.\n\nJuggling your work and home life, Zoom calls instead of in-person meetings and possibly parenting and home schooling kids, it's no wonder Americans are exhausted.\n\nIn fact, in a recent Monster survey, 51% of respondents admitted to experiencing burnout while working from home during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Their home, which is normally a sanctuary and place to rest and relax with family, has instantly morphed into their office,\" said Vicki Salemi, a Monster career expert.\n\nThat's despite taking breaks for self-care throughout the day: 71% of those surveyed said they were stepping away from work for things like walks or spending time with family.\n\nThe culprit: a lack of structure and routine to your work day, Salemi said.\n\nOn top of that, we are isolated from those outside our immediate family, facing uncertainty about our health and the status of the virus, and parents are parenting all the time, added licensed psychologist Melissa L. Whitson, an associate professor of psychology at the University of New Haven in Connecticut.\n\nThere is also financial anxiety. While those working remotely still have a job, as opposed to the more than 30 million Americans who have filed unemployment claims since March, there is the threat that they, too, could lose their paycheck or have their salary cut at some point if the recession continues, she said.\n\n\"There is still that, 'I need to work while I'm making money now and also to show that I am a good employee so they keep me on,'\" Whitson said. \"There is that added pressure onto it.\"\n\nAlana Acosta-Lahullier, 41, understands that feeling of burnout. With two children and a full-time job, she is exhausted all the time.\n\nShe helps with her the schooling of her 7-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son while she works from home full-time for an electrical contractor. Her son has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and is on the autism spectrum, so he needs some extra help. Her husband works out of the home as a police officer.\n\n\"I am constantly on the verge of a panic attack,\" said Acosta-Lahullier, who lives in Parsippany, New Jersey.\n\nWhile her employer is very understanding, she feels the need to get everything done correctly.\n\n\"I find myself working all the time, even when I should be getting ready for bed,\" Acosta-Lahullier said. \"I feel an obligation to get everything done, even if it's to the detriment of my own mental health.\"\n\nOn top of that she has \"mother's guilt.\"\n\n\"I need to make sure that everybody I have to take care of has everything they need,\" she said. \"I put this constant pressure on myself.\"\n\nFor 45-year-old David Hoffman, who lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, and leads operations for a business unit of a large multinational company, the stress sometimes causes him to get \"really short and snap.\"\n\nAs the primary caregiver during the day to his three children, who are in first, third and sixth grade, he spends the day giving guidance on their various school assignments. He's also trying to get his work done.\n\n\"Eight weeks of constant abnormal working and this heavy support and kids stuck in the house is stressful,\" said Hoffman, whose wife has a full-time job in health-care administration at a local hospital.\n\nHe finds himself starting work earlier than he did while in the office, working later and doing more work at night after the kids have gone to bed in order to catch up.\n\n\"It's just this monotony, this depressing monotony,\" he said.\n\n\"It seems like it never ends. You go to sleep and you are right back at it.\"\n\nThe first thing you should do is to be kind to yourself and know that the stress manifests itself differently in different people, Whitson said.\n\nYou may be more angry or irritable, or you may appear to be more depressed or withdrawn. Recognize and accept that you may be experiencing any of these symptoms.\n\nTo help alleviate the stress, try to implement a routine and structure in your day-to-day life.\n\n\"When you are always on, your system gets overwhelmed and exhausted,\" Whitson said.\n\nMonster's Salemi recommends waking up each morning as you would if you were commuting to your job. Get dressed and have breakfast. Put it on your calendar and create a routine around it, she said.\n\nMore from Invest in You : Expert tips on coping with coronavirus-related money stressors\n\nAt the end of your normal workday, stop working and put your laptop out of sight.\n\nIf you are juggling kids' school work and parenting, build that into your routine, as well. If you are able, work in a different room to do your job so that you can focus better. Trade off parenting duties with your partner, if possible.\n\nBuilding a sense of community can also help, Whitson said. Make a point to have virtual meetings to connect with colleagues and online social gatherings with friends.\n\nNot only can it increase your well-being, it can have \"profound effects\" on productivity and satisfaction in the workplace, she said.\n\nLastly, don't be afraid to reach out for help from counselors or other support networks if you need it.\n\n\"We are all in this together,\" Whitson said. \"It is helpful to know that other people are in the same boat.\n\n\"Just find out what works for you and, if it's not working, try something new,\" she added. \"It is not a one-size-fits-all.\"",

    "Andy Cohen says he couldn't donate plasma because he is gay": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Andy Cohen is speaking out about what he says is a discriminatory practice happening at the federal level when it comes to LGBTQ people being able to donate blood and convalescent plasma.\n\nThe 51-year-old talk show host tested positive for the coronavirus in March and recovered from COVID-19 by the end of that month. Since then, he said he's been trying help those still suffering from the disease, but due to laws against men who have sex with men, he can't.\n\n\"I signed up for a program for COVID-19 survivors where you could donate plasma, which is rich in antibodies, to those still battling the virus,\" he said on Thursday's episode of \"Watch What Happens Live.\" \"I was told that, due to antiquated and discriminatory guidelines by the FDA to prevent HIV, I am ineligible to donate blood because I'm a gay man.\"\n\nCohen later explained that since the coronavirus is \"ravaging our planet,\" the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is saying \"there is an urgent need for plasma from survivors.\"\n\nConvalescent plasma is the liquid portion of blood taken from survivors of a disease that is rich in antibodies. Precious for people sick with COVID-19, doctors hope using it can speed up recovery for the sickest patients.\n\nPlasma donors have to confirm they had COVID-19 and have fully recovered. That means having documentation of a positive test, which can be difficult since there is limited access to testing across the country. They also need to either be 14 days from their last symptoms and have a negative COVID-19 test, or 28 days from their last symptoms -- no negative test required.\n\nAs of this week, the American Red Cross has produced 200 units of convalescent plasma donated by almost 150 eligible donors. The goal is to send out more than 1,000 units to hospitals, which would require 500 to 600 donors.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the demand is far exceeding the supply, even though many people in our organization are working around the clock on this endeavor,\" Dr. Pampee Young, chief medical officer of the organization, told TODAY.\n\nEarlier this month, due to an \"urgent need for blood,\" the FDA revised its blood donor guidelines, easing the restrictions on men who have sex with men. The new guidelines reduce the donation deferral period for sexually active gay and bisexual men from 12 months to three. These healthy men will now have to abstain from same-sex sexual activity for 90 days before they are eligible to donate blood.\n\nThe same restrictions apply to recovered COVID-19 patients who wish to donate plasma. That 90-day period is significantly less than the restrictions that existed before the pandemic, but Cohen argues any restriction based on sexual orientation is inherently homophobic in its practice.\n\n\"Even the new relaxed rules require gay men to abstain from sex for three months, whether they're in a monogamous relationship or not before giving blood, though no such blanket restrictions exist for people of other sexual orientations,\" he said.\n\nCohen points out that all donated blood, no matter the person's sexual orientation, is screened for HIV. He suggested a rapid HIV test could be given before a person donates to ensure they are negative.\n\n\"So, why the three-month rule?\" Cohen questions. \"Why are members from my community being excluded from helping out when so many people are sick and dying? Maybe because we're valuing stigma over science? I don't know. My blood could save a life but instead it's over here boiling.\"\n\nCohen also noted that since the coronavirus pandemic began, people have adapted in many ways, including the wearing of masks and social distancing. So why can't the FDA adapt as well?\n\n\"It is bad enough that quarantine has us wondering what day it is, I'm sitting here wondering what year it is,\" Cohen said. \"We need to think about this and do better.\"",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Another Navy ship at sea has reported a coronavirus outbreak and is returning to port, the Navy said Friday.\n\nNavy officials said at least 18 members of the crew of a destroyer, the USS Kidd, have tested positive and it expects the number to grow. It said it is evaluating the extent of the outbreak aboard the ship.\n\nThe Kidd is off the Pacific coast of Central America, where it has been operating as part of a U.S. counter-drug mission. The Navy said it has a crew of about 350. It is only the second Navy ship, among about 90 deployed around the world, to report a coronavirus outbreak at sea. The other is the USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nOne sailor who displayed symptoms was flown off the Kidd on Thursday to a medical facility at San Antonio, where he tested positive for the virus.\n\nAfter the positive case was confirmed at San Antonio, the Navy deployed a specialized medical team to the ship to conduct contact tracing and additional onsite testing.\n\n\"The first patient transported is already improving and will self-isolate. We are taking every precaution to ensure we identify, isolate, and prevent any further spread onboard the ship,\" said Rear Admiral Don Gabrielson, commander U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command and U.S. 4th Fleet. \"Our medical team continues coordinating with the ship and our focus is the safety and well-being of every Sailor.\"\n\nThe Navy said the ship will return to port, where the crew will continue to clean and disinfect the ship, observing protocols in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Navy-specific guidelines.\n\nThe Navy continues to struggle with a coronavirus outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier that is docked in Guam and has more than 800 confirmed virus cases.\n\nAsked whether the Pentagon fears that the Kidd may become another Roosevelt crisis, the Pentagon's chief spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said the Navy acted quickly once learning of the first symptomatic sailor aboard the Kidd.\n\n\"The Navy has lessons learned from prior experience with a COVID crisis, and they have been quickly applying those to this case,\" Hoffman said. \"Fingers crossed, the Navy is doing everything they can right now, and we're going to hope for the best outcome, but they are going to take all of the prudent steps that they possibly can.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Collecting personal data may be the only way to help slow the spread of coronavirus on the massive scale needed, public health experts say. But how that information is used and by whom worries some privacy advocates.John Minchillo / AP\n\nApple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nThe companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.\n\nMany governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people's location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.\n\nPublic health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.\n\nThe companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic \"exposure notification\" system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.\n\nThe identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.\n\n\"User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,\" the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.\n\nThe companies said the new technology -- the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants -- solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone's battery.\n\nThe statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.\n\n\"We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,\" said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.\n\nNorth Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.\n\nTim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps -- his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.\n\nSome privacy advocates have favored the Google-Apple approach because it offers more privacy and security. But others, including Ryan Calo, a law professor who co-directs the University of Washington's Tech Policy Lab, said he is concerned about its effectiveness if people get too many false alerts asking them to quarantine themselves. He said public health agencies would be better off being able to track location with careful safeguards.\n\nCalo said Google and Apple have been more upfront about the limitations of their model, but he said he's still worried some governments will treat it as a substitute for crucial investments in free, widespread testing and hiring an army of human contact tracers.\n\n\"We're just not going to get out of this global pandemic with a clever app,\" he said.",

        "body": "\"The more and more we learn, we're seeing what this virus can do,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said during a Senate hearing Tuesday.\n\nThe number of children with a rare and potentially deadly inflammatory condition likely linked to COVID-19 has risen to more than 100 in at least 14 states.\n\nThe tally comes as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it's actively preparing guidance for health officials to track what's now being called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or PMIS, nationwide.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe vast majority of the cases are in New York, where Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Tuesday the state has treated about 100 patients who range in age from younger than one to 18 years old.\n\nAt least five children in New York have died from the illness, which acts much like toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease, causing severe inflammation of the coronary arteries.\n\n\"I know parents around the state are very concerned about this,\" Cuomo said during a media briefing Tuesday. \"If we have this issue in New York, it's probably in other states.\"\n\nIndeed, as awareness of PMIS has grown over the past few weeks, doctors have reported a small number of other cases in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washington, and Washington, D.C.\n\nOn Tuesday, a CDC spokesperson told NBC News the agency is working to come up with a standard definition of PMIS. The guidance is meant to assist public health officials in tracking cases in each state.\n\nIdentifying the syndrome can be difficult, doctors say, because many affected children don't exhibit the typical respiratory symptoms associated with the coronavirus.\n\nChildren are arriving at the hospital \"with things like very high fever, severe abdominal pain and dropping blood pressure,\" said Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, head of the division of infectious diseases at Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C.\n\nDeBiasi said the children's hearts either aren't pumping normally or there is inflammation in the coronary arteries that supply blood flow to the heart. Some patients, but not all, also develop red eyes, rashes, swollen hands or enlarged lymph nodes.\n\nAnd while many of the young PMIS patients have tested positive for COVID-19, or at least were found to have antibodies for the virus, not all children have. That may be because some kids don't appear to develop symptoms until a month after a COVID-19 infection.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, warned a Senate committee Tuesday that much remains unknown about COVID-19 \"particularly when it comes to children.\"\n\n\"We really have to be very careful,\" Fauci said, \"because the more and more we learn, we're seeing what this virus can do.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there is growing evidence that COVID-19 can and does affect children much more severely than previously thought, even if they're not ultimately diagnosed with PMIS.\n\nDeBiasi and colleagues at Children's National Hospital analyzed medical records of 177 children and young adults in their 20s who tested positive for COVID-19. A quarter needed to be hospitalized, and a small percentage (5 percent) were critically ill and on life support.\n\nThose most likely to require critical care interventions, such as mechanical ventilation, were either very young children, or youngsters over age 15. One of those patients was diagnosed with PMIS.\n\nThe research was published Tuesday in the Journal of Pediatrics. After the paper was submitted for publication, DeBiasi said the hospital treated about 70 additional children with the coronavirus, as well as two more with PMIS.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThose with underlying neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy, have been significantly more likely to require hospitalization.\n\nDeBiasi cautioned that coronavirus complications remain rare in kids, and that it's clear the vast majority of pediatric COVID-19 patients seem to have mild illnesses, or no symptoms at all.\n\nBut she said PMIS cases, so far, appear to be more prevalent on the East Coast of the U.S. and also in Europe, than had been reported in China and the U.S. West Coast.\n\n\"On the East Coast, and in particular speaking for the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region,\" DeBiasi said, \"we're seeing more sick kids than we had expected.\"",

        "body": "A paramedic carries a 10-month-old boy with a fever after arriving by ambulance at a hospital in Stamford, Conn., on April 4, 2020.John Moore / Getty Images file\n\nChildren with a rare but potentially dangerous complication thought to be linked to the coronavirus have now been identified in at least seven states and the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nDoctors say the increase does not necessarily suggest that the number of such cases has grown. Instead, they say, it is likely the result of increased awareness of the problem, which just this week got an official name: pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nNBC News has found at least 85 such cases in children across the U.S. The majority -- 64 -- are in New York state, which has also recorded the highest number of COVID-19 cases overall.\n\nOther cases include four patients at Boston Children's Hospital, an estimated five to 10 at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, three at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, three at Nemours Children's Health System in Delaware, three at Ochsner Medical Center in Louisiana and one at Seattle Children's Hospital.\n\nChildren's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., has also reported two patients, but it has 15 more children in intensive care with some kind of massive inflammatory response to COVID-19. It's unclear whether all of those patients indeed have pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n\n\"All the kids have some sort of severe inflammation,\" said Dr. Michael Bell, head of critical care medicine at Children's National Hospital. \"I think it's all part of some spectrum of disease that's evolving as we learn more and more about this infection and its consequences.\"\n\nThe newly identified syndrome appears to be the result of a child's immune system's going into overdrive after a COVID-19 infection. However, it's still too soon to pin all of the cases on the coronavirus. Some patients have tested negative.\n\n\"We're all still waiting for the smoking gun to be sure it is associated with COVID-19,\" said Dr. Audrey John, chief of pediatric infectious diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, adding that it's \"certainly suspicious.\"\n\nPediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome can mirror symptoms of other inflammatory illnesses, such as Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome.\n\nChildren can have high fevers, severe diarrhea, rash and often red eyes or conjunctivitis. But \"the feature that's been most concerning is that they have problems with their heart function,\" John said.\n\n\"The heart isn't squeezing as well as it should, so they need medications to help keep their blood pressure up,\" John said.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nChildren with the condition are also usually treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, an antibody-rich plasma infusion that's been used to treat Kawasaki disease for decades.\n\nDoctors say the young patients will need to be followed closely in the coming years for further heart problems.\n\nKawasaki disease \"puts kids at risk for having coronary problems later in childhood, which can cause premature heart attacks,\" Bell said. \"We have seen patients with COVID-related disease that looked [like] Kawasaki have these coronary artery abnormalities.\"\n\nNo deaths have been reported in the U.S.; however, a 14-year-old boy in the U.K. died. His and other such cases in Europe are detailed in a report published in The Lancet.\n\nStill, COVID-19 complications, which include the possibly-linked new syndrome, are rare in children.\n\n\"We want to reassure parents this appears to be uncommon. While Kawasaki disease can damage the heart or blood vessels, the heart problems usually go away in five or six weeks, and most children fully recover,\" Dr. Jane Newburger, director of the Kawasaki Program at Boston Children's Hospital, wrote in a news release on behalf of the American Heart Association.\n\nJohn said: \"In general, families do not need to worry about this. I doubt that this is really new. I think it's just really newly recognized.\n\n\"I hope what comes of this is that, because we're seeing more cases, it will not take long before we will be better at recognizing this and treating it.\"",

The right fielder, who only turned 28 in March, said that doctors initially believed he had celiac disease or an ulcer until he underwent an endoscopy and colonoscopy.\n\n\"I was still woozy from the anesthesia, but before he even said the word cancer I was thinking to myself, There's no way that he's about to say what I think he's about to say,\" Mancini said. \"And then he said it: They had found a malignant tumor in my colon.\"\n\nDoctors removed Mancini's tumor on March 12, just six days after it was found, and he began chemotherapy a month later. The 28-year-old said that his father had previously fought stage two colon cancer, but Mancini thought he was too young to worry about such a diagnosis.\n\nMancini said he knew he was lucky for quite a few reasons, including his new contract with the Orioles from January following a breakout year where he was one of the American League's best hitters. Beyond his love of the game, he credited the team's resources and support for doctors being able to detect his tumor before it was too late.\n\nHe didn't have any typical symptoms of colon cancer other than feeling more lethargic than usual. Initial blood tests only showed low iron levels.\n\nBut further testing eventually found the tumor before it created a total blockage of his colon, Mancini said.\n\nThe treatment will take at least six months, meaning he won't be returning to baseball even if the MLB decides to start the 2020 season amid a pandemic.\n\nHe said \"chemo in the age of COVID-19 is crazy.\"\n\nMancini's treatment has to be done alone due to restrictions put in place due to the coronavirus. His girlfriend drives him to the hospital, but cannot come inside with him.\n\n\"I'm definitely trying to follow all the protocols, not only because it's the right thing to do, but also because I don't want to expose myself to anything, especially before going into chemotherapy,\" Mancini said.\n\nHe acknowledged that this is a \"terrible time\" for everyone and that once he is recovered, he wants to use his platform to make a difference.\n\n\"So many people have lost jobs, so many people have lost loved ones,\" Mancini said. \"After my chemo is done, and when I'm totally cancer-free, I've got a few different ideas of what I can do.\"",

    "CDC: Coronavirus now a leading cause of death in some states": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A body is moved on the street outside the Andrew Cleckley Funeral Home inBrooklyn, New York on April 30, 2020.Spencer Platt / Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. has seen at least 66,000 more deaths than usual so far this year, according to government data, and the new coronavirus accounts for much -- but not all -- of the increase.\n\nUsually the nation sees about 1 million deaths by the end of April, meaning the rise is in the neighborhood of 7%.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which posted the data this week, found the new coronavirus was reported as a cause in about half the excess deaths. It's likely the virus was a factor in many other deaths too, said Robert Anderson, who oversees the CDC's death statistics work.\n\nMedical examiners say drug overdoses, falls and certain types of accidents around the house may be up. Experts also believe at least some of the excess deaths may have been people with heart problems or other conditions who decided not to go to a hospital because of concerns they were filled with coronavirus-infected people.\n\n\"Everybody's afraid to go to the hospital. And they may be dying more frequently because they're not taking care of their coronary,\" said Dr. Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan researcher who studies flu and coronaviruses.\n\nThe virus has become a top killer in some places.\n\nIn Connecticut, it was the leading cause of death in April, said Dr. James Gill, the state's chief medical examiner. The office has handled over 2,300 certified coronavirus-related deaths since late March. Normally, the state averages 2,500 deaths in a typical month.\n\nFive states -- Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- each saw at least 3,000 deaths more than normal through last week, according to the analysis of provisional death certificate data by the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.\n\nThe analysis was based on data through last week. Data from more recent weeks is less complete than older information, Anderson said. It can take weeks for the death certificate data to catch up with case reports, which suggest that the nation's current COVID-19 death toll is more than 60,000.\n\nMedical examiners are making extra efforts to ensure virus cases are counted, though scientists are still trying to determine how accurate the tests are for the deceased.\n\nConnecticut investigators, for example, tested 160 bodies at funeral homes for coronavirus, and more than half came back positive.\n\n\"Many of those death certificates had things like 'respiratory failure' and other non-specific causes of death,\" Gill said. \"Without our going and doing the swabbing, those would have been deaths that were missed.\"\n\nIn some places -- especially rural ones -- coroners or medical examiners may not have the staff to ask about coronavirus symptoms every time there's a home death, said Dr. Sally Aiken, the county medical examiner in Spokane, Washington, and president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. Testing shortages are also a problem.\n\nShe has been telling death investigators around the country to save specimens for future testing. The CDC recently used such tests to discover two coronavirus deaths that reset the public understanding of when infections began spreading in California, she noted.\n\n\"You may not have the testing you need today but you probably will at some point,\" Aiken said.\n\nShe also offered one surprising observation: Stay-at-home orders may be keeping many people off the roads in some places, but that doesn't necessarily mean car crash deaths are down.\n\n\"In my area, they're probably about the same, because the few people that are out are deciding that they want to drive crazy because there's no other traffic, and then they have wrecks,\" said Aiken.",

    "Class action suit aims to free all transgender ICE detainees": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A coalition of LGBTQ and immigration activists filed a class action lawsuit last week demanding the immediate release of all transgender detainees in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention, alleging that because of the rapid spread of the coronavirus in these facilities, \"ICE's failures have made detention centers death traps for transgender people in civil immigration detention.\"\n\nThe federal suit, filed Thursday in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by the Transgender Law Center, Ballard Spahr LLP and the Rapid Defense Network, alleges that conditions inside ICE facilities are woefully inadequate to stop the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and that detainees cannot practice social distancing. It claims that transgender prisoners in civil immigration detention constitute a \"class\" and seeks a class action injunction ordering their immediate release.\n\nThey constitute a class, the suit claims, in part because \"as a group they are more likely to have underlying medical conditions making them vulnerable, such as infection with HIV, diabetes and high blood pressure.\"\n\nBallard Spahr partner Leslie E. John said class action is a good strategy to secure relief for a constantly shifting at-risk group, like those who move in and out of civil immigration detention.\n\n\"I think you can show that there are common failures in these ICE detention centers that make it an efficient way for the court to deal with it as a class action,\" John said. The suit estimates that there are somewhere 60 to several hundred transgender people currently in ICE detention and says that community organizations are prepared to receive them in the case of a mass release.\n\nSworn statements from over a dozen petitioners, whose names were redacted for privacy reasons, were included in court documents: C.G.B., a trans woman, said she was alarmed when a new detainee placed in her bunk bed began \"coughing uncontrollably\" and was later \"returned to the general population.\" C.G.B. said she was tested for COVID-19 after displaying symptoms but her results were never given to her.\n\n\"She is being held in a pod with a dozen other detainees suffering from COVID-19 symptoms, two of whom have confirmed cases of the disease,\" the lawsuit alleges.\n\nMany of the declarations allege that there are few, if any, social distancing procedures in place at ICE detention centers.\n\nSeveral HIV-positive detainees at the Nevada Southern Detention Center -- including K.M., a Haitian transgender woman who has been detained there since March 2019 -- allege that staff at the facility sometimes do not provide them with medically necessary HIV medication, causing missed doses.\n\n\"We have known for years and years and years that transgender people are not getting the medically necessary care they need in immigration detention, so that wasn't a surprise,\" Lynly Egyes, the Transgender Law Center's legal director, said of the claims out of the Nevada center.\n\nEgyes said she and her organization started hearing reports from detainees about inadequate COVID-19 prevention measures over the past two months and connected with the Sante Fe Dreamers Project, a group in New Mexico whose social workers and attorneys investigated the claims inside several facilities scattered throughout the Southwest.\n\nThe declarations, many collected by Santa Fe Dreamers, paint a picture of crowded, unsanitary facilities where it is largely impossible to practice any form of social distancing. Detainees cannot frequently wash hands, detention staff do not wear masks and people who are visibly ill are housed close to those who are not, according to the declarations.\n\nIn an email sent to NBC News, ICE said it could not comment on pending litigation but said the issue of medical decisions and humanitarian releases are an ongoing issue.\n\n\"Due to the unprecedented nature of COVID-19, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is reviewing cases of individuals in detention deemed to be at higher risk for severe illness as a result of COVID-19,\" ICE said in an email. \"Decisions to release individuals in ICE custody occur every day on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nNBC News did not receive a response to a request for comment from the Department of Justice.\n\nICE's own statistics show that the coronavirus is spreading rapidly throughout its detention facilities. The first infection was reported on March 19, and by late April there were over 400 confirmed COVID-19 cases in dozens of immigration detention centers across the country.\n\nR. Andrew Free, an immigration attorney based in Tennessee, said he is alarmed by estimates of the rate of infection of COVID-19 in ICE's crowded facilities. Free cited a forthcoming study in the Journal of Urban Health that modeled the virus' r naught (a measure of how many people each single contagious person infects) in ICE facilities under \"optimistic\" and \"pessimistic\" scenarios of 2.5 and 7 people infected respectively, and forecast that nearly three quarters of ICE detainees would be infected with the coronavirus within 90 days under the most optimistic scenario possible. The pessimistic scenarios forecast 100 percent infection rates in ICE centers well before three months.\n\nTraci Green, the lead author of the forthcoming study and a researcher at Brandeis University, said that the data show ICE detention facilities, in terms of social distancing, are \"even worse than prison or jail, and they're not equipped for COVID-19.\"\n\n\"It's pretty stunning to see without doing anything, nearly every facility will have a pretty high infection rate,\" Green added, calling these \"totally unnecessary hospitalizations\" that will likely overwhelm surrounding hospitals. The study, reviewed by NBC News before publication, predicted that COVID-19 outbreaks at nine ICE detention centers would fill all the ICU beds at hospitals in a 50-mile radius.\n\nFree said he and other immigration attorneys will be looking carefully at whatever filings the federal government submits in response to the Transgender Law Center suit by the Friday deadline, because of an alleged pattern of mismatching COVID-19 data from ICE.\n\nGregory Copeland, co-legal director of Rapid Defense, a legal services group that provides pro bono representation to people facing deportation, said this suit could help watchdogs. \"One of the benefits of these types of litigation is it creates, at a minimum, some kind of oversight of ICE and the government and what they're doing,\" he said.\n\nIn January, just before the coronavirus outbreak began, a group of 45 Democratic lawmakers sent a letter calling on ICE to release all transgender detainees after a string of deaths of trans people held in immigration detention.\n\n\"This already vulnerable population faces a heightened and unique set of injustices while in immigration detention,\" the letter stated. \"Transgender migrants and asylum seekers are particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment, solitary confinement, physical assault and medical neglect.\"\n\nAt least two transgender migrants have died in ICE custody in the past two years. Roxsana Hernandez Rodriguez, a Honduran, died of complications from untreated HIV in 2018. Rodriguez did not receive antiretroviral therapy while in ICE custody, despite guidelines mandating that all detainees receive the minimum standard of care, which for HIV infection is antiretroviral therapy. Last year, another HIV-positive transgender migrant, Johana Medina Le\u00f3n from El Salvador, died shortly after being released from ICE custody, where she had requested medical assistance.\n\nAfter reports of serious health care lapses, all transgender detainees that had been at ICE's dedicated transgender facility in Cibola, New Mexico, were transferred to other locations in January.",

Another 24 laboratories are conducting their own antibody testing without having obtained FDA authorization.\n\nIn contrast, the FDA has actually verified and authorized just eight tests.\n\nAmid an ongoing investigation, the House Oversight subcommittee on economic policy sent letters Tuesday demanding test data and a list of all purchasers from four companies that have claimed that their tests are more accurate than the California researchers' data shows.\n\n\"The discrepancies in these performance characteristics are deeply troubling,\" the subcommittee's chairman, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said in the letters, which were obtained by NBC News.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe antibody tests, a pillar of reopening the economy, were rushed to the U.S. market without review by the FDA.\n\nThe emergency policy to speed up availability of antibody tests -- which tell you whether you once had the virus -- was intended to avoid the excruciating delays the U.S. faced in ramping up diagnostic tests -- which tell you if you currently have COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus.\n\nScientists still don't know whether people who test positive for antibodies have immunity to COVID-19 and, if so, how much. But identifying who's already had the virus is critical to assessing when social distancing can be eased and who can safely return to work, with the Trump administration considering issuing \"immunity certificates\" to those who've already had the virus.\n\nThat's why doctors and researchers are particularly concerned about false positives.\n\n\"The concern here is that these tests are giving people this false sense of security, that they're going to go out and they're not going to protect themselves or protect other people from them,\" said NBC News medical correspondent Dr. John Torres. \"They could be spreading coronavirus or catching it.\"\n\nAlthough the FDA hasn't announced any accuracy benchmark that tests must meet, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, has cited 90 percent \"test specificity\" as the bar to meet.\n\nTest specificity refers to how many negative samples accurately test negative. So a specificity of 90 percent means the test produces a false positive the other 10 percent of the time. For other common medical tests, a specificity of 95 percent or 98 percent is often the industry standard, medical experts say.\n\nMarson and a team of researchers at UC San Francisco and the University of California, Berkeley, have spent months analyzing a dozen of the more than 150 tests on the market. They used the tests to test \"known positive\" blood samples -- from coronavirus patients -- as well as \"known negative\" samples from 2018 or earlier, long before the coronavirus started circulating.\n\nFour of the 12 tests produced false positives for the pre-2019 samples at least 10 percent of the time. One test -- from Anhui Deepblue Medical Technology Co. -- triggered false positives 16 percent of the time. Only one test -- from Sure Biotech -- detected samples negative for antibodies 100 percent of the time.\n\nThe accuracy results were even worse for samples from patients known to have had COVID-19. With one exception -- a high-performing test from Jiangsu Bioperfectus Technologies -- none of the other tests exceeded 91 percent accuracy rates for detecting either IgG or IgM antibodies for the coronavirus, even for samples taken 20 or more days after patients noticed symptoms.\n\nResearchers from the two University of California schools cautioned that the results are preliminary and haven't yet undergone peer review. But the early results are alarming enough that the House subcommittee is urging the FDA to revise its policy to require antibody test makers to apply for FDA approval and to allow only effective tests to be sold.\n\nUnder an FDA policy announced in March, all that labs and manufacturers must do before starting testing is assert that they've validated the tests themselves. They are encouraged but not required to submit the data for FDA review or emergency approval.\n\nThose selling unapproved tests must inform people in the test results that the tests haven't been FDA-reviewed and \"should not be used as the sole basis\" to determine whether someone has had COVID-19.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nBut House investigators have raised concerns about whether the requirements are being followed, and they identified at least one company whose written materials suggested that people who tested positive for IgG antibodies, which the body starts making later in the disease process, are assumed to have \"functional immunity\" and can return to work or discontinue social distancing.\n\nIt's unclear how much policing the FDA is doing when test manufacturers overstate the applicability of their tests. House Oversight Committee staff members found that the FDA has no dedicated staff focused on enforcement regarding antibody tests. The same FDA officials who review applications for emergency authorization are given the double duty of monitoring the market and acting on violations.\n\nFDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn has said \"we have and will\" take action \"such as issuing Warning Letters\" telling companies to stop making false claims. But the FDA didn't respond to inquiries about how many letters have been issued or whether the agency has pursued any civil or criminal actions against violators.\n\nConcerns about the tests' accuracy come amid continued uncertainty about whether having coronavirus antibodies proves future immunity and about which of the antibodies produced by the body in response to the virus confers immunity. Experts have said it may take months for answers.\n\n\"I would clearly tell people not to rely on tests at this point to see if they are immune to future infections with COVID-19,\" Marson said.\n\nEven if individual results can't fully be trusted, the antibody tests can still be useful for public health, because they can be used on a wider scale to assess what part of the population more or less has been exposed to the virus. In New York, early results from a state program that has tested thousands of people found exposure rates as high as almost 25 percent in New York City.\n\nBut in most parts of the U.S., the percentage of all people who have contracted the coronavirus is assumed to remain in the single digits. That means that if a test is producing false positives for 10 percent of people who take it, the test is actually producing more false positives than true positives.\n\nFaulty antibody tests have already created major problems in some places. Last month, the city of Laredo, Texas, spent half a million dollars on 20,000 coronavirus antibody tests that then failed the city's efforts to validate them. The Department of Homeland Security ultimately seized the tests.",

    "Connecticut launches bold new approach to virus crisis: COVID-19-only nursing homes": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MERIDEN, Conn. -- The single-story red brick building looks unremarkable on the outside. But this nursing home in central Connecticut is now the site of a novel approach to protect the population most vulnerable to the coronavirus.\n\nConnecticut is among a handful of states to open COVID-19-only facilities that provide an environment specially designed to handle infected patients -- and help prevent outbreaks at other nursing homes.\n\n\"This is really the safest approach,\" said David Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School.\n\nThe deadly virus has wreaked havoc across the country, killing more than 80,000 people. No institutions have been hit harder than nursing homes, where outbreaks are particularly dangerous for the highly concentrated populations of the ailing and the elderly.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIt is estimated that a third of nursing homes nationwide have at least one COVID-19 case, according to Grabowski, in part, he said, because \"nursing homes have been in the back of the line in terms of getting testing and personal protective equipment.\"\n\nIn Connecticut, more than 50 percent of the state's known COVID-19 deaths are linked to nursing homes, according to the latest figures, a total of 1,627 long-term care patients.\n\nOf the 213 registered nursing homes in Connecticut, at least 159 have had positive cases and 146 have had deaths as of May 6, according to state health department data. Three facilities have had more than 100 residents test positive.\n\nThe figures are expected to rise dramatically in the next week as testing is expanded across the state.\n\n\"I'm terrified,\" Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont said.\n\n\"Nursing homes are like a petri dish for this pandemic,\" added Lamont, who pushed the plan for facilities restricted to coronavirus patients only.\n\nThe new centers are intended to be the first stop for nursing home residents who are released from the hospital after having been treated for COVID-19. The facilities can also provide a critical service to seniors who are hospitalized with the virus and need rehab after their stints or for COVID-19 patients in nursing homes that are unable to safely segregate infected residents.\n\nIn all of the cases, keeping the patients in a COVID-19-only facility ensures that they will get specialized care and avoid potentially exposing seniors at other nursing homes.\n\nThe state has four free-standing centers, including the single-story facility in Meriden called Westfield Specialty Care Center.\n\nNBC News was granted an exclusive tour of the 90-bed facility before it accepted its first residents on May 1. The building was previously used as a nursing home, but it shut down in November.\n\nThat makes it an ideal candidate to be used for COVID-19 patients only, according to experts like Grabowski.\n\n\"You're not displacing existing residents by moving nursing home residents out of a building to create a COVID-specialized facility,\" Grabowski said.\n\n\"You have adequate infection control and personal protective equipment. This is really what we want to see in terms of a specialized COVID facility, and this is really what many clinical leaders and what many nursing home leaders around the country are calling for.\"\n\nMeriden Mayor Kevin Scarpati acknowledged that some people living in the community were concerned about opening a facility catering to people suffering from the virus.\n\n\"But one thing that I think we've embraced is the fact that there is a need,\" Scarpati said. \"There's a need for these individuals who are needing to transition out of a dangerous environment in a hospital before they go back and potentially cause infection for other residents in their nursing homes.\"\n\nUpon entering the center, staffers are screened for symptoms and their temperatures are taken. Staffers said in interviews that they have no fears working at a facility replete with COVID-19 patients in large part because they have proper personal protective equipment, or PPE, and training.\n\n\"I'm in that critical age group, and I'm not concerned,\" said the facility's head administrator, Donna Orefice. \"We have the proper PPE. We have proper infection control procedures. We're keeping our staff to individual units so that people aren't crossing.\"\n\nOrefice said she didn't need to spend time convincing her family that she should accept the job. \"They know what kind of person I am,\" she said.\n\nDr. Anu Walaliyadda, the facility's medical director, said providing a place for the elderly to go when they leave the hospital will also help alleviate the burden on area medical centers. He said recovering coronavirus patients of any age would be welcomed in Meriden.\n\n\"It's whoever that is needed,\" Walaliyadda said, noting that younger COVID-19 patients sometimes need additional rehab after they leave the hospital. \"They can come to a place like this and recover.\"\n\nCreating COVID-19-only facilities presents numerous challenges. Chief among them: Where do you find the space?\n\nUnable to find other empty facilities like the facility in Meriden that could quickly be repurposed, Connecticut officials decided to move healthy residents out of two existing homes to turn them into coronavirus-only centers.\n\nState health officials have said they agonized over the decision, knowing that moving nursing home residents can lead to poor outcomes.\n\n\"It's really traumatic to move long-stay residents,\" Grabowski said. \"That's a policy that's really not putting the nursing home residents first.\"\n\nThat the nursing home system across the country is under unprecedented strain should come as little surprise, Grabowski said.\n\n\"Nursing homes have always been this forgotten setting,\" he said. \"They've been underfunded. Oftentimes we have a workforce that is underpaid and underappreciated. Nursing homes are forgotten in many respects.\"\n\nSo when the coronavirus struck, it hit many facilities filled with vulnerable elderly particularly hard.\n\nThe crisis isn't just among the residents -- staff members are struggling, too. About 40 percent of the workers in 13 nursing home facilities in Connecticut are out sick with COVID-19 or are quarantining at home, according to Rob Baril, president of the SEIU Healthcare 1199 union. And that often means fewer staff members are available to take care of sicker residents.\n\nBaril said he doesn't believe that a small number of COVID-19-only facilities are going to make a significant impact on slowing the death toll. \"The overwhelming majority of the cases of nursing home residents who are ill are outside of the state's\" COVID-19-only facilities, he said.\n\nGrabowski believes it is a good first step, especially when combined with other moves the state is taking.\n\n\"Connecticut deserves a lot of credit, he said. \"They're testing everyone -- staff and residents -- they're providing personal protective equipment for the staff and then finally creating these specialized COVID facilities.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe federal agency that oversees nursing homes isn't keeping track of coronavirus-only facilities.\n\nThe nursing home crisis has plagued governors around the country.\n\nIn New York, the hardest-hit state, Gov. Andrew Cuomo has drawn criticism for his response to outbreaks in nursing homes, including a mandate that required the facilities to take back coronavirus patients being discharged from hospitals.\n\n\"If you can't provide adequate care to a patient, you must transfer the patient,\" Cuomo said last month. \"If they cannot transfer a patient to another facility, they should call the Department of Health ... and the Department of Health finds a facility.\"\n\nThe governor said repeatedly that if nursing home operators couldn't find appropriate transfers, the state would.\n\nCuomo has also faced scrutiny for saying it's \"not our responsibility\" to provide protective equipment like masks and gowns to privately owned nursing homes, although the state has now done so.\n\nOn Sunday, Cuomo announced a policy shift aimed at providing new measures to protect the 100,000 New Yorkers living in nursing homes. Under the new policy, hospitals aren't allowed to release COVID-19 patients to nursing homes. They now must hold on to the patients or send them to one of the state's COVID-19-only facilities. Cuomo also says he is mandating that all nursing home staffers be tested twice a week.\n\nLamont, the Connecticut governor, said his office has devoted considerable time and effort to securing protective equipment and testing supplies for his state's nursing homes.\n\n\"I've gone to every single broker from China I can find,\" Lamont said. \"I've gone down on bended knee to the Mike Pence commission and said, 'This is what you need to do.' And most importantly, I've worked with all the private vendors I could, the major businesses that are responsible for this, and that's how we're getting significant loads of PPE and testing we wouldn't otherwise get.\"\n\n\"I think, especially in a crisis, the buck stops right here,\" Lamont added.",

    "Connecticut town tests 'pandemic drone' to detect fevers. Experts question if it would work.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Police in Westport said the drone would \"provide better health monitoring support for potential at-risk groups,\" and would not be used to observe people in private yards.\n\nA Connecticut police department said it plans to begin testing a \"pandemic drone\" that could detect whether a person 190 feet away has a fever or is coughing.\n\nBut an expert on viruses and a privacy advocate question whether such technology can work and, if it does, whether it would help in controlling the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe Westport Police Department and the town's top elected official, First Selectman Jim Marpe, said the goal is to use the technology as part of a pilot program to \"flatten the curve\" of the pandemic.\n\n\"We know that social distancing is working to flatten the curve and ultimately saving lives,\" Marpe said in a statement. \"In an effort to continue safeguarding the citizens of Westport during the COVID-19 outbreak, and as we position ourselves to gradually return to our routines, we should explore ways to prevent a possible resurgence of the virus.\"\n\nHe praised the police department for exploring \"smart solutions\" that can keep residents safe.\n\nWestport, a wealthy community of about 29,000 an hour north of Manhattan, has 198 cases of coronavirus and five deaths.\n\nConnecticut has over 20,300 confirmed cases, with more than 1,400 deaths.\n\nThe town's police department said in a release that the drone could help to \"provide better health monitoring support for potential at-risk groups,\" and that it would not be used to monitor people in private yards and does not use facial-recognition technology.\n\nPolice Chief Foti Koskinas said one of the biggest obstacles in fighting the virus has been determining how far it has spread in the community, and a drone could help solve that problem.\n\n\"Using drones remains a go-to technology for reaching remote areas with little to no manpower required,\" the police chief said in a statement. \"Because of this technology, our officers will have the information and quality data they need to make the best decision in any given situation.\"\n\nIt is not clear what actions police might take if a drone detected a person with fever.\n\nNBC News reached out to police, Marpe and the company that developed the drone, Draganfly, on Wednesday, but did not immediately hear back.\n\nThe company said in a statement that the technology can detect fever, coughing, sneezing and heart and respiratory rates, and that Westport police plan to use it to protect those considered high-risk, such as senior citizens, and monitor people gathering in crowds, including to see if they are maintaining social distancing.\n\nBut David McGuire, executive director of the ACLU of Connecticut, cautioned against the use of technology as a way to stop the spread of the coronavirus and said more information is needed about what data the drone will collect and if that data will be stored or sold.\n\n\"The COVID-19 virus is a grave public health risk, so we shouldn't write off tools that might help mitigate the problem,\" he said in a statement. \"But we also must recognize that technology is no magic pill to stemming the pandemic. Towns and the state should be wary of self-interested, privacy-invading companies using COVID-19 as a chance to market their products and create future business opportunities.\"\n\nMcGuire also expressed doubt that the drone's technology could accurately detect if a person's symptoms are related to the virus. He noted that some people with the virus are asymptomatic and that others who have a fever or cough may not be infected.\n\n\"Even if this drone-based remote system detection technology is accurate, it may not be helpful in stopping the spread of COVID-19,\" he said.\n\nDr. Joseph Fair, a virologist and epidemiologist, expressed a similar view to NBC News in March, saying, \"Temperature checks are things that we mostly do out of an abundance of caution, but they're mostly a visual measure that makes you feel better.\"\n\n\"It makes you feel like you're going through some kind of screening, but they have very limited effectiveness,\" he said.\n\nThe Westport Police Department launched a drone program in 2016 to help dive teams in locating submerged objects and victims. It later expanded the program for assistance in accident investigations, documentation of scenes and search-and-rescue.",

    "Convalescent plasma is safe to treat COVID-19: nationwide study": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The most comprehensive national study to date has found that convalescent plasma appears to be safe to use on COVID-19 patients, a promising development in the race to find a treatment for the deadly virus. But the study didn't determine whether the treatment works.\n\nA team of more than 5,000 doctors from over 2,000 hospitals and laboratories have been testing the experimental therapy, which involves transfusing the antibody-rich blood serum of recovered COVID-19 patients into people who are battling the illness.\n\nOf the 5,000 seriously ill patients who received blood plasma transfusions for the study, fewer than 1 percent experienced serious adverse events. The mortality rate seven days after treatment was 14.9 percent, but the researchers noted the infusion patients were already gravely ill and the rate \"does not appear excessive.\"\n\nFor more on this story, tune in to NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt tonight at 6:30pm ET/5:30pm CT or check your local listings.\n\n\"These early indicators suggest that transfusion of convalescent plasma is safe in hospitalized patients with COVID-19,\" says the report, which was authored by researchers at several institutions, including the Mayo Clinic, Michigan State University and Johns Hopkins.\n\nThe study hasn't undergone peer review or publication in a scientific journal. The results were posted on a public server, called MedRxiv, so that other scientists could quickly review the data.\n\nThe study wasn't designed to evaluate the effectiveness of the treatment. But the researchers said the results were promising.\n\n\"Although this study was not designed to evaluate efficacy of convalescent plasma we note with optimism the relatively low mortality in treated patients,\" the report says.\n\nConvalescent plasma therapy isn't a new form of treatment. It has been used to fight past virus outbreaks, including Ebola, influenza and SARS.\n\nBut it hasn't been used widely in the United States for decades, and its effectiveness has never been scientifically established due to a lack of robust trials.\n\nThe study notes that the most common complication of convalescent plasma therapy is transfusion associated circulatory overload (or TACO), which occurs when a patient cannot tolerate the increased blood volume that results from the transfusion of plasma. Researchers were also concerned about the possibility that the antibodies infused into patients could lead to the formation of new infections.\n\nBut the 5,000 transfusions studied resulted in few such complications, the report says.\n\nA total of nearly 10,500 COVID-19 patients have now received the treatment at facilities across the country, according to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.\n\nDoctors at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, which is part of the national coalition, have used it on more than 350 COVID-19 patients.\n\nDr. Nicole Bouvier, one of the leaders of the hospital's plasma program, said an analysis of their first 39 patients suggests it is most effective when used in the early stages of the virus.\n\n\"It's not a magic bullet. It doesn't cure everybody,\" she said. \"But on the whole, patients who have gotten convalescent plasma have gotten better, quicker and more often, than similar patients who didn't get convalescent plasma.\"\n\nOne of those patients was Claudia Garcenot, a New York City woman who contracted COVID-19 about six weeks ago.\n\nGarcenot is the chief nursing officer at Mount Sinai Brooklyn, a bustling hospital hit by an influx of coronavirus patients throughout the month of March.\n\nOne day near the end of the month, Garcenot felt a wave of fatigue followed by shortness of breath. Her symptoms soon worsened, prompting her to go to a hospital where she tested positive for COVID-19. A chest X-ray revealed she had bilateral pneumonia as well.\n\nGarcenot went home to recover but her condition worsened as her breathing became more labored.\n\nShe rushed to her hospital's emergency room.\n\n\"Of course, I heard all those horror stories about this is what happens with COVID,\" Garcenot said. \"You get sick. You don't feel well. Then you get viral pneumonia and then you end up on a ventilator.\"\n\nGarcenot was eventually admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan because no beds were available at her hospital. A few days later, when it appeared she ran the risk of being put on a ventilator, Garcenot found out she was a candidate for convalescent plasma treatment.\n\nAs the medical team described the process, the severity of her condition set in.\n\n\"I really wasn't a nurse at that moment,\" Garcenot said. \"I was a really frightened, sick patient, who was worrying about surviving.\"\n\nShe received two doses of convalescent plasma April 5, a process that took four hours. Just over a day later, she woke up in the morning feeling like a different person.\n\n\"I remember taking that first deep breath,\" Garcenot said. \"Even though I still felt the tightness in my chest, I felt like I had oxygen.\"\n\n\"I breathed in again and I thought to myself, 'It's got (to be) the plasma,'\" she added. \"I felt like I'd won the lottery.\"\n\nSome 48 hours later, with her fever gone and her oxygen levels back to normal, Garcenot was discharged from the hospital.\n\nWhile researchers may not have yet come to a conclusion about the effectiveness of convalescent plasma, Claudia Garcenot has.\n\n\"I really believe that receiving that plasma treatment is what changed the course of my illness,\" she said.",

To be safe, though, \"it may be wise to avoid sexual contact with men until they are 14 days without symptoms,\" Dr. Peter Schlegel, the group's immediate past president, said in a statement.",

    "Countries weigh issuing \"immunity passports\" to former virus patients": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A screen shows a thermal imaging system taking the body temperature of a customer carrying bags at the entrance to a reopened commercial center in Santiago, Chile.Ivan Alvarado / Reuters\n\nGovernments and health agencies around the world are considering issuing \"immunity passports\" to help restart their economies -- documents certifying that the holders are immune to COVID-19 because they've already had it.\n\nBut global health authorities warn that such documents would be unreliable and potentially dangerous.\n\nChile's Ministry of Health recently announced that it would issue \"release certificates,\" in the form of smartphone QR codes, to people who are 14 days clear of COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nThe certificates would allow such people to travel and re-enter the workforce with -- in theory -- a reduced risk of infection.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization says there's no proof that being infected once with the coronavirus makes a person immune. And critics warn that granting additional freedoms to people who are theoretically immune would risk creating a black market for certification - and even create an incentive for deliberate infection.\n\nAs of Monday, May 4, Chile had 20,643 confirmed cases, with 270 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Medical professionals are warning that the country is ill-equipped to deal with a second outbreak if the new program fails.\n\n\"It is not a good idea because it gives the population a pause in protection and that means they are going to move everywhere and spread the virus in lots of different places\" said Dr. Mat\u00edas Libuy, a critical care doctor in the capital, Santiago.\n\nStill, the Chilean government is pushing ahead. It points to a distinction between being \"immune\" and \"less likely\" to fall ill -- and some doctors agree.\n\n\"We're seeing this more as a discharge or recovery card,\" said Dr. Maria Belcells, an infectious disease specialist in Chile. \"There's a subtle difference between an immunity card and a recovery card.\"\n\nDespite the uncertainty, other governments around the world are also considering issuing immunity passports as they ease lockdowns.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that, prior to the WHO guidance, a form of immunity passports was \"being discussed.\" And British Health Secretary Matt Hancock has floated the idea of \"immunity bracelets.\"\n\nBut Dr. Philippa Whitford, a U.K. lawmaker and a former surgeon, said she worries about stigmatizing people.\n\n\"We normally avoid having anything that gives away your health status or health record that is physically visible,\" she said. \"This idea that you're looking at whether people have got a certain colored bracelet, and particularly if they don't have that bracelet, and how they might be reacted to.\"\n\nIn Germany, too -- a country praised for its high testing numbers and low infection rate -- officials are looking into issuing licences to those who have recovered.\n\nLaboratories across Germany are conducting more than 100,000 swab tests per day. The Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig is part of an initiative that could start providing certificates to people who test negative for the disease.\n\nItaly, too, is starting to conduct immunity tests this week in hopes of issuing licences to those with antibodies. The study is being conducted in the region of Lombardy, which accounts for nearly half of the country's COVID-19 deaths.\n\nIn China, a similar system is being used. At checkpoints throughout Wuhan, where the pandemic first erupted, citizens must present QR codes on their cellphones that rate the user's risk of catching the coronavirus.\n\nA traffic light system uses green to grant the holder unrestricted movement. Yellow requires seven days in quarantine, while red requires 14 days. .\n\nHarvard University bioethicist Glenn Cohen said he worries that some people might be tempted to intentionally expose themselves to the virus in the hope they can battle through and then get back to work.\n\nAnd there is concern that some people could resort to illegal tactics to get an immunity badge, creating a black market.\n\n\"I'm really worried about the diverting of resources which are finite to cracking down on the black market rather than have these resources aimed at the interventions that are most efficacious in curbing infection and helping people survive,\" Cohen said.",

        "body": "\"We are just your every day ordinary family going through the toughest time of our lives losing both our parents....don't let it be you,\" one of their daughter's wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nKathleen MacDowell can hardly believe how much her life has been altered in the past few weeks.\n\nOn March 10, MacDowell and her sisters Patty, Connie and Meg were wrapping their annual \"sisters weekend\" in the city of Marathon in the Florida Keys.\n\nTheir parents, Eleanor and Peter Baker, were traveling to a New Jersey State Police reunion that same day in Melbourne, Florida, a couple hours from their winter home in Webster.\n\n\"Nothing out of the ordinary....right?? \" MacDowell wrote in a Facebook post Friday. \"Wrong...that week changed our entire lives.\"\n\nEleanor and Peter Baker, who were married for almost 62 years, died of COVID-19 a day apart, about three weeks after the reunion.\n\nMacDowell said that before their trip, she and her sisters told their parents to be conscious about washing their hands.\n\n\"There was no significant alarm in our minds at that point regarding them going to the reunion,\" MacDowell told NBC News.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis had not yet issued a statewide stay-at-home order.\n\nHer mother made sure to pack hand sanitizer, and her parents assured her the event would be small.\n\nEleanor and Peter Baker had no way of knowing that at the reunion, they would come into contact with a friend who had COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. That friend was not showing any symptoms. MacDowell said about 40 people attended the reunion and five others in addition to her parents contracted the virus but have recovered.\n\nOn March 23, Eleanor became ill and drove herself to a hospital in Leesburg, Florida, where she was immediately admitted, MacDowell said.\n\nA day later, after they could not reach their father, her sister Patti, who lives in Jacksonville, drove three hours to find him gravely ill.\n\n\"He was extremely weak and was unable to get out of bed,\" MacDowell said. \"But not in obvious respiratory distress.\"\n\nPeter Baker was taken by ambulance to the same Leesburg hospital and admitted. Patty and her husband had to be quarantined for two weeks because of contact with her father. MacDowell drove from her home in Philadelphia and picked up her sister Meg who lives in Atlanta and drove to Jacksonville so they could see their parents and buy groceries for their sister in quarantine.\n\nAbout a week later, Eleanor Baker, 84, died. Peter, 85, died the following day, April 3.\n\n\"We are heartbroken,\" MacDowell wrote in her Facebook post.\n\nShe said Friday was the first day she was able to hold her parents in some time -- but in a box. MacDowell said she drove with a sibling to pick up their parents' ashes in Leesburg.\n\nShe said she was disclosing this on Facebook because she was seeing posts from people who still think the coronavirus is \"no big deal, that they will not get sick, that it won't happen to them.\"\n\n\"Maybe not, but you might give it to someone else, or someone may give it to your Mom and/or Dad,\" she wrote. \"You will not be able to go in the hospital to comfort them, to tell them how much you love them, to be strong, to keep fighting ... it is excruciating!\"\n\nThe post was shared almost 3,000 times as of Monday afternoon and garnered more than 950 comments.\n\nIf it is you that gets sick, she continued, \"no one will be allowed to be with you either, not any of your family or friends.\"\n\n\"Imagine not being able to breathe and being scared and being alone,\" MacDowell wrote, adding that \"wonderful nurses and doctors\" could become your lifeline to your loved ones.\n\n\"Thank God for them,\" she wrote.\n\nOne of Eleanor's favorite songs was \"Ave Maria,\" so MacDowell had her daughter Melissa record a video of herself singing the song and sent it to Eleanor's nurses.\n\n\"Two of the nurses went into my mom's room and recorded our mom watching the video and sent it to us,\" MacDowell said. \"They were so kind to her, comforting her. It really is beautifully sad.\"\n\nHer father was on a ventilator in intensive care for much of his stay. MacDowell said the hospital arranged an end-of-life visit wherein Patty and their brother, James, \"suited up\" so they could be with their parents before they died.\n\n\"They brought mom up to be with dad in the ICU,\" she said. \"Mom was able to hold dad's hand.\"\n\nPatty and James were able to video chat with their siblings on that visit. When Peter was removed from the ventilator, all five of his children were able to be with him.\n\n\"As heartbreaking as it was, at least all of us were able to tell our dad how much we loved him, that he did a great job raising all of us and we would always make him proud,\" MacDowell said.\n\nIn her Facebook post, she appealed for people to continue to be vigilant about wearing masks, social distancing and washing their hands.\n\nAnd she concluded her post by writing that she hoped no one has to ever go through what she and her family has.\n\n\"We are just your every day ordinary family going through the toughest time of our lives losing both our parents .... don't let it be you,\" she wrote. \"Be safe everyone.\"\n\nPeter Baker served in the Navy and retired as a captain from the New Jersey State Police after a 32-year career. Eleanor \"had a strong faith,\" maintaining a lifelong devotion and service to the Catholic church, her family said.\n\nPeter, who was affectionately known as \"Dad,\" \"Grandpa\" and \"Poppy,\" was famous for his blueberry pancakes.\n\n\"He could fix just about anything and was always willing to lend a hand to anyone who needed help,\" his family said. \"Eleanor loved gardening and flowers, was a legendary hostess and homemaker and had a smile that lit up a room.\"\n\nThe couple were longtime residents of Mount Olive Township in New Jersey. They moved to Wallenpaupack Lake Estates, a private community in Pennsylvania, upon retirement, and traveled extensively in their motorhome.\n\n\"They loved each other dearly, raised a beautiful family and made friends with everyone they met,\" their children said.\n\nThey are survived by their five children along with their spouses, 13 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.",

    "Cuba bets on their biotech industry in the race to treat coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "HAVANA -- Communist-run Cuba, laboring under a six-decade U.S. embargo, is betting a biotech sector begun by late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro can give the Caribbean island an edge in a global race to find effective treatments for the new coronavirus.\n\nCuba is especially touting an interferon it produces, a decades old antiviral agent that boosts the immune system.\n\nThe island nation says it has been successful in treating the novel coronavirus at home and in China, and that 80 countries have already expressed an interest in buying its interferon alpha 2b.\n\nThe government is hoping that its interferon and other treatments it is developing will provide a lift to its struggling economy.\n\n\"We have good products like interferon alpha 2b that we are exporting and that open possibilities,\" Trade Minister Rodrigo Malmierca said during a recent televised roundtable.\n\nInterferons have long been used internationally to treat dengue fever, cancer and hepatitis B and C. Studies during the SARS epidemic in 2003 suggested interferons might also be useful against coronaviruses.\n\nHavana has promoted that China, where the pandemic emerged last year, included interferon in its treatment guidelines for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. One of the interferons it used is produced by a joint Cuban-Chinese venture Changheber, Cuban authorities said.\n\nCritics have accused Cuba of advocating a treatment that is unproven for COVID-19, as well as originally obscuring the fact other countries also produce interferon alpha 2b.\n\nInterferons can cause serious side effects when administered in their usual forms - injections or infusions - some of which may mirror COVID-19 symptoms, such as fever and breathing difficulty.\n\nCuba, however, says it has treated nearly all of its patients with interferon injections and credits the medicine for helping it achieve a lower mortality rate among its 1,804 confirmed COVID-19 cases - 4.1% versus an average of 5.9% for the rest of the Americas.\n\nIt has also flagged a trial at Taihe hospital in China's Hubei province at the height of its outbreak that suggests newer ways of administering interferon may help contain the virus and even prevent contagion with fewer side effects.\n\nNone of the nearly 3,000 healthcare workers who used interferon nose drops became infected with the novel coronavirus, according to an informal study report reviewed by Reuters. They included more than 500 with high exposure to infected patients, the Chinese researchers said.\n\nThe trial used interferon alpha, albeit not specifically the Cuban version, and the results have not been formally peer-reviewed or published in reliable medical journals.\n\nIn a separate trial at Union hospital in Wuhan, China, COVID-19 patients who inhaled interferon in an aerosol formulation had faster improvement in respiratory symptoms and clearance of the virus from their blood than patients who did not receive interferon, according to another informal report by Chinese, Australian and Canadian researchers.\n\nRandomized controlled trials are needed to corroborate these early findings and dozens of studies involving interferon are underway worldwide.\n\nCuba is not waiting for those results. It is already starting to use interferon nose drops for infection prevention in medical workers.\n\nInterferon, considered a potential miracle drug in the 1970s and 1980s, has a special place in Cuba.\n\nCastro, whose 1959 revolution prioritized health and education and who often took a keen interest in scientific developments, sent Cuban scientists abroad to study its production.\n\nThey swiftly figured out how to manufacture it at home and the drug was used successfully during a 1981 outbreak of hemorrhagic dengue fever. That was when Cuba's biopharmaceutical sector started to grow in earnest despite obstacles posed by the U.S. trade embargo.\n\nIt now produces most of the drugs used in Cuba as well as more than 300 products for export to more than 50 countries, including a therapeutic vaccine for lung cancer called CIMAvax.\n\nThere are now 21 research centers and 32 companies employing some 20,000 people under the umbrella of the state-run BioCubaFarma.\n\nMedicine exports brought in $442 million in 2016, according to the latest available official data, surpassing export revenue from sugar, rum or tobacco.\n\nSupporters of Cuba's success say it disproves the idea that free market competition is needed for pharmaceutical and biotech innovation. Skeptics question whether the mostly state-financed industry is in fact profitable, and whether it can flourish given Cuba's cash woes.\n\nCuba has not been able to produce enough medicines to fully meet domestic demand in recent years under strict austerity measures.\n\nBut the pandemic may present a unique opportunity for the sector to burnish its reputation and generate hard currency.\n\nBioCubaFarma President Eduardo Mart\u00ednez gave a presentation last week on a raft of drugs Cuba is testing and developing to strengthen the immune system against COVID-19, prevent a worsening of symptoms and help patients recover.\n\nIt is developing its own version of AbbVie's (ABBV.N) Kaletra, an HIV therapy being tested in combination with other drugs, including interferon, against COVID-19.\n\nMartinez said Cuba's efforts were garnering interest abroad, and he anticipates high demand.\n\n\"We are creating the conditions to introduce (these drugs) at an industrial level and to crank up their production,\" he said.",

We grieve the loss of any patient to COVID-19 or any other illness.\"\n\nBeaumont did not detail how the hospital determines who is screened for the coronavirus.\n\nHospitals and states across the county have reported a shortage of swabs and other supplies needed for coronavirus testing kits, as well as delays in securing test results.\n\nKaila Corrothers said her mother started experiencing symptoms in mid-March.\n\nGatewood, 63, drove herself to the hospital's emergency room in Farmington Hills on March 18, where she requested a test and was sent home.\n\n\"They said she wasn't severe enough and that they weren't going to test her,\" said Corrothers, Gatewood's only child. \"They told her to just go home and rest.\"\n\nGatewood went back to the hospital March 19, by which time she had developed a cough, her daughter said.\n\n\"So they gave her a prescription for cough medicine,\" Corrothers said in a phone interview Friday.\n\nHer mother's symptoms worsened.\n\nGatewood drove to the hospital again March 21 because her fever had spiked, Corrothers said. On that visit, she said her mother was told that she most likely had COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but was still not tested.\n\nGatewood went to that hospital for the last time March 23.\n\nOn March 27, Corrothers went to her mother's house and found her in bed. She was not responding when Corrothers called her name.\n\nSo she decided to take her mother, who had lost her appetite, to another hospital.\n\n\"My husband and I got her ready,\" Corrothers said. \"It was taking her a long time to catch her breath, to take any steps.\"\n\nAs they approached the door to leave, Gatewood collapsed.\n\n\"Her eyes kind of rolled back,\" Corrothers said. \"She was unresponsive. We got her back to the bed and laid her down.\"\n\nGatewood was taken by ambulance to Sinai-Grace Hospital, where she was tested for the coronavirus. She had a fever of 106 degrees. She had developed bilateral pneumonia and was intubated for more than two weeks, her daughter said. Gatewood's kidneys began to fail. Then her heart. On April 17, she was declared dead.\n\nCorrothers said what bothers her most is that her mother was not treated well at the hospital where she worked for 31 years. She hopes that people do not get discouraged from seeking help the way her mother did after being turned away multiple times.\n\n\"If people feel symptoms, go to the doctor. You're the only person who knows how you feel,\" Corrothers said. \"If you can't get treated at one hospital, go to another.\"\n\nWhen she thinks of her mother, Corrothers said there is one thought that lingers: \"This did not have to happen this way.\"",

        "body": "Diana Berrent, who started a Facebook group for coronavirus survivors, donates convalescent plasma for an experimental therapy to treat COVID-19 patients.Courtesy Diana Berrent\n\nJennifer English was sick, scared and confused. For two weeks, the Oregon City, Oregon, single mother had had no sense of taste, a fever that reached 102.5 degrees and an uncomfortable tightness in her chest.\n\nEnglish, 46, who helps manage a restaurant and bar, suspected she had the coronavirus and worried her health might worsen, leaving her incapable of caring for her son. But in phone calls and virtual doctor appointments, physicians downplayed her concerns.\n\nWhen she then started experiencing dizziness so overpowering that it caused her to collapse on her bathroom floor in mid-April, English went to an emergency room and demanded a test for COVID-19. An ER physician gave her the test, but told her she had likely had a panic attack -- even though English has no history of anxiety -- and sent her home.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nTwo days later, her coronavirus test came back positive, and English was relieved to finally have a diagnosis. But she did not get better, and doctors' suggestions -- to rest and take a prescription cough medicine -- did not help.\n\nSo she joined a Facebook coronavirus support group on a friend's suggestion, and felt instantly validated: People from all over the world were describing fevers that lasted for weeks, fatigue that wouldn't go away and a roller coaster of emotions as they coped with the unknowns of the novel illness, just as she was.\n\n\"That was huge, because I felt so alone at the time, and nobody was helping me,\" English, whose fever lingered for 31 days, said.\n\nCOVID-19 is as mystifying as it is isolating. Those who get it are often separated from their loved ones and seeking answers that the medical community does not yet have. As a result, millions of coronavirus survivors and family members of patients are turning to a different source for information and support: one another.\n\n\"These are people who are at the scariest, most frightening moment of their lives, and they're alone,\" said Diana Berrent of Port Washington, New York, a photographer who founded Survivor Corps, the Facebook group that English joined, while Berrent had the coronavirus herself.\n\nSurvivor Corps is among the biggest of such Facebook groups, but it is far from the only one: More than 4.5 million people have joined 4,000 U.S.-based COVID-19 support groups, according to Facebook.\n\nWhile medical professionals generally warn against relying on health information found online, in this case, some doctors have been open to crowd-sourced ideas -- especially as symptoms of the coronavirus persist for some patients.\n\nDr. Ashley Stoecker, a family medicine doctor with the Northwestern Medicine Regional Medical Group, joined a Facebook group, Long Haul COVID Fighters, at the suggestion of one of her patients who had been struggling with symptoms for weeks.\n\nShe posted a survey in the group to gather data about symptoms, duration of illness, and whether patients had tested positive or negative for COVID-19.\n\nThe goal has been to \"learn from the people experiencing these things on a day-to-day basis to see if there are things that can help us put together a picture in a puzzle that we don't have answers for at this point,\" Stoecker said.\n\n\"We are basically just treating the symptoms, because we don't have clear studies that have shown what can be helpful,\" she said. \"Seeing my patients suffering for as long as they are and feeling like I don't have anything to do for them is really difficult.\"\n\nLike other social media platforms, Facebook has historically struggled to contain the spread of health misinformation and says it has taken an aggressive approach to moderating coronavirus content.\n\nIn April, the social networking giant put misinformation warning labels on about 50 million pieces of COVID-19-related content. The company is also directing any users who have liked or commented on coronavirus misinformation that it has flagged to a website that debunks coronavirus myths from the World Health Organization.\n\nBut dangerous misinformation is not the only problem patients can run into when heeding suggestions online, especially with the coronavirus, experts say.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIn addition to the symptoms caused by COVID-19, the disease can complicate underlying, chronic medical conditions. Primary care doctors are trained to account for both, and treat appropriately -- something Facebook commenters who \"decide to become Dr. Google\" cannot, Dr. Jacqueline Fincher, president of the American College of Physicians, said.\n\n\"If you're diabetic or hypertensive or have congestive heart failure, going through a major illness like this can certainly impact those,\" she said. \"Maybe your blood sugar is out of whack, and that's why there's more fatigue.\"\n\nIn the Survivor Corps group, nearly 30 volunteer administrators work to make sure all posts adhere to the page's rules, Berrent said.\n\n\"If you post a scientific theory that doesn't have a scientific source attached to it, or a YouTube video made in your kitchen, or anything that is self-published, that gets taken down,\" she said. \"You can give your anecdotal information on your experience, but you can't tell other people medical advice -- unless it's 'you need to go to the emergency room right now.'\"\n\nVicki Judd, 49, of Mohawk, New York, recently asked Survivor Corps for input -- not for medical advice, but for guidance on dealing with the mental health component of the coronavirus.\n\nJudd, who works in information technology sales, had six weeks of severe coronavirus symptoms, including one week on a ventilator, and has been seeing a therapist to process the trauma of her experience. Three weeks into her recovery, she suddenly got a cough, headache and slight fever.\n\nTerrified she could be relapsing, she polled the group on how to stay grounded. Responses came flooding in: Call the doctor to see if this could be allergies; do breathing exercises; and recognize that this could be from anxiety, given everything she has been through. Judd's doctor ended up switching her allergy medications, and the symptoms went away.\n\nThe group was comforting to Judd from the moment she joined.\n\n\"It just made me sob and sob,\" she said. \"It was relief, excitement, sadness that somebody else knows what you're going through.\"\n\nOthers have found social media to sometimes be ahead of doctors' understanding of the disease.\n\nChristy Canter, 48, of Dallas, Georgia, was hospitalized twice in one week for breathing difficulties from COVID-19, and got a rash shortly after she came home. The nurse she called said it was likely a reaction to the medication she was given in the hospital. Curious if others had gone through the same thing, Canter, a homemaker, asked the Survivor Corps group and was stunned when more than 100 people said they had and that it was also on their upper body like Canter's was -- and at the same point in their recovery.\n\n\"The group confirms all the things you went through or that you sensed or felt,\" she said. \"It makes you realize, 'OK, I wasn't crazy, I'm not the only one.'\"\n\nBerrent conceived Survivor Corps as a service organization, and the group offers information on how and where to donate convalescent plasma, the antibody-rich blood product from individuals who have recovered from the disease that is being infused as an experimental therapy into patients still battling it.\n\nSome members of Survivor Corps say they take as much comfort in reading others' stories as they do in sharing their own. Bill Cudnyj, 52, of Clifton, New Jersey, joined days after a three and a half week hospital stay during which he came so close to death, he called his wife at one point to share all his passwords with her and tell her his wishes for his burial. He is still on an oxygen machine 24/7 at home, but is actively participating in the group.\n\n\"I like commenting, sharing, talking,\" he said. \"It gets you through things, because holding them in really doesn't help.\"\n\nWhile these groups are overflowing with stories of triumph over the coronavirus, not all the posts are positive. Interspersed among them are tragic updates from people informing the groups that their loved one has died from the illness, often thanking members for their support.\n\nThey are heartbreaking for everyone, but for those who feared they too would die, they can also bring survivor guilt.\n\n\"The older people obviously hurt my heart, but I'll tell you, the younger people are what make me feel guilt-ridden,\" said Judd, the New York woman who has been seeing a trauma therapist. \"It hurts me.\"\n\nCanter, of Georgia, has found that the best outlet for the guilt is in helping others. She has her first appointment next week to donate convalescent plasma.\n\nFor her, it's personal: She recently found out that shortly after she was released from the hospital, the respiratory therapist who treated her died of COVID-19.\n\n\"I don't know if he got it from me or somebody else,\" she said. \"It's just so many unanswered questions.\"\n\nEnglish, the single mother in Oregon, said the deluge of stories every day of those who are dying from the virus is overwhelming.\n\nWhat has helped her the most is messaging friends she has made through social media: individuals in New York, Dubai and Italy whom she has dubbed her \"virus buddies.\"\n\n\"The biggest thing with those three has been laughing and crying, just a release of energy and frustration and everything else,\" she said. \"Depression is so bad with this.\"\n\nShe plans to keep in touch with the friends she has made as a result of her ordeal.\n\n\"I'm hoping, at some point, to go visit all of them,\" she said, \"and go give them a big hug.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Blood samples taken from patients with COVID-19 symptoms in Berlin on March 27, 2020.Sean Gallup / Getty Images\n\nThree weeks ago, critical care pulmonologist Hugh Cassiere encountered something he hadn't seen in 24 years of practicing medicine.\n\nA 45-year-old man arrived at the hospital where Cassiere works, North Shore University Hospital on Long Island, New York, with fever and severe fatigue -- well-known symptoms of the coronavirus -- and went on to test positive for it.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nBut then the man developed a complication not usually associated with respiratory viruses: a blood clot in his leg that was so dangerous that doctors were forced to remove the leg below his knee. The development was totally unexpected, Cassiere said.\n\n\"He had no history of peripheral vascular disease, nothing that would predict\" this outcome, Cassiere told NBC News. \"That's how severe this clotting can be.\"\n\nCassiere isn't the only doctor who has noticed unusual clotting in patients with COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus.\n\n\"We're used to patients that are critically ill having a high frequency of blood clots,\" said Dr. Mark Crowther, chairman of the Department of Medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, who is a member of the American Society of Hematology. \"But nowhere near the magnitude that we're seeing in COVID patients.\"\n\nA study from the Netherlands published this month looked at data on 184 patients in intensive care with COVID-19. Nearly a third were found to have clots, which is \"remarkably high\" for ICU patients, the study authors wrote.\n\nBlood clots form when certain blood components thicken into a jelly-like mass. They can be life-threatening if they move to parts of the body like the heart, the lungs or the brain.\n\nIt's unknown whether the coronavirus itself causes blood clots or whether the body's massive inflammatory response to fight the virus is what damages blood vessels and blood cells.\n\nWhatever the mechanism, it's wreaking havoc on the sickest COVID-19 patients and doctors' ability to treat them.\n\nSome physicians are reporting increases of patients in their 30s and 40s with COVID-19-related strokes that result when clots block blood vessels leading to the brain.\n\nAnd blood from COVID-19 patients with kidney injuries is clotting so much, doctors have found, that it's clogging the filters in dialysis machines.\n\nIn some cases, intensive care doctors are finding that large catheters called cannulas are becoming clogged almost immediately in patients who are put on ECMO, a process that replaces the function of the heart and lungs if they're too damaged to work on their on own.\n\n\"As soon as you put the cannulas in and you turn the machine on, there's clotting,\" Cassiere said. \"That is very, very surprising.\"\n\nTo counteract the clotting, physicians give patients blood thinners, usually medications called anticoagulants that make it harder for clots to form.\n\nIt's not uncommon for intensive care patients to be put on such blood thinners, and physicians know to watch for excessive bleeding.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nBut complicating matters further, the drugs don't appear to be working for COVID-19 patients, even if they're given higher-than-usual amounts.\n\n\"I'm thoroughly surprised that we're not seeing a lot of bleeding, which is a little scary,\" Cassiere said. \"In the back of my mind, I'm thinking, maybe the usual anticoagulation isn't enough.\"\n\nAnother option is anti-platelet medication, such as aspirin, which works by preventing platelets in the blood from sticking together. Experts say it's too soon to recommend such drugs for COVID-19 patients.\n\n\"There's no good data on whether anti-platelet therapy for COVID-19 patients makes sense,\" Cassiere said.\n\nAnother clue that COVID-19 is causing chaos in the blood system comes from a study published in the journal Cell in March, which showed that the virus infiltrates the body by binding to a type of receptor on cells called ACE2.\n\nACE2 receptors are often found in endothelial cells, located in the lining of the heart and blood vessels. One of the main jobs of the cells is to help control blood clotting and platelets.\n\nBut until more is known about exactly how the virus affects those cells and platelets, doctors are left in search of answers.\n\n\"Nobody knows what the correct way of preventing this clotting is or if we can even prevent it,\" Crowther said. \"There are many studies going on now looking at various strategies.\"",

    "Elective surgeries set to resume, with complications and concerns": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Surgeons perform surgery in a hospital operating room.Ruben Earth / Getty Images\n\nAustin Wall left work with severe pain and knew something was not right.\n\nWall, 42, a Caterpillar dealership parts coordinator in Irving, Texas, went to an urgent care clinic nearly a month ago and was quickly sent to the Medical City Hospital in Arlington -- his kidney stones were causing problems in his digestive system and his right kidney was functioning at a loss.\n\nWhile his doctors were able to put a stent into his left kidney, they were unable to perform laser surgery to break up the large stone in his right one because of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's March 22 executive order postponing all surgeries that were not \"immediately, medically necessary to correct a serious medical condition or to preserve the life of a patient.\"\n\nInstead, the doctors sent Wall home with a catheter. He continued to work for several weeks before being placed on short-term disability because the stent and catheter prevented him from lifting more than 10 pounds. As Wall awaits surgery, his daily routine has been disrupted by the catheter and stent.\n\n\"When he wants to take a shower, we have to put a shield over his back where that tube is coming out of his kidney, so that it doesn't get wet,\" Austin's wife, Jessica Wall, said. \"We have to change the bandage every so often because from sleeping and sitting and just, you know, everyday moving, it causes the bandages to move, so we're constantly having to change those bandages. He constantly has to drain the urine from the bag, and we have to flush the bag out.\"\n\nShe said that Wall also feels as if he constantly has to urinate, but has little success. \"I kind of laugh and tease and say, now he knows what it's like to be pregnant,\" she said.\n\nAustin Wall is also a 17-year brain cancer survivor, which his wife said probably makes him a part of the immune-compromised category. He has had a number of health problems in recent years, including seizures. Jessica Wall said that a possible side effect of his seizure medicine is kidney stones.\n\n\"It's super frustrating, you know, knowing that this surgery is absolutely needed for him and because of where we are in the world right now with the coronavirus, everything is at a halt,\" Jessica Wall said. \"This surgery seems so simple to us, you know, but it's so needed for him. You can't just pick up the phone and say, 'Hey, we're ready to have this surgery.' We have to wait.\"\n\nAs COVID-19 has spread across the country in recent months, hospitals have postponed elective surgeries, nonemergency procedures such as Wall's that are scheduled in advance. Cosmetic surgery, hernia repair and cancer operations are among the wide range of elective surgeries that come with varying degrees of complexity and urgency.\n\nThe American Hospital Association published a road map to resuming elective surgeries on April 17, alongside the American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anesthesiologists and the Association of periOperative Registered Nurses.\n\nThe road map details principles and considerations for health care professionals to take into account as they start integrating more elective procedures back into their schedules. Some of the principles include timing for reopening elective surgeries, COVID-19 testing within facilities, adequate Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) supplies, conservation policies for PPE and case prioritization and scheduling.\n\nAcross the board, hospital revenues in March were down 13 percent from the same month last year, according to an April financial report by Kaufman Hall, a health care consulting firm.\n\nBy late April, more than 30 governors had issued executive orders banning or postponing elective surgeries, while others have left the decision up to the individual hospitals. Governors from more than a dozen states have loosened restraints to allow some degree of elective treatments to start again in the coming weeks.\n\nResumption of elective surgeries is a part of President Donald Trump's \"Reopening America\" plan. \"We're encouraging states around the country to restart elective surgery wherever possible even on a county by county basis,\" Vice President Mike Pence said Friday, speaking at Trump's signing of a $484 billion coronavirus relief package.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nAs states gauge whether to allow elective surgeries, surgeons and hospitals face the difficult task of balancing patients' needs with safety and equipment requirements. Postponing elective surgeries has also allowed hospitals to conserve personal protective equipment (PPE) and hospital beds for care involving COVID-19 patients.\n\n\"Coronavirus is highly infectious, and if there's a procedure that would bring people together, just like in a restaurant or an airplane, then avoiding it if it can be avoided is the best practice,\" Dr. David Hoyt, executive director of the American College of Surgeons, told NBC News. \"You have to balance that with patients that need surgery, but the urgency of it can be triaged, and that's what was done.\"\n\nSome surgeons have also shared concerns about performing elective surgeries on asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, fearful that patient mortality and ICU rates can increase significantly for those with unknown infection at the time of surgery.\n\nHospitals that resume elective surgeries need to be mindful of maintaining beds and equipment in case there are an uptick of sick patients, Hoyt said. \"I think people need to ramp up at some rates, not just do it all overnight.\"\n\nMost hospitals have come up with systems to assess the urgency of elective surgeries for their patients.\n\n\"We've continued to do urgent cases,\" Dr. Elizabeth Wick, a professor of surgery at University of California San Francisco, said. \"If they start to have symptoms, we've tried to keep a close eye on our backlog. All the cancer patients that we've postponed have been discussed in the tumor board with a multidisciplinary group.\"\n\nSurgeons at the University of California San Francisco hospital -- in the same region as the country's first known COVID-19-related death, on Feb. 6 -- devised a triage plan in early March to determine the urgency of elective surgeries. Their plan includes establishing strong leadership and communication across departments, details on ensuring hospital capacity and the equipment needed as well as preparations for an unstable workforce environment. According to the study, the staff was able to reduce their operating room volume by 80 percent under this system.\n\nThe hospital in April also began implementing preoperative testing and screening for patients undergoing surgery.\n\n\"We expect that the vast, vast, vast majority of our patients will continue to be asymptomatic, COVID-negative, even after we implement this,\" Wick said. \"So, it's just an extra reassurance that you know it's safe to proceed with surgery.\"\n\nWick also said that there is a large backlog of patients in the hospital and that it was unclear when exactly patients with lower-risk procedures will have them. She said that process will involve lots of reassurance and explanation to patients in the coming months.\n\n\"Some of those lower priority cases, patients with lower priority conditions, aren't wanting to come to the hospital, particularly with the visitor restrictions and other things in place,\" Wick said. \"I think it's going to take a lot of thought and working with the patients to sort of work through that backlog.\"\n\nThe University of Chicago hospital published a scoring system this month to aid surgeons in making decisions about elective surgeries. The \"Medically Necessary Time-Sensitive (MeNTS) Prioritization\" system allows surgeons to assess elective surgeries systematically -- evaluating risks for both patients and personnel.\n\n\"While these numbers are not meant to be strict cutoffs, as far as if it's above some number, then you can't do it and below it, you can, that sort of thing, it at least provides guidance,\" Dr. Vivek N. Prachand, professor of surgery and chief quality officer for surgery at University of Chicago, said.\n\nPrachand said that this will provide some guidance and then the threshold of whether to do the surgery can be decided, \"not only the score, but the availability of the resources and personnel in the hospital itself, depending on where it's located, not only geographically but where it's located along the COVID curve.\"\n\nElective surgeries bring in a great deal of revenue for hospitals, and as the pandemic persists, hospitals have begun to see the financial impact of postponing them. A number of hospitals have laid off or furloughed staff, or cut pay to make up for the losses. The Henry Ford Health System in Detroit announced Wednesday it was furloughing approximately 2,800 employees. University Hospitals in Cleveland reduced hours and pay by 20 percent for approximately 4,100 staff members.\n\nThe Bureau of Labor and Statistics reported a 3.2 percent unemployment rate for education and health care professionals in March, up from 2.3 percent last year, a difference of 195,000 people.\n\nHospitals were recently allocated $100 billion in federal stimulus funds. A JP Morgan Analysis found that this amount would keep hospitals afloat for two months if hospital revenues were to drop by 50 percent.\n\nHospitals received $30 billion shortly after the announcement and were supposed to start receiving payments on a weekly rolling basis starting on Friday, April 24.\n\nLocation is also a factor for reintroducing elective surgeries. This process will look different for hospitals around the country, based on a number of factors, including population size and the presence of Covid-19 cases in the community.\n\n\"I think in a hospital that has slowed down elective surgery that does not have a lot of COVID patients, they're going to be able to ramp up more quickly, and they'll feel a little safer doing so on the short term,\" Hoyt said. \"But you know, some of them, depending on the locale, may have sent physicians off to help somewhere else. They're just going to have to look at what they have, what the capacity they can create based on what they have and then come up as quickly as possible.\"\n\nAlong with the road map back to elective surgeries, the American College of Surgeons released recommendations for local resumption of elective surgeries.\n\nThere is also a gray area around the long-term outcomes that patients will experience if they do not receive the elective surgeries. The majority of Prachand's operations are for weight management, and he said that while they all seem to be elective on the surface, there is data that shows some health problems could be avoided if the surgery is completed.\n\n\"In the longer term -- two years, two and a half years after surgery -- it does appear that the benefits of the surgery helps reduce the risk of dying prematurely,\" Prachand said. \"It certainly reduces the presence of diabetes and high blood pressure and these sorts of things.\"\n\nThe way that this will affect hospitals in the long term is unclear, but there are several changes to note, including the use of telehealth, a digital resource that allows patients to connect with physicians for information and video chats.\n\nDr. Carolyn Hettrich, Chief of Shoulder Service at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that 98 percent of her surgeries are elective, so most of her days are now spent having virtual appointments with her patients.\n\n\"It's been dramatic across our department that most of our surgeons have seen dramatic reductions in the number of surgeries performed,\" Hettrich said.\n\nHettrich said that while there are positives and negatives about virtual appointments, she is able to still connect with her patients and provide them with knowledge and advice about their pain. The video aspect allows her to see her patients and do limited physical exams -- sometimes asking them to pick up household items, like a gallon of milk, to determine results for strength exams.\n\n\"Patients seem to like it,\" Dr. Hettrich said. \"It allows people to stay in their homes, they stay safe and it's still a way to kind of interact with your patients.\"\n\nHoyt also said that he thinks telecommunication will be enhanced and used more after the pandemic. He also thinks that there will be heightened sensitivity to the potential for future outbreaks as well as \"better stockpiles of equipment, more contingency plans for bed availability and more regional sharing of resources.\"\n\n\"I think there will be a lot of policies that will affect the health care system that will be governed by certainly the government, but also insurers and physicians,\" Hoyt said. \"So, I think a number of things, mostly good, will come out of this, but right now, we're still doing a lot of learning.\"\n\nFor Austin Wall, his faith in the Lord is helping him stay positive as he waits for his operation. He expects to continue waiting for his surgery even after restrictions in Texas are lifted. He and his wife pass the time by sitting in their front yard watching \"nonexistent\" cars pass by and catching some Vitamin D.\n\n\"We can either keep life shut down and just worry and have fear and anxiety, or we can choose to trust that when things do open back up, that my husband will be taken care of,\" Jessica Wall said.",

    "Exonerated man leaves prison, now in hotel quarantine: 'I could watch Netflix!'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Kevin Harrington, who was recently released after serving nearly 18 years for a murder he didn't commit, is now in a 14-day quarantine at a hotel in Michigan.Ali Lapetina / for NBC News\n\nDressed in a white T-shirt and maroon shorts, Kevin Harrington beamed as he walked out of the Macomb Correctional Facility in southern Michigan. After a few steps in the fresh air, he let go of the dolly holding his belongings and raised his hands to the sky.\n\nHarrington had spent 17 years behind bars for a murder he had always insisted he didn't commit. On Tuesday, a judge tossed his conviction and threw out his life sentence after prosecutors determined the lead detective coerced a key witness into implicating Harrington and a second man.\n\nA group of friends and relatives was outside the prison waiting for him - several of them cheering his name, his mother shaking a tambourine.\n\nBut Harrington couldn't hug them. And he still can't go home.\n\nBecause of a COVID-19 outbreak at the prison, the 37-year-old former inmate is now holed up at a hotel for a voluntary 14-day quarantine -- a confinement of sorts but one far more pleasant than what he was used to.\n\n\"I could eat Grubhub. I could watch Netflix. I get to sleep on a nice comfy bed,\" Harrington told NBC News by phone from his hotel room.\n\n\"It's been beautiful.\"\n\nSpeaking two days after his release, Harrington said he still doesn't have much in his spacious hotel room.\n\nA few pairs of clothes. His Daily Bread devotional pamphlet. And the four bags of legal work and one bag of family photos he lugged out of prison.\n\n\"That's all I had in 17 years, six months, two days and 35 minutes of being wrongfully incarcerated,\" Harrington said. \"I really like to call it being kidnapped. Because kidnapping is taking someone somewhere they don't want to be without their consent and or will.\"\n\nThe case began in late September 2002 when the body of a man named Michael Martin was found in a field across the street from his apartment building in the city of Inkster.\n\nInvestigators questioned a local woman who gave conflicting accounts of what she observed but told them several times that she had no idea who fatally shot Martin.\n\n\"You got up in the middle of the night and you saw something,\" Inkster police Detective Anthony Abdallah said to her during an interview at police headquarters, according to a transcript.\n\n\"No, I didn't,\" she said.\n\nLater in the interview, Abdallah appeared to threaten the woman. \"We don't want to leave you here and somebody take your kids, OK?\" he said.\n\nShe eventually told investigators that she saw Harrington and a second man, George Clark, assault Martin and drag him into a field -- and then she heard gunshots.\n\nHarrington was 20 years old. He had been taking classes at Wilberforce University in Ohio -- the first in his family to attend college -- but was at that point trying to figure out the next phase of his life.\n\nClark, who was 31 at the time of his arrest, had been taking care of his ailing mother who was struggling to manage severe diabetes and arthritis.\n\nThe two men had grown up in the same housing project in Inkster but they were 11 years apart in age and didn't know each other well.\n\nAt their trial, the woman took the stand and denied witnessing the shooting or hearing any shots. But she admitted to having implicated Harrington and Clark at a pretrial hearing, according to an appeals court summary of the trial.\n\nThere was no physical evidence linking Harrington or Clark to the murder, but the jury found them guilty.\n\nHarrington's verdict was overturned on appeal, and he went on to have three more trials. The next two ended in hung juries but the fourth resulted in a conviction. He was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in February 2006.\n\nClark received a life sentence after his motion for a new trial was denied in 2003.\n\nBehind bars, Harrington said he poured his energy into fighting his conviction.\n\n\"I didn't have time to be angry, bitter,\" he said. \"I had to fight. I had to read.\"\n\nThe Michigan Innocence Clinic, which is run by the University of Michigan Law School, began looking into his case in 2009.\n\nBy 2015, however, all of Harrington's appeals were exhausted and it seemed his fate was largely sealed. But last fall, the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office Conviction Integrity Unit opened an investigation into the case.\n\nA six-month probe uncovered a \"disturbing pattern of behavior from the original lead detective that involved threatening and coercing a number of witnesses,\" according to a statement from the prosecutor's office.\n\nThe unit concluded that Harrington and Clark did not receive fair trials as a result of the detective's conduct. But the prosecutor's office \"has not reached any conclusion regarding actual innocence of Mr. Harrington and Mr. Clark,\" it said in the statement.\n\nImran Syed, the assistant director of the Michigan Innocence Clinic, praised the prosecutor's office for recommending the convictions be vacated and the charges dismissed.\n\n\"Having investigated this case for more than a decade, the Michigan Innocence Clinic firmly believes in Mr. Clark and Mr. Harrington's innocence,\" said Syed, who was a second-year law student when he began working on the case in 2009.\n\n\"All of the evidence indicates that this is a case of police misconduct where two men who had absolutely nothing to do with the murder were charged, convicted and served 17 years in prison, while the true perpetrator remained at large.\"\n\nInkster police Chief William Riley said the detectives involved in the case are no longer on the force and he would welcome an outside investigation.\n\n\"We have nothing to hide here,\" Riley said. \"I'm like every other citizen that feels if a criminal act occurred in the prosecution of this case, they need to be held accountable.\"\n\nAbdallah, who served as the lead detective on the case, is now a police officer in the Detroit suburb of Harper Woods.\n\nReached Friday afternoon, he declined comment. \"Man, you can't talk to me about s--- like that,\" Abdallah said.\n\nClark was released from the Lakeland Correctional Facility on April 9. His mother never got a chance to see him walk free.\n\nShe died in 2004, just two years after Clark's arrest.\n\n\"Basically when she found out what they did to me, she gave up,\" he said. \"This is something I have to live with. But even though she's not here in the physical form, I'm sure she's looking down and seeing that justice finally prevailed.\"\n\nThe prison where Clark was held has had 393 prisoners who tested positive for the virus and nine inmate deaths linked to COVID-19, according to the Michigan Department of Corrections.\n\nClark moved in with family members in Michigan but has been social distancing. \"I never gave up hope that one day this would happen,\" he said.\n\nDue to the coronavirus pandemic, he's hardly left the house since walking out of prison, but that hasn't been a hardship for him. \"I'm enjoying every minute of my freedom,\" Clark said.\n\nAt the Macomb Correctional Facility, where Harrington was held, 84 inmates have tested positive and four have died from the virus.\n\n\"It was serious, serious, serious,\" Harrington said of the conditions behind bars. \"Think about a closed-in environment with a rampant virus ravaging through.\"\n\n\"I never experienced any symptoms,\" he added. \"But for the sake of my family, I'm sacrificing another 14 days.\"\n\nClark and Harrington are both planning to sue the state seeking $50,000 for each year they were in prison under the state's Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Act. Their lawyer, Wolfgang Mueller, is also planning to file suit against the city of Inkster and the lead detectives.\n\n\"I fully expect to hold the police accountable for what happened here,\" Mueller said. \"They flat out framed these guys.\"\n\nHarrington's first meal after leaving prison was a cheeseburger with french fries and a slice of cheesecake. His hotel stay is being paid for by the Michigan Innocence Clinic. The program was unable to also cover the cost of his meals, but a call for donations from students was answered so quickly that enough money was raised in two hours, said law student Danielle Bernstein.\n\nThe students have also begun a fundraising effort to help him cover housing and transportation costs as he adjusts to his new life.\n\nHarrington has yet to venture off the hotel grounds. He's been spending his days FaceTiming on his new iPhone with his family, watching television and reading his devotional pamphlet, as well as the two-page court document ordering his release from prison.\n\n\"I enjoy reading it,\" he said. \"It's so refreshing after what I fought for all these years.\"\n\nHe's having trouble sleeping at night. His room gets pitch black, a stark contrast to his 17 years of sleeping in a cell with a \"bright light shining into it.\"\n\nBut Harrington is not at all complaining about his current setup at the hotel.\n\n\"There's other people here.They're friendly. It's a cool atmosphere,\" he said. \"If I need more sheets, towels. They got free breakfast - muffins and granola. I can get coffee.\"\n\n\"For free!\" he exclaimed. \"All the stuff is free!\"\n\nReflecting on his quarantine status, Harrington said he thinks it's actually for the best. It gives him a chance to ease into his new life on the outside.\n\n\"I look at it as one chapter closed in my life and this new chapter is so bright and beautiful. It's almost like a transitional period for me,\" he said by phone from his hotel room. \"And being here, I'm not thrust back into the hustle bustle of life after being gone so long.\"\n\nBefore Harrington hung up, his lawyer nudged him to explain one of his final acts behind bars.\n\nHarrington said he took stock of the possessions he had accumulated after 17 years in captivity and figured there were others who needed them more.\n\nSo he walked along a wing of the prison known as the Rock and handed out nearly everything he had: his television, his clothes, his snacks and Ramen noodles.\n\n\"I was able to give out 54 items,\" Harrington said. \"I knew the hardships of going through that type of journey. I just wanted to give back one last time.\"\n\nThe only clothes he had left were the white T-shirt and maroon shorts. It was about 35 degrees outside but at that point Harrington had no other options.\n\nHe would soon head for the prison gates, where his family was waiting for him and so was the rest of his life.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Tablets on a blister pack of hydroxychloroquine on April 10, 2020, in Rio de Janeiro.Buda Mendes / Getty Images\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration on Friday cautioned against prescribing hydroxychloroquine to COVID-19 patients outside of hospital settings or clinical trials. The drug, an antimalarial, was repeatedly touted by President Donald Trump as a possible treatment for the coronavirus.\n\n\"The FDA is aware of reports of serious heart rhythm problems in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with azithromycin,\" the FDA wrote on its website.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"We are also aware of increased use of these medicines through outpatient prescriptions. Therefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,\" the FDA said.\n\nThe agency said hydroxychloroquine can still be used in hospital settings or in clinical trials, but it was not immediately clear whether some planned trials would be stopped.\n\nCardiologists have been sounding the alarm about hydroxychloroquine's heart risks for weeks, saying the drug could be deadly in a small number of patients who are susceptible to heart conditions.\n\nHydroxychloroquine, and a related compound called chloroquine, is a medication that's been around for decades. It's used to treat malaria, as well as certain autoimmune diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.\n\nEnthusiasm for its potential as a treatment for the coronavirus began to build in March, when a French study suggested hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (the antibiotic known as a Z-Pak) might benefit COVID-19 patients. The journal that published the French study, however, later said that the article did not meet its expected standard.\n\nA week later, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine, allowing health care providers to use the medicine for COVID-19 in hospitalized patients with severe disease, even though the drug had not been approved as a specific treatment for the illness, and was known to increase the risk for irregular heartbeat.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nBut the previous fervor for hydroxychloroquine has diminished. In one case, a New York woman with coronavirus symptoms died after her family said a doctor prescribed her a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin without confirming she had COVID-19 or testing her for heart problems ahead of time. The exact cause of death for the woman has not yet been determined.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also pulled back on its guidance for using hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 and no longer offers recommendations for dosage. And earlier this week, a National Institutes of Health panel of experts said doctors should not use hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin to treat the illness, citing lack of evidence.",

    "Family of New York woman blames hydroxychloroquine combo for fatal heart attack": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A New York woman with coronavirus symptoms died last week after being prescribed a drug cocktail with known cardiac side effects, and family members say she was not tested for COVID-19 or for heart problems before receiving the medication.\n\nThe family's experience suggests that at least some physicians are prescribing hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin -- drugs President Donald Trump has promoted to treat the coronavirus -- outside of hospital settings, underscoring why major medical organizations including the American Heart Association have issued warnings about the drug's potential to trigger heart arrhythmia in some patients.\n\nIn early April, Ligia, a 65-year-old Queens resident, was given the drug by her general practitioner after she reported having a bad cough, fever and shortness of breath. Ligia's last name is being withheld on the request of her children.\n\nFor full coronavirus coverage\n\nWhile Ligia's symptoms were consistent with those of COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, she was never tested for the virus, her brother-in-law, Lee Levitt, told NBC News. Ligia received the drug after speaking by phone with her doctor, Levitt said. She was never evaluated in person and received no heart screening or warning about the potential side effects.\n\n\"It was handed over like a bag of cookies,\" Levitt said.\n\nNBC News made two attempts to reach Ligia's doctor for comment. A man who answered the office phone and identified himself as the doctor then said there'd been a misunderstanding and offered to take a message.\n\nLevitt acknowledged that the family does not know that the drug caused Ligia's death. The family has not received a death certificate.\n\nTrump's promotion of hydroxycholroquine, often in televised White House briefings, has led to a surge in demand even though it hasn't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the coronavirus and doctors say its effectiveness is inconclusive. The drug is typically used to treat malaria and lupus. Azithromycin -- better known as a Z-pack -- is an antibiotic.\n\nSince March 19, Trump has frequently touted the drug during his daily news conferences. On March 21 he even tweeted that the drug combination could be \"one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.\" In one three-day period last month, the liberal watchdog group Media Matters says it found over 100 mentions of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine on Fox News, which Trump often watches.\n\nThe fanfare around the untested drug combination raised alarms among U.S. cardiologists. In an interview with NBC News last week, cardiologist Michael Ackerman of the Mayo Clinic warned physicians may be prescribing the drugs without pre-screening the cardiac health of patients.\n\nLigia's story, Ackerman said Tuesday, showed the concerns were real.\n\n\"We knew that there would be either unawareness of, disregard to, or disrespect for the drug-induced cardiac effects, he said, and that even \"well-intended efforts to treat COVID-19 could in fact cause the patient's sudden death.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, we may have been proven correct already,\" he said.\n\nLigia filled her prescription on April 4, four days before the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology issued guidance for physicians prescribing hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The AHA, in its guidance, urged caution given that \"each have potential serious implications for people with existing cardiovascular disease,\" including increased risk of sudden death. The effect of the two combined has not been studied, the AHA stated.\n\nLigia was diabetic and had high blood pressure but no known history of heart disease, Levitt said.\n\nAfter taking three doses of the drug combination, Ligia suffered cardiac arrest early on the morning of April 7, and died before paramedics could reach her. Her 40-year-old daughter, guided over the phone by emergency medical technicians, had tried unsuccessfully to revive her.\n\nAbout the same time, the daughter of one of Levitt's co-workers who tested positive for COVID-19 was prescribed the same drug cocktail despite a history of heart problems.\n\nLynn Donawald happened to call Levitt the morning after Ligia's death.\n\nDonawald's 32-year-old daughter, who had recently been diagnosed with myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, was given the prescription by a telemed doctor she'd never seen her before and who asked no questions about her underlying health conditions, Donawald said.\n\nDonawald recalled her conversation with Levitt, which took place as her daughter's husband was en route to fill the prescription.\n\n\"Stop. Stop him right now,\" Levitt told Donawald, who hung up and immediately called her son-in-law.\n\n\"When I called Lee back he was sobbing, telling me the story about his sister-in-law who had died during the night,\" said Donawald, whose daughter is now recovering from the virus. The daughter declined NBC's request to identify the doctor.\n\nLevitt said he believed it was essential for families to speak out publicly about the dangers associated with taking the drug.\n\n\"If nobody is willing to stand up and say 'This drug killed my loved one,' then others will assuredly die as Ligia did,\" Levitt said. \"It's basically a game of Russian roulette; we don't know who can tolerate the drug and who can't.\"\n\nIt is unclear how many Americans have been given prescriptions for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and its potential for treating COVID-19 is still being explored. Scientists have warned of major flaws in an initial study suggesting the drug might be effective in treating the illness, and the journal that published the study announced on April 3 that it did not meet its standards.\n\nMore recently, a study of 150 hospitalized patients by doctors at 16 centers in China found hydroxychloroquine did not help patients better than standard care and was much more likely to cause side effects. While the World Health Organization and labs in numerous countries are conducting larger clinical trials, the drug's efficacy remains anecdotal. Still, the FDA granted an emergency use approval late last month to distribute millions of doses of the drugs to hospitals across the country, to be used specifically in hospitalized patients.\n\nThe Donawald and Levitt family stories show the drug is being administered outside the hospital setting.\n\n\"This is happening,\" Donawald said. \"Not once did they ask if my daughter had heart conditions or any underlying ailments. They were just focused on the fact that she was positive\" for COVID-19.",

        "body": "The Federal Correctional Institution, Terminal Island, a low-security facility housing male inmates, in San Pedro, Calif.Kevork Djansezian / Getty Images file\n\nMore than a week has passed since Lyndsay Harrington has heard from her brother, who is locked up at a federal prison in California that houses inmates with health problems.\n\nSome 600 inmates at FCI Terminal Island, roughly 57 percent of the total inmate population, have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said. Five inmates have died after contracting COVID-19, including three in the last 48 hours, and at least 10 staff members have been infected.\n\nHarrington said her brother is particularly vulnerable because he suffers from asthma and a thyroid condition.\n\n\"We don't want this to turn into a death sentence for him,\" she said of her brother, who is also bipolar.\n\nLike others interviewed for this story, Harrington asked that her sibling not be named because her family fears prison staffers could retaliate against him.\n\nDetention facilities across the country are struggling to contain severe outbreaks of the virus, but the stakes are especially high at places like FCI Terminal Island.\n\nThe low-security prison in Los Angeles houses prisoners who have complex medical or mental health conditions but do not require 24-hour nursing care.\n\nThe facility has far and away more confirmed COVID-19 cases than any other prison in the federal system, but it's also one of the few where 100 percent of the inmates are being tested for the virus.\n\n\"As machines and test kits become more accessible to us, we are expanding testing of asymptomatic inmates at facilities experiencing wide-spread transmission,\" Bureau of Prisons Director Michael Carvajal said in a video message to staffers on Wednesday.\n\nCarvajal said Terminal Island is one of a handful of federal facilities that are working with local health departments or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to assist in testing all inmates.\n\nThe more comprehensive testing began on April 23 as part of an effort to isolate sick inmates and mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Only 10 percent of the inmates who have tested positive are exhibiting \"outward objective symptoms,\" such as coughing or fever, officials said.\n\nThe facility has set up 200 beds in \"alternative housing\" and has repurposed the prison industry factory and visiting room for inmate housing, a Bureau of Prisons spokesman said in a statement.\n\nDavid Fathi, director of the American Civil Liberties Union National Prison Project, said the surge in positive cases at Terminal Island represent the \"tip of the iceberg\" in regard to the pervasiveness of the coronavirus in the American prison system.\n\nFathi said the lack of widespread testing means \"we really have no idea\" how many people inside detention facilities have the virus.\n\n\"If the prisoner gets it today, the prison staff gets it tomorrow and it will be in the community the day after that,\" Fathi said. \"It's not just a prison health emergency. It's a public health emergency.\"\n\nFCI Terminal Island has barred inmates from using prison phones and computers to help curb the spread of COVID-19. But the move has compounded the strain on the prisoners' families, many of whom are now in the dark over the health of their loved ones.\n\nTiffany Holloway said she last spoke to her father, who suffers from congestive heart failure and is locked up on financial fraud charges, about two weeks ago.\n\n\"He sounded scared,\" she said. \"It was in his voice.\"\n\nHolloway said she felt conflicted about speaking out because she fears it could harm her father's chances of securing an early release.\n\nEarlier this month, Attorney General William Barr directed the Bureau of Prisons to release to home confinement those inmates who were particularly vulnerable to the disease and who are deemed to no longer pose a threat to the public.\n\n\"We constantly live in fear as family members because we don't want to make the wrong move,\" Holloway said.\n\nIn his last message to her, Holloway's father expressed alarm over the outbreak at the prison and wondered why he wasn't being fast-tracked for release.\n\n\"It is here. There is nothing I can do,\" he wrote in the email dated April 8.\n\n\"I have past heart issues. I have no idea what this will do to me,\" he added. He signed off the email with two words: Please help.\n\nPrison officials said the five Terminal Island inmates who succumbed to COVID-19 had pre-existing medical conditions.\n\nLeonard Auerbach, 73, died on Thursday at the local hospital where he arrived a week earlier suffering from a fever, chills and other symptoms, officials said. He was serving a 15-year sentence for production of child pornography.\n\nThe two prisoners who died on Wednesday were Rex Damon Begay Sr., 80, and Stephen Cino, 54.\n\nBegay, who was serving a 10-year sentence for child sexual abuse, had tested positive for the virus on April 19. Cino, who was serving a 23-year sentence for conspiracy to distribute drugs and money laundering, tested positive on April 23.\n\nMichael Fleming, 59, died April 19 at a nearby hospital 11 days after he was found to have COVID-19, officials said. He was serving a 20-year sentence for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine.\n\nBradley James Ghilarducci, 73, died from the virus on April 13. He was serving an eight-year sentence for receiving and distributing a \"visual depiction\" of child sexual abuse, officials said.\n\nHarrington's family last heard from her brother in a letter dated April 22.\n\n\"I'm not sure how long we will be like this,\" he wrote. \"No phone, no email, no rec, etc. It's best I don't get the virus though.\"\n\nHarrington's brother is serving a nine-year sentence on bank robbery charges. His current release date is October 2022, but his family is hoping that he, too, will be let out early for home confinement given his health problems.\n\n\"Hope you guys figure out how to get me home,\" he wrote in his letter. \"They have disabled us here obviously. Love you all very much. Be healthy and safe.\"",

        "body": "Andrea Circle Bear, who was serving a 26-month sentence for a drug charge, appeared to be the first female inmate to die of COVID-19 in federal custody.\n\nA 30-year-old federal inmate who gave birth while on a ventilator four weeks ago died from the coronavirus Tuesday, the Bureau of Prisons said.\n\nAndrea Circle Bear was serving a 26-month sentence for maintaining a drug-involved premises, the agency said in a news release.\n\nCircle Bear, of Eagle Butte, South Dakota, appears to be the first female inmate to have died in custody, according to a review of reported coronavirus-related deaths within the federal prison system.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nShe was first taken to FMC Carswell, a federal prison medical facility in Fort Worth, on March 20 from a local jail in South Dakota. As a new inmate in the federal prison system, she was quarantined as part of the Bureau of Prisons' plan to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nShe was evaluated eight days later for her pregnancy. On March 31, she was seen for a fever, a dry cough and other COVID-19 symptoms, according to officials.\n\nCircle Bear, who the agency said had a preexisting medical condition that put her at high risk for the disease, was taken to a local hospital, where she was placed on a ventilator. Her baby was delivered via cesarean section April 1, the agency said. Three days later, Circle Bear tested positive for the virus.\n\nShe was pronounced dead Tuesday, the agency said. The condition of her baby wasn't immediately clear, and the bureau didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nTwenty-nine other inmates have died in the federal prison system since March 19, when the agency reported the death of Patrick Jones, an inmate at Oakdale prison in Louisiana.\n\nSix other inmates have died from the disease at Oakdale, the last reported on April 15, according to the bureau. Other prisons hit hard by the virus include Butner, in North Carolina, and Elkton, in Ohio.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe agency has said it is expanding COVID-19 testing within its prisons. To stem the spread of the disease, it is limiting inmate movement and suspending training and travel for officials, as well as nonessential services for contractors, among other measures.\n\nSince the outbreak began, experts have warned that the virus could \"wreak havoc\" on American jails and prisons.\n\nAs of Tuesday, more than 1,700 federal inmates have tested positive for COVID-19. About 400 of them have recovered.",

    "Fever, fatigue, fear: For some COVID-19 patients recovering at home, weeks of illness, uncertainty": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "COVID-19 patients who are not sick enough to be hospitalized have little guidance on how to recover.Adrian Lam / NBC News\n\nKate Porter has had a fever nearly every day for 50 days. She can't shake the extreme exhaustion that hit when she became infected with the coronavirus nearly two months ago.\n\nThe longevity of her symptoms are unlike anything she's ever experienced. \"I know it sounds crazy,\" Porter said, \"but is this permanent?\"\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nSince her diagnosis, Porter, 35, has been in her Beverly, Massachusetts, home with her 12-year-old daughter, Adria, who also had symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nNeither has underlying health conditions that would suggest a complicated or drawn-out recovery from the virus, and neither has had to be hospitalized.\n\nAccording to data collected by Johns Hopkins, more than 180,000 people in the U.S. have recovered from COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers a person recovered if three days have passed since a fever broke without the assistance of medication, and respiratory symptoms, such as cough or shortness of breath, have improved. Negative tests can also signal recovery, but tests can be inaccurate.\n\nAfter an initial positive COVID-19 test, Porter has since tested negative for the virus, yet symptoms persist.\n\n\"I'll feel great one afternoon and think, 'I'm going to read, I'm going to do laundry,'\" Porter told NBC News. Inevitably, the fever and fatigue return.\n\nIt happens repeatedly, Porter said. \"It's like a mind game.\"\n\nAndrew Dumont, 32, of Seattle, has also tested negative for the virus after a previous positive COVID-19 test. Two months since first falling ill, Dumont still suffers from numbness in his limbs and shortness of breath -- prompting two visits to the emergency room twice in the past week.\n\nCT scans and lung x-rays showed no additional infections.\n\n\"It's really scary, because you're just kind of left at home by yourself essentially trying to treat it,\" Dumont said.\n\nCOVID-19 patients who are not sick enough to be hospitalized have little guidance on how to recover. There is no specific drug or treatment, other than rest, fluids and fever-reducing medicine such as Tylenol.\n\nBut because the virus can smolder in the body for days or weeks before potentially worsening, some physicians are increasing their vigilance for those recovering at home, alone.\n\n\"We do frequent telephone calls, checking in and telling patients what to watch out for,\" Dr. Lara Hall, clinical lead for the Cambridge Health Alliance Respiratory Clinic near Boston. \"The thing we really worry about is shortness of breath.\"\n\nExperts say trouble breathing is a sign that COVID-19 may be wreaking havoc in the body, and usually requires an emergency response.\n\nHall estimates her clinic has seen about 2,400 patients with symptoms of the coronavirus since it opened nearly seven weeks ago. About 70 percent of those patients have tested positive.\n\nSome patients may require more frequent check-ins. \"If someone's over 65 and they have diabetes or high blood pressure or heart disease or obesity, chronic lung disease,\" Hall said, \"those are people in a high risk category that we're calling every day.\"\n\n\"We call this intense outpatient management,\" she said. Some patients may need to be seen again at Hall's clinic, while others may be urged to seek care at an emergency room.\n\nMany COVID-19 patients recovering at home recount similar anecdotes of how the virus acts each day and night.\n\nMornings tend to begin normally, but as the day progresses, viral symptoms creep in \"like clockwork,\" Porter said.\n\nTemperatures begin to rise. Cognition becomes hazy. Porter describes it as a \"weird forgetfulness\" as she struggles to find words.\n\n\"Nighttime is when things start to flare up a bit more, and I just get nervous.\"\n\nAs night falls, fear takes hold. Despite debilitating exhaustion and fatigue, many patients are unable to get a good night's sleep.\n\n\"Honestly, I dread going to sleep,\" Porter said. She frequently wakes up during the night with her whole body shaking, as if she's been exposed to freezing temperatures. After a subsequent fitful rest, she often wakes up with her hair, sheets and clothes drenched in sweat.\n\nThe ongoing symptoms make Porter and other patients worry they've developed a secondary infection. However, subsequent COVID-19 tests have been negative, and other diagnostic screenings have been unable to uncover additional problems.\n\n\"I think I'm in the clear, but I'm not sure,\" Porter said, as she continues to log daily fevers. \"It feels never-ending. I am at a loss.\"\n\nDumont, too, has suffered sleepless nights because of COVID-19.\n\n\"My breathing has been so bad that last week there were three nights where I couldn't even lay down,\" he said. \"I stayed awake without any ability to sleep.\"\n\nEven doctors with a keen understanding of how viruses typically act understand recovering patients' concerns.\n\n\"As a physician, I know what can happen,\" Dr. Michael Saag, a renowned infectious disease expert at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said. Saag was diagnosed with COVID-19 in March and described the illness as a \"horror\" that included fever, muscle aches, fatigue and difficulty thinking.\n\n\"I would sit awake, counting the minutes until morning almost, wondering if my breathing was going to get worse and I'd end up on a ventilator,\" he said.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nDr. Buddy Creech, an infectious disease expert and director of the Vanderbilt Vaccine Research Program at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, expressed similar fears after he, too, was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\n\"I was just kind of watching it happen, documenting my symptoms,\" Creech said. \"It was legitimately terrifying.\"\n\nCreech's wife and three children were also diagnosed with the illness, with symptoms that varied in degree. None had to be hospitalized, and the five family members stuck it out together at first, resting and staying hydrated.\n\n\"We had flu-like illness with chills, muscle aches, headaches, but when I would take Motrin or Tylenol, I would feel great,\" Creech recalled. \"We had an epic game of Monopoly going on.\"\n\nThe family started to recover after about a week. But Creech's apparent recovery did not last.\n\n\"One of my colleagues warned me that the second week can go sideways,\" Creech said. Indeed, on day seven, he developed a more substantial cough and a fever that lasted weeks.\n\n\"I felt like I was having this inflammatory response that I simply couldn't control,\" he said.\n\nPatients like Porter and Dumont, who have had long-term symptoms, understand the value of sharing their stories.\n\n\"I was desperate for someone to tell me I'm not crazy,\" Porter said. \"It's scary to go through this for so long when there's so many unknowns about the virus.\"\n\nDumont shared his COVID-19 symptoms on Twitter, and said he's since received hundreds of messages on the social media site from other patients with similar stories.\n\n'We fall into the category of not critical and dying, but not asymptomatic,\" Dumont said.",

Andrew Cuomo said during a briefing Friday that the state department of health is investigating several related cases in children.\n\n\"This would be really painful news and would open an entirely different chapter,\" Cuomo said.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"This is an extremely rare and previously unknown presentation of COVID-19 in children,\" the Mount Sinai Health System said in a statement. \"We extend our deepest condolences to the family in the wake of this tragedy.\"\n\nNationwide, nearly 100 children have been diagnosed with the newly identified syndrome. At least eight states -- California, Delaware, Louisiana, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington -- as well as Washington, D.C., have reported cases.\n\nPediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome can mirror symptoms of other inflammatory illnesses, such as Kawasaki disease and toxic shock-like syndrome.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nChildren can have high fevers, severe diarrhea, rash and often red eyes or conjunctivitis.\n\nMost concerning is that children can develop problems with heart function. The heart doesn't pump as efficiently as it should. The problem appears to be the result of a child's immune system's going into overdrive after a COVID-19 infection.\n\nMany, but not all, children with the condition have been diagnosed with the coronavirus. At a news conference with Westchester County, New York, officials on Friday, doctors said some children don't develop symptoms until a month after exposure to the virus.\n\nA 14-year-old boy in the U.K. has also died from the inflammatory syndrome. His and other such cases in Europe were detailed in a report published this week in The Lancet.",

    "Florida official says she was ousted for refusing to censor coronavirus data": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Rebekah Jones reportedly balked at changing data to \"drum up\" support for reopening the state.\n\nThe head of the Florida public information portal that lists the number of coronavirus casualties and cases claims she was ousted from the project for refusing to censor the dismal data.\n\nRebekah Jones said the responsibility for updating the COVID-19 Data and Surveillance Dashboard was taken from her office on May 5 and, in an email first obtained by the newspaper Florida Today, she questioned the state Department of Health's pledge to maintain \"accessibility and transparency.\"\n\n\"As a word of caution, I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,\" Jones wrote. \"After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.\"\n\nIn an email to a Florida TV station, CBS12 News, Jones said her exit was \"not voluntary\" and that she was ousted after she refused to \"manually change date to drum up support for the plan to reopen.\"\n\nJones was referring to Gov. Ron DeSantis' plan to gradually reopen the state, some sectors of which were locked down to prevent the spread of a virus that as of Tuesday had claimed more than 2,000 lives in Florida.\n\nIn particular, Jones reportedly balked at removing data that showed Florida residents reported coronavirus symptoms before cases were officially announced, according to internal emails obtained by The Tampa Bay Times.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Florida Department of Health on Jones' firing and she did not immediately return calls or emails from NBC News seeking comment.\n\nBut Jones' removal comes after the state health department, without warning on April 20 stopped releasing the list of coronavirus deaths being reported by the state's medical examiners -- a tally that, at times, was reportedly 10 percent higher than the official state tally.\n\nNBC News has also reached out to the DeSantis administration to see if there is any connection between the departure of Jones and the decision to stop publishing the ME figures, which had been standard procedure before. There was no immediate response.\n\nBut DeSantis' spokeswoman Helen Aguirre Ferre sent the following statement on Tuesday to The Miami Herald:\n\n\"The Florida COVID-19 Dashboard was created by the Geographic Information System (GIS) team in the Division of Disease Control and Health Protection at the Florida Department of Health,'' Ferre wrote. \"Although Rebekah Jones is no longer involved, the GIS team continues to manage and update the Dashboard providing accurate and important information that is publicly accessible.\"\n\nThe DeSantis administration has been harshly criticized for the state's slow response to the coronavirus crisis and for failing to provide information about COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes and other long term care facilities.\n\nBut the governor's office had been praised by President Donald Trump and others for creating a COVID-19 dashboard that had given daily updates on the death toll, number of cases and coronavirus tests in every county in the state.\n\n\"This is extremely troubling,\" said Pamela Marsh of the First Amendment Foundation, a Florida-based watchdog group. \"It shows an administration willing to hide the truth to further its own agenda. As Ms. Jones pointed out in her email, the data on the dashboard was being used by scientist, health care workers, journalists and citizens who wanted to inform themselves with the most accurate, up-to-date data. With this news regarding the administration's manipulation of data, why would anyone trust the information coming out of Florida?\"\n\nEarlier, Dr. Stephen Nelson, who is chairman of Florida's state Medical Examiners Commission, confirmed to NBC that the procedure for posting the ME figures was changed in April after the state health department intervened.\n\nNelson said the information they had been providing to the state health department did not list names, but it included the probable cause of death along with the victim's demographic information and summaries of the person's medical and travel history.\n\nWhen NBC News requested the coronavirus death list from the Florida Department of Health, it was sent a compilation in which the categories \"probable causes of death\" and \"case descriptions\" were blacked out.\n\n\"Without that information, this list is meaningless,\" said Nelson. \"To me, this is a public record paid for by taxpayers and the public has a right to know.\"\n\nOnly a medical examiner can certify a death from COVID-19 in the state of Florida, Nelson added.\n\n\"The chief difference between the lists compiled by the ME's and the Florida Department of Health is that we're counting people who died here in Florida and they're not,\" said Nelson.\n\nPeople who pass away in Florida but who aren't legal residents are counted as fatalities in their home states, said Nelson.\n\n\"So our numbers are never going to be the same,\" said Nelson.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health echoed Nelson in a statement.\n\n\"Data released by medical examiners and the data released by DOH can differ based on the fact that medical examiners include non-Florida residents in their reports,\" it said. \"The State reports this data to the CDC and the state of residency but does not include it on the COVID-19 dashboard to avoid double counting with other states. This is the same protocol that other states have for Florida residents.\"",

        "body": "A member of the clinical staff cares for a patient at the Intensive Care unit at Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge, on May 5, 2020.Neil Hall / AFP - Getty Images pool\n\nBlood thinners may help keep COVID-19 patients on ventilators alive longer, a study published Wednesday suggests.\n\nIn recent weeks, physicians have noticed that the sickest coronavirus patients are more prone to forming blood clots -- an unexpected symptom for a respiratory virus.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nClotting means \"patients are at increased risk for deep vein thrombosis, strokes, heart attacks\" and pulmonary embolisms, said Dr. Hugh Cassiere, a pulmonologist and the medical director of Respiratory Care Services at North Shore University Hospital on Long Island, New York.\n\nCassiere, like many ICU physicians, has responded by treating patients with blood thinners.\n\nNow, early data indicates that using these drugs may be beneficial.\n\nIn a study published Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, researchers at Mount Sinai Health System analyzed the health records of 2,773 COVID-19 patients.\n\nA total of 395 were placed on ventilators. Among those who weren't given a type of blood thinner called an anticoagulant, 62.7 percent died, compared with 29.1 percent of those who were given the medications.\n\n\"Using anticoagulants should be considered when patients get admitted to the ER and have tested positive for COVID-19 to possibly improve outcomes,\" Dr. Valentin Fuster, the study's author and director of Mount Sinai Heart, wrote in a press release. However, Fuster added doctors should also carefully consider whether patients may have an increased risk for bleeding.\n\n\"This is an observational study and should be interpreted with caution,\" Fuster told NBC News. That means the research cannot prove the anticoagulants indeed led to fewer deaths or had any real therapeutic impact. More research, including randomized trials, will be needed to answer those questions.\n\nCassiere agreed. \"This study doesn't help us figure that out, but it is helpful because we've been anticoagulating these patients anyway based on no data.\"\n\nAnecdotally, the drugs are working.\n\nWarnell Vega, 33, arrived at the Mount Sinai Morningside's emergency room in New York City last month with a blood clot in his lungs.\n\n\"He was really in dire straits,\" said Vega's physician, Dr. John Puskas, the hospital's chair of cardiovascular surgery. \"The clot almost completely blocked blood flow to his right and his left lungs.\"\n\nVega tested positive for COVID-19 and was admitted to the intensive care unit, where he was put on several medications in an attempt to treat the virus. He was also given anticoagulants to help break up the clot.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nVega was able to go home, but still needs to take two types of blood-thinning drugs: a low-dose aspirin and the drug Eliquis, a type of anticoagulant.\n\n\"I have to take that for the next three months,\" Vega said.\n\nMore data on the effects of blood thinners on COVID-19 patients may be coming soon. Fuster's team plans to double the number of patients they're observing in a similar study, ahead of clinical trials aimed at figuring out which blood thinners and at what doses may be most beneficial.\n\nThe group also plans to study the effect of blood thinners for patients who are not sick enough to be hospitalized.",

That, combined with the 2018 Kerala floods, made it difficult for her to focus on school when she returned for her sophomore year of college, she said. It prompted her to leave school and work full time for the Sunrise Movement, a climate change political advocacy nonprofit, where she serves as training director.\n\n\"I remember having this feeling that everything that we talk about on how bad climate change is going to get,\" she said. \"It's already here.\"\n\nFor Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders like Shiney-Ajay, environmental protection is a pressing issue. They are more likely as a group to prioritize it over economic growth, compared to other racial and ethnic groups, according to AAPI Data. And for some, their ties to countries in the Asia Pacific region contribute to their dedication to protecting the planet and combating climate change.\n\nThe greatest percentage of people living in high risk climate zones are those in the Asia Pacific region and South Asia, according to data in a 2019 Global Peace Index report. Natural disasters, particularly those related to climate change and environmental degradation, have increased in intensity and frequency in the region. Nearly half of all natural disasters across the globe in 2018 occurred in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nOne of the strongest storms in 2018 - Typhoon Yutu, which tied Typhoon Mangkhut as the strongest storm of 2018, according to NASA - slammed the Northern Mariana Islands that year.\n\nThe catastrophic storm was the catalyst for Michelle Voacolo, a resident of the nearby island of Guam, to establish the Micronesia Climate Change Alliance (MCCA), a nonprofit that seeks to address climate change through culture- and community-based solutions by collaborating with various agencies and organizations.\n\n\"A lot of our work is rooted in climate justice and systemic change, and understanding that climate change is a symptom of a larger global problem rooted in capitalism and valuing profits over people and the environment,\" she said.\n\nVoacolo said the organization's efforts are focused on small projects to help the community realize that a vibrant economy is dependent on the health of the environment. One project the group is developing, given the island's food insecurity, is a plant-based cookbook to help reduce Guam's dependency on imported food and help residents return to nature for nourishment.\n\n\"Once we nourish ourselves with our natural surroundings, we'll be more likely to nourish the land back,\" Mo\u00f1eka De Oro, a fellow at MCCA, said.\n\nEducating the public about the climate crisis is another key action for activists.\n\nBecky Furey, program director of the nonprofit Micronesia Islands Nature Alliance, said in an email that the Northern Mariana Islands are heavily dependent on their biodiversity for food through subsistence agriculture, fishing and hunting. But that biodiversity is suffering due to habitat loss for a range of reasons, including pollution and climate change.\n\nOne of the alliance's programs trains high school graduates to become community conservation messengers about the threats facing the islands' environment, Furey said. They monitor Saipan's beaches and encourage community members to take a responsible and sustainable approach when interacting with the island's natural resources, she added.\n\nIn California, Kristy Drutman, an assistant lecturer at UC Berkeley, created a media series about building an environmentally just society called Brown Girl Green. She said she was inspired to root her work in her identity as a Filipino American after connecting with her Philippine heritage during a trip to her mother's hometown in the southern part of the country.\n\nDrutman said her activism focuses on content creation to make the issue more palatable to broader audiences, something she considers an important piece of the puzzle.\n\n\"There's a large disconnect between groups and how activities are moving worldwide and I feel like the only way that you can really learn strategies and tactics, and info to develop trends and mobilize people who otherwise wouldn't be engaged in this in person, is through social media,\" she said. \"If I hadn't had access to social media, I don't think I'd be doing what I'm doing right now.\"\n\nAAPI youth are also among activists rallying behind climate action.\n\nNadia Nazar was 16 when she co-founded Zero Hour, a youth-led nonprofit that aims to spotlight the voices of diverse youth in climate and environmental justice conversations. Since the organization was established in 2017, it has expanded to about 150 chapters worldwide, including in Australia, India, the Philippines and Iran, she said.\n\nNazar said seeing the impact of warming temperatures on India, where her parents are from, including massive flooding and droughts, deepened her drive to do whatever she can to address the climate crisis.\n\nOlivia Sun, 15, an activist with Zero Hour, said one of the organization's programs encourages young people to vote for climate candidates - not only in presidential elections, but also in local races. The group is also working on carrying out digital action in light of the coronavirus pandemic to encourage voter turnout in November.\n\nWhile a number of youth involved in Zero Hour won't be able to vote in the election, they recognize that they will be able to vote in the future.\n\n\"This fight isn't just for something that's happening in 2020,\" Nazar said. \"This is something that's going to be happening for years.\"\n\nShiney-Ajay noted that the current generation lives in a society with intersecting societal crises, from economic depressions to a rise mental health problems, all while the planet has continued to warm.\n\n\"I think the experience of living through those things and growing up with these crises looming over you really affects the way that I've seen people feel the climate crisis so deeply like never before,\" she said.",

        "body": "With no vaccine yet available for the coronavirus, the role of the retail store has abruptly pivoted from a high-touch experience to safety and practicality as states begin to reopen nonessential businesses.Patrick T. Fallon / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nEager shoppers will soon be able to browse their local retail stores as states continue to roll back stay-at-home orders. But instead of testing a swatch of lipsticks at a makeup counter or waiting in line to try on summer shorts, customers should expect \"virtual try-on tools,\" styling via app, shuttered fitting rooms, and returns that are quarantined for 72 hours.\n\nApple is the latest company to reopen stores, requiring face coverings for staff and customers, temperature checks at the door, conducting \"health questions\" to screen anyone with COVID-19 symptoms, and deep cleanings throughout the day.\n\n\"A store opening in no way means that we won't take the preventative step of closing it again should local conditions warrant,\" Deirdre O'Brien, Apple's senior vice president of retail and people, wrote in a blog post on Sunday.\n\nWith no vaccine for the coronavirus on the market, the role of the retail store has abruptly pivoted from a high-touch experience to safety and practicality as states begin to reopen nonessential businesses.\n\nBut now safety and convenience are paramount to retailers' ability to recoup some of their losses over the last several weeks as bleary-eyed customers venture out of lockdown to shop, according to Christa Hart, a senior managing director with the business advisory firm FTI Consulting.\n\n\"Brands are particularly cautious about how they're perceived about how they care about the customers safety and workers' safety,\" she said.\n\nCompanies such as Gap Inc, which is preparing to reopen 800 stores beginning with several stores in Texas, said it is implementing rigorous new cleaning routines throughout each store and will require workers to wear facial coverings. Like other retailers, Kohl's is posting signs throughout the store encouraging customers to observe social distancing guidelines.\n\nMany retailers have also installed protective barriers at registers and will routinely clean lanes after each customer transaction. Several retailers, such as American Eagle and Nordstrom, will provide hand sanitizer for customers, while Kohl's also set up additional hand sanitizer stations specifically for employees.\n\nSome stores such as TJX, which owns TJMaxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods, said it \"expects\" customers to also wear facial coverings while shopping.\n\n\"No matter where people live in the world, we want our associates and customers to feel confident when they come back to work or shop in our stores,\" TJX CEO Ernie Herrman said.\n\nAside from new sanitation practices, stores such as Gap are temporarily closing restrooms and quarantining returns for 24 hours before putting them back on the sales floor. Nordstrom is keeping tried and returned merchandise off the sales floor for 72 hours. Gap and Kohl's are also temporarily closing fitting rooms.\n\nUlta is taking special precautions with its salon services, which made up 5 percent of its sales volume in 2019. Hair services will only be available in certain stores and stylists and customers must both wear facial coverings and gloves. Nordstrom will now also offer contactless personal styling through its app, where customers and stylists can work together to create looks digitally.\n\nSome companies, such as Warby Parker, which reopened some stores on Thursday, have leaned on their existing e-commerce business to provide shoppers with a personal experience in the age of social distancing. The company offers eyeglass shoppers an online quiz to select five pairs of glasses to try at home and a virtual try-on tool on its site. It is also extending its virtual vision consultations in select states where its retail stores are still closed.\n\n\"The last couple of months have challenged all of us in ways we never could have imagined,\" the company said in a statement. \"Like so many others, we've needed to evolve every aspect of our business in response to COVID-19.\"\n\nRetailers have followed a phased approach to reopening stores in large part because the White House has left the decision to close businesses to individual states. This makes it more complicated for companies to determine where it is legal to open for business, and more importantly, where people are safe to shop. A dozen states at least partially reopened nonessential business before meeting the federal criteria, according to a Bloomberg analysis.\n\nBut companies aren't completely flying blind. Two separate retail trade associations, the Retail Industry Leaders Association and the National Retail Federation, released a joint Blueprint for Shopping Safe, outlining a three-phase approach to reopening retail stores, which has been serving as a guide for companies in the absence of a national strategy.\n\n\"There is no doubt that even under the most optimistic of scenarios, American families will be adjusting to a 'new normal' for some time to come,\" according to the guide.\n\nMall and apparel retailers that have been closed for weeks are also taking cues from essential businesses such as Kroger which have been adjusting with the fast changing pace of shopping as the virus spread over the last several weeks. Kroger, a chain of 2,800 grocery stores across 35 states, has seen sales skyrocket during the pandemic. The company shared its insights in a guide called Kroger's Blueprint for Business and has provided assets to other retailers to use, including signs and audio.\n\n\"While there is no 'one thing' that makes all the difference, taking a comprehensive, thoughtful approach to safety will lead to better outcomes,\" Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said.\n\nKroger started testing one-way aisles and seniors-only shopping hours in its grocery stores in April. Now, several retailers have adopted the same strategy to add space between merchandise in their stores and designate certain shopping hours for high-risk customers.\n\nKohl's has also physically rearranged breakrooms, training rooms and offices to ensure proper social distancing. It created one entrance and exit to keep traffic flow in one direction and it has reduced the number of associates in the stores at one time to allow for social distancing.\n\n\"Previously when you walked into the store, you walked into the new releases of t-shirts for the spring and summer season,\" said David Kopsch, a workforce skills consultant with the human resources firm Mercer. \"Now the tables of clothes are farther apart from each other so customers have good social distance from each other.\"\n\nShopping habits have also changed under lockdown as more people bought online, according to Adobe's Digital Economy Index. U.S. e-commerce increased 49 percent in April, compared to the period in early March before shelter-in-place restrictions went into effect.\n\n\"We're seeing them making a shift in online because their customers have moved online,\" said Kopsch.\n\nRetailers are now expanding options for customers to buy items online and pick them up at a store to help minimize contact. Williams Sonoma is providing appointment times for people to shop. Urban Outfitters is ramping up contactless payments, and Bed Bath & Beyond expanded its curbside pickup options to 750 stores. Kohl's will offer touchless payment through Kohl's Pay on its app. Meanwhile, about 70 At Home stores will offer curbside pickup or contactless next-day local delivery. More than 180 At Home stores will have buy-online-pickup-in-store options as well.\n\nTo support the demand in its online business, Ikea said it is gradually opening up certain stores to help fulfill online orders. It said that \"operating in this limited capacity will allow us to begin to welcome back some of our furloughed hourly co-workers.\"\n\nBut for retail's thousands of workers, going back to work creates fear -- and many of them will no longer receive hazard pay by the end of May. Many of them felt they had no other choice but to go back to work in the midst of a pandemic and a bleak job market.\n\nThe unemployment rate has soared to 14.7 percent, after months at a half-century low, wiping out all job gains since the Great Recession. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Sunday he believes that number could rise to the Depression-era level of 25 percent.\n\n\"We don't have a choice financially,\" said one worker at a Starbucks who asked to remain anonymous. \"We have no idea which customers have been following procedures or who has been in hospitals. It's a managed risk.\"\n\nWith the virus still not contained, some shoppers are avoiding leisure shopping altogether. About 57 percent of shoppers in March and April came immediately home after a Target or Walmart run, according to the foot traffic analytics firm Placer.ai.\n\nMichell Tinoco, a college student quarantining with her family in Kansas City, Kansas, told NBC News she refuses to go to the mall or a retail store even though they opened in her state on Wednesday.\n\n\"They are ensuring that customers wear PPE or follow social distancing but I don't see a need to shop if there is no need,\" said Tinoco, who recovered from the virus. \"I will only go to a store in dire circumstances.\"",

    "Frontier Airlines will drop open-seat fee that drew attacks": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Frontier Airlines is dropping plans to charge passengers extra to sit next to an empty middle seat after congressional Democrats accused the airline of trying to profit from fear over the new coronavirus.\n\n\"We recognize the concerns raised that we are profiting from safety and this was never our intent,\" Frontier CEO Barry Biffle said late Wednesday in a letter to three lawmakers. \"We simply wanted to provide our customers with an option for more space.\"\n\nBiffle said the airline will rescind the extra fee, which Frontier called More Room, and block the seats from being sold.\n\nEarlier in the day, Democrats had railed against Frontier's plan to charge passengers at least $39 per flight to guarantee they would sit next to an empty middle seat. The offer was to begin with flights Friday and run through Aug. 31.\n\nThe chairman of the House Transportation Committee called it \"outrageous.\" Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said the Denver-based airline was using the need for social distancing during a pandemic \"as an opportunity to make a buck ... capitalizing on fear and passengers' well-founded concerns for their health and safety.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., highlighted the fee during a congressional hearing on how COVID-19 is affecting the airline industry.\n\n\"I don't think it's appropriate for some passengers who can't afford to pay an additional charge for a seat to be less safe than other travelers,\" Klobuchar said.\n\nU.S. air travel has dropped more than 90% from a year ago because of the pandemic, and many flights are nearly empty. However, some flights -- highlighted on social media -- have been much more full, with many passengers not wearing face coverings. That has led airlines to say they will block middle seats when possible to create space between passengers.\n\nFrom the outset, Biffle rejected the notion that his airline would be charging for social distancing.\n\n\"We are offering the option, and it is guaranteed. We don't believe you need it -- if everybody is wearing a facial covering - to be safe,\" he told The Associated Press earlier this week. \"It gives people more peace of mind if they want it.\"\n\nBiffle said ticket sales rose after previous announcements around safety, including a decision to require passengers to wear masks, and he expected the same reaction to the empty-seat offer.\n\nAirlines steal ideas from each other all the time, but so far, none have copied Frontier's More Room offer.\n\nDuring Wednesday's Senate Commerce Committee hearing, the president of Airlines for America, a trade group for the biggest U.S. carriers, said none of his airlines have a similar charge. Frontier is not a member.\n\nThe trade group official, Nicholas Calio, said other airlines block some middle seats and board passengers from back to front to keep spacing on planes.\n\nKlobuchar asked if the federal government should issue guidelines to \"fix\" Frontier's policy. Calio said rules aren't necessary.\n\n\"Hopefully the market will take care of that,\" Calio said.\n\n\"Well, it didn't with Frontier,\" Klobuchar responded.\n\nHilary Godwin, dean of the school of public health at the University of Washington, said the Frontier policy \"is exactly the reason that some national-level guidance\" is needed for social distancing on airlines and in airports.\n\nGodwin said crowded planes and long flights create the greatest risk for spreading the virus. She said the expectation that air travel will recover slowly is a good thing -- it will give airlines and health officials time to decide the best steps to protect travelers and airline and airport workers.\n\nBiffle announced Frontier would drop the fee idea in a letter to Reps. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., and Jesus Garcia, D-Ill., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass.\n\nU.S. health officials stress the importance of social distancing, and they also recommend that people wear cloth face coverings in public because some who are infected don't feel symptoms and could unknowingly spread the virus.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A vial of remdesivir at a Gilead manufacturing site in the United States.Gilead Sciences / via AP\n\nStock trading was briefly halted Thursday for California-based Gilead Sciences, after a draft report said the company's experimental coronavirus treatment disappointed in a recent drug trial.\n\nShares continued to slump, even after the biotech company moved quickly to dispute the findings of the World Health Organization study into the effectiveness of its anti-viral drug, remdesivir. The results were accidentally published online, before being taken down.\n\nGilead's statement helped steady afternoon trading.\n\n\"We believe the post included inappropriate characterizations of the study. Importantly, because this study was terminated early due to low enrollment, it was underpowered to enable statistically meaningful conclusions,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"It went on to describe the early results as \"inconclusive,\" and added: \"Trends in the data suggest a potential benefit for remdesivir, particularly among patients treated early in disease.\"\n\nAccording to earlier reporting by NBC News, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine found the drug improved breathing in some patients, though only 53 people were involved in the study.\n\nIn the majority of the patients -- 68 percent -- doctors were able to reduce the amount of oxygen support needed. In addition, 17 of 30 patients who had been on ventilators were able to come off those machines -- a key factor, since COVID-19 patients who need to be put on ventilators appear to be more likely to suffer long-term health consequences, and may have worse outcomes.\n\nGilead's shares have taken a rollercoaster ride in recent weeks as Wall Street clings to any hope that a treatment can be found for the deadly virus. Last week, stock soared by 13 percent after STAT news reported that a Chicago hospital treating coronavirus patients with remdesivir in a trial were recovering rapidly from severe symptoms.\n\nCOVID-19 does not have a vaccine or a treatment, and scientists are racing to figure out ways to assist patients suffering from the previously unseen virus. Another treatment, hydroxychloroquine, promoted from the White House by President Donald Trump, has seen mixed results and, in some cases, deaths.\n\nInvestors have said that news of an effective treatment or vaccine would be needed for stocks to mount a sustainable comeback.\n\n\"Remdesivir sounds like something that can get people out of hospitals quickly,\" CNBC's Jim Cramer said in a tweet last week. \"That allows our economy to have a fighting chance. I think that remdesivir would cut the morbidity ... which would change how quickly we can open... and what we can do.\"",

    "Got coronavirus? You may get a surprise medical bill, too": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Medical workers take in patients outside a special coronavirus intake area at a medical center in Brooklyn, N.Y., on April 14, 2020.Spencer Platt / Getty Images\n\nChristopher Hoffman had the telltale symptoms: a dry cough, trouble breathing and a missing sense of smell. In early March, before the coronavirus shut the country down, the 25-year-old New Yorker went to urgent care, where he was diagnosed with pneumonia.\n\n\"Because I didn't have a fever, they didn't think to test me for COVID-19,\" Hoffman said. A week later, he was in the hospital on an IV.\n\nHe recovered, but his battle with what he is certain was COVID-19 left him with more than $3,800 in out-of-pocket expenses and no clue exactly how much his insurer will cover -- a common refrain in the age of the coronavirus.\n\n\"I'm going to have to duke it out with my insurance company,\" said Hoffman, who was never formally diagnosed with the disease and got sick before many measures to cut the cost of catching it were in effect.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe government and insurance companies have vowed to pick up much of the tab for coronavirus testing and treatment. But insurance experts, doctors and health care economists told NBC News that because of the fragmented nature of the U.S. health care system, they're already seeing holes in this impromptu safety net.\n\nEven in normal times, they say, doctors and hospitals have to navigate dozens of health care plans, public and private. Now all those plans are changing their policies to address the coronavirus, and the providers -- the ones who compute the cost of your care -- struggle to keep up, leading to surprise bills even after promises that costs would be waived.\n\nThe experts caution that it is still early in the outbreak and that the government and the insurers are adjusting their responses daily, but they've already seen gaps in coverage that fit into a few broad categories. Here are five things they say to watch out for in your medical bills:\n\nOn March 18, President Donald Trump signed legislation requiring private insurers to waive testing costs. State authorities have also stepped in, although the measures vary from state to state.\n\nBut that doesn't mean insurers are covering all the costs related to testing.\n\nEvan S.'s wife is a nurse at a hospital in the Washington, D.C., area. Amy, whose last name is being withheld because of concern for her job, started showing symptoms March 11. Two days later, she had a sore throat, a cough and chest pain.\n\nTest results took more than two weeks. Amy came up negative. Not long after came the bill, which NBC News reviewed. The family is being charged $190 for the clinic visit, plus flu and strep tests run before Amy was tested for COVID-19.\n\nBecause Amy was tested on March 16, two days before Congress passed legislation requiring that the cost of testing be waived, the family may get a bill for the coronavirus test, too, the insurer said.\n\n\"We've been promised that the costs for testing and treatment are going to be covered,\" Evan said. \"Now I've got a $200 bill.\"\n\nFront-line workers elsewhere have also received big bills for tests. A nursing home employee in Washington state is among a handful of people who have filed complaints with state authorities saying that despite promises to cover testing, they're still getting charged.\n\nThe complaint, filed by the woman's daughter-in-law, said the woman worked at a nursing home with 30 confirmed COVID-19 cases. But when she went to get tested, her insurance covered just $7.15 of the $578.87 bill, according to the complaint, submitted to the state Office of the Insurance Commissioner on March 3.\n\n\"This is shameful,\" the complaint said. \"She's called a hero wherever she goes, but her insurance can't take care of more of this bill.\"\n\nA month and a half later, doctors and policymakers are now worried about the thousands who, because of a continued shortage of tests, almost surely contracted the virus but may not be able to prove it to insurers.\n\n\"I'm routinely sending half of the patients who have COVID symptoms home without a test,\" Dr. Rob Davidson, a Michigan emergency room physician who heads the Committee to Protect Medicare, which advocates for Medicare expansion. \"They still have X-rays and labs, and yet they still don't have a positive test. Are they going to pay for those people?\"\n\nSome of the current treatments for the coronavirus are experimental, like the hydroxychloroquine the president has touted to much controversy.\n\nBut consumers are finding that experimental measures aren't necessarily covered by insurance -- even when they're cleared by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAnne Bakjian, 40, of Georgia spent two weeks in the hospital with COVID-19, fighting for each breath. She needed more oxygen, and doctors warned that a ventilator could come next.\n\nDoctors initially gave her Tylenol and told her to \"pray,\" she said. A week later, they put her on hydroxychloroquine.\n\nBakjian's eyes turned yellow and her vision became distorted, she said, but after two days, her lungs opened up. The hospital sent her home March 30 with a prescription for eight hydroxychloroquine pills.\n\nWeeks later, she received a statement indicating that her insurer, Peach State Health Plan, the Medicaid program for low-income Georgia residents, hadn't paid her $48,000 hospital bill.\n\nA representative for Peach State told her that the care wouldn't be covered because it hadn't been pre-approved, Bakjian said.\n\nAfter calls from Bakjian and NBC News, the hospital told NBC News that Peach State had cleared the bill. But Bakjian and her family still paid $700 for the eight hydroxychloroquine pills.\n\nThe FDA had issued emergency approval to use the drug for COVID-19, and Bakjian had trouble finding pills, which generally cost a small fraction of the price. Friends started a GoFundMe campaign to pay the cost, something that hundreds of patients across the country have done to help cover bills linked to COVID-19.\n\n\"If you're on Medicaid, you don't have that kind of money,\" Bakjian said.\n\nPeach State didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nMore than 28 million people lacked health insurance of any kind, government or private, in the most recent tally, and that total has surely grown as millions have lost their jobs during the pandemic.\n\nThe federal government's message has been that for the uninsured, treatment will be covered.\n\n\"Hospitals and health care providers treating uninsured coronavirus patients will be reimbursed by the federal government,\" Trump said during a White House briefing April 3. \"This should alleviate any concern uninsured Americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment.\"\n\nThe federal government has allocated $1 billion to test the uninsured, and it has announced plans to use part of the $100 billion slated for health care providers in the coronavirus response legislation known as the CARES Act to reimburse hospitals for the costs of treating the uninsured.\n\nBut snags continue to emerge. A woman interviewed by NBC San Diego received a bill for nearly $1,500 for a coronavirus test. The hospital told the station that while federal legislation made tests free, it didn't cover the uninsured.\n\nThe head of Carbon Health, a startup promoting rapid testing in the San Francisco Bay Area, also argued that health care providers should be allowed to charge the uninsured.\n\n\"The supplies and labs for COVID-19 testing are very expensive,\" CEO Eren Bali wrote April 14 on Twitter. \"Would be ridiculous to expect the healthcare providers to take the tab instead of insurance/government.\"\n\nThree days later, in response to an email from NBC News, a spokesperson for Carbon Health said that testing fees will be waived for uninsured patients and that the company is refunding those who paid fees.\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act, passed in March, allows states to tap Medicaid, the country's program that insures the poor and the disabled, to cover the cost of testing the uninsured, including people who are undocumented.\n\nTexas, where nearly 20 percent of residents lack insurance, just announced that it is requesting funds. That will likely prove crucial in places like Cameron County, in the state's southernmost tip. About 30 percent of its residents are uninsured, according to federal data, but new coronavirus cases are being detected every day. More than 300 residents have tested positive, and nine have died.\n\nActually covering coronavirus treatment for the uninsured could reach $40 billion, according to an analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. The government hasn't addressed how it would address the ongoing care some uninsured may need for a disease that affects not just the lungs but also the kidney, the heart and the brain.\n\n\"We know people who have been on a ventilator for a long time may need care down the road,\" said Jennifer Tolbert, director of state health reform at Kaiser. \"This would not cover all of that care.\"\n\nWill the surprise medical bills keep arriving?\n\nMore than a month into the global pandemic, states have issued more than 320 mandates, orders and requests for insurers to make accommodations to ease access to care during the pandemic, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.\n\nInsurance commissioners in states such as California, Washington, New York and New Jersey now require some health insurers to waive most costs related to COVID-19 testing.\n\nHowever, 22 states, including Alabama and Texas, ask only that insurers look at waiving fees and preventing out-of-network charges for those who cannot get care in their networks.\n\nThis patchwork, said Katherine Baicker, dean of the Harris School of Public Policy at the University of Chicago, \"is symptomatic of the challenges of our system.\"\n\nMany insurance companies have announced that they are voluntarily eliminating copayments and deductibles for some treatment.\n\n\"We were making these commitments before we knew what testing or treatment could cost,\" said Kristine Grow, spokesperson for America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group. \"We're committing to doing everything we can to protect patients.\"\n\nSeveral insurers and medical providers NBC News spoke with said they are working with patients to address costs. Several waived charges for specific patients after NBC News inquiries.\n\nHealth insurance companies have made good-faith efforts to remove barriers to care and to curb the epidemic, said Vivian Ho, a health economist at Rice University in Houston.\n\n\"They're worried that this is something that will continue to spread, so they want to do their part to make sure it doesn't,\" Ho said.\n\nBaicker said making sure care is affordable -- especially making sure testing is widely available -- is fundamental to moving the country forward. \"Any cost barriers to that are wildly counterproductive,\" she said.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIn the long run, however, Americans could still end up paying insurance companies extra for the coronavirus.\n\nCOVID-19 could cost insurance companies as much as $556 billion over two years, according to an estimate prepared for America's Health Insurance Plans, which is lobbying Congress to implement measures to offset the costs, among them keeping people on their employer-sponsored coverage.\n\nWhat isn't paid now might come due later in the form of steep increases to buy insurance. One analysis found that premiums could rise by 40 percent in 2021 if regulators don't step in.\n\nThe pandemic will inevitably reshape the country's health care system, Ho said, but it's still too early to know how.\n\n\"There are going to be some drastic changes,\" she said. \"I'm just not sure which ones.\"",

    "Have French doctors found Europe's coronavirus 'patient zero'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "PARIS -- Health investigators around the world are racing back in time.\n\nWhile it was thought COVID-19 only began to spread beyond China and across Europe in January and February, French doctors this week said they have established the coronavirus was already present in Paris by late December -- a month before the country's first official recorded case and two and a half months before a nationwide lockdown.\n\nThe patient, Amirouche Hammar, 43, from the suburbs of Paris, has been dubbed France's potential \"patient zero\" by researchers and was possibly even the first case in Europe.\n\nThe French team is among researchers across the world now poring over old medical reports hunting for clues from the very start of the COVID-19 outbreak, hoping to paint a wider, more accurate picture of how the virus spread so quickly.\n\nA team at Avicenne Hospital in Paris, led by Dr. Yves Cohen, its head of emergency medicine, started digging last month. They went back to the end of the year and re-examined medical records of intensive care patients admitted for influenza-like illness between Dec. 2 and Jan. 16.\n\nAccording to the study, they narrowed the list of 58 patients to 14 who had tested negative for pneumonia. But one sample came back positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"It's surprising, but also exciting,\" Cohen told NBC News. At the time, he didn't suspect COVID-19 \"because at the end of December, there was no coronavirus in France.\"\n\nBut then the team tested the sample again to be sure and contacted French health authorities. Two weeks ago, Cohen called Hammar, 43, with the news.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Hammar said, as he sat in his garden just 15 minutes away from Avicenne, surrounded by his four kids, life looking almost normal five months on. \"I'm a miracle,\" he said.\n\nHammar explained his December symptoms, now obvious hallmarks of COVID-19: cough, chest pain, trouble breathing. \"I began having pain in my chest that felt like knife stabs,\" he remembered. And most frighteningly, he coughed up a lot of blood.\n\n\"Everyone was panicking,\" he said of his time in the hospital. \"Honestly, no one had the key to this.\" Cohen doesn't dispute his patient's recollection -- at the time, he had assumed it was another unknown virus.\n\nHammar's wife, Fatiha, at home with their four children, called every 20 minutes for news, so he sent her videos to reassure her.\n\nWatching her husband gasp for air on her phone was far from reassuring, Fatiha Hammar recalled.\n\nIn a statement, the French health authorities said they will \"consider other investigations if they prove to be necessary.\"\n\nSince the COVID-19 diagnosis, Hammar and his wife have replayed the events of December in their minds: Where had they been? Whom had they seen? Neither had been on a plane since August when they traveled to Algeria. Fatiha Hammar works at a supermarket close to the airport and said that sometimes \"passengers would come in right off the flights with their suitcases.\" They wondered, could a traveler have infected her?\n\nIn late December, she felt run-down. \"Tired. Very tired,\" she recalled. She had a small cough, a light fever -- what she thought was a winter cold. A week later, her husband drove himself to the emergency room at 5 a.m.\n\nWhere they picked it up remains a mystery, but Cohen says the new timeline is a step closer to understanding how quickly the illness might have jumped from China to Europe. At a briefing Tuesday in Geneva, the WHO took notice of the French study.\n\n\"This gives us a whole new picture on everything,\" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier said, encouraging other countries to follow France's lead.\n\nDr. Vin Gupta, a pulmonologist and a public health expert at the University of Washington, said discoveries such as Cohen's may disprove current models and lead authorities to question where their populations really are in terms of the magnitude of the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"Maybe we are talking about true herd immunity? Maybe most of us are actually truly infected,\" Gupta said, emphasizing the number of unknowns.\n\n\"If we know that this as a respiratory pathogen can move that quickly, that changes everything with respect to the next one and we know there's gonna be a next one.\" he added.\n\nCohen agreed. His research isn't for now, he said, it's for the next pandemic.\n\nHe stressed that every doctor should be doing this same study and doing it now.\n\n\"To fight an enemy, we have to know the life of the enemy,\" he said.",

    "He thought he had a cold  --  then his father fell ill with COVID-19. Now he's wrestling with guilt.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In the third week of March, he came down with a sore throat, mild fever, cough, chills and body aches. The coronavirus was just starting to spread across Illinois, shuttering schools and workplaces, including the clinic in DuPage County where he worked as a rehabilitation technician. It didn't occur to him that he might have the virus, even after a co-worker tested positive. Paul's symptoms came and went, and on some days he felt well enough to go on a 5-mile run.\n\nThen his father started coughing.\n\nPaul, 55 and twice divorced, lived with his parents in the house he grew up in. He assumed his father, Robert, 86, a tough former pro baseball player, Army veteran and cancer survivor, had picked up his cold. But the bug seemed to take over Robert's body, wrecking his appetite and pummeling his lungs.\n\nBefore dawn on April 2, Paul woke to another of his father's coughing fits. He helped Robert to the bathroom, where his dad passed out. Paul dialed 911.\n\nA paramedic, dressed in full protective gear, told Robert he needed to go to the hospital. Robert quietly acquiesced. At the front door, still in bare feet, he paused and looked back at his son.\n\n\"I love you,\" Robert said.\n\n\"I love you, Dad. Everything's going to be OK,\" Paul replied.\n\nAt Central DuPage Hospital, his father tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe news made Paul realize that he may have had the virus too. As his father's condition deteriorated, Paul began to wonder if he was to blame.\n\nThat haunting feeling afflicts untold numbers of Americans who believe that in the fog of the coronavirus' early spread across the country, they unwittingly infected the people they loved the most.\n\nWhile it is often impossible to know exactly how the virus passed from one person to another, many survivors hold themselves responsible, questioning decisions they made in the days when they had little information, could not get tested and were not yet subject to strict social distancing and mask measures.\n\nThese experiences hint at the unanticipated scope of the suffering caused by the coronavirus.\n\n\"The mental health consequences of all this, beside the deaths and physical aspects, are profound,\" said Dr. Michelle Riba, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Michigan Medical School. \"We've never been through this in our lifetimes, so we are learning as we go.\"\n\nPeople who develop mild symptoms, or none at all, are convenient pathways for the coronavirus' spread, because they don't know to take steps to avoid passing it on to people who are at risk of life-threatening complications, researchers say.\n\nPaul believes that is what happened to him and his father.\n\n\"Could I have been more careful with what I thought was the common cold?\" he said in a recent interview. \"If you felt the way I did now, you would not expose people to that. But there just wasn't enough information then. That's what I've struggled with.\"\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nHe has not been tested for the coronavirus; he asked about getting a test but was told that his relatively mild symptoms wouldn't be considered serious enough to meet the stringent requirements. His mother and his girlfriend, meanwhile, developed only minor symptoms.\n\nIn the hospital, Robert's lungs began to fail. Doctors said there wasn't much more they could do to stop the virus' assault on his body. They began palliative care, easing his pain with sedatives.\n\nVisitors were not allowed, but Robert and Paul spoke frequently by phone, including some FaceTime chats. Robert seemed at peace. Married for 60 years and deeply religious, he said he'd had a good life. Paul never heard his father speculate on how he got the disease or the possibility that his son had given it to him.\n\nPaul told his father he believed he was the likely source.\n\n\"I'm sorry, Pops,\" he said.\n\nOn April 9, after Robert had been in the hospital for a week, they had their final conversations. Paul thanked him for being a good parent. He assured his father that he would take care of his mother, and help pay the bills.\n\n\"Thank you, son. You are a wonderful son and I'll see you in heaven someday,\" Robert replied.\n\nLater that afternoon, the hospital called Paul to say he could visit his father the following morning. As he was preparing to leave, his sister called with a palliative care nurse on the line. Robert had died.\n\n\"I just killed my dad,\" Paul told his girlfriend after hearing the news. \"I gave this to my dad.\"\n\nShe told him he was not responsible because he didn't know if he had the virus, and he never intended to harm his father. His sister and his mother also reassured him.\n\nBut he could not let it go. A few relatives questioned why Paul didn't call an ambulance sooner. He overheard his mother defending him on the phone.\n\n\"It's an odd feeling, like you're not at peace,\" he said. \"You can't get rest because you're still dealing with the guilt.\"\n\nThe coronavirus feeds on families. As researchers track its spread across the world, they have found households are a common source.\n\nTo be the person who introduced the virus into a family carries a heavy emotional burden, even if the risk wasn't clear at the time, experts say.\n\n\"You can't use the facts you have now to go back and judge yourself back then,\" Riba said. \"In retrospect it looks easy now, but it wasn't easy back then. People were getting on planes, still going to events and restaurants. They didn't know.\"\n\nThis guilt is not limited to cases in which a family member fell gravely ill.\n\n\"I couldn't keep my family safe, and that's your No. 1 job as a parent,\" said Carianne Ekberg, who believes she passed the virus to her husband and their two young children in early March after coming down with what she initially thought was a bad cold or allergies.\n\nShe suspects she picked it up while getting a manicure with her 5-year-old daughter near their home in Gig Harbor, Washington. Midway through, the nail technician told her that a recent customer had just told them they'd come down with the virus. Ekberg left in a panic, showered and disinfected her family's car and home.\n\nEkberg, 37, a social media consultant and Air Force reservist, said she called her doctor and a public health worker, and both told her that she probably wasn't exposed to the virus, to be careful and to quarantine herself if she got sick. She stopped seeing relatives and canceled a trip to the East Coast, but did see two close friends while observing social distancing recommendations.\n\nTen days passed, and then she developed overwhelming fatigue, nausea, coughing and shortness of breath that lasted two weeks. A few days into her symptoms, her children developed low-grade fevers and runny noses, and her husband felt tightness in his chest. They've all since recovered.\n\n\"The guilt you feel when you infect your family, especially your children, is serious,\" she said. \"Even if you didn't know you had COVID or you couldn't help getting it, you still feel guilty and anxious and panicked at the first sign of a fever, cough or runny nose.\"\n\nEkberg has found comfort in speaking to other coronavirus survivors. She participates in a weekly Zoom forum hosted by the YMCA of Pierce and Kitsap Counties. She also runs a Facebook group for parents seeking advice on dealing with school closures.\n\n\"You can't blame yourself forever, but while you're going through it you have to find something that will keep you focused on something else,\" Ekberg said. \"Because you are not going to recover yourself unless you have a positive mindset and are doing things to get well.\"\n\nEkberg's outlook fits the advice from experts, who say there are many paths to managing this kind of remorse. They include helping others, focusing on work, exercising and talking to someone -- friends, self-help groups, a religious leader or mental-health provider.\n\n\"Giving yourself a break is hugely important,\" said Dr. Ronjon Banerjee, a psychiatrist and assistant professor at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, where a growing number of his patients are health care workers. \"Some have infected family. They feel guilty. Others feel shame. Others feel they have no power or control. They feel hopeless. Talking about it can help make sense of it and how to regain control.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nJane Weinhaus is a talker, and she says that has helped her cope with her belief that she infected her husband, two adult sons and a daughter-in-law. She spent time with all of them before falling ill, and all ended up testing positive and getting pneumonia. Weinhaus, 63, spent more than a week on a ventilator.\n\nA suburban St. Louis preschool teacher with a busy social life, Weinhaus has retraced her steps from early March to figure out how she may have been infected, and who else she could have exposed. The list is frightening: She went to work, out with friends, attended a bat mitzvah and a wedding, sat shiva with a friend's family, ate dinner with her 90-year-old father, babysat grandchildren.\n\n\"To think I could have given them something that could have killed them, that I could have exposed so many people...\" Weinhaus said before trailing off in tears.\n\nShe watches news of people who died on ventilators and wonders why she survived.\n\nShe has decided to make her work the reason.\n\nShe has been teaching preschool for 25 years. During her recovery, she has joined Zoom meetings with her 2-year-old students, and hopes to return in late August, provided her school is allowed to open.\n\n\"I will go on and make a difference in the life of a child,\" she said. \"That is my calling. That gives me purpose.\"\n\nAfter his father's funeral -- limited to 10 people -- Paul continued to wrestle with regret.\n\nHe went into \"playback mode,\" wondering if he could have done more to keep his father from getting sick. Should he have quarantined himself in his bedroom? Been more aggressive in sanitizing their home? Taken his father to the hospital earlier?\n\n\"I think about it every day. Could I have been more careful?\" he said.\n\nThere is one piece of information that might help him come to terms with what happened.\n\nBecause he never got tested, Paul still doesn't know definitively that he had the coronavirus. But he plans to get an antibody test, which could provide the answer. He expects it to come back positive; his girlfriend has already taken the test, and she has the antibodies.\n\n\"I definitely want to know,\" Paul said. \"It's important to me so I can close that chapter out in my life.\"",

        "body": "Chad Capule's family believes he would have survived had he been tested for coronavirus sooner.\n\nThe nurses at the Wisconsin hospital where Chad Capule died were really hoping he would pull through so he could help them better understand the new computer system he had traveled there to install just as he started feeling ill.\n\nBut the IT manager, who was 49 years old and whose only underlying condition was hypertension, tested positive for coronavirus and was intubated a week after setting up that new system at St. Agnes Hospital. He died there two weeks after that.\n\nCapule's family believes he would have survived had he been tested for coronavirus sooner. He also fell victim to another cruel trick of the virus -- starting to feel better right before turning for the worst.\n\nHours after he was finally tested and found out he was positive, Capule wrote an email to his friends and family to fill them in, striking an encouraging tone.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"This was somewhat frightening, but am very low risk and not in mortal danger,\" he wrote in the email that his wife, Anne Starkweather, shared with NBC News.\n\n\"I want to assure everyone that the primary symptoms have subsided and I am well on the road to recovery and expect to be back by this weekend in DC,\" Capule wrote on March 11.\n\nInstead, Capule returned home in an urn.\n\n\"I rode with his ashes in a car for 14 hours,\" Starkweather said. She had traveled to Wisconsin to be with her sick husband but ended up also testing positive for coronavirus and having to quarantine in a hotel room as Capule lay unconscious in a hospital bed.\n\nStarkweather believes they both caught the virus in their home state of Maryland because Capule didn't start feeling feverish until March 5, just a day after he traveled to Wisconsin for work. He went to an urgent care center, but wasn't tested for coronavirus. Instead, he was told he likely had the flu and was sent back to his hotel.\n\n\"We feel that they're not really treating COVID on the onset, which is a big problem,\" said Capule's sister Angie Capule Fontanilla. He was told at a clinic, \"'here's some medicine, go back to your hotel,'\" she said.\n\nDelayed testing, lack of testing, confusion about symptoms and in some cases an absence of symptoms have all proven to be major hurdles in fighting the novel coronavirus and quelling its ever-rising death toll across the country.\n\nOn March 8, still suffering from a fever, Capule completed a COVID-19 screening checklist in St. Agnes Hospital's emergency room, but he still was not tested.\n\n\"I was told by a nurse that it was because he hadn't travelled internationally,\" Starkweather said. \"Medical staff assured him it was unlikely to be COVID-19,\" the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"St. Agnes Hospital is committed to providing the best care possible to our patients and community. As such, we have been strictly adhering to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines regarding our COVID-19 care protocols, testing and preparedness efforts,\" Agnesian HealthCare communications manager Shelly Haberman said in a statement.\n\n\"Those guidelines have continued to be updated as the pandemic has evolved, and we have adjusted our processes and procedures, accordingly,\" Haberman said. The CDC's guidance for testing people with coronavirus symptoms was most recently updated on March 4, March 9 and March 24.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nCapule was tested on March 10, and quickly learned he was positive for the virus, at which point he sent the optimistic email to family and friends. He was intubated a day later, and died on March 29.\n\nThe nurses at St. Agnes were devastated, and not only because they were operating a new computer system they didn't entirely know how to use. They also very much enjoyed Capule's company and his playlists featuring his wide-ranging love of music, said sisters Capule Fontanilla and Benilda Capule.\n\nCapule's other passions included British TV, especially Dr. Who; all kinds of sports, specifically the Yankees; and animals, especially the rescues he adopted and volunteered with.\n\nCapule's wide range of interests made him perfectly suited for his favorite pastime: trivia.\n\nHe and Starkweather competed with trivia teams twice a week. He also volunteered his time as a trivia host for his local Rotary Club, and his coworkers' kids knew he was the guy who would always be up for a quick quiz session. He even competed on \"Jeopardy\" in 2015.\n\nCapule just loved to play, said Starkweather, recalling floors full of Legos in the Maryland home they shared with three adopted cats.\n\n\"He was this totally responsible adult who still brought a childlike joy to everything he did,\" she said.\n\n\"I am heartbroken, and I don't know how I'm going to recover from this,\" Starkweather said. \"I'm not sure how I'm going to go on without him. He was my life.\"\n\nThe couple had met while Capule was under Starkweather's desk fixing her computer at the nonprofit where she worked.\n\n\"It was just natural,\" Starkweather said. \"We never even dated, we just went right into being together.\" She proposed, and the couple married in 2007.\n\n\"He and Anne are just so made for each other,\" said Benilda Capule. \"They're one of the other half. I've never seen a couple so compatible.\" They \"so just love life and life together,\" she added.\n\nCapule and his sisters, who came to the U.S. from the Philippines when they were children, were also very close. The two older sisters had, within recent years, celebrated their 50th birthdays, and the family was planning a big bash for Capule's 50th in July, with high school, college, work and trivia league pals.\n\nThe gathering will now likely be a memorial, Starkweather said. \"There are a lot of people who are grieving over this.\"\n\nDuring a virtual memorial held for Capule by his colleagues, almost everyone shared a story about a time Capule helped them out or made them feel at ease.\n\nOne man, who had recently moved from India to the U.S. with his family without a way to or idea of how to get around, said that Capule not only helped him navigate the area, but also loaned him his car.\n\nOther coworkers said that if they were late to a meeting, Capule would discreetly fill them in. And others shared stories about feeling out of place or a little lost until they met Capule.\n\n\"Chad was easy to be with -- naturally empathetic ... and he was able to bring different groups of people together in a way that not a lot of people can do,\" Starkweather said. \"I just wish he could have heard all of the wonderful things that people are saying about him.\"\n\nBenilda Capule is still trying to process the abrupt loss of someone who was so full of life. \"One day, they're getting better like my brother and the next day, next thing you know, he needs to be sedated and things turn bad,\" she said. \"They just treat people or do testing when it's too late.\"\n\n\"I really wish I could be Dr. Who,\" said the mourning sister, reminiscing about hours British TV she enjoyed with her little brother. \"And go back in time and save him.\"",

    "Health care experts say coronavirus exposes major flaws in medical system": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A nurse tends to a COVID-19 patient in the Stamford Hospital intensive care unit in Connecticut on Friday, April 24, 2020.John Moore / Getty Images\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continues its rampage across the United States, with more than a million confirmed cases and no end in sight, medical professionals and experts say the strain on the health care system has exposed major flaws and taught hard lessons.\n\nThey said the pandemic has shown that we need to shift the way we think about health care as overwhelmed hospitals struggle to treat the surge in patients and lack enough personal protective equipment to keep workers safe.\n\n\"We essentially have built a health care system that is perfectly right-sized for the care that was delivered yesterday, with totally just-in-time supply chains because we value efficiency,\" said Dr. Brendan Carr, chair of emergency medicine for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York. \"And what just happened to us is we got caught out on that, and it became very, very clear that we weren't ready for an unexpected bump in the night.\"\n\nIn New York City, he said, \"it took two weeks, three weeks, until we totally broke the financial model of health care.\"\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nHealth care experts urged the industry to heed the tough lessons learned during the pandemic for the future of medicine, and they called for a change in financial incentives, a more national and global approach to public health, the creation of an efficient manufacturing and distribution system for critical supplies, and a continued increase in the use of telemedicine.\n\nCarr said that in New York City, the center of the virus in the U.S., there has been \"a total pause on almost everything that we understand as health care,\" including scheduled outpatient visits, procedures and operations, as well as chemotherapy treatments -- which are major revenue streams for hospitals.\n\nHe said primary care was a low-margin to negative-margin business for hospitals, while \"fancy operations and cancer therapy and things of that nature are high margins, what makes health care systems stable to offset the losses from primary care.\"\n\nA change in how health care businesses are run would likely be determined either by congressional action or by creating payment incentives for hospitals, Carr said.\n\nIf there were a congressional bailout for health care systems and business resumed as normal, he said, some systems would stockpile more, and some might be more mindful about workflows and increasing social distancing in facilities.\n\n\"But I've got to tell you that feels like moving deck chairs around on the Titanic to me,\" he said. \"Those are responses to a broken system, and the big fixes that are out there can't be done at the hospital level. They have to be done either with regulatory reform or through payment reform.\"\n\nDr. Hardeep Singh, a professor of medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, said hospitals have also typically run at near-maximum capacity and do not want to have excess beds because of financial incentives.\n\n\"But that has cost us in terms of problems in this day and age, so I think preparedness and having that surge capacity going forward\" would be critical in the future, he said.\n\n\"We generally in health care do things reactively, and I think what this episode has taught us is we need to be a lot more proactive,\" he said.\n\nSingh said the pandemic has showed that the U.S. should \"absolutely\" start relying more on domestic manufacturing of lifesaving personal protective equipment and ventilators, which were in short supply and high demand from manufacturers in China.\n\nIn addition, it is critical to have effective distribution channels and national data sharing, he said.\n\n\"We just don't have a national or regional sort of spine of all the data elements that we need to figure out where do we allocate resources next,\" he said.\n\nSingh stressed the importance of building a public health infrastructure in which the U.S. could identify which areas and hot spots will need the most supplies. The national infrastructure could also be used in future crises.\n\n\"You don't know what's going to affect us five or 10 years down the line,\" he said.\n\nDr. Paul Biddinger, director of Massachusetts General Hospital's Center for Disaster Medicine, said he expected many health care systems, including his own, to start stockpiling equipment.\n\nHe also hopes to see major changes at the national level in the distribution of supplies.\n\n\"In this arena, we have to have an excess capacity for events exactly like this, treating it like a national health security issue, just like we would with military supplies to defend the nation. This is a version of protecting the nation,\" he said.\n\nPatricia Davidson, dean of the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing, said the pandemic also showed the need for more national and global governance in public health.\n\nDavidson cited states' creating competition when they individually tried to buy protective equipment and ventilators, which drove up prices and left them scrambling.\n\n\"I really hope that we'll be able to learn some really important lessons and people can collaboratively come together to make better solutions,\" she said.\n\nRegional or national coordination of stockpiles of equipment or ventilators would be a challenge, she said, and it is important to develop a system that would allow for \"considered management of inventory and rotating things out.\"\n\n\"This is a really complex undertaking, but what's clear is individual, small, stand-alone community hospitals can't deal with this,\" she said.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe speed with which the virus became a worldwide outbreak also highlights the need for more global governance in health care and the empowerment of agencies like the World Health Organization, Davidson said.\n\n\"There needs to be a realization that we're each on the planet interconnected. Viruses don't know borders,\" she said.\n\nThe experts said the speed with which the medical system had to adapt to the pandemic led the health care industry to boost access to telemedicine.\n\n\"I think medical care in so many different ways will be transformed with the really increased use of telemedicine,\" Biddinger said. \"I think this hopefully will be better for patients and for providers for the subset of visitors where you don't really need to physically come in to see your doctor.\"\n\nBiddinger also hopes increased attention to hand hygiene and increased use of protective equipment could reduce the spread of infectious diseases within hospitals.\n\n\"Even in the medical setting, lots of people took a reasonably casual approach to personal protective equipment,\" he said. \"They weren't quite as careful about how they took off their gloves or gowns or their masks. They weren't quite as good at hand hygiene.\n\n\"I think that's now pretty ingrained in a lot of people. There's a possibility we could see a decrease in hospital-acquired infections, which would be fantastic,\" he said.\n\nBut other learned social behaviors could have negative impacts in the long term, Singh said.\n\n\"People have been afraid to go into health care [facilities] even if they have actually alarming symptoms, and we're afraid that people would be getting harmed sitting at home and not seeking treatment,\" Singh said.",

        "body": "A four-hour wait at the airport could become the norm, as some opt for \"sanitagging,\" an extra process that involves passing plastic and metal suitcases through UV light to disinfect them. Kai Pfaffenbach / Reuters\n\nHigher ticket prices, temperature checks before boarding, and no inflight alcohol: Airline travel in the post-coronavirus era will look very different from the low-cost \"getaway\" trips of the past -- and you should probably pack your lunch.\n\nAirlines are keen to see passenger volume return, and have been making significant changes to prevent the spread of the disease. In an industry that has seen a decline in traffic by 95 percent, and two airlines already forced into bankruptcy, the pressure to get it right is enormous.\n\nTo start with, ticket prices are likely to be 50 percent higher if planes attempt to enforce social distancing, according to Alexandre de Juniac, the head of the International Air Transport Association, the global air transportation authority.\n\nSome airlines, including Delta and EasyJet, have said they would at least temporarily eliminate the middle seat in order to allow a safe distance between passengers and those who are not part of their travel party. Aircraft designers are also looking at installing plastic screens between seats.\n\nMichael O'Leary, head of Dublin-based budget carrier Ryanair, said blocking off seats would be \"idiotic\" and prohibitive for his airline. In an interview with the Financial Times, he warned that if Ireland planned to impose such a rule, then \"either the government pays for the middle seat or we won't fly.\"\n\nPassengers on Frontier Airlines must pay an extra fee if they want the middle seat blocked, the company announced Monday.\n\nPaper menus and inflight magazines will also be a thing of the past, and even the inflight meals will look very different. Gone are the chicken or pasta choices: American Airlines said it will not provide alcohol or meals except on international routes. United will offer prepackaged and sealed drinks, and Delta encourages customers to bring their own food in order to \"reduce physical touch points between customers and employees.\" First class passengers will receive a packaged meal containing items such as a sandwich and fruit plate.\n\nOne more reason to pack a snack: A four-hour wait at the airport could become the norm, as some airports opt for \"sanitagging,\" an extra process that involves passing plastic and metal suitcases through UV light to disinfect them.\n\nThose suitcases will also cost more. American Airlines has already raised the cost of a checked bag to $75 from $60 for a flight between the United States and Europe or Africa.\n\nAnyone traveling out of Dubai should prepare to have their blood drawn. Emirates is conducting blood tests for some passengers. Etihad airline is installing contactless check-in booths to screen for symptoms. In some parts of India, disinfection tunnels will clean passengers before they gather. Thailand said it will deny boarding to anyone exhibiting symptoms such as sneezing or coughing.\n\nIn the U.S., Frontier is mandating that passengers fill in a health acknowledgement form certifying neither they nor family members have suffered from COVID-19 symptoms in the prior 14 days to the flight. The airline will not allow anyone who has a fever to travel.\n\nDespite the precautions, some travelers are skeptical that carriers will have the resources required to enforce new safety protocols. Many airport workers including security are not wearing masks.\n\n\"I'll believe in government officials and the safety of financially busted airlines when I see it,\" San Francisco-based tech executive Jean-Claude Goldenstein, who travels frequently to Europe, told NBC News.\n\nNancy Friedman is a retired travel marketing executive who took seven international trips and at least five domestic trips last year.\n\n\"While I'm anxious to continue traveling, before booking anything by air, I'd be sure the virus numbers were flat,\" she said, adding that she would need assurances that airplanes are doing meticulous cleaning and that there are temperature checks and that crew would wear gloves and masks.\n\nAmerican Airlines also said it would require flight attendants to wear masks and would distribute protective equipment to passengers. Lufthansa also said it would require masks for passengers and flight attendants.\n\nJetBlue was the first airline to require passengers to wear masks. Starting this week, passengers are required to wear a mask that covers their nose and mouth during the duration of each flight and also during check-in, boarding and deplaning, according to a JetBlue statement.\n\n\"Wearing a face covering isn't about protecting yourself; it's about protecting those around you,\" said Joanna Geraghty, the airline's president and chief operating officer.\n\nIn an interview on NBC's \"TODAY\" show on Wednesday, Sara Nelson, the president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA, AFL-CIO, said mask directives should be coming from the government. \"I encourage all airlines to follow JetBlue's lead on this.\"\n\nLast month, the association wrote a letter to Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, calling for the government to \"use its authority to mandate masks in aviation for crew, employees and passengers; require personal protective equipment; and suspend all leisure travel until the virus is contained.\"\n\nAs for passing through security -- a spokeswoman for the Transportation Security Administration said, \"It's truly challenging to predict what will change for TSA after the pandemic,\" though she said some changes have already been mandated by new government rules. Larger bottles of hand sanitizer are now permitted.\n\nThe spokeswoman recommends that passengers remove items from their pockets and place them on luggage rather than on the plastic trays. Frontline employees will change their gloves upon passenger request. Still, there's no nationwide requirement to wear masks.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which oversees the John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, said the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was leading health screening procedures and that following orders from Gov. Andrew Cuomo, new signs had been set up alerting passengers that they need to wear masks.\n\nStill, most airlines are not expecting passenger volume to return to its usual level for two to three years.\n\n\"We have to reimagine and reshape our airline and create a new future for our people, our customers and the destinations we serve,\" British Airways CEO Alex Cruz said in a memo to staff on Tuesday.\n\nThe International Civil Aviation Organization, an agency within the United Nations, said Thursday global airlines could see 1.5 billion fewer travelers this year. Seat capacity could drop by almost three-quarters, resulting in a $273 billion loss, compared to previous forecasts, the agency warned.\n\nAirline executives and Secretary of the Treasury Steven Mnuchin have described the coronavirus crisis as worse than what the industry experienced after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks.",

        "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel -- As the Nazis murdered Jews and ransacked their property on the infamous nights of Kristallnacht in 1938, 13-year-old David Toren stayed with his wealthy great-uncle in Germany admiring a painting hanging in the sunroom depicting two men on horseback on a beach.\n\nWithin a year, Toren would be smuggled out in a series of rescues for Jewish children organized by several European countries. Left behind, his family would perish in the death camps and their vast art collection would be seized by Nazis and later traded by unscrupulous dealers.\n\nToren went on to serve in the Israeli pre-state militia before moving to America where he eventually built a successful law practice on the 54th floor of the World Trade Center. Later in life, even as a degenerative eye condition robbed him of his sight, the images of his past never escaped him.\n\nToren died on April 19 in his Manhattan home from symptoms of the coronavirus. He was 94. He left behind his son Peter and two grandchildren.\n\nPeter Toren said his father spent his final years pursuing the art collection his family lost in the war.\n\nHe had sued the government of Germany for his great-uncle's collection and in 2015, after a lengthy saga, recovered the Max Liebermann work \"Two Riders on the Beach\" that so moved him in his youth.\n\n\"He regarded it as justice and felt very strongly about it,\" said Peter Toren. \"The art is something that was taken from his family and it was something there was a possibility of getting back. He couldn't get back all the lives that were exterminated.\"\n\nBorn Klaus-Gunther Tarnowski in Breslau, now part of Poland, Toren and his family at first seemed immune to the rise of the Nazis. His father, a decorated World War I veteran, was a prominent lawyer who was allowed to practice even after the Nazis forbade most Jews from doing so.\n\nBut eventually he too was taken away to a concentration camp and with his wife, died in Auschwitz.\n\nToren's great-uncle, the wealthy Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann, was forced to flee and the Nazis pillaged his extensive collection. Many of the works ended up in the hands of Hildebrand Gurlitt, a notorious German art dealer who traded in what the Nazis called \"degenerate art\" -- works deemed inferior because they were un-German -- to help fund the war machine.\n\nMuch of Gurlitt's collection remained unseen for decades and experts feared they had been lost or destroyed. But a vast horde of more than 1,200 works resurfaced by surprise in 2012 when German authorities raided a Munich apartment belonging to his son Cornelius while investigating him for tax evasion. Paintings by artists including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Henri Matisse were discovered.\n\nThe discovery brought renewed attention to the many unresolved cases of looted art that was never returned to original Jewish owners or their descendants.\n\nToren was the only descendant of his great-uncle, whose daughter died in Auschwitz, leaving him to stake a claim. After reclaiming \"Two Riders on the Beach,\" he tracked down another piece that had made its way to Israel. After a lengthy negotiation he got back \"Basket Weavers\" as well, an Impressionist work depicting five boys weaving baskets out of straw.\n\nHis son Peter Toren said further efforts were ongoing to acquire more than 50 documented antiques seized from Friedmann's collection.\n\nToren's grandson, Ben, said his grandfather pursued the art collection in retirement with an \"unsentimental\" focus and tenacity as he did in his law career. \"He very strongly felt that these paintings were his paintings and it gave him a lot of purpose,\" he said.\n\n\"But he never presented himself as being any kind of victim and he never asked for any pity,\" he quickly added. \"His life experience required of him to have a rock-solid exterior. That's how he presented himself to the world.\"",

        "body": "Stocks surged after a report said a Gilead Sciences drug showed some effectiveness in treating the coronavirus, giving investors some hope there could be a treatment solution that helps the country reopen faster from the widespread shutdowns that have plunged the economy into a recession.\n\nThe moves put the S&P 500 on track for its first back-to-back weekly gains since early February. Through Thursday's close, the S&P 500 has risen 0.35 percent, while the Nasdaq Composite climbed 4.65 percent, lifted by double-digit gains in Amazon and Netflix.\n\nA jump in Boeing shares and a rollout Thursday evening of the White House plan to reopen the economy also added to the bullish tone on Friday.\n\nGilead shares jumped more than 13 percent in premarket trading after STAT news reported that a Chicago hospital treating coronavirus patients with remdesivir in a trial were recovering rapidly from severe symptoms. The publication cited a video it obtained where the trial results were discussed.\n\n\"An effective treatment is a huge deal and would create a path to open the economy and resume normal 'social activities' way sooner than a vaccine,\" said Tom Lee, head of research at Fundstrat Global Advisors. \"A treatment is safer and more scalable because it is only given to people who need to be treated.\"\n\nOther studies have shown remdesivir to be an effective treatment against the coronavirus. However, they have been smaller in scale. Gilead itself also cautioned that anecdotal reports are not enough to determine yet whether the drug will be an effective treatment.\n\nStill, CNBC's Jim Cramer said the drug could give the economy a \"fighting chance.\"\"Remdesivir sounds like something that can get people out of hospitals quickly,\" Cramer said in a tweet Thursday. \"That allows our economy to have a fighting chance..I think that remdesivir would cut the morbidity ... which would change how quickly we can open... and what we can do.\"\n\nBoeing shares jumped about 7 percent after the airplane maker said it would resume production in the Seattle area as early as April 20.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Thursday that \"our experts say the curve has flattened and the peak ... is behind us.\"\n\nHe also issued guidelines to open up parts of the U.S. Thursday night, which identifies the circumstances necessary for areas of the country to allow employees to start returning to work.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Erika Rono, a nurse working in a top United States hospital.Jun Cen / for NBC News\n\nErika Ro\u00f1o has made it a rule in recent weeks to leave behind every aspect of her personal life as soon as she begins her shift at work.\n\nThere's no room to entertain thoughts about her monthly bills or even think about how her husband is doing at home. Once she walks through the doors at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, she can't afford to focus on anything else except her duties as an emergency room nurse.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has induced a new level of anxiety for Ro\u00f1o as the number of confirmed cases in the United States has skyrocketed to more than 1 million and more than 61,000 Americans have died over the last few months.\n\n\"The virus doesn't have a mind of its own, so it doesn't discriminate,\" she said. \"I just look at a patient knowing that this could be me tomorrow if I'm not careful or if my resistance goes down or I'm just unlucky. This could be me tonight. And that's the scary part of it.\"\n\nRo\u00f1o, 32, an ER nurse at Johns Hopkins Hospital and a vascular access nurse at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Maryland, arrived in the U.S. in 2014 and is one of an estimated more than 150,000 Filipino nurses in the U.S. who continue to work in the field as the pandemic continues.\n\nShe considers herself fortunate to work at a place that provides sufficient protective personal equipment for medical professionals, but she said she's disappointed in America's fragmented response to the crisis.\n\n\"Coming from the Philippines, you hear about the United States being a superpower. We can do a lot of great things, and this is happening. Why is this happening?\" she said.\n\nMaryland has more than 20,000 confirmed cases and more than 900 confirmed deaths. And both the hospital and the medical center have continued to see rises in admissions of coronavirus-positive people, Ro\u00f1o said.\n\nWork life has changed drastically for Ro\u00f1o, who has been at Johns Hopkins Hospital a little more than five years. She said she typically sees 12 to 16 patients during an average shift. But amid the pandemic, she's seen up to 35 patients a day, including those who are COVID-19-positive.\n\nBecause of the sheer number of COVID-19 patients, she and her colleagues engage in an approximately five-minute process to put on protective gear: gloves, powered air-purifying respirator hoods - or an N-95 mask and face shield -- gowns and an additional set of gloves. Shoe covers aren't mandatory, but she chooses to wear them.\n\nIt's not a completely new process, she said -- it's one she's had to do when she's dealt with tuberculosis patients. What worries her is the sheer number of COVID-19 patients Johns Hopkins sees that requires her and her colleagues to prepare so extensively.\n\nThe hospital's and the medical center's efforts to minimize contact between medical professionals and coronavirus patients have been an adjustment for Ro\u00f1o, as well. While treating unstable patients normally requires a team of seven to eight medical professionals, thet number has been reduced to four. She said she once spent four hours stabilizing a single patient without the help she normally has.\n\nHealth care workers account for 10 percent to 20 percent of coronavirus cases in the country. Ro\u00f1o has so far managed to remain unscathed despite having intubated multiple COVID-19 patients. But she said she knows of three doctors she worked with in the Philippines who have died from the virus.\n\nIt's not only work that Ro\u00f1o has had to adjust to. Her personal life has also been affected. She and her husband had been trying to start a family, but they paused because they worry that it may not be safe to bring a child into the world at this time, she said.\n\nThe many unknowns and rapidly evolving findings about the coronavirus have been the most challenging aspect of the crisis for Ro\u00f1o. She said Johns Hopkins last month began screening for gastrointestinal symptoms when testing patients for the contagious disease.\n\nThe one thing she said she does know is that social distancing measures have been effective. She encourages the public to continue distancing to keep the health care system from becoming overwhelmed.\n\nDespite uncertain times,Ro\u00f1o said it's fulfilling to be an ER nurse and part of a team that helps save lives.\n\n\"People come to us on the worst day of their lives, and we don't get to see the tail end of it, but you get to see them live,\" she said. \"You got to ship them off to the ICU, and you know there's hope for them to see another day. And you're part of that, and that's a pretty big deal.\"",

        "body": "Amid coronavirus concerns, a healthcare worker takes the temperature of a visitor to Essentia Health who was crossing over a skywalk bridge from the adjoining parking deck, Friday, April 10, 2020, in Duluth, Minn.Alex Kormann / AP file\n\nA flood of new research suggests that far more people have had the coronavirus without any symptoms, fueling hope that it will turn out to be much less lethal than originally feared.\n\nWhile that's clearly good news, it also means it's impossible to know who around you may be contagious. That complicates decisions about returning to work, school and normal life.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nIn the last week, reports of silent infections have come from a homeless shelter in Boston, a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, pregnant women at a New York hospital, several European countries and California.\n\nThe head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 25 percent of infected people might not have symptoms. The vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Hyten, thinks it may be as high as 60 percent to 70 percent among military personnel.\n\nNone of these numbers can be fully trusted because they're based on flawed and inadequate testing, said Dr. Michael Mina of Harvard's School of Public Health.\n\nCollectively, though, they suggest \"we have just been off the mark by huge, huge numbers\" for estimating total infections, he said.\n\nWorldwide, more than 2.3 million infections and more than 160,000 deaths have been confirmed. The virus has caused nearly unprecedented economic and social harm since its existence was reported in early January.\n\nBased on known cases, health officials have said the virus usually causes mild or moderate flu-like illness. Now evidence is growing that a substantial number of people may have no symptoms at all.\n\nScientists in Iceland screened 6 percent of its population to see how many had previously undetected infections and found that about 0.7 percent tested positive. So did 13 percent of a group at higher risk because of recent travel or exposure to someone sick.\n\nAboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, where one crew member died from the virus, \"the rough numbers are that 40 percent are symptomatic,\" said Vice Adm. Phillip Sawyer, deputy commander of naval operations. The ratio may change if more develop symptoms later, he warned.\n\nIn New York, a hospital tested all pregnant women coming in to deliver over a two-week period. Nearly 14 percent of those who arrived with no symptoms of coronavirus turned out to have it. Of the 33 positive cases, 29 had no symptoms when tested, although some developed them later.\n\nPreviously, tests on passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess cruise ship found nearly half who tested positive had no symptoms at the time. Researchers estimate that 18 percent of infected people never developed any.\n\nThese studies used tests that look for bits of the virus from throat and nose swabs, which can miss cases. Someone can test negative one day if there's not much virus to detect and then positive the next.\n\nSymptoms also may not appear when someone is tested but turn up later. One Japanese study found more than half of those who had no symptoms when they tested positive later felt sick.\n\nBetter answers may come from newer tests that check blood for antibodies, substances the immune system makes to fight the virus. But the accuracy of these, too, is still to be determined.\n\nOn Friday, researchers reported results from antibody tests on 3,300 people in California's Santa Clara county: Between 1.5 percent and 2.8 percent have been infected, they claimed. That would mean 48,000 to 81,000 cases in the county -- more than 50 times the number that have been confirmed.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe work has not been formally published or reviewed, but some scientists were quick to question it. Participants were recruited through Facebook ads, which would attract many people likely to be positive who have had symptoms and want to know if the coronavirus was the reason. Some neighborhoods also had way more participants than others, and \"hot spots\" within the county might have made infections seem more common than they are elsewhere.\n\nShips, maternity wards and single counties also don't provide data that can be used to generalize about what's happening elsewhere. And many of the figures have come from snapshots, not research on wide populations over time.\n\nAntibody testing in particular needs to be done \"in an unbiased approach\" on groups of people that are representative of the geographic, social, racial and other conditions, Mina said.\n\nThe CDC and other groups plan such studies, and they could guide public health advice on returning to normal life for people in certain areas.\n\nIf infections are more widespread than previously understood, it's possible that more people have developed some level of immunity to the virus. That could stifle the spread through what's called herd immunity, but scientists caution that there is still much to learn about whether mild illnesses confer immunity and how long it might last.\n\nIt will probably be months before enough reliable testing has been done to answer those questions and others, including how widespread infections have been and the virus's true mortality rate, which has only been estimated so far.\n\n\"If they've all seen the virus before, then maybe you can relax in that neighborhood\" and ease social distancing, Mina said. \"We're not anywhere close where we need to be\" on antibody testing to do that yet, he said.",

        "body": "A scientist works in the lab at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland, amid the outbreak of coronavirus on May 13, 2020.Russell Cheyne / Reuters\n\nThe science of sewage surveillance could be deployed in countries across the world to help monitor the spread of national epidemics of COVID-19 while reducing the need for mass testing, scientists say.\n\nExperts in the field - known as wastewater epidemiology - say that as countries begin to ease pandemic lockdown restrictions, searching sewage for signs of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could help them monitor and respond to flare-ups.\n\nSmall early studies conducted by scientific teams in The Netherlands, France, Australia and elsewhere have found signs that the COVID-19-causing virus can be detected in sewage.\n\n\"Most people know that you emit lots of this virus through respiratory particles in droplets from the lungs, but what's less well known is that you actually emit more small virus particles in faeces,\" said Davey Jones, a professor of environmental science at Britain's Bangor University.\n\nThis suggests that on a wider scale, sewage sampling would be able to estimate the approximate number of people infected in a geographic area without having to test every person.\n\n\"Every time a person becomes infected with COVID-19, they start shedding virus into the sewer system,\" Jones said. \"We're using that (knowledge) and tracking people's toilet movements.\"\n\nThe practice has been used to monitor health threats and viral diseases before.\n\nIt's a crucial tool in the global fight to eradicate polio, and scientists in Britain and elsewhere also use it to monitor antibiotic resistance genes from livestock farming.\n\n\"Wastewater epidemiology has been part of monitoring of polio infection across the world, so it's not completely new,\" said Alex Corbishley, a veterinary scientist at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh who is running a three-month pilot project to track SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Scotland. \"But it's never really been applied to an outbreak in this way.\"\n\n\"The idea here is that you could potentially use this as a relatively cheap, but much more importantly, scaleable, way of saying 'there's X amount of transmission' in a community.\"\n\nScientists conducting initial COVID-19 sewage studies in Europe and Australia stress that what they are picking up is not live, infectious virus, but dead particles or fragments of the virus's genetic material that are not infectious.\n\nIn a pilot trial in Queensland, Australia, scientists were able to detect a gene fragment of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage from two wastewater treatment plants.\n\nIn the Netherlands, sewage epidemiologists acted ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak there and took samples from seven cities and a major airport in February and March.\n\nWhile they found no detectable virus three weeks before the first COVID-19 case was detected, by March 5 - barely a week after the first case was confirmed there - they were able to detect virus fragments.\n\n\"The detection of the virus in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, indicates that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus,\" the researchers wrote in a paper posted online on MedRxiv.\n\nResearchers in Paris posted findings in April that showed how sampling wastewater in the city for a month tracked the same curve of the rising and falling epidemic there.\n\nFew countries have the resources or capacity to test each person individually, with most only able to test healthcare workers or people with symptoms severe enough to mean they need hospitalisation. This means authorities have only limited information about how widespread the new coronavirus is or whether it is affecting some communities more than others.\n\n\"You can use this type of surveillance as a public health tool,\" said Andrew Singer, a researcher at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology who is working with Davey and others on pilot coronavirus sewage testing plans in Britain.\n\n\"And the utility of this approach is that it's so cheap and the investment that you make ... will reap rewards, not just for (this) coronavirus pandemic,\" but for future outbreaks too.",

        "body": "A man plays the accordion in front of dummies displayed to replace audience during the Belarus Championship football match between FC Dynamo-Brest and FC Isloch in the town of Brest, on April 12.Sergei Gapon / AFP - Getty Images\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has silenced soccer stadiums across the globe.\n\nBut one of the few countries refusing to let the virus interfere with its soccer season -- or pretty much any other area of life -- is Belarus.\n\nThe country's longtime president, Alexander Lukashenko, has dismissed concerns about the outbreak and the mass lockdowns that have followed as \"coronapsychosis,\" suggesting that drinking vodka, going to saunas and driving tractors are the best ways to ward off the disease.\n\nThat has left Belarus as the only place in Europe where men's professional soccer is still being played, and in front of fans, too.\n\nThe country's premier league, Vysheyshaya Liga, hardly a draw for aficionados in normal times, is now being livestreamed by fans across the world starved for action since the season kicked off last month.\n\nSeveral clubs told NBC News that they are enjoying their newfound popularity outside Belarus. Vitaliy Bunos, chairman of FC Slutsk, said the club had gained fans from Australia, England and the U.S.\n\n\"It's great that they found out about us, and this, of course, motivates our players,\" Bunos said.\n\nAt home, he said fans are still allowed into the stands to watch the games, but they have to get their temperatures checked at the entrance and are asked to wear masks and use hand sanitizer.\n\n\"Probably, you can't be absolutely calm in the emerging epidemiological situation, but each of us is trying to follow the recommendations of doctors so as not to be at risk,\" he said.\n\nSome clubs are jumping on the sudden interest abroad as an opportunity to bring in more business.\n\nDynamo Brest FC, the league's reigning champion, has started selling \"virtual\" tickets to its foreign fans. As a token of appreciation, the club places cardboard cutouts of the faces of new supporters on mannequins in the stands during matches.\n\nAs to the well-being of their players, the club's spokesperson, Vladimir Machulskiy, said the team has been \"taking all measures\" to prevent infection, but as of now, they carry on playing as usual.\n\n\"No one is afraid or in panic,\" said the club's goalkeeping coach, Vasili Khamutouski.\n\nThe Football Federation of Belarus said last week that only three players in the league had been tested for coronavirus so far, and none were positive.\n\nAll major soccer leagues in Europe suspended their seasons last month, and the European Football Championship, scheduled for this summer, is postponed until next year. Turkey's league played games until mid-March before postponing play -- leaving Belarus as the only game on the Continent.\n\n\"Belarusian football is completely out of kilter with the rest of the sporting world,\" said Simon Chadwick, director of the Centre for the Eurasian Sport Industry in Paris. \"There are few competitive contests taking place anywhere, suggesting that the authorities in Minsk are perhaps not taking the virus as seriously as they should.\"\n\nBelarus, with a population of 9.5 million, had 6,264 cases and 51 deaths as of Monday, according to the country's health ministry. But it has not closed restaurants or businesses or restricted people's movement as the rest of Europe and the world has. It even reopened schools Monday after an extended spring break.\n\nTaiwan has also allowed sporting events to resume, without fans, as its baseball and soccer seasons opened behind closed doors over the weekend. But the island of 24 million has been far more successful at containing the outbreak, with six deaths so far from the coronavirus, according to Reuters.\n\nAsked if Vysheyshaya Liga would shut down should the outbreak worsen in Belarus, the league's general secretary, Sergei Zhardetski, said only that \"appropriate decisions will be made.\"\n\nFor now, Zhardetski said fans are allowed to attend games, albeit with safety precautions.\n\n\"We review the situation on a daily basis,\" Zhardetski said in an interview this month with ESPN. \"We fully trust our health care system, and there are currently no reasons for stopping the league.\"\n\nBut health experts are skeptical.\n\nSoccer matches are \"an ideal environment for the coronavirus to spread,\" said William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University.\n\n\"Taking temperatures offers some additional protection, but we have learned that COVID-19 can be spread by persons who are completely without any symptoms, including fever,\" Schaffner said. \"Unless done carefully, temperature taking can lead to false results -- the tumultuous atmosphere at the time of a football match likely is such an occasion.\"\n\nBut for fans clamoring for competition, the hope is that Belarus will play on.\n\nJosh Colbourne, 24, a teacher from Adelaide, Australia, has been watching the league since his home league shut down last month.\n\nNow an FC Slutsk supporter, Colbourne has been watching all the club's games, even though some of them run well into the night.\n\nColbourne said he hadn't given much thought as to whether the league should suspend play, saying it has provided \"an escape\" for the millions of fans like him forced into isolation.\n\n\"Selfishly, I'm sure everyone would love to see football still being played,\" he said.",

    "In Louisiana's 'Cancer Alley,' coronavirus brutalizes vulnerable black communities": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A healthcare worker leaves her shift at the University Medical Center as the spread of coronavirus continues, in New Orleans on April 14, 2020.Carlos Barria / Reuters\n\nWhen Sharon Lavigne was a little girl in rural Louisiana, she remembers the air being as fresh and sweet as the sugarcane her daddy grew on the family's farm. They lived off the land, fished and raised cows, hogs and chickens. The kids would play outside for hours. And Lavigne remembers feeling a deep connection to the soil beneath her naked toes and the air that would swell in her lungs on days she'd chase softballs into the long-setting sun.\n\n\"It was the American dream,\" she said. \"It was so wonderful. Everything was nice. The air was clean, the water was clean. We could drink water from the hydrant.\"\n\nLavigne's family has lived in St. James Parish, Louisiana, for four generations. Now 67, she still lives on 22-acres of her family's land. But these days she said the air she breathes sometimes burns her lungs. The ground is often covered in a mysterious soot or ash.\n\nSt. James Parish is a nearly majority black parish of about 21,000 people. It sits halfway between New Orleans and Baton Rouge -- along an 85-mile stretch that is home to more than 200 chemical plants and refineries. Even before the coronavirus arrived, there was so much sickness and death in that corridor of southeastern Louisiana that it's been given the nickname Cancer Alley. And more recently, Death Alley.\n\nIf Lavigne's grandchildren spend too much time playing outside they develop a rash, she said. Over the years, many of her neighbors, family and friends have moved or faded away. Too many to count. Cancer mostly. The landscape has changed, too.\n\nFor more on this story, subscribe to Into America, a new podcast from NBC News and MSNBC.\n\nMany of the old family farms have been replaced with petrochemical plants and refineries and other behemoths of industry -- DuPont, Mosaic Fertilizer, Nucor, NuStar, OxyChem, Plains Pipeline, Shell and others. Look out along the horizon and you see smoke stacks where trees once stood tall. The factories have pushed so far into residential communities that chemical storage tanks have sprouted behind churches, many neighbors share fence lines with facilities, not families, and some homeowners have found themselves jammed between chemical plants on nearly all sides.\n\nLavigne, who was diagnosed with auto-immune hepatitis in 2016 and lives next to chemical companies, eventually saw what she believed to be the cause of all the sickness and death -- the air and water.\n\n\"I have to go outside and breathe this air. It hurts. I'm telling you, it hurts so bad,\" Lavigne told NBC News for the \"Into America\" podcast. \"I pray every day, every night.\"\n\nAnd now the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 has exacerbated the dire state of health in St. James and nearby St. John the Baptist parishes, which are among the 20 U.S. counties with the highest per-capita death rates from the coronavirus. Lavigne said that friends and neighbors, many already suffering with health issues, have fallen gravely ill or died from the virus.\n\nThat's been the case in other environmentally compromised black communities across the country, where the virus appears to have seized upon America's deeply ingrained social and racial inequities to infect black people with greater frequency and lethality than whites. Health and science experts say layers of pre-existing conditions -- like hypertension, and heart and respiratory diseases -- often brought on by negative environmental factors like air pollution, have made black people more susceptible to catching and dying from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nThis month, Harvard released a preliminary study that suggests long-term exposure to air pollution is connected to the most severe COVID-19 symptoms and higher mortality rates from the disease. A long history of segregation and mistreatment has made African Americans more likely than whites to live in unhealthy neighborhoods, where air and soil quality are worse. Even middle-class blacks are more likely than poor whites to live in these kinds of more toxic environments.\n\n\"When you talk about having communities that are similarly situated with all the chemicals being pumped out, not having access to good quality health care, high concentration of people who are uninsured, then you have lots of underlying conditions that make it ripe for a heat-seeking missile like COVID-19,\" said Dr. Robert Bullard, a professor of urban planning and environmental policy at Texas Southern University. Bullard, widely considered \"the father of environmental justice,\" has spent decades researching the links between the environment and race.\n\n\"So when we talk about who's most likely to be the most vulnerable, you can actually predict where the deaths are going to be,\" Bullard said.\n\nCity by city and state by state, the disparities are glaring. In New York City, blacks are dying from COVID-19 at twice the rate of their white counterparts. In Chicago, African Americans make up just 30 percent of the population but 70 percent of the deaths from the disease. In Wisconsin, they represent 6 percent of the population, but nearly 40 percent of those fatalities. In nearby Michigan, it's 14 percent of the population and 40 percent of known coronavirus deaths.\n\nBlack Louisianans in Lavigne's region have been hit especially hard by the pandemic. African Americans represent 56 percent of the state's COVID-19 deaths -- much more than the 32 percent of the population they represent.\n\n\"It's not random. It's not isolated. It's not coincidental. The singular root is racism and the continued operation of disparities based on race and based on place,\" Bullard said. \"Air pollution and pollution in general is segregated, and so is America.\"\n\nChemicals emitted from nearby plants -- things like ethylene oxide and benzene -- are known carcinogens. And seven of the 10 census tracts with the highest cancer risk in the nation are found in Cancer Alley, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nIn St. James Parish alone, there are over 30 petrochemical plants. While the population is pretty evenly split -- 49 percent black, 49 percent white -- the plants are largely concentrated in the Fifth District of the parish, where Lavigne lives. The Fifth District is more than 80 percent black.\n\nWhen the first petrochemical plants started popping up in St. James Parish in the 1960s, Lavigne said people were excited about the prospect of good jobs. But as more plants started moving in, the prospects of black folks getting lots of those jobs seemed to vanish. White landowners began selling off their land to big corporations. In the decades that followed, sickness started to set in.\n\nLavigne and her neighbors have decided to fight back. In 2018 she formed a group called RISE St. James to push back against the expansion of big industry in their community. They do research, stage protests and have sued to stop construction of yet another petrochemical company facility in the parish.\n\n\"The industry is killing us now. On top of that, coronavirus keeps killing us. So we have a double whammy,\" Lavigne said. \"This is heartbreaking, and I don't want to leave, I want to stay right here. This is my home.\"",

    "In Nicaragua, express burials cast doubt on official coronavirus numbers, say doctors, families": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- Roger Ordo\u00f1ez was hospitalized with breathing problems last week.\n\nWhen his son Enrique came to visit the next morning, the 69-year-old retiree was already being buried by government workers in protective white full-body suits in a cemetery on the outskirts of Chinandega, a city of 133,000 people in northwest Nicaragua.\n\nThe hospital warned the Ordo\u00f1ez family to self-quarantine for two weeks but said their patriarch did not have the novel coronavirus, even though they were shown no test results.\n\nPresident Daniel Ortega's government has stood out for its refusal to impose measures to halt the coronavirus for more than two months since the disease was first diagnosed in Nicaragua. Now, doctors and family members of apparent victims say, the government has gone from denying the disease's presence in the country to actively trying to conceal its spread.\n\n\"I begged the doctor to tell me what happened to him,\" Enrique Ordo\u00f1ez said. \"I needed to know if he was infected. I have an 18-month-old girl, my mother has a variety of ailments and we need to know if it was COVID.\"\n\nThe government says this country of 6.5 million people has seen 16 coronavirus cases and five deaths since its first case was diagnosed. Businesses and government offices remain open and the government has actively promoted sporting events and other mass gatherings.\n\nThe nongovernmental organization Citizen Observatory made up of health workers and activists, said it had identified 1,033 suspected COVID-19 infections in the country through Saturday.\n\nNicaraguan epidemiologist Alvaro Ram\u00edrez, currently living in Ireland, said the number is already far higher and coming days \"will be decisive\" for Nicaragua.\n\nHe calculates that in two weeks Nicaragua could have some 18,000 infections, of which 890 would be serious.\n\nPlainclothes police and government supporters have detained journalists outside a hospital in Managua and in a cemetery in Chinandega in the past week.\n\nBut in Chinandega the pandemic is becoming difficult to hide. White-suited men in pick-up trucks with coffins in the bed have become a more common sight in recent days, residents say. And it seems everyone knows someone who got sick.\n\nA Chinandega doctor, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation, said she knew four people who had died, including one of her patients, who was buried within two hours of dying.\n\n\"Everyone they consider a suspected patient who has died of atypical pneumonia they send for immediate burial,\" she said.\n\nDiagnoses are made based on symptoms and X-rays of patients' lungs, because tests for the virus are tightly controlled by the Health Ministry and difficult to obtain.\n\nAn informal network of medical colleagues in the city had tallied 25 suspected COVID-19 deaths through Sunday, she said.\n\nOrdo\u00f1ez, an appliance sales executive, said his father suffered from chronic ailments, including hypertension and respiratory problems, but that last week from one day to the next he suddenly struggled to breath. He took him to the hospital Thursday evening and he died that night.\n\n\"The hospital organized everything,\" Ordo\u00f1ez said. He had shown up early Friday morning to ask about his father's condition, but they told him he was already being buried.\n\n\"I tried to identify the grave the best I could, because there are other bodies there,\" he said. \"But we can't raise our voices much. Fear is pervasive in our country.\"\n\nIf something else killed him, then why did the hospital bury him without letting his family be present and why did doctors tell Ordo\u00f1ez to self-quarantine for two weeks, he wondered.\n\nNeighboring Honduras and El Salvador have taken strict measures to try to slow the virus' spread. Honduras has about 2,000 confirmed infections and El Salvador has about 1,000. Costa Rica has more than 800.\n\nA request for comment from Vice President Rosario Murillo, the government's spokeswoman and Ortega's wife, was not answered.\n\nBut it appears the government is beginning to recognize what is coming.\n\nAt the end of April, the Health Ministry called a meeting of all the hospital directors and top-level health officials at ministry offices.\n\n\"They told them this is getting serious, that every hospital needs to prepare,\" said R\u00f3ger Pasquier, president of the Nicaraguan Anesthesiology Association. \"This call is very late. They didn't take isolation measures, they haven't protected health workers, there aren't sufficient beds in any Managua hospital, nor any regional hospital.\"\n\n\"Contrary to what is shared officially, I know through my medical colleagues that we have a great number of people sick in Managua, Masaya, Matagalpa and Chinandega, where there is an outbreak that could be very dangerous,\" Pasquier said.\n\nMany doctors fear speaking publicly, because of government retaliation. Pasquier said he was speaking freely \"because I'm not being political; we just want to save lives in a dramatic moment for the world.\"\n\nA doctor at another hospital for the National Police in Managua said there were 18 patients there with suspected COVID-19 infections. None had been tested, but were diagnosed based on symptoms and lung x-rays, said the doctor who requested anonymity because she was not authorized to speak.\n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio V\u00e1squez, president of the Nicaraguan Medical Unit, an organization of doctors that formed after the protests of April 2018, said the group had identified 42 doctors, nurses and technicians who have suspected infections.\n\nIn Chinandega, fear has deepened in recent days, a combination of more frequent sightings of the white-suited men in pickups and recent deaths of a couple of well-known local figures. The area has sea connections to El Salvador and a corridor for truck cargo with Honduras. Local officials have said nothing.\n\nThe local doctor said it appeared as though from Friday to Monday more than half of the city's formal businesses had closed. Doctors, nurses and technicians at the public hospital have been infected due to a lack of protective equipment and early recognition.\n\n\"If we manage to survive this, it's because God is great,\" the doctor said. \"There's no other explanation.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of nervousness here,\" said university student Pablo Antonio Alvarado, mentioning a couple acquaintances in Chinandega he heard were infected. \"They say we're the epicenter of the pandemic, like Wuhan in China.\"\n\nHe described the white-suited men riding with coffins in pickups as looking like \"astronauts.\" The Chinandega doctor said they were hospital orderlies given the task of quickly disposing of the dead.\n\nOrdo\u00f1ez was left with more questions than answers about his father's death. \"The doctor told me (the virus) was dangerous,\" while also insisting the elder Ordo\u00f1ez didn't have it, he said.\n\n\"I didn't bury him, they buried him,\" Ordo\u00f1ez said. \"And before, they had buried others, at dawn, because beside him there were seven or eight more graves.\"",

John Minchillo / AP\n\nPeople with obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure are at greater risk for complications from the coronavirus, according to a large study of patients hospitalized with the illness it causes.\n\nThe findings, published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association, confirm what physicians nationwide have noted anecdotally.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe study included data on 5,700 people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the New York City area.\n\nUnderlying conditions were common. The researchers found that, among all patients, 57 percent had high blood pressure, 41 percent were obese and just over a third had diabetes.\n\nPeople with those chronic health problems should call their physicians if they experience new or unusual symptoms or have contact with a person diagnosed with COVID-19, said the researchers, from the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell Health in New York.\n\nThat's \"because those patients, at least from our description, are highly represented in the people who have a severe course of the disease,\" said Karina Davidson, senior vice president at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research.\n\nThe study wasn't designed to answer why those conditions are more common among very ill patients.

But those symptoms tend to vary from person to person. And it's unclear whether certain symptoms might serve as warning signs that a person might end up in the hospital with severe disease.\n\nDavidson said Northwell Health is training medical students to go back and analyze patient charts for such symptoms.\n\n\"Is there any pattern of symptoms that predicts a worse outcome or predicts people are in fact going to be safe and can be managed at home?\" Davidson asked.",

    "Inmates fear death as Ohio prison is overwhelmed by coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Inmates voice concerns as coronavirus spreads in Ohio prison\n\nIn an Ohio prison struggling to contain a deadly outbreak of the coronavirus, inmates are fearful they won't make it out alive.\n\nRichard Williams, 27, has been in prison for more than a year and at the Marion Correctional Institution since November on an assault conviction. In the beginning of April, he developed a high fever. The fever has subsided, but the headache and chest pain linger.\n\nInmates like him are concerned that prison officials are not doing enough to protect them from the virus.\n\n\"Sometimes, I call my mom. I don't want to worry her too much because she gets to crying,\" Williams said. \"To be honest, I'm scared. I'm nervous of being in here.\"\n\nMarion has one of the largest coronavirus prison outbreaks in the country, with nearly 80 percent of inmates, or about 1,976, testing positive for COVID-19, according to prison officials. Five inmates and one correctional officer have died from the virus since the outbreak began.\n\nThe prison has struggled to institute social distancing, according to inmates. Several interviews and videos obtained by NBC News from inmates describe the prison population as living in close quarters, a lack of personal protective equipment for prison workers, limited supplies of soap and hand sanitizer, and a lack of physical separation between COVID-19 positive inmates and those who have yet to be tested.\n\nThe problems at Marion can be found in prisons across the country, according to the American Civil Liberties Union, which found that Marion's staggering positive case count is reflective of what the numbers may look like at every American prison under mass testing protocol.\n\nThe Ohio ACLU also says the high case count and Marion's difficulty to socially distance inmates is an indication of the overpopulation in American prisons.\n\n\"You got guys in here dying, that's falling out, that's stacked on top of each other,\" said Shannon Kidd, who has been incarcerated since 1996 for rape, kidnapping, aggravated murder and other charges. \"We got COVID-19, this was brought in to us. I know some guys have done horrific crimes, including myself, but I was a kid, I was a juvenile -- we just want help.\"\n\nKidd, 42, tested positive at the start of April. His symptoms initially included cold sweats, body aches, shortness of breath and a dry cough. He is one of the few COVID-19-positive inmates to report visible symptoms that he's aware of at this time.\n\nHe said prison officials are not doing enough to stop the spread of the virus inside the prison.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"They took our temperature regularly, but they haven't done anything other than that. They're saying a lot of people are asymptomatic, but there are a lot of guys who don't want to take this stuff to medical because they feel that nothing is being done. They don't want to be moved,\" said Kidd.\n\nMarion prison officials reported that 95 percent of COVID-19 positive inmates are asymptomatic. It is one of the few prisons in the U.S. implementing mass testing, along with two others in Ohio: Pickaway Correctional Institution in Circleville and the Franklin Medical Center in Columbus.\n\nKidd resides at dormitory 7 at Marion, where three inmates have died from the virus.\n\nOne was Jesse \"Ziggy\" Ziegler, 74, who died on April 20. His family was notified of his death when they got a call from Ohio State Wexner Medical Center asking if they needed an autopsy.\n\nZiegler's stepdaughter, Christine Bevington, 44, said he started showing symptoms of a sore throat, body aches, cough and headache on April 6. He was transferred to the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center sometime in the next two days. A nurse called Ziegler's family to inform them that he had tested positive for COVID-19 and was under oxygen and blood observation.\n\nBevington and her mother's last conversation with Ziegler was on April 19. A hospital director called to tell them Ziegler probably wouldn't make it through the night.\n\nBevington said that a prison official called the day after the hospital notified them of Ziegler's death. He expressed his condolences and then asked the family, \"Who called you and asked about an autopsy?\"\n\nAndre Stores, 43, tested positive for COVID-19 and resides in dormitory A.\n\nThe inmates say their bunks are just an arm's length from each other, and Stores has had an older inmate coughing at him the last few nights. Stores said he has been given only a single face mask since the pandemic began.\n\n\"One guy's lymph nodes were swollen, he had dizziness. It was four or five days before they took them out,\" Stores said. \"My neighbor just laid there, got real dizzy, and he couldn't taste anything, smell nothing, his head was hurting. This older guy had really bad diarrhea. ... People were walking around like zombies.\"\n\nWillis Williams, 64, is also housed at dormitory A and says he hasn't gotten his COVID-19 test results yet. Willis has high blood pressure and hypertension, and he fears the virus will kill him.\n\n\"There's people here who are obviously in advanced stages of the virus. One person was walking around like he was an extra on 'The Walking Dead,' dragging his feet,\" said Williams. \"I don't want to be here.\"\n\nThe Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said it has been difficult to separate COVID-19 positive inmates from the larger population because of the nature of the facility.\n\n\"The physical layout of a correctional facility does not lend itself to isolating every inmate at all times, especially in lower level facilities where there is dormitory style living,\" department spokeswoman JoEllen Smith said in an email.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe department said there is no shortage of cleaning supplies and added that it has increased the use of disinfectants. Inmates can request additional bars of soap if needed. As of Tuesday, inmates should have received a third mask.\n\n\"Head to toe\" sleeping has been implemented in the dormitories to increase social distance, ORDC said but inmates who spoke to NBC News said that's not true.\n\nOhio residents with incarcerated loved ones are bracing themselves to hear the latest updates inside Marion, if any. Williams' mother, Sabrina White, is anxious for him to come home -- although his sentence isn't up until March 2024.\n\n\"My son deserved to serve a sentence. ... He screwed up,\" White said. \"This is supposed to be a correctional rehabilitation facility, not death row. Right now, it is death row.\"",

    "Inside an 'army' of COVID-19 contact tracers in Massachusetts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "\"Every call is a chance to halt the virus in its tracks,\" said one worker on the virtual front lines of the state's effort to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nChristian Arthur was out of a job when the addiction recovery center in South Boston where he worked closed last month. It took him two weeks to find a new one -- as a \"contact tracer\" on the virtual front lines of Massachusetts' effort to halt the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"There's an army of us,\" Arthur, 29, told NBC News.\n\nWith the coronavirus still plaguing much of the country, contact tracing is seen as a key tool in the effort to stop the chain of transmission and help facilitate a safe reopening of the United States.\n\nThe practice involves identifying and making contact with all of the people who may have interacted with a COVID-19 patient. The virus tracers alert the contacts of their possible exposure, explain what they need to do and follow up to check on their health.\n\nContract tracing has long been used in the U.S. and other countries to help curb the spread of such diseases as tuberculosis, cholera and Ebola. It has also been used to great effect to mitigate the virus in countries like South Korea and Germany, public health experts say.\n\n\"All epidemics are super local, and that's why you have to go through this painstaking process,\" said Dr. Joia Mukherjee, chief medical officer of Partners in Health, which is hiring, training and virtually deploying the contact tracers in Massachusetts, an initiative launched by Gov. Charlie Baker.\n\nThe potential benefits of contact tracing have been well documented. But few of these contact tracers have spoken out in public.\n\n\"To participate in curbing this threat, especially on a local level in the state that I've lived in my whole life, is super meaningful,\" said Arthur, who started on the job two weeks ago. \"These may not be my literal neighbors and friends and family, but they might as well be.\"\n\nThe program in Massachusetts has a virtual workforce of 1,000 contact tracers. Roughly 9,000 applied in the first 24 hours, and the job pays the rate of a federal census worker, $20 to 25 an hour, according to Mukherjee.\n\nThe job is done exclusively by phone and the workers are trained in handling what could be difficult conversations.\n\n\"At the end of the day, some of this work is deeply human,\" Mukherjee said. \"And we want to make sure people are connected to one another to really talk through these questions.\"\n\nSome members of the corps of contact tracers work as case investigators, speaking with COVID-19 patients and untangling the web of contacts they may have exposed in the past 14 days. These workers counsel the infected people and help to connect them with such services as food assistance if necessary.\n\nKrysta Cass, 31, served as an Army officer for eight years after graduating from West Point in 2010 and being deployed to Afghanistan and countries in the Middle East. Before taking on a job as a supervisor in the Massachusetts tracing program, she worked as an orthopedic physician assistant.\n\nCass now oversees a team of 100 contact tracers, divided into 10 units with two to three case investigators in each. The case investigators interview those who tested positive and then pass along the list of contacts and places they went to to the contact tracers in the unit.\n\n\"Most military recruits volunteer for public service in response to a global need,\" said Cass, whose team focuses on Boston. \"The people I'm working with are so similar. They care about the mission.\"\n\nLast week, her team spoke to 535 people who tested positive and identified 255 contacts. Public health experts estimate that each positive case can infect two to two-and-a-half people.\n\nThe most sensitive of the cases get elevated to a person like Cass.\n\nOne involved a new mother and her baby, who both tested positive at delivery. Cass spoke to the mother just eight days after she gave birth.\n\n\"They were discharged from the hospital because they were doing well, and then their symptoms started to get worse,\" Cass said. \"Because English was their second language, they were confused and scared.\"\n\nCass connected them to the Boston Public Health Commission, which dedicated a nurse to help the mother navigate the illness affecting her and her newborn.\n\nWhen breaking the news to someone that they've been exposed, Cass said she never reveals the identity of the patient zero. \"People say, 'I'm actually too scared to tell some of the people I've been in contact with that I tested positive, because I don't want them to be mad at me,'\" Cass said. \"They don't want to be that reason to tell someone you're stuck in your house for 14 days.\"\n\nThe people who tested positive retrace their steps to identify any potential points of transmission. But it's not always a straightforward process, especially when the person has gone to a grocery store or other potentially crowded place.\n\n\"We'll call Whole Foods and let them know,\" said Cass, before giving an example of what she says on the calls: \"Somebody who's diagnosed with COVID-19 recently had exposed your workforce during these hours. They think they ran into a man who fits this description.\"\n\nCass said people who developed the virus and had used rideshare programs also pose challenges. \"We have to get the information like, 'Who is your driver?'\" Cass said, adding that the answer could be a first name, type of car and license plate. \"And we elevate that so that the state can let Uber know,\" Kass said.\n\nCalls for a national contact tracing program have grown in recent days. Since Massachusetts announced the launch of its program on April 3, other states have signaled a willingness to follow suit. Last week, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg will help fund contact tracing efforts in the region, which includes New Jersey and Connecticut.\n\nArthur, one of the first people hired to work at the Massachusetts program, said the job has led him to have conversations with a wide range of people, from high schoolers to senior citizens. His most memorable experience? A recent call with a woman in her late 60s.\n\n\"At the end of the call, she said, 'You know, I've been really socially isolated and I really appreciate just getting to talk to you,'\" Arthur recalled.\n\nThe job is fulfilling for another reason, he said. \"Every call,\" Arthur said, \"is a chance to halt the virus in its tracks.\"",

        "body": "The aerosol chamber at the Department of Homeland Security's biodefense research laboratory.Department of Homeland Security\n\nFor scientists working at the Department of Homeland Security's biodefense research laboratory, the directive from senior agency officials was unprecedented: drop everything and focus on one target, the coronavirus.\n\nAs the number of positive cases in the United States tops 1.2 million and deaths exceed 70,000, those scientists have been working 15 hours a day, seven days a week trying to crack the COVID-19 code.\n\n\"This is the most urgent thing we have worked on since 9/11,\" said Lloyd Hough, a senior official and biology expert with Homeland Security's Science and Technology Directorate.\n\nRead more on this story at NBCNews.com and watch \"NBC Nightly News with Lester Holt\" tonight at 6:30 p.m. ET/5:30 p.m. CT.\n\nThe National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center, or NBACC, was created and built by the department as a federal response to anthrax letter attacks in 2001.\n\nLocated on the sprawling biodefense campus at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Maryland, an hour outside Washington, D.C., the NBACC was the first national laboratory created by Homeland Security. Two centers are housed in the 160,000 square foot facility: the National Bioforensic Analysis Center which provides law enforcement with forensic testing on suspected bio threat samples such as anthrax and ricin, and the National Biological Threat Characterization Center, which conducts experiments and studies on biological hazards like the coronavirus.\n\nThe NBACC has a biosafety level 4 accreditation allowing scientists at the facility to perform research on the deadliest of pathogens, those for which no vaccine or treatment exists. It's one of only seven such facilities in the country.\n\nBSL-4 is the highest biosafety laboratory containment level, employing precautions such as dedicated airflow systems, positive pressure suits, layered gloves, and extensive personnel training to prevent exposure to or the spread of highly dangerous and infectious microbes including Marburg, Ebola and Lassa viruses, smallpox and the plague.\n\nSecurity at the facility is so tight that when an NBC News team recently visited the lab, officials said it was the first time in 10 years that cameras were allowed through the front doors and even then, the crew was not allowed to go beyond the front lobby.\n\n\"I would think that staff working here in the lab, they're probably better protected against the virus than the people walking around out in public who are exposed to the virus without any protection,\" said Paul Dabisch, a senior research scientist who is leading the coronavirus study at the facility.\n\nDabisch sat down for an exclusive interview and gave a detailed look at how the lab works.\n\nDozens of staff comprise multiple teams investigating different characteristics of the coronavirus, in the hopes of quickly learning more about its survivability and the transmission of the disease, both on common surfaces and in the air. Unlike other viruses, little was known about the emerging coronavirus when the pandemic broke out.\n\nThe lab received its first sample of the pathogen from a national repository which obtained the isolate or culture from a case in Washington state that in February became the first confirmed coronavirus-related death in the United States. Researchers have since acquired other samples from around the world with the intent of finding out whether the biological makeup of the virus has changed as it's circled the globe.\n\nTheir work is guided by a \"master question list\" intended to quickly summarize what is known about the virus, what additional information is needed, and which other research entities across the country are working to answer those questions. The list includes questions such as \"how much agent will make a healthy individual ill?\", \"how does it spread from one host to another?\" and \"how long after infection do symptoms appear?\" Each question is updated in a weekly report with two sections: \"What do we know?\" and \"What do we need to know?\"\n\nThe approach is modeled after similar work undertaken in 2015 in response to the Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nPreliminary results from the lab's testing were first revealed by William Bryan, the acting undersecretary for science and technology at Homeland Security, during a White House coronavirus press briefing two weeks ago. But shortly after Bryan mentioned how disinfectants can play a role in killing the coronavirus, President Donald Trump suggested that scientists test whether disinfectants, such as bleach, could be injected into the human body to fight the virus. The White House later said the comments had been taken out of context and Trump himself said he'd been speaking sarcastically, although there was no indication when he made the comment that he wasn't serious about the recommendation.\n\nRegardless, the intense backlash and ridicule of the president overshadowed Bryan's remarks. Doctors and other health officials railed against Trump's musing about injecting disinfectants into people. The comments also prompted warnings from the makers of commercial disinfectants.\n\nWhat got lost in the message was what Bryan referred to as the \"most striking observation to date,\" that ultraviolet rays from the sun may have a powerful effect on the virus.\n\n\"What we have found so far is that sunlight seems to be very detrimental to the virus,\" Dabisch explained. \"And so within minutes, the majority of the virus is inactivated on surfaces and in the air in direct sunlight.\"\n\nScientists say that could have a profound effect on eradicating the virus on everyday items such as shopping carts, playground equipment and outdoor furniture.\n\n\"Our preliminary results say, yes, that the sunlight on plastic will inactivate the virus very quickly. And so we're hopeful that that is the case,\" Dabisch said.\n\nOn a recent day, staffers were looking at such mundane items as the plastic on computer keyboards and mouses, items that people come in contact with on a routine basis.\n\nTesting has also revealed that higher temperatures and humidity may also help kill the virus and reduce its transmission.\n\nIn order to replicate different climates from around the country, the lab uses several environmentally controlled chambers -- it's the only lab in the country with this capability. It allows researchers to measure the potential survivability of the virus in different regions across the U.S., mimicking the typical levels of sunlight, temperatures and humidity.\n\nIn addition to measuring the virus's longevity on surfaces, those chambers are used to analyze how COVID-19 is transmitted through the air and how long it can survive in the form of small particles known as aerosols. That would have an effect on spread at nursing homes, hospitals, meatpacking plants, schools and prisons, where people are in close proximity.\n\nThe Homeland Security lab has made at least one critical discovery about the aerosol configuration of the virus: that the size of saliva droplets generated by an infected individual through talking, coughing or sneezing has no bearing on contagiousness. Droplets smaller than a human hair can be lethal.\n\n\"We're most concerned about the really small droplets that you can't see because those are the ones that get down deep into your lung and for most infectious agents, that's when you get the worst possible infection,\" according to Hough. \"Those could be deadly.\"\n\nAnother revelation: common disinfectants found in the home such as isopropyl alcohol and bleach can in some cases destroy the virus within seconds. But while the practical applications of that find are widespread, scientists at the NBACC have a specific purpose in mind: they are desperate to find different decontamination methods for personal protective equipment like N95 masks so the equipment can be reused if necessary. Extending the lifespan of PPE could be crucial in hard-hit areas of the country.\n\nDabisch said the main goal of the study is to learn the most possible about transmission routes for the virus and then use that data to assess the risks of performing activities in our everyday lives. He said that information can then be shared with policymakers, public health officials and front-line doctors and nurses to make informed decisions on how to combat the spread of COVID-19, and ultimately save lives.\n\nAs the death toll continues to mount, so does the pressure on scientists to solve the riddle of the coronavirus.\n\n\"It's very great,\" Dabisch admitted. \"We are working around the clock because of that to try to answer questions that we're being asked about this virus, and hopefully those results can help to inform our response to this and we know the clock is ticking on this.\"",

    "Instagram's cofounders left Facebook. Now, they're working on a coronavirus website.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "That's the question Instagram co-founders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger set out to answer when they created RT.live, a website that tracks the rate of infection in all 50 states.\n\nThey said it's meant to be an at-a-glance score for evaluating our progress in the fight against coronavirus.\n\n\"The goal for us was, what if we tried to boil it down to a single metric that tells you how things are going now,\" Systrom said. \"Forget about forecasting for a second. What's happening right now?\"\n\nSystrom and Krieger are just two of the many Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who have been trying to create new tools to help track the spread of COVID-19, which as of Thursday has killed roughly 50,000 people in the United States and left 26 million without jobs.\n\nApple and Google have partnered to build a system for smartphone-based contract tracing; Facebook last week released county-by-county maps showing where users have voluntarily self-reported COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nRT.live centers on an all-important number: One.\n\n\"This number is important because if I infect more than one person, that means the epidemic grows exponentially,\" Systrom said. \"But if I infect less than one person, the virus actually quickly peters out.\"\n\n\"So all we're trying to do is say, look at this number. ... If it's above one, that's bad news. If it's below one, we're doing a good job.\"\n\nEpidemiologists generally use a unit of measure known as R0 (pronounced \"R-naught\"), or the basic reproduction rate of a virus. R0 is a measure of how many other people, on average, a single contagious person goes on to infect. But that's a hard number to directly find.\n\n\"The problem is measuring it,\" Systrom said. \"Because you can't go around and easily know exactly how many people someone infects. So what you have to do is take a look at the data coming in and infer what that number is.\"\n\nAnd so Systrom and Krieger decided to instead go after Rt, or the effective reproduction rate of the virus -- the rate in real-time that one person seems to be infecting other people in a given location. The number is broadly calculated using the reported number of new infections and comparing them to past reports.\n\nBut the lack of testing capacity, delays in test results and other factors make that data by itself unreliable. So the duo drew on Bayesian statistics, used for generations to investigate the probability of outcomes under changing conditions, and drew from a Bayesian algorithm built to predict the spread of disease in a 2008 paper by a pair of Los Alamos National Laboratory researchers. But while that algorithm only compared today's rate to yesterday's, Systrom drew his result from the past seven days, which he said seems to sharpen the results.\n\nAt a broad state level, Rt can be misleading, Systrom said. In California, which Systrom describes as \"a tale of two different regions doing two very different things,\" the Rt suggests Californians aren't doing enough to stop the virus. But that doesn't reflect the reality in specific cities.\n\n\"Los Angeles and Riverside are actually growing fairly quickly. The Bay Area is not growing quickly. But when you blend those together, you get an average picture that looks like it's picking up slightly,\" he said. \"So if you go to our site, you'll see that California has an R above one. But that may not feel like what is happening locally.\"\n\nAs of late April, RT.live's data suggests that the rate of infection is trending down in states like New York and Virginia and trending up in states like California and Connecticut. The idea is that over time, as data is added to the model, the Rt will become more and more accurate.\n\nSystrom and Krieger said their next goal is to get more specific data on a county-by-county, metro-by-metro level.\n\nTracking an infectious disease was not what Systrom and Krieger thought they'd be doing when they stepped down from their roles at Instagram in 2018, six years after the photo-sharing site was acquired by Facebook.\n\n\"It's an interesting change from Instagram, where you're working sort of within your own company, keeping everything secret,\" Krieger said.\n\nKrieger said their operation is now able to make its work public, which means collaboration with statisticians and epidemiologists who have helped improve their system.\n\nAnd what have their efforts and the available data taught them about COVID-19 and the path toward recovery?\n\n\"I think that most people think about this as ... a one way door. Like you open the door, you go through this process and you're on the other side,\" Systrom said. \"I think the truth of the matter is that it's way more complicated. It's way more like a revolving door. Where you go in, and it's possible you go through to the other side, but it's also possible you go around once or twice.\"\n\nIn other words, it's possible we may curb the disease for a time, or in some counties or states, then find ourselves back in a scenario similar to the one we're in today.\n\n\"You're going to have some states or some municipalities who get through this and get on the other side and start to open back up, only to become infected from another area where someone travels from, because they haven't gotten through to the other side,\" Systrom said.\n\n\"It's this dynamic nonlinear system that makes this so hard to predict,\" Systrom said. \"So I am hopeful that we've done a good job in terms of lowering our T-values over time. But I think it's going to be difficult going forward. And I think that's why we need something like this.\"",

    "It's hard to flee from your abuser during a coronavirus lockdown": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "During the COVID-19 lockdown, calls for help to domestic violence hotlines have grown shorter and more frantic. One woman shared her story with NBC News.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, contact the National Domestic Violence Hotline by calling 1-800-799-SAFE (7233), visiting www.thehotline.org or texting LOVEIS to 22522.\n\nWhen the stay-at-home order went into effect in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, C. realized her plan to leave her abusive husband had just been sped up. Her two teenage children would suddenly be home to witness the violence.\n\n\"My kids were home from school and they were going to see this,\" said C., who asked that her full name not e used to protect her privacy. \"They knew how controlling he was, but knowing that they would be home -- we didn't make it two weeks into our stay-at-home order.\"\n\nThe family walked on eggshells during the order, she said. \"What I wore to the way I did my hair -- anything would set him off.\"\n\nC. knew she was going to leave, but didn't know when or how. When an argument over what television channel to watch began to escalate one night, she'd had enough.\n\nShe told her husband she was leaving, she said. He threatened to throw her down the stairs.\n\nC. and her kids stayed in a hotel that night, while her husband emptied her bank account, freezing her financial options. At the bank the next morning, which was open for drive-through service only, she explained what happened to the teller. The teller said she'd once been in a similar situation and gave C. the phone number for the local domestic violence organization, Safe House for Women, saying they could help her.\n\nWithin hours, after a call to Safe House, C. and her children were in a hotel room with a kitchenette, where they've been for the last five weeks. She's among many women who have fled domestic violence during stay-at-home orders who have ended up in hotels for long-term stays because shelter capacity has been dramatically reduced to limit the potential spread of COVID-19.\n\nDomestic violence organizations around the country have overhauled how they operate in the last two months due to coronavirus, working to support isolated victims who are suddenly harder to reach and help than ever. It's an unprecedented challenge for domestic violence groups, which provide victims with everything from shelter to legal support, mental health counseling, relocation assistance, and even rape crisis response.\n\nThirty-five local domestic violence organizations in 19 states shared with NBC News how their work has changed since the start of the crisis. Most saw major disruptions in requests for services. Hotline calls became shorter and callers more frantic. In some areas, calls more than doubled, in others, lines went eerily silent as victims trapped at home with abusers had limited privacy to call. Several providers said that while reports of abuse went down under their local stay-at-home orders, those that did come in described more violent incidents.\n\nThe pandemic has forced domestic violence groups to figure out how to file protection orders remotely, how to provide emergency shelter that doesn't create unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus, and how to reach victims who can't make phone calls. Many have implemented innovative solutions, such as working with local courts to set up e-filing for protection orders, partnering with hotels to increase shelter capacity and rapidly setting up text-message hotlines.\n\nYet all that costs money, and funding for these organizations, which often already operate on shoestring budgets, is suddenly far less stable. Many have lost significant income in the past two months and are bracing for future budget cuts at a time when experts say domestic violence is on the rise. A number of city law enforcement agencies previously confirmed to NBC News that they saw an uptick in calls about domestic violence during the first few weeks of stay-at-home orders.\n\n\"These crimes are rooted in power and control,\" explained Beth Larsen, the executive director of Resilience: Advocates for Ending Violence in Western Michigan. She, like all the providers who spoke to NBC News, expects a rush of people seeking assistance as restrictions lift.\n\n\"Any threat to an abuser's feelings of vulnerability almost always escalates violence toward other individuals -- who are often intimate partners or family members,\" she said. A pandemic is just that kind of threat.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, victims reach out to domestic violence shelters, families, or co-workers when their abuser isn't home, according to shelter directors around the country. But under a stay-at-home order, they may never have a chance to place a call because their abuser is always present.\n\n\"Abusers thrive off isolation. With the pandemic, it is a perfect storm for domestic violence,\" said Kristin Shrimplin, president of Women Helping Women, which provides domestic violence services in greater Cincinnati. \"Survivors are telling us that it is not safe for them to talk.\"\n\nOrganizations that run hotlines reported varying changes in calls to NBC News. A majority of groups saw shorter call durations after shelter-in-place orders went into effect. Some saw call volume and website traffic rise. Others experienced the opposite. One group in Texas saw both its highest and lowest daily call volumes ever in the same month.\n\nThere are many factors that could affect trends in call volume and duration, said Ruth Glenn, the executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. \"What are the stay at home directives? Are they rural or urban or suburban? What is the social economic area that you're in? How many domestic violence resources are available?\"\n\nOverall, said Glenn, \"We probably saw a decrease when we first went into COVID crisis, survivors adjusted to their temporary normal -- they figured that part out -- and now they're figuring out how to be safer.\n\nThe increase in frantic calls and severe abuse reports led the Domestic Violence Action Center in Honolulu to provide additional mental health resources for staff members as it worked to expand services.\n\n\"We had to be more creative in our outreach to better protect survivors and our own staff,\" said CEO Nanci Kreidman. When it became \"impossible for us to make a phone call,\" she said her nonprofit rushed to build a 24/7 text message service.\n\nWhile the national domestic violence hotline has been providing online live chat and text messaging for more than a decade, local hotlines often only have the capacity to take calls. Some, like Kreidman's, have pushed to add texting or website live chat services in the last two months. Others said more victims are contacting them through Facebook messages.\n\nAround the country, organizations are coming up with innovative solutions to other challenges created by social distancing. Advocates who can no longer accompany survivors during sexual assault exams at emergency rooms now participate through video conferencing. Providers are filing protection orders online and hosting virtual support groups and therapy sessions. An organization in Ohio is supplying more covert aid by hiding money in food deliveries.\n\nThe pandemic's unprecedented unemployment numbers only further discourage victims from leaving their abusers, said Shrimplin.The vast majority of the people her organization assists have a family income below $50,000. \"Many women that we serve are financially dependent on their abuser and more often than not, have one or multiple kids,\" Shrimplin said. \"It's even worse that more and more are losing the jobs they barely had.\"\n\nSojourner House in Providence, R.I., has seen more clients reaching out to its transitional housing program for rental assistance than ever before. \"We used to receive a few requests for rental assistance a month, but in the month of April we received 50 such requests in one week,\" said executive director Vanessa Volz.\n\nWhat happens when victims make the leap and reach the shelters? Unfortunately, traditional shelter design doesn't lend itself to social distancing.\n\nMost domestic violence shelters were designed for short, emergency stays: they were set up dormitory-style, with shared bathrooms, kitchens and other common spaces. In recent years, many have shifted toward more small rooms of just a few residents or single families, with residents staying sometimes weeks while they regain a sense of safety and independence.\n\nTo keep residents safe and comply with public health guidelines, shelters around the country have reduced capacity. Many have limited the number of staff on site at any given time, asked residents to stay in their rooms when possible, and placed six-foot markers in shared areas. Some have created quarantine space out of a room with a private bathroom, in case anyone requesting assistance shows symptoms or is awaiting a coronavirus test result.\n\n\"As a domestic violence services provider, we used to strive to provide trauma-informed, victim-centered care,\" said Nicole Barren, executive director of Rise-NY, located near Binghamton, N.Y. \"Much of this practice has had to be abandoned to keep staff and residents safe.\"\n\nWhen the New York stay-at-home order took effect, Barren's team made the difficult decision to temporarily close their 20-bed shelter for nearly three weeks to properly prepare it to be a safe environment. They worked to get a hold of sanitizing supplies and masks for staff and residents, instituted daily temperature checks, and fitted their transport van with plastic sheeting between the driver and passenger area.\n\n\"We now have grab and go meals,\" said Jeannine Lisitski, the executive director of Women Against Abuse in Philadelphia, which operates two 100-bed shelters in the city. \"Everyone is wearing masks, we're taking temperatures from everyone.\"\n\nWith capacity reduced in many places, organizations are turning to hotels to insure they can provide housing to those in need. Hotels with unfilled rooms are offering many shelters discounts, but housing victims in them brings additional challenges, keeping them isolated and more difficult for service providers to be in regular contact with.\n\nDomestic violence groups have long used hotels for short, temporary housing when necessary, but the pandemic has led many to start using them for long-term stays. The biggest challenge is food, as few hotel rooms have kitchenettes, and many victims seek housing with their families.\n\nOther options have similar challenges. Resilience in Western Michigan is currently housing more families at an unnamed alternative location than at its shelter. While the second location has greatly expanded capacity, the organization has taken on the task of coordinating daily food deliveries for all residents there.\n\nThe need for safe housing in compliance with social distancing has strained resources for Safe House for Women, the Missouri group that has been helping C., despite a swell of community support.\n\n\"We received a grant from the Community Foundation of the Ozarks for $10,000 to help us with our hotel placements, but in the month of April we spent $13,000,\" said executive director Jessica Hill. \"At one point, we had 20 people in the shelter and 20 people in the hotel. We didn't want to turn anyone away.\"\n\nWhile more isolated than a shelter, the freedom of the hotel has been \"amazing,\" C. said. Away from her husband, she is taking steps to build a life for her family somewhere new.\n\n\"I've had a lot of people ask me, 'Why didn't you leave before?' And it's that he had that much control over me,\" she said.\n\nNow, she makes her own decisions. \"I took my kids fishing for the first time in ages on Mother's Day, because that's what I wanted to do. And we had the best time.\"\n\nHelping families like C.'s takes time and money. Yet since the start of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.S., more than half of the 35 organizations NBC News spoke to have lost significant funding. Before the pandemic, many were already facing funding cuts from government grants, in some places the cuts were upwards of 20 percent.\n\n\"Our income has gone down but our expenses have not,\" said Sandy Nadeau, communications director at Anna Marie's Alliance in St. Cloud, MN. \"Will businesses rebound and donate? Will people hold on to funds and not donate?\"\n\nSafeHaven of Tarrant County in Texas spent $35,000 on technology alone to move to partial remote work. The YWCA of Dayton, Ohio had to cancel its largest annual fundraiser, which usually sees 900 people attend and brings in more than $200,000. The Safe House for Women in Missouri lost almost two months of income from its thrift store, which typically provides 30 percent of the organization's operating budget, when it had to temporarily close its doors.\n\nThe new financial strains have forced some domestic violence organizations to consider cutting their services and hours.\n\nGlenn, of the national coalition, said programs around the country expect to see a significant increase in calls and a rise in reports of domestic violence as restrictions ease in the coming months and more people are able to share their stories from isolation. \"All of us in the domestic violence field of work are bracing ourselves,\" she said.\n\nThe worst case scenario is turning away people in need. \"Supply won't be able to meet demand, and the thought of having to turn away survivors who have been hurt is terrifying,\" said Kreidman in Honolulu.\n\n\"It's going to cost us and it's going to cost survivors.\"",

But what may have looked like much-needed relief brought more financial punishment.\n\n\"It's only for surviving,\" said Barberi, wearing a mask and rubber gloves outside his family-owned boutique in one of Rome's most fashionable neighborhoods, adding that he was opening to show \"the people a new way, a new day.\"\n\nAlmost a century old, his I Vippini Roma children's clothing shop sells mostly handmade outfits. It had only a few customers on the day it reopened, and only one made a purchase.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nBarberi's tiny store and its customers are at the tip of the spear of Italy's delicate economic reopening, one that will be watched by the rest of the world as policymakers try to prevent the pandemic from becoming an economic catastrophe.\n\nPoliticians, as well as medical and economic experts, warn that Italy may not make a convincing model for other countries -- its death toll remains the highest in Europe, at 24,114, according to Johns Hopkins University. Some complain that Italy's planning for its \"phase two\" of the outbreak is still too little, too late.\n\n\"Come on, you need to have a plan,\" said Alessandro Vespignani, an Italian American physicist and expert on mathematical epidemiology at Northeastern University in Boston. \"This is like everyone is talking about D-Day but they don't know if they have ships, soldiers or support. But all everyone is talking about is when is [the date] of D-Day.\"\n\nAround two weeks before Italy is scheduled to reopen for business on May 3, an advisory task force of scientists, business and economy experts appointed by the Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has yet to roll out a comprehensive plan to put Italians safely back to work. On Tuesday, Conte said that he was \"confident\" that he would be able to announce a plan for reopening the country by the end of this week.\n\nThe government describes this phase as the one in which Italians find a way to live with the virus -- allowing people to return to work and use public transportation while still practicing social distancing, tracking personal associations and strengthening the health system to prepare for fresh outbreaks.\n\nIn Italy, as elsewhere, medical caution is colliding with hard economic realities. The heavily indebted country ranked among the least financially solvent in Western Europe even before the crisis, and recent estimates from the International Monetary Fund see Italy's economy contracting by more than 9 percent by the end of the year -- the worst projection in Europe.\n\nEven after Silvio Brusaferro, president of Italy's National Health Institute, said last week that the \"contagion curve is dipping,\" the government is debating whether to extend the lockdown past May 3 over concerns of a viral rebound.\n\nThe debate over Italy's reopening has played out across familiar fault lines, pitting big business and industry against labor unions and the wealthy north against the much poorer south.\n\nThe government is tentatively planning to slowly reopen the economy in three stages across the north -- by far the worst afflicted by the virus -- the center and south of the country, according to the Italian news agency ANSA.\n\nWhich businesses open first and how has become a central sticking point in the debate.\n\nChildren's clothing stores like Barberi's were allowed to open last week, along with bookstores, stationery stores and logging activities -- counterintuitive categories that labor and industry leaders said were meant to prevent swarms of new customers.\n\n\"I think it's because children grow up,\" Barberi said about why his store was allowed to open so early. \"If there was someone that was born in December or January, they finished their little dress.\"\n\nBarberi's shop is among the 95 percent of Italian businesses that employ fewer than 10 employees. Those companies, less equipped to provide protection for their employees and typically more financially exposed, are among the most vulnerable to the virus.\n\nBut representatives of major industries in the automobile and garment sectors have been applying substantial pressure on the government to allow large factories to reopen.\n\nOf particular concern are the \"Made in Italy\" brands -- labels in fashion, food, furniture and mechanical engineering (mostly automobiles) that are largely for export and considered iconic.\n\nThe newspaper Corriere della Sera reported over the weekend that such businesses may be allowed to reopen before May 3.\n\n\"There is a real risk that these industries will be severely damaged,\" said a representative of Confindustria, the Italian employers' federation, which has been pushing hard to reopen big brands. \"You can find ways to allow safe work. But you can't just stay at home ... because the social consequences can be really very, very serious.\"\n\nThe Confindustria representative argued that most new cases were transmitted within hospitals, private homes and nursing homes, not workplaces.\n\nBut epidemiologists have called such arguments misleading. While most patients who died from the disease are elderly and retired people, many probably contracted the virus from younger working people who carried few symptoms.\n\nLabor unions have argued against returning to work while complaining that big business is prioritizing the economy over workers' safety.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"There's a sort of contradiction between saying always 'stay at home, stay at home, stay at home,' but at the same time to tell workers to go to work without the security and conditions,\" said Gianna Fracassi, deputy secretary-general of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, Italy's main labor union.\n\nFracassi said that even after major industries had agreed with the government to keep the economy shut in public meetings Friday, they then privately lobbied the prime minister to reopen early.\n\nThe representative from Confindustria denied that industrial lobbies had disagreed with the government's decision to extend the lockdown.\n\nBut the arguments around the reopening point to an emerging realization about phase two: For many, in particular labor unions such as Fracassi's, it's less a new phase than a new reality.\n\n\"We will be in a different world, and we will need to be in a very different social and economic situation,\" Fracassi said. \"We know that we are going to be different at the end of this story, which will be very long.\"",

Smithfield Foods is one of the five processing plants involved in the pilot program.Daniel Acker / Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nA federal judge has dismissed a worker advocacy group's lawsuit accusing Smithfield Foods Inc, the world's largest pork processor, of failing to adequately protect employees from the novel coronavirus at a plant in Missouri.\n\nSmithfield is already taking many of the steps called for by the Rural Community Workers Alliance, including screening production-line workers for symptoms and installing barriers between them, District Judge Greg Kays in Kansas City, Missouri, said in his ruling on Tuesday.\n\nKays also said that under President Donald Trump's executive order in April requiring meatpacking plants to remain open during the pandemic, the federal government, and not the courts, were responsible for overseeing working conditions.\n\nVirginia-based Smithfield, which is owned by China's WH Group Ltd, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nDavid Muraskin, a lawyer for the advocacy group, on Wednesday said the decision was disappointing but that the lawsuit had spurred Smithfield to make changes in response to workers' concerns.\n\n\"We wish that Smithfield would do more, but the decision shows that workers can organize and move companies to make changes, and that's a really important development,\" Muraskin said.\n\nIn the lawsuit filed last month, the RCWA accused Smithfield of creating a \"public nuisance\" by failing to protect workers at the Milan, Missouri, plant and endangering the surrounding community.\n\nSmithfield responded that it had implemented protections recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other agencies.\n\nThe company said the lawsuit should be dismissed because OSHA is already conducting an investigation of the Milan plant, and government agencies are continually changing their guidance for the industry.\n\nKays agreed in his decision on Tuesday.\n\n\"Under these circumstances, where the guidelines are rapidly evolving, maintaining a uniform source for guidance and enforcement is crucial,\" the judge wrote.\n\nSmithfield has closed other pork-processing plants in Missouri, Wisconsin and South Dakota after outbreaks of coronavirus cases among workers. Companies like Tyson Foods Inc, Cargill Inc and National Beef Packing Co have also shut U.S. meat plants during the pandemic.\n\nLast week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that about 4,200 workers at meat and poultry plants had contracted the novel coronavirus, and 20 had died.",

Some experts say he waited too long to impose social restrictions and failed to adequately prepare the NHS and supply it with personal protective equipment.\n\nThe United Kingdom has had more than 20,000 people die in hospitals with COVID-19 -- giving it one of the highest death tolls in Europe -- with many more believed to have died in nursing homes.\n\nFor years Johnson's private life has been the subject of some speculation, fueled in part by his repeated refusal to say how many children he has.\n\nHe has been married twice before and fathered four children with his second wife. In 2013, when Johnson was mayor of London, appeal court judges ruled that the public had the right to know whether he had an extramarital affair with a woman who gave birth to his daughter.\n\nThis is his first child with Symonds, and their wedding would be the first for a sitting prime minister in some 250 years.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The end of the pandemic and a return to normalcy will mean more strain on human services providers as they deal with the fallout of a distressed economy. Evan Vucci / AP\n\nMore than half a trillion dollars in aid has been set aside for the government's Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses weather the coronavirus pandemic -- but the hastily crafted guidelines mean some of the most needy businesses miss out on crucial funding.\n\nThe small-business lending program is open only to companies and organizations with fewer than 500 employees, which is meant to ensure that the most vulnerable businesses receive aid. But it inadvertently shuts out larger nonprofits that provide essential human services.\n\nThose groups could desperately use an influx of cash as they cater to increasing numbers of society's most vulnerable populations, such as the homeless and the elderly, many of whom are also at high risk for developing severe symptoms of COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus.\n\n\"These nonprofits are the kinds of groups that fall through the cracks,\" said Doug White, a nonprofit and philanthropic adviser. \"This bill doesn't go where they are. They're being hung out to dry.\"\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nWhile the workforce restriction prevented nonprofits from getting access to much-needed cash, the otherwise loose guidelines meant unintended recipients got millions of dollars. That included the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, one of the most profitable franchises in the NBA, which was able to secure $4.6 million during the first round of PPP distributions. The Lakers eventually returned the money.\n\nThe main purpose of the PPP loans is to cover eight weeks of payroll, but a smaller percentage can also be used to cover rent and utility expenses. If the rules are followed, the loans will be forgiven, making them especially desirable to human services nonprofits, which are struggling to respond to the pandemic.\n\nAs providers of essential services, these nonprofits have to stay open. Not only are existing services in higher demand, but new expenses related to COVID-19 are also taxing finances.\n\nThe issue facing these large nonprofits is not whether they'll get back the money they spend. They most likely will, through reimbursements from cities or states. The problem is whether they can stay afloat long enough to survive the pandemic without the immediate relief that something like PPP would provide.\n\n\"They don't know when they're going to get this money back,\" said Michelle Jackson, acting executive director of the Human Services Council, which represents 170 human services nonprofits. \"PPP would be great to help them muddle through the next few months.\"\n\nTom Hameline, president and CEO of Help USA, a nonprofit fighting homelessness, said: \"90 percent of what we're talking about is a cash flow and timing issue. We're stretched very thin now with what we have in a checking account.\"\n\nHelp USA, which is based in New York City, operates 53 programs and shelters in six states. To serve more than 3,500 people every day, it has a workforce of over 1,600 employees, including social workers, janitorial crews and security officers.\n\n\"Over the last month, we've put out close to $700,000 in COVID-related expenses, including protective gear, extra staffing, diapers, supplies for families quarantining with us,\" Hameline said.\n\nOne of the biggest new outbreak-related expenses is disinfection after a suspected or positive COVID-19 case. It requires hiring a specialized outside company that sends cleaners in heavy protective gear. Each incident costs thousands of dollars. Last week alone, Help USA had to hire cleaners seven times. In all, it has spent upward of $100,000 on COVID-19-related sanitation.\n\nHelp USA also now has to pay for heavily marked-up protective gear for workers and occupants while continuing to pay regular vendors, who are strained by the economic downturn and adopting a first-pay, first-served policy.\n\nThere's also heavier reliance on the services Help USA provides, such as its food pantry, as more adults and children are out of work and school. Costs that might be offset by a workplace or a school are being placed on the organization and its shelters. For instance, Help USA had to buy mobile Wi-Fi devices to make sure the students in its shelters can keep up with virtual instruction while schools are closed.\n\nIt's also paying its employees 100 percent of their usual salaries even as they work reduced hours.\n\n\"I wake up between 3 and 4 in the morning worrying about people dying and running out of money,\" Hameline said. \"I don't know how to consider what one does when you run out of cash.\"\n\nHelp USA is $13 million in the red. It's working to increase its line of credit from $5 million to $10 million, which is an expensive route for a nonprofit -- one that CAMBA, based in Brooklyn, New York, is trying to avoid.\n\nCAMBA, which runs numerous homeless shelters and provides social services to New Yorkers, has about 2,000 employees.\n\n\"We've expended approximately $1 million in this very short period of time,\" CEO Joanne Oplustil said.\n\nPart of the cost is associated with providing its shelters with a daily supply of 1,500 gloves, 500 masks and 30 gowns. CAMBA has also had to rent hotel rooms to ensure that people in its adult shelters, which are structured like dorms, can socially distance. There's also greater demand for expensive wraparound services, such as meal delivery for the elderly and those in quarantine who have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"PPP is really ideal for the nonprofit world, where a lot could be paid back without interest,\" Oplustil said. \"That's the quagmire for nonprofits. There's nothing geared for us.\"\n\nNot only are nonprofits being skipped over by coronavirus-related aid; they've also had to cancel valuable fundraising events because of social distancing lockdowns. Some groups have become creative and turned to other foundations for assistance, but that's only a temporary fix.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nHenry Street Settlement CEO David Garza was recently able to secure an additional $1 million, but increased costs due to the pandemic have pushed ongoing expenditures well over that amount.\n\nHenry Street, which operates four homeless shelters and two supportive housing units in New York, is now providing 1,800 meals a day to people. It employs about 700 workers.\n\nThe organization is paying onsite staff members time and a half, and, for the time being, it has been able to continue paying its employees who aren't currently working. It has launched a help line staffed by 16 caseworkers to serve those sheltering at home. Henry Street also issued emergency cash grants totaling tens of thousands of dollars to high-risk groups, such as the undocumented, artists and gig workers.\n\n\"It's gravely unfortunate that we're not eligible considering the relevance and importance of what we're doing,\" Garza said. \"As much as I understand the speed with which they needed to get this out, that's what happens when you issue a one-size-fits-all guideline like 500 employees.\"\n\nUnfortunately, the end of the pandemic and a return to normalcy will only mean more strain as human services providers deal with the fallout of a distressed economy.\n\n\"More people are going to be homeless because of the outbreak,\" White said.\n\nJackson agreed, saying evictions will increase, as will reliance on essential services.\n\n\"Nonprofits will be in an even riskier position in the long term, because COVID recovery is going to be squarely on their backs,\" Jackson said. \"They're going to be more heavily relied upon when we come back from this.\"",

But before that happened, the CDC reported that workers were promised extra money if they showed up for work during the pandemic.\n\n\"Additionally we learned of a 'responsibility bonus' of $500 being offered to employees who did not miss time (e.g. were not late or sick) during the time period of April 1, 2020 through May 1, 2020,\" the report stated.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Smithfield's CEO, Kenneth Sullivan, to the findings. The company's chief spokesperson, Keira Lombardo, said in a statement: \"We will thoroughly and carefully examine the report point by point and respond in full once our assessment is complete.\"\n\nSmithfield Foods is one of the biggest clusters of coronavirus cases in the country and has put an unwanted spotlight on Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican who has been criticized for not issuing a shelter-at-home order in a state where as of Thursday nine deaths and 1,956 cases have been reported.\n\nNoem has, however, urged residents to practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings.\n\n\"I want to thank Vice President Pence, Secretary of Agriculture Perdue, and the CDC for prioritizing the situation at Smithfield Foods in Sioux Falls,\" Noem said in a statement. \"Their partnership has been critical to the work that we've done to get this cluster under control and safeguard the health of this workforce.\"\n\nNoem also pledged that the South Dakota health department \"will continue to work with Smithfield and offer any assistance we can to help them implement these CDC recommendations, so they can safely reopen this plant as soon as possible.\"\n\nLater, at a press conference, Noem said she is \"anticipating\" Smithfield will act on the CDC's recommendations.\n\nMeanwhile, Tyson Foods Inc. announced it was closing a meat processing plant in Pasco, Washington that produces enough beef in one day to feed four million people.\n\n\"We're working with local health officials to bring the plant back to full operation as soon as we believe it to be safe,\" Steve Stouffer, head of Tyson Fresh Meats, said in a statement.\n\nTyson has already closed two pork processing plants and a chicken processing plant in Tennessee because of the coronavirus.\n\nExperts warned that all these closures could result in meat shortages.\n\n\"Meat shortages will be occurring two weeks from now in the retail outlets,\" Dennis Smith, a senior account executive at Archer Financial Services, told Bloomberg News.\n\nMore than 5,000 meat and food processing workers have been infected of exposed to COVID-19 and 13 have died since the pandemic struck, the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union reported Thursday.\n\nAt Smithfield Foods in South Dakota, the CDC report suggested 11 recommendations for the Smithfield plant in Sioux Falls, including speeding up the installation of plexiglass barriers on production lines, adding 100 more time clocks to prevent bottlenecks, boosting the number of hand sanitizer stations to 3,500 so there is at least one per worker, and designating staffers to roam the floor and provide hand sanitizer to workers on the line every 30 minutes.\n\n\"A combination of control measures with ongoing education and training will be useful in reducing or eliminating transmission in the workplace,\" the report said. \"These recommendations are intended for this specific Smithfield plant, but broader interim recommendations for meat and poultry processing industries are in development.\"\n\nThe South Dakota Department of Health is requiring the company to submit a plan of action before it reopens and expects it to follow the CDC recommendations.\n\n\"For each recommendation, please indicate a timeframe for implementation,\" Health Department secretary Kim Malsam-Rysdon and state epidemiologist Dr. Joshua Clayton wrote in a letter dated Thursday to Sullivan.\n\n\"If a recommendation cannot be implemented or a different solution is proposed, please provide the justification,\" it said.\n\nThey also asked for a date when the plant, which processes fresh pork, bacon, hot dogs, deli and smoked meats, will re-open.\n\nSmithfield is owned by Hong Kong-based WH Group, which is the largest pork processor in the world and which also operates plants in Wisconsin, Missouri and Pennsylvania. Two of the U.S. plants were closed after workers there tested positive for the coronavirus.",

They're overwhelmed by all the information.

Here's what else you may qualify for.\n\nQualified workers, including those telecommuting, can get two weeks of paid leave at full pay courtesy of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act.\n\nValid reasons include being unable to work because you are under quarantine order, have coronavirus symptoms and are seeking diagnosis, or must care for a child whose school or daycare provider is shut.\n\nIf you're caring for a sick family member, you might still qualify for a portion of your pay.\n\nMany utility companies -- including PG&E, Con Edison, American Electric Power Company and Duke Energy, among others -- have suspended service disconnections.\n\nYou may be able to set up a payment plan for your utility bill or have some fees waived, such as for late payments. Check the website of your provider for assistance tapping into other support programs, such as Housing and Urban Development's COVID-19 resources. Your state's website may help.

    "Many New Yorkers with COVID-19 waited too long to call 911. Why?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "An ambulance drives down the street during the outbreak of the coronavirus in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Thursday, April 16, 2020.Lucas Jackson / Reuters\n\nSince the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, thousands of New York City residents with symptoms of the disease it causes have called for ambulances, only to die before or just after the EMTs arrived.\n\nWhy? The experts and the data suggest the reasons are linked to the patients' home addresses -- but also to effects of the virus on the body that have come into better focus only after six weeks of deaths. Many patients probably didn't know how sick they really were.\n\nNBC News reviewed data from Emergency Medical Services, the division of the city's fire department that handles 911 calls, showing that the number of cardiac calls -- calls for patients whose hearts have stopped or are near death -- has spiked since the beginning of the pandemic, as has the number of those calls that end in death. The surge is particularly noticeable in the city's poorest neighborhoods.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nOn March 23, EMS call volume started rising to record levels, from 4,000 on an average day to more than 6,500 calls a day.\n\nThe fire department's chief of emergency medical services, Lillian Bonsignore, said at the time, \"I've been in this profession for about 30 years, and I've never seen anything like this in my whole career -- or in my life, for that matter.\"\n\nFrom March 1 to April 13, poor neighborhoods in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens recorded two to three times the number of cardiac calls compared to the same period in 2019, with three to five times as many patients dying.\n\nFrom March 1 to April 13, 2019, almost 60 percent of cardiac call patients in the borough of Queens survived. This year during the same period, 70 percent died.\n\nExperts say that patients in those poor neighborhoods are more likely to have underlying conditions like heart disease and diabetes that can make coronavirus infection lethal and that they may be wary of seeking health care until an emergency arises because of the cost. The neighborhoods also have higher numbers of people per residence and many multigenerational households, aiding the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nA look at the city's poverty rates by ZIP code and data from the fire department's 911 dispatch system shows the link. In the Bronx neighborhoods encompassing ZIP codes 10456, 10467 and 10468, 28 percent to 38 percent of residents live below the poverty line, compared to a citywide rate of 18 percent. In those ZIP codes, there were 114 cardiac calls and 46 deaths a year ago. This year, over the same March 1-to-April 13 period, there were 346 cardiac calls and 223 deaths.\n\nIn the Rockaways, an area of Queens, the poverty rate is close to 20 percent, and 60 percent of the population identifies as black or Hispanic, both groups hit hard by COVID-19, the disease associated with the coronavirus. There were 76 cardiac calls and 35 deaths a year ago. This year, the totals were 204 cardiac calls and 151 deaths.\n\nIn Brooklyn's East New York, the poverty rate approaches 25 percent, and more than 90 percent of the population identifies as black or Hispanic. There were 79 cardiac calls with 34 deaths last year, compared to 168 cardiac calls and 114 deaths this year.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe data sharply contrast with the numbers from affluent lower Manhattan. In ZIP codes that cover the financial district, Tribeca and parts of SoHo, the poverty rate averages 8.8 percent and more than two-thirds of residents are white. Last year, there were 30 cardiac calls with 12 deaths, and this year there were 42 cardiac calls with 23 deaths. There were more calls and more deaths, but nothing like the uptick in poorer, nonwhite neighborhoods.\n\nDr. Ashwin Vasan, an assistant professor at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, called the data dramatic, saying, \"This virus has come into our society and simply exposed the structural weaknesses and the inequities and the disparities that were already there.\"\n\nBut Vasan and Dr. Eili Klein, an assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine's Department of Emergency Medicine, both said other, non-demographic factors also fed the spike in cardiac calls.\n\nThey said messaging to members of the public early in the outbreak about avoiding hospitals unless they were very ill probably led people to stay home with lesser symptoms.\n\nAs doctors' understanding of the disease improved, they discovered that many patients had greatly diminished lung capacity long before they displayed those serious symptoms that were supposed to make them call 911.\n\nKlein said COVID-19 can cut lung capacity by as much as 50 percent before a patient even knows it, like a form of \"cryptic\" pneumonia. People can feel sick but not short of breath.\n\n\"It's attacking the lungs in a way that's not fully giving all the signals to your immune system that it's attacking the lungs, so the lungs are sort of acting regularly,\" Klein said.\n\nVasan said this hidden phenomenon can lead to a sudden decline in a COVID-19 patient's health, the kind that elicits a 911 call when it's too late. \"People are at home with these really low oxygen levels,\" he said, \"and then they hit that tipping point, and it just gets beyond the point of return -- in the case of this data, the point of cardiac arrest.\"\n\nA doctor who has been treating patients at one of New York City's busiest hospitals, Richard Levitan, wrote in a New York Times opinion piece about patients he treated who had symptoms for long periods before they went to the hospital.\n\n\"To my amazement,\" Levitan wrote, \"most patients I saw said they had been sick for a week or so with fever, cough, upset stomach and fatigue, but they only became short of breath the day they came to the hospital.\"\n\n\"We are just beginning to recognize that COVID pneumonia initially causes a form of oxygen deprivation we call 'silent hypoxia' -- 'silent' because of its insidious, hard-to-detect nature,\" he wrote.\n\nVasan and Klein both said EMS did the best it could in March and April given the hand it was dealt.\n\n\"I think our EMS operators are heroes, our FDNY are heroes,\" Vasan said, \"and they did the best and they've been doing the best with a very difficult set of circumstances.\"",

One temporary worker from Voyant has died from COVID-19, and others said the company hasn't done enough to keep them safe.Chicago Workers Collaborative\n\nCOVID-19 outbreaks at meat and poultry facilities have hobbled the nation's meat supply chain, leading President Donald Trump to invoke the Defense Production Act to keep them open.\n\nBut outbreaks at manufacturing facilities that make everything from wind turbine parts to soap have also sickened scores of workers while garnering far less attention.\n\nSome of those employees are sounding the alarm on what they say were poor safety practices that led to widespread infection among their co-workers.\n\nThe federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has more than 1,300 open safety complaints related to COVID-19 at manufacturing facilities, according to NBC News analysis of data that runs through May 4. Those make up about 20 percent of the 6,672 open complaints related to the coronavirus. OSHA also closed 466 complaints from manufacturing facilities through April 22.\n\nExperts said OSHA has taken a lax approach to enforcing safety laws during the pandemic, putting workers at risk.\n\n\"OSHA did not put out a standard for this pandemic and is not enforcing their authority,\" said Preethi Pratap, a research assistant professor of environmental and occupational health at the University of Illinois at Chicago. That's left even well-meaning facilities scrambling to figure out protections, and workers pay the price, Pratap said. \"Every worker is vulnerable.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Labor, which oversees OSHA, vigorously disputed that claim in an email to NBC News. The spokesperson cited guidance issued specifically for the manufacturing sector in mid-April that included social distancing, training workers to properly use protective clothing and equipment, allowing workers to wear masks and ensuring workers have access to public health communications about coronavirus recommendations in the workplace.\n\n\"The suggestion that employers have been left to figure it out for themselves is false,\" the spokesperson said. The rules already in place have enough teeth to protect workers from the coronavirus, the spokesman said, and the agency doesn't intend to issue more. \"Because of the enforcement authorities already available and the fluid nature of this health crisis, OSHA does not believe now is the time to issue a new regulation.\"\n\nTPI Composites, a manufacturer of wind blades, shut down its Newton, Iowa, facility after approximately 20 percent of employees tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a May 2 news release. At least one worker has died.\n\nKyle Brown, 54, worked at TPI Composites for eight years, most recently in the maintenance department, his wife, Pamela Dennen, told NBC News in a phone interview. Brown died from COVID-19 on April 29.\n\nDennen described her husband as funny, quirky and passionate about sports. She called him \"the best husband ever.\"\n\n\"We didn't have a fancy or adventurous life, but we loved it,\" Dennen said. \"The everyday stuff of just living life was so exciting and so fulfilling and so happy.\"\n\nTPI did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Brown's death or the number of people who tested positive for COVID-19 at the company's facilities.\n\nBrown began experiencing COVID-19 symptoms on April 17, which started with difficulty breathing and a burning feeling in his chest, Dennen said. Knowing he'd been exposed to the virus, Brown sought testing the following day at a local urgent care center. But staff there told Brown he could not be tested because he didn't work at a meatpacking plant and wasn't over 65, Dennen said.\n\nHowever, Iowa's testing framework as of April 17, which detailed criteria for COVID-19 testing through the State Hygienic Laboratory, did not require employment at a meatpacking plant to be tested for the virus. Essential services personnel with fever or respiratory illness were among those who fit the criteria for testing.\n\nBrown was later able to get tested at a nearby hospital but was denied hospitalization twice, despite barely being able to breathe, his wife said. He was finally admitted to a hospital in Marshalltown on April 24 and flown to a hospital in Des Moines days later, where he died.\n\n\"I don't know if there'd been intervention earlier, I don't know if he'd be able to survive. ... We'll never know that,\" Dennen said. \"We felt like nobody was paying attention to how sick he was and that it was being written off as, 'This is COVID. This is what we're seeing. Go home.'\"\n\nAlmost 500 miles away in Grand Forks, North Dakota, workers said they were ignored in March when they raised alarms about safety conditions at LM Wind Power, a General Electric-owned plant that produces wind turbine blades, according to the company's website. Weeks later, 145 people tested positive for COVID-19, according to the North Dakota Department of Health. Fifteen of those employees live outside of North Dakota, while 130 are North Dakota residents, the department told NBC News. At least one employee from the plant has died, but GE did not confirm whether it was related to the coronavirus.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of one of our employees,\" the plant's director, Jagadish Rao, said in a statement to NBC News. \"We extend our condolences to the family and friends of our colleague, and have offered to assist the family during this difficult time.\"\n\nLarissa Boushee, a former employee, said she tried to provide early warning signs back in March, when she wrote an email to the local health department. She said officials told her she wasn't the only person who was complaining about LM Wind Power and that any complaints would go straight to the mayor's desk.\n\n\"I thought, 'Great, something will happen,'\" Boushee said.\n\nNothing did, Boushee said. So, she took it a step further and went to OSHA.\n\nA Department of Labor spokesperson said the complaint was received on March 26, adding, \"At this time, OSHA continues to work with the company during the implementation of their safety action plan.\"\n\nGE told NBC News it \"proactively took a comprehensive set of actions at our facility in line with CDC guidelines and in coordination with local officials, including implementing temperature checks, increasing the disinfection and cleaning of our site, adding cleaning staff, applying physical distancing measures, staggering break times, and distributing hand sanitizers, among other safety measures.\"\n\nBut Boushee and two other employees told NBC News that social distancing was not consistently enforced, door handles were not properly disinfected and protective equipment, including masks, was limited.\n\nAsked about those accusations, a GE spokesperson said they began to implement safety measures \"before we learned of the first cases of COVID-19 at our facility.\"\n\nOne employee said they spoke with supervisors and contacted GE Global with concerns about whether there was a coronavirus plan in place for employees at the plant. They never received a response from GE, but human resources said safety measures would be put in place and anyone with concerns could take voluntary time off, which could include unpaid leave if someone had not accumulated enough paid time off, the employee said.\n\nBut taking unpaid leave isn't realistic for working-class people, said the employee, who spoke anonymously for fear of retribution.\n\n\"If we don't have paid time off,\" the employee said, \"you're not going to stay home.\"\n\nAnother employee, who also spoke anonymously for fear of retribution, said supervisors allowed employees who were ill to continue to work.\n\n\"I was shocked at how many people were sick and still coming to work,\" said the second employee, who has since tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThree weeks after Boushee raised concerns, the outbreak at LM Wind Power was so widespread that North Dakota's Department of Health issued an executive order mandating all plant employees remain under quarantine for two weeks.\n\n\"Nobody did a thing until after there were positive cases,\" Boushee said.\n\nThe plant, which shut down in mid-April, is now beginning to reopen, with employees undergoing training to familiarize themselves with new safety protocols, GE said.\n\nBut Boushee said she isn't going back to her job in the plant's component's department, where she worked for about one year.\n\n\"I don't feel safe there,\" she said. \"They just don't care.\"\n\nIn her district outside of Chicago, Illinois state Rep. Karina Villa said she's hearing the same concerns. She gets calls daily from workers in the 350 manufacturing facilities in her district who claim their employers haven't made the changes needed to keep them safe.\n\n\"We're working elbow to elbow. We have to punch in on the same time clock. We're given flimsy PPE. We're being ignored,\" Villa said workers tell her.\n\nAmong Chicagoland residents raising alarm are those at Voyant Beauty, who last month took their concerns to the Illinois attorney general. This week, workers rallied outside the facility in Countryside to demand better sick leave policy.\n\nAs is the case throughout the area, many who work at Voyant are temporary workers employed through a staffing agency, according to Tim Bell of the Chicago Workers Collaborative, a nonprofit focused on low-income workers. Many are also Latino, a demographic group that is testing positive for the coronavirus at higher rates than any other in the state. That's alarmed officials and experts who say that if the number of COVID-19 cases \"continues to rise in Latino communities, so too will the rates of deaths.\"\n\nUntil recently, Hilda Bravo was one of those Voyant workers. She spent 17 years at the facility, putting labels on lotion, shampoo and soap for major brands. In early April, Bravo got a notice from her staffing agency that the facility would shut down for cleaning for several days.\n\n\"They didn't say why,\" Bravo recalled.\n\nSoon after, Bravo learned her colleague Norma Martinez, whom she had seen on her last day at work, had died from COVID-19. Another employee who worked on Bravo's line tested positive around the same time, she said.\n\n\"An individual who previously worked with us as a temporary employee tragically passed away at their home, presumably from COVID-19,\" Voyant spokesperson Anne Miller wrote in an email. \"We mourn this individual's passing, and we are heartbroken for this loss.\"\n\nVoyant told NBC News it is taking precautions, including temperature checks when workers arrive; use of social distancing, masks and plastic shields between workers; and deep cleaning on weekends or when someone has presumably tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"While unfortunate that anyone should catch this virus, less than 1% of our worker population has tested positive for COVID-19,\" Miller said.\n\nAfter 17 days of self-quarantine, Bravo went back to Voyant -- she was worried about paying her rent. She said that while the company was checking for fever, people were still working in close quarters. \"There are so many lines bunched together that social distancing is impossible,\" she said.\n\nAfter nearly two decades as a temp worker at the facility, Bravo decided not to return. She has heard of at least eight co-workers at Voyant who have tested positive for COVID-19 and is worried about what would happen if she caught the virus, as she doesn't have health insurance or sick leave.\n\n\"There's already been one person dead, and there have been several infected,\" Bravo said. \"I'm 60 years old. I'm afraid to go back.\"\n\nMark Denzler, president and CEO Illinois Manufacturers' Association, which represents the majority of facilities in the state, said his members are working hard to protect their employees. One challenge has been that throughout the pandemic, the guidance around safety has been a moving target.\n\n\"The guidance has changed rapidly,\" Denzler said. \"One of the frustrations that we hear from our members are different opinions or interpretations of best practice.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention might say one thing and the local health department another, he said, making it difficult for the companies trying hard to know what the best practices are.\n\nVilla said she has seen companies who have kept workers safe, which is why she feels others can do better.\n\n\"That's how I know there's a standard that can be met,\" she said. \"It's not impossible to put people above profit.\"",

        "body": "A patient is loaded into an ambulance at Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center in Andover, N.J., on April 16, 2020.Stefan Jeremiah / Reuters file\n\nThe New Jersey nursing home where 17 bodies were found stuffed into a tiny morgue last month was hit with a hefty fine Friday after federal inspectors found that residents there were put at risk of \"serious injury, harm impairment or death.\"\n\nThe Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation II facility in Sussex County must pay $220,235 -- more than $14,000 for each day that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) found the \"facility was not in substantial compliance with federal requirements,\" from April 6 to April 20. The home also faces other fines, and the monetary penalties will accrue \"until substantial compliance is achieved or termination occurs,\" according to a May 7 statement by Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J.\n\nThe nursing home currently has 133 residents and 54 staff members who have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the congressman. In total, 94 residents and one staff member have died.\n\n\"These failures in proper infection control practices had the potential to affect all residents in the facility through the development and transmission of COVID-19 and other communicable disease,\" said the CMS inspection report cited in Gottheimer's statement. \"It was determined that the provider's noncompliance with one or more requirements of participation has caused, or was likely to cause, serious injury, harm impairment or death to residents.\"\n\nThe report detailed specific instances of disturbing neglect and violations at the home, the statement said.\n\nOn April 10, a resident had fallen on the floor by the bed and sustained a head abrasion. The resident was pronounced dead the next day. A physician's report read: \"Found dead this am ... not performed Physical-COVID-19 test was done? ... High fever for the last few days -- that was not brought to my attention. Flu like illness, likely COVID-19.\"\n\nPatients' elevated temperatures and symptoms were not documented, the inspectors found.\n\nIn one case, a resident was found to have a fever of nearly 105 on April 6. Then next day, the patient's temperature was not documented, and the day after that the resident died. \"No documentation of coronavirus monitoring was found regarding the respiratory symptoms which included coughing or shortness of breath assessment\" for this resident,\" according CMS report excerpts in Gottheimer's statement.\n\nDocumentation did indicate the practice of placing patients with COVID-19 symptoms in rooms with residents who did not have symptoms, according to CMS. The inspectors also found \"multiple instances of insufficient PPE usage and protection for staff in the facility.\"\n\n\"I am absolutely disgusted and heartbroken for the residents, staff and families about the conditions this CMS inspection has uncovered from the facility in Andover. The loss of life and the circumstances that so many of the residents faced are a complete tragedy,\" Gottheimer said.\n\nIn mid-April, an anonymous tip led to the discovery of 17 bodies crowded into a four-person morgue at Andover, which is one of New Jersey's largest nursing homes. \"They were just overwhelmed by the amount of people who were expiring,\" Eric C. Danielson, the town's chief of police told The New York Times at the time.\n\nThe center has been hit with two federal fines over the past three years, totaling more than $20,000, and had a rating of \"much below average\" for its health and overall categories before the pandemic, according to a Health Department report obtained by NBC New York. The home has been issued dozens of citations over recent years.\n\nFormer employees who declined to be identified told NBC New York that conditions at the home were bad long before the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\"There would be urine and fecal matter on the floor, in the hallway, in the bedroom, like it was just gross. ... I have seen bedbugs in patient beds and, you know, we have reported this a couple of times and nothing is being done about it. Nothing. They don't care about the patients,\" said one. \"And then with the virus happening ... things just got 10 times worse because there's nobody there to help these residents, because of the staff being so scared of working there.\"\n\nBut Andover would ask staff to come in to work even if they had been symptomatic for the coronavirus, the former employee said.\n\nAnother worker said staffers weren't given the proper personal protective equipment. \"I would wear a mask because I would bring a mask from home. They wouldn't give me a mask,\" the employee said, adding that one person, believed to be a supervisor, said they \"shouldn't have a mask on\" and that the facility didn't have any to give out.\n\nOne of the owners of the home was a top executive at a collapsed chain of troubled nursing homes previously investigated by NBC News. Federal records show that Louis Schwartz, who is listed as a 50-percent owner of the Andover, was a vice president at Skyline Healthcare, a now-defunct nursing home chain that was plagued by allegations of neglect and mismanagement and the subject of more than a dozen lawsuits.\n\nA message left with Andover's administrative office requesting comment was not immediately answered Friday.\n\nWhile nursing homes around the country have been hit hard by coronavirus cases, none have been more slammed than New Jersey's. More than half of the state's COVID-19 deaths have come from long-term care facilities, 513 of which have seen viral outbreaks.\n\nThis week, Gottheimer introduced the Nursing Home Pandemic Protection Act of 2020 to make it federal law for nursing homes to report communicable diseases, infections, and potential outbreaks to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and keep patients' families informed of infections at facilities. The law would also require homes to have crisis plans, and a stockpile of PPE.\n\nThe Andover facility now has 10 days to submit a plan of correction, according to a letter from CMS, which is a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Nidha Azam, a physician's assistant who left family medicine to help victims.Courtesy of Nidha Azam\n\nWhen the coronavirus pandemic began spreading in the United States, Nidha Azam's father had one request: Don't go work at a hospital.\n\nAzam, 31, is a physician assistant on Long Island, New York. She had been working at a family medicine practice, where she provided some care to patients showing COVID-19 symptoms, but when she saw the need for more health care workers in New York City hospitals, she knew she wanted to do more.\n\n\"I was like, 'Dad, all those A's, all those extracurriculars, all that test prep,'\" Azam told NBC Asian America. \"I was like, 'Ultimately, what did you think it was for? It's for this, Dad, so we can put ourselves in a position where we can do some real good in the world.'\"\n\nSo this month, Azam left her job and joined Northwell Health hospitals in New York City.\n\nHer days at Northshore University Hospital start by getting updates from the night team and catching up on the status of the patients in her care. A nurse might deliver the grim news that a patient has worsened or become unresponsive.\n\n\"I best describe it as being thrown into a war zone,\" Azam said.\n\nWhen she's working with COVID-19 patients, she wears an N-95 mask and an eye shield. She dons extra personal protective equipment throughout the day, but she still worries that she might be risking her family's health and her own.\n\n\"In the back of your mind you're always wondering: 'Was I too close? Do I now have COVID?'\" Azam said.\n\nAt the family practice where she used to work, Azam would help refill medications, do routine physical check-ups and manage acute complaints. But when the coronavirus started spreading in New York, more of her patients began complaining about COVID-19-related symptoms. It was hard for her emotionally to hear them say they were having trouble breathing.\n\n\"Because you have so many patients, you think we just kind of become these robots,\" Azam said. \"And on some level, we are, just because we see so many of the same complaints. But something about this has been a very emotional experience, because these are dear, dear patients, and when they're sick, you can't leave that worry in the office.\"\n\nWork doesn't end when Azam's shift is over. Friends and family call her about their own symptoms, and she offers reassurance and recommends where they can find appropriate care. She said that health care workers are always providing to those who need it.\n\n\"You can't just be like, 'No, I don't have time, I don't have time because my kids are being crazy,'\" Azam said. \"And that's not even a thought that comes to my mind. It's like: 'So-and-so needs help. What can I do?'\"\n\nWhen she comes home to her husband and daughters, 2 and 4 years old, she is always concerned about potentially spreading the virus to them.\n\n\"The thought that you might accidentally bring your kids harm is a frightening thought,\" Azam said. \"And it's a paralyzing thought. When my kids had a cough here and there over the last couple weeks, I think I've stayed up and sometimes in tears because I'm like, 'Did I do it?'\"\n\nBut Azam pushes through because she knows the importance of her work and wants to be a good example for her daughters.\n\n\"I do this because I want to be able to tell them that whatever you do in life -- and it doesn't matter what -- make sure it is with purpose, make sure it is with intention,\" Azam said. \"Make sure that it is for something great.\"",

        "body": "Staff in protective gear prepare to test people at a drive-through COVID-19 testing site at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J. on March 24, 2020.Seth Wenig / AP file\n\nFor a few hours on Wednesday, New Jersey residents without coronavirus symptoms thought they could go to a drive-up facility to be tested for the virus.\n\nNew Jersey now has more than two dozen publicly available testing sites, and many others including private labs, for a total of 86 testing sites statewide.\n\nThe state's office of Emergency Medical Services announced Wednesday morning that its two community-based drive-up COVID-19 testing sites were expanding to offer testing for people without symptoms. Previously state guidance was that people without symptoms should not be tested.\n\nBut just hours after the announcement, Gov. Phil Murphy said at an afternoon press conference that the state may have moved too hastily, as the two sites in question are run in coordination with the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the federal government has said those sites should remain for symptomatic people only.\n\nTo expand them to offer tests to anyone with symptoms, New Jersey would need to get a waiver, Murphy explained.\n\n\"It turns out, whether we wanted to or not, we actually need a federal HHS waiver, because FEMA is our partner,\" he said. \"We may have given an impression of that that was innocently not what the facts are.\"\n\nMurphy later added that the state's federal partners have \"a strong edict that asymptomatic folks have to step aside to let symptomatic folks get in and get tested, and we've been sympathetic and supportive of that.\"\n\nThough it won't be doing so at those two sites, New Jersey's goal is to expand testing availability to a wider range of residents.\n\n\"We have to be able to test a broader population, not just symptomatic folks, and it needs to be a rapid return test,\" Murphy said.\n\nFEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the testing site requirements.\n\nThe two sites, which opened in March, have not previously tested asymptomatic patients, though some patients without symptoms have been tested elsewhere in the state.\n\nThe New Jersey Department of Health referred NBC News to the governor's comments.",

        "body": "\"I just feel like the health care system failed her on so many levels,\" her sister said. \"The health care system failed us.\"\n\nA beloved Brooklyn schoolteacher died from complications of COVID-19 after she was initially denied coronavirus tests, her family said.\n\nBushwick Ascend Middle School hailed Rana \"Zoe\" Mungin, 30, as a \"one-of-a-kind educator\" who had a \"transformational impact on her students and colleagues,\" according to a campus statement issued Tuesday.\n\nShe died Monday from the pandemic that has ravaged the world and brutalized New York City.\n\n\"It's just a tough one to swallow right now,\" her sister and housemate, Mia Mungin, a nurse, told NBC News on Wednesday. \"I really thought she was coming back home. She was doing so much better.\"\n\nThe family believed that Mungin had been improving in recent weeks before she took a sudden turn for the worse.\n\n\"It was so crazy. I got to see her on Friday. We FaceTimed, and despite everything, she looked well,\" Mia Mungin said. \"But the next day we FaceTimed her, it was like a different person. She was like a deer in headlights. You could just tell.\n\n\"We FaceTimed on Sunday. That's when I broke down,\" Mia Mungin continued. \"She was tired. You know, it is only so long the body could take a beating.\n\nThe veteran nurse said she's bitter, feeling let down by the industry she has worked in for two decades.\n\n\"I just feel like the health care system failed her on so many levels,\" Mia Mungin said. \"The health care system failed us, something that I stood for for 20 years.\"\n\nZoe Mungin was a 2011 graduate of Wellesley College, where she majored in psychology.\n\n\"Rana touched the lives of so many members of our community during her time here at Wellesley, and beyond,\" school President Paula Johnson said in a statement.\n\n\"As her family has shared, Rana's battle with COVID-19, is a painful example of the disproportionate impact COVID-19 is having on African American and LatinX families across the country. Racial and gender disparities in healthcare are a moral and systemic failure. We can and must do better. \"\n\nZoe Mungin felt her first symptom, a fever, on March 12, Mia Mungin said.\n\nShe first went to Brookdale University Hospital Medical Center in Brooklyn on March 15 and was told that she couldn't have a coronavirus test, according to Mia Mungin.\n\nZoe Mungin's condition worsened, and the family called 911 on March 19. But even after getting to Brookdale that day, she was again denied testing, according to loved ones.\n\n\"She said to me, 'Mia, they still don't want to test for me this virus,'\" Mia Mungin recalled her sister saying. \"'He keeps telling me that my lungs are clear, even though I'm still short of breath.'\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nFollowing the 911 trip to Brookdale on March 19, Zoe Mungin was allowed to go home -- and was then rushed back to the hospital the next day, the family said.\n\n\"They intubated her in the ambulance,\" Mia Mungin said. \"They told us she was intubated and the sickest in the hospital and that we need to be prayerful.\"\n\nA Brookdale spokesman confirmed Wednesday that Zoe Mungin was treated at the facility's intensive care unit before being transferred to other hospitals in Manhattan and New Jersey. The spokesman declined to discuss her treatment.\n\nMia Mungin said she fears she's the one who passed the virus to her sister.\n\n\"She wasn't working, you understand?

        "body": "Quarantine workers spray disinfectants at the popular nightlife neighborhood of Itaewon, following the coronavirus outbreak, in Seoul, South Korea, on MondayYonhap / Reuters\n\nLockdowns have been re-imposed by China and South Korea on Monday after a spike in new infections of the coronavirus is raising concern of a second wave of the pandemic.\n\nAt least 15 cases of the virus have been confirmed in Shulan, China, prompting officials to quarantine 290 people connected to the outbreak, enforce martial law and lock down the northeastern city.\n\nThe city was declared high-risk for the spread of the epidemic on Sunday by the Jilin provincial government. Trains and vehicles, with the exception of emergency rescuers, have been barred from entry to the city.\n\nResidents must stay at home, according to a report in the state newspaper Capital News. Households can elect one person to go out to purchase essential goods like groceries.\n\nHigh school students who were recently allowed to return to the classroom are once again taking their courses online. Public service and entertainment venues such as sports centers and libraries have been temporarily closed. Generally, restaurants are only permitted to provide take-away.\n\nThe first case of the new outbreak was detected on Friday and involved a 45-year-old woman who is a laundry worker for a city's public security bureau, Jilin health authorities said. Eighteen of her close contacts were required to isolate.\n\nWhile contact tracing is underway in Shulan, elsewhere in the country, life is making the slow return to normal.\n\nIn Shanghai, Disneyland began to reopen to the public on Monday with enhanced health and safety measures. The park is limiting the number of people allowed to enter, enforcing social distancing in queues, restaurants, and ride vehicles, and frequently sanitizing and disinfecting facilities, the park operators said in a statement.\n\nNationwide, China reported 17 new cases on Sunday and no deaths. The total number of people infected in the country since the outbreak began in December has reached 82,918 and killed 4,633 people.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea, which eased social distancing requirements last week, saw a spike of cases linked to nightclubs in Seoul. But authorities cautioned that it did not suggest a second wave of the pandemic was beginning.\n\n\"The first wave has not ended and had a break to start another pandemic,\" Jung Eun Kyeong, director-general of South Korea's Center for Disease Control told NBC News during a briefing Monday.\n\nStill, she said the medical community is continuing preparations for a second wave of the virus in the autumn or winter by keeping enough equipment reserved and encouraging social distancing and other preventative measures.\n\nBars and clubs have been temporarily closed in Seoul in response to the new outbreak that has been traced to one confirmed patient who visited a slew of establishments. People who had visited bars in the popular nightclub district Itaewon have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days, regardless of whether they show symptoms, and be tested.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in said it was a reminder that even though the spread of the virus has been controlled, it can re-emerge at any time, especially around enclose, crowded spaces.\n\n\"It's not over until it's over. While keeping enhanced alertness till the end, we must never lower our guard regarding epidemic prevention,\" he said during a press briefing Sunday.\n\nAcross the country, a total of 35 new cases were reported Monday, bringing the cumulative total since the beginning of the outbreak to 10,909. Of those, 9632 have recovered. The death toll has remained steady at 256 since Friday.",

    "New coronavirus test is imperfect step toward mass screening": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The first so-called antigen test is not quite the kind sought by top government health officials.\n\nA new type of coronavirus test offers a cheaper, quicker way to screen for infections, moving the U.S. toward the kind of mass screening that experts say is essential to returning millions of Americans to school and work.\n\nBut the first so-called antigen test -- announced Saturday by the Food and Drug Administration -- is not quite the kind sought by top government health officials. It is less accurate than the current gold standard for testing and can only be run on specialized equipment.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"It is too early to tell,\" said lab researcher Patricia Simner of Johns Hopkins University, assessing the test's impact. \"It certainly has the potential to aid in more widespread testing.\"\n\nSome questions and answers about the new test:\n\nThe new test screens for new infections but in a different way. The test from Quidel Corp. looks for protein traces of the virus -- known as antigens. The same approach is used in rapid tests for flu, strep throat and other infections that are run at the hospital or doctor's office. They represent a trade-off, sacrificing some of the accuracy of more rigorous tests for quicker results at a lower cost.\n\n\"They allow you to dramatically expand testing and they're very cheap,\" said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, in an interview Sunday with CBS. But he acknowledged antigen testing's reduced accuracy: \"They're going to miss some patients who have COVID.\"\n\nPreviously, the only way to diagnose active infections was a test that detects the genetic material of the virus. While highly accurate, most of those tests take hours to develop on machines mainly found at commercial labs, hospitals or universities. Abbott Laboratories makes a 15-minute version of the genetic test that runs on its portable machine, but it only does one sample at a time.\n\nThe U.S. is still struggling to increase testing to the levels that most public health experts say are essential. Harvard researchers have projected that the nation needs to be able to do 900,000 daily tests to be able to track new cases and contain new outbreaks as the country reopens. That's more than three times the country's current daily testing rate of about 275,000.\n\nWhite House adviser Dr. Deborah Birx and other federal officials have said a \"breakthrough\" in antigen testing could open the way to daily testing before going to back to work or school.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is pouring $1.5 billion into efforts to develop highly accurate, easy-to-use tests that could be performed without professional oversight or special equipment. While an important stepping stone, the Quidel test isn't there yet.\n\nThe new test uses a nasal swab like other screening tests, and delivers results in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe sample is put in a tube with testing chemicals and then into a cassette that goes into the company's electronic reading device. There, it's exposed to a testing strip embedded with laboratory-made antibodies, the specific blood proteins made by the body's immune system when it detects an infection. If the antigens and antibodies interact, the test is positive.\n\nThe new test is expected to detect about 80 percent of active COVID-19 infections, according to the FDA. That accuracy rate is similar to other rapid antigen tests for seasonal flu.\n\n\"They are going to pick up fewer people that are infected,\" said Simner of Johns Hopkins. \"So that's where you see a lot of skepticism around using antigen tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nFor now, Simner and other experts say negative test results for people showing symptoms should be confirmed with the more accurate genetic test.\n\n\"But as you might imagine, that's not a perfect scenario because you have to do twice as many tests when the result isn't positive,\" said Dr. Robin Patel of the Mayo Clinic.\n\nMany companies are working on versions that would be more accurate, easier to use and more suitable for mass screenings.\n\nOraSure Technologies has a $700 million federal contract to develop a saliva-based antigen test that wouldn't require specialized equipment or professional supervision. The company has similar tests for other viruses -- including HIV and Ebola -- and those have accuracy rates of over 95 percent. Along with accuracy, the company is focused on speed, aiming to delivers results in 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n\"If you are going to test people coming into work you can't make them line up at 3 a.m.\" OraSure CEO Stephen Tang said. \"You need to be able to get their results quickly.\"",

    "New evidence in race to find France's COVID-19 'patient zero'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "PARIS -- French doctors may have made a new breakthrough in the race to establish where and when the coronavirus pandemic first hit Europe, by establishing the virus may have been in France much earlier than anyone thought.\n\nA team of researchers in the city of Colmar in northeastern France announced in a release last week, that it had identified two X-rays, one from Nov. 16 and one from Nov. 18., showing symptoms consistent with the novel coronavirus. NBC News has exclusively obtained these scans.\n\nIf confirmed, this is evidence that the virus was spreading in Europe two months before France declared its first cases Jan. 24 and well before COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, had been officially identified in China.\n\nThe news comes a week after a separate team of scientists in Paris established that a patient had the coronavirus Dec. 27, so far the earliest known case in Europe.\n\nOfficials in the Chinese city of Wuhan confirmed the existence of a then-unknown illness with pneumonia-like symptoms to the World Health Organization's China office Dec. 31, but it wasn't established as a new coronavirus until Jan. 7.\n\nU.S. spy agencies have gathered intelligence hinting at a public health crisis in Wuhan in November.\n\nScientists believe mapping the spread of the disease in its early stages is key to understanding how to protect people and prevent a second outbreak.\n\n\"We can only manage the future if we understand the past,\" explained Dr. Michel Schmitt of Albert Schweitzer Hospital in Colmar, who led the new research. \"Today, we clearly do not understand this outbreak.\"\n\nUnder Schmitt's leadership, his radiology department has spent the last few weeks poring over thousands of chest X-rays from late 2019.\n\nDr. Vin Gupta, a pulmonologist, global health expert at the University of Washington and NBC News contributor, examined the scans for this article and found them to be \"consistent\" with what he had seen treating COVID-19 patients, noting that the scans appear to show evidence of \"atypical pneumonia.\"\n\n\"This fits a pattern we're seeing with coronavirus -- especially early coronavirus infection where you're seeing some abnormalities in some parts of the lungs but not abnormalities everywhere,\" he said. In many cases patients in that condition \"have been just fine.\"\n\nSchmitt, who cautions against making conclusions from his early results, led his team in examining almost 2,500 chest X-rays taken between Nov. 1, 2019, and April, looking for patterns. As well as the two suspected cases in mid-November, they identified 12 in December and 16 in January. After that, the numbers tick up dramatically.\n\nIf the virus arrived in the fall of 2019, rather than appear in February and explode across the country throughout March as has been assumed, the public health implications are vast.\n\n\"This could completely change the government's management strategy,\" Schmitt added.\n\nAnd while Schmitt's team looked over old scans, Vincent Breton, a research director at the French National Centre for Scientific Research or CNRS, launched a social survey in the same region to improve understanding of the raw medical data.\n\n\"At this point to understand the epidemic, we need feedback from citizens because we know so little about this virus,\" he said, explaining how families are asked to fill out an online questionnaire describing everything from past symptoms to social interactions.\n\nBreton's goal is to cross-reference this data with medical data to pinpoint the path of the virus and identify areas and time periods in which people caught the virus. With that information, he explained, governments can make smarter decisions about what to reopen and when.\n\nBreton cites the city of Mulhouse, the country's first epicenter, as an example of why their work and their coordination are so vital. In mid-February, a religious conference at a church in Mulhouse was widely reported as an accelerant in the region, but Breton says his team's data suggests COVID-19 was already circulating weeks before the event.\n\n\"The testimonies are really rich, they show that people felt that something strange was going on, but they were not in a capacity to raise the alarm,\" he explained.\n\n\"That is something we can learn from this pandemic, we should think of new ways to raise alarm for emerging diseases.\"\n\nIn Colmar, Schmitt said he is just beginning and his team will now look back to scans from October. The more information they have now, the more prepared they'll be for a possible second wave.\n\nDr. Yves Cohen, who led the Paris study, looked back at the records of intensive care unit patients from late last year who had flu-like symptoms but tested negative for pneumonia. He retested 14 patients and one tested positive for COVID-19. He urged all doctors around the world to do the same.\n\n\"To fight an enemy, we have to know the life of the enemy,\" he said, echoing Schmitt. Last week, the World Health Organization agreed, encouraging other countries to revisit old cases.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Nurses hold a demonstration against a new sick leave policy outside of Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, N.Y., on April 17, 2020.Mary Altaffer / AP\n\nA nurse at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles said she was sent home after refusing to wear a surgical mask instead of a protective respirator to treat COVID-19 patients -- and that she was denied a coronavirus test even after she began displaying symptoms.\n\nA nurse at a hospital in Kentucky said she was reprimanded for insubordination and reassigned for refusing to treat COVID-19 patients when the hospital would not supply her with an N95 mask.\n\nA nurse in New Jersey said he was fired after speaking out publicly about the lack of proper protective gear during the pandemic.\n\nAll three nurses said they believe they are being persecuted for simply trying to protect themselves and others, and some experts agree.\n\n\"I think it's important to speak up if you see inadequate conditions for patients or yourself,\" said Arthur Caplan, head of the division of medical ethics at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. \"I think we would expect people to do almost as whistleblowers and get protected -- not punished.\"\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nThe nurses in Los Angeles and Kentucky both said they spoke directly to managers, not publicly on social media, but were reprimanded for raising concerns. Caplan said that was simply \"absurd.\"\n\n\"It's even more ridiculous if you're going up the chain of command,\" he said. \"We expect people in health care to take some risk. And the reason is it's in their codes of ethics. Medicine and nursing say, 'Put the patient first, not your own interest,'\" he said, referring specifically to the American Nurses Association code of ethics. \"That's where it comes from. It's not legal. It's ethical.\n\n\"So if I say, 'I'm not going to work here unless you give me an N95 mask and an adequate gown and gloves, you can't make me go in there,' I think you're right,\" Caplan said. \"You cannot be forced to take very dangerous risks.\"\n\nIn a phone interview with her attorney on the line, the nurse in Kentucky, who requested anonymity out of fear of retribution, said she has asthma and needs the protection of an N95 mask, which provides a higher level of protection than a surgical mask and has been in short supply. At the start of a shift in late March, she said, she was reprimanded for not wanting to go into a COVID-19 patient's room at Norton Women's and Children's Hospital in Louisville without an N95 mask.\n\n\"My reprimand was insubordination for not following policy,\" she said. \"They sent me home on the spot.\"\n\nLess than a week before, she said, N95 masks were in abundance on a supply cart with other personal protective equipment, or PPE, that she and her colleagues wore while treating patients battling COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nBut the hospital's policy now reserves N95 masks for certain procedures in which the virus could be airborne, such as a respiratory treatment.\n\nKate Eller, a spokeswoman for Norton Healthcare, denied that the nurse was subjected to any disciplinary action, saying, \"We found her a position that meets her needs.\"\n\nThe new position she has undertaken does not involve caring for patients, however, which the nurse said has left her feeling hopeless.\n\n\"I don't have a choice. Otherwise I won't have any income,\" she said. Her attorney said his client was told that \"if she doesn't report to this job, they will assume this is a voluntary resignation.\" She has not taken any formal legal action.\n\nNorton Healthcare said it is operating under the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"Since the beginning of this pandemic, we have followed CDC guidelines regarding the use of PPE,\" Eller said.\n\nThe nurse is welcome to return to a clinical position, Eller said, \"as long as she agrees to wear the right mask for the right task per CDC guidelines, which is not always an N95 mask.\"\n\nThe CDC's guidance is a large part of the problem, nurses and experts say.\n\n\"We know that the CDC policy is built on shortage. It's not built on proven evidence,\" said Caplan, who has built a career advising doctors on moral issues. \"Reusing things, it's a policy that is trying to adapt to the reality of shortage. And so, to say you have to follow CDC guidelines isn't enough in a pandemic.\"\n\nCaplan said that Washington and the CDC are partly to blame for inadequate numbers of tests and amounts of equipment and that he can understand why some health care workers \"would be leery of trusting messages about protective gear that come from Washington.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nDr. Ezekiel Emanuel, chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania, said, \"It's not like management has control of all the variables.\"\n\n\"So I think it's important to recognize that, too,\" Emanuel said. \"You know, if you're a good manager, you say to people: 'Look, here's my situation. How are we going to handle this together?'\"\n\nAdam Witt was fired from Jersey Shore University Medical Center after he said it did not have proper protective gear in a public post on his Facebook page. New Jersey has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases, behind New York.\n\n\"The CDC has continued to water down the standards of what is appropriate protection to meet supplies versus supporting the science,\" the post said. \"Sometimes we don't even meet their reduced standards.\"\n\nWitt, president of the local nurses' union, said his problems began when he learned that a nurse at the hospital had been disciplined for raising concerns about coronavirus exposure in a post in a private Facebook group. Witt said he told his manager last month that he would be taking a day off to defend the nurse at a disciplinary hearing, a customary responsibility for a union leader. \"I've used a union day numerous times for exactly this type of scenario without issue in the past,\" Witt told NBC News.\n\nA week later, on March 31, the hospital said he was being suspended because he took an unauthorized day off. Witt was fired after a disciplinary hearing April 6.\n\nThe hospital, where he worked in the emergency department, said he was terminated because he abandoned his shift on March 24, \"not for the 'reasons' now being suggested by him or his surrogates.\"\n\n\"At all times -- but especially during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis -- his first responsibility should have been to the JSUMC patients,\" said Mary Jo Layton, a spokeswoman for Hackensack Meridian Health, which operates the facility. Layton said Witt gave less than 24 hours' notice when he requested off \"for what amounted to a 35-minute telephone conference call.\"\n\n\"Under these circumstances, Adam's refusal to comply with his leaders' instructions and his refusal to report to work disregarded his responsibility to his patients,\" Layton said. \"As a direct result, his fellow nurses and other dedicated health care workers had to shoulder an additional burden in an extremely challenging situation.\"\n\nWitt said he told his managers verbally and via email that he was using a \"union day\" and was never denied. \"They did not respond to my email, nor did they call or text me on the day they alleged I didn't show up,\" he said. The hospital said that Witt was advised that his request was denied because of the surge of pandemic patients in the emergency department and that he was directed to report to work as scheduled.\n\nHe is appealing his firing.\n\nThe nurse at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who asked not to be named for fear of having her nursing license revoked, said that after she raised concerns with her bosses about potential COVID-19 exposure from patients she had treated, she asked whether she should wear an N95 mask in the hospital.\n\nShe said she was instructed not to, \"as it could cause paranoia,\" and was told to keep the supply shortage in mind. She said that in a follow-up conversation with her managers in which she questioned whether doctors were being given priority over nurses in the distribution of protective respirators, she received a similar response as the nurse in Kentucky, who was referred to CDC guidance. When she expressed discontent with having to wear a surgical mask to treat COVID-19 patients, a protocol that has been authorized by the CDC but that has come under scrutiny, she said, she was sent home.\n\nThe nurse also said she was denied a COVID-19 test this month even after she began exhibiting symptoms.\n\nShe said: \"I asked my administrator if I could get a test. And she said: 'What would change? If you got a test, how would your behavior change?' And I said, 'Well, it wouldn't, really.'\" The nurse had already been self-isolating outside work.\n\nShe said her administrator responded: \"'So all it would change is, if you were positive, it would prevent you from coming in to work? At this point, we presume all the nurses are positive.'\"\n\nCedars-Sinai had also sent nurses guidance on extended use and reuse of N95 masks. In an email dated April 15, provided to NBC News by the nurse, Cedars-Sinai acknowledged that while the \"reuse and extended use of PPE is a departure from previous infection control guidance,\" the process is safe if done properly and \"has been endorsed by the CDC\" and other health agencies. The email noted that the safety of health care providers was the \"top priority.\"\n\nBut, as Caplan said, the CDC's policy is not necessarily built on proven evidence.\n\nThe CDC's website notes that \"there is no way of determining the maximum possible number of safe reuses for an N95 respirator as a generic number to be applied in all cases.\" It says safe reuse is \"affected by a number of variables.\"\n\nThe website also acknowledges that risks may be involved with the extended use and reuse of respirator masks.\n\n\"Although extended use and reuse of respirators have the potential benefit of conserving limited supplies of disposable N95 respirators, concerns about these practices have been raised,\" the website says.\n\nSally Stewart, a spokeswoman for Cedars-Sinai, said April 10 it is following current national and state guidelines, which \"call for N95 masks to be used only in aerosol-generating procedures,\" such as CPR and intubation.\n\n\"We offer the same standard of protection for doctors, nurses, respiratory therapists, environmental health personnel, chaplains and other staff who work in patient areas,\" Stewart said.\n\nIn a statement April 17, a spokesman said the hospital currently has an adequate supply of N95 masks to make them available for staff when caring for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. \"To ensure that we maintain supplies amid a potential surge of patients in the weeks ahead, we are collecting N95 masks for reprocessing,\" the spokesman said. \"However, we are not distributing reprocessed masks at this time.\"\n\nThe role of management and of administrators is to protect a very stressed, heroic, sometimes burnt-out workforce, Caplan said.\n\n\"If people want nurses and doctors ... and first responders to be heroic, then you've got to cut them some slack,\" he said.\n\n\"Remember, the CDC guideline is minimal, not the most. Can we pull this boat with the oars going in the same direction, or are we really going to have labor standoffs in the middle of a plague?\"\n\nNurses across the country have already begun organizing protests.\n\nNurses at DMC Sinai-Grace Hospital in Detroit staged an hourslong sit-in at the hospital this month. Salah Hadwan, a registered nurse in the emergency department at Sinai-Grace, posted a Facebook Live video on April 5 shortly before midnight. Hadwan said the nurses were eventually asked to leave. \"We basically were told to leave because we refuse to accept unsafe patient loads,\" Hadwan said in the video.\n\nBrian Taylor, a spokesman for the Detroit Medical Center, acknowledged in a statement that this is \"a very challenging time for caregivers.\"\n\n\"Our doctors and nurses continue to demonstrate their commitment and dedication to our patients,\" he said. \"We are disappointed that one evening earlier this month a very small number of nurses at Sinai Grace Hospital staged a work stoppage in the hospital refusing to care for patients. Despite this, our patients continued to receive the care they needed as other dedicated nurses stepped in to provide care.\"\n\nAnd in California, nurses at Providence St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica held a rally Friday to protest management's putting 10 nurses on paid leave for refusing to treat COVID-19 patients without what they consider proper protective gear.\n\nSince April 9, the hospital has suspended 10 nurses, according to the California Nurses Association, a statewide union that represents them. Hospital management announced last week that it had changed the policy and that health care workers throughout the Providence system will be issued N95 masks to wear when treating confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, the union said. Eight St. John's nurses have tested positive for the coronavirus, including two who worked in the hospital's COVID-19 unit, according to the union. The hospital did not return requests for comment.\n\nCaplan predicted that as more friction arises between the workforce and management, one of the fallouts is likely to be more unionization of doctors and nurses.\n\n\"If you make people feel like they're censored or being pushed around for expressing concern, you are driving them to unionize to protect themselves,\" he said. \"And I don't think that's what management really wants.\"",

    "Official U.S. coronavirus death toll may be missing many thousands": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- As President Donald Trump and his allies suggest the number of fatalities from COVID-19 may be overinflated, epidemiologists are warning the U.S. death toll is actually far higher than official statistics show, almost surely missing many thousands of virus victims.\n\nOn paper, more than 72,000 people have died from the coronavirus, according to an NBC News tally from each state and U.S. territory. But that number is likely an incomplete picture, due to a perfect storm of testing shortages, inconsistent death reporting practices across the country and a high concentration of nursing home deaths.\n\nDr. Matt Heinz, a hospitalist who's been treating COVID-19 patients in Arizona, said he's seen cases, particularly early in the pandemic, in which patients still waiting for coronavirus testing died of unknown respiratory illness that in retrospect looked very much like the coronavirus.\n\n\"Is that COVID? Is that not? In some cases, we can't even go back and test for that, because it's been weeks and weeks,\" he said.\n\nA stroke landed retired musician Charlie Terhune in a rehabilitation facility in Islip, New York, late last year, and weeks later, his family feared he would contract the coronavirus if he stayed there -- a fear that later seemed to prove all too real. Although he'd made great progress recovering from his stroke symptoms, Terhune's breathing deteriorated around the same time that he was discharged.\n\nWhen the paramedics came to his home, they told his wife, Suzanne, that if he went to the hospital for testing, he'd likely never come home. A retired nurse, Suzanne knew she could care for him with the right equipment at home, so he was never tested before he died April 5.\n\n\"I spoke with the doctor every day from the time he came home until the time that he died, and there was no question in her mind\" that he had coronavirus, Suzanne said. \"The hospice nurses who came in, no question. The ambulance, no question. That's what he had.\"\n\nYet, the death certificate listed \"acute respiratory failure\" as Terhune's cause of death. And so as America counts its dead, he became one of an unknown number of likely coronavirus fatalities to go uncounted.\n\nResearchers at the Yale School of Public Health found that in hard-hit areas of the country, the death toll may be off by 50 percent or more.\n\n\"Those numbers are only as good as the death certificates that they're based on. And that depends upon the people who are filling them out,\" said Dr. James Gill, Connecticut's chief medical examiner, and vice president of the National Association of Medical Examiners.\n\nLast month, he reviewed a death certificate for a woman who'd had a fever and shortness of breath but was never tested for the coronavirus. The cause of death was respiratory failure, but the state sent an investigator to the nursing home to take a sample post-mortem -- and it was positive for the coronavirus. The certificate was changed.\n\n\"Without us doing that further investigation, that death would have been missed,\" Gill said.\n\nTo get a more accurate picture, epidemiologists use a concept called \"excess deaths.\" They start with the total number of reported deaths, then subtract the number of deaths that are normally expected for that period, based on the past several years. The gap between the two is known as \"excess deaths\" -- and may be a clue as to what's really happening.\n\n\"There's not been a hurricane, there's not been a nuclear bomb or anything else. Then these excess deaths, in the setting of low testing rates, are a very good way for us to estimate the impact of this coronavirus,\" said Dr. Camara Phyllis Jones, a Harvard University fellow and a past president of the American Public Health Association.\n\nData from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show there were thousands more deaths in March and April than normal for those months -- even when known coronavirus deaths are factored in.\n\nIn New Jersey, there were about 5,200 excess deaths in the month ending April 11, according to a New York Times analysis, but less than 2,200 reported coronavirus deaths, leaving an unexplained gap of 3,000.\n\nNot all of those excess deaths are necessarily from the coronavirus itself. Some could be other consequences of the new normal, such heart attacks or other diseases going untreated because people don't want to risk going to the hospital in the middle of the pandemic. Higher rates of suicide and domestic violence could also explain some of the deaths.\n\nIn Washington, the numbers have also become highly politicized -- and a grim yardstick against which Trump may be measured as he runs for re-election.\n\nIn February, before the U.S. had any known coronavirus deaths, Trump predicted the number of cases would drop to zero. His later estimates of how many would die have changed repeatedly as the public health models have shifted up, down and back up again.\n\nTrump has defended the comparatively high mortality rate by arguing that other countries are missing deaths that the U.S. is capturing because of what he describes as better reporting. He raised doubt when New York state announced that another 3,700 residents who died without being tested were now presumed to have died from the coronavirus.\n\n\"I see, this morning, where New York added 3,000 deaths because they died,\" Trump said in mid-April. \"And they're now saying, rather than, 'It was a heart attack,' they're saying, 'It was a heart attack caused by this.' So they're adding.\"\n\nOnly 1 in 3 Americans trust the death toll is accurate, an Axios-Ipsos poll this week found. Not surprisingly, the split was partisan: Republicans were more likely to believe the death toll is overinflated, while Democrats are more likely to believe it's underinflated.\n\nOne reason the U.S. may be undercounting its coronavirus dead is the high level of deaths occurring in nursing homes, where the outbreak has run rampant. In nursing homes and adult care facilities, residents are often cremated with no autopsy or death investigation.\n\nIn some parts of the U.S., only people who test positive for the coronavirus before they die get counted in the official tally. The CDC says medical examiners and coroners should use their \"professional judgment\" about whether to test post-mortem.\n\nAnother factor is the hodgepodge of systems used for death investigations across more than 2,000 jurisdictions in the U.S. Some areas have medical examiners, while others have coroners or justices of the peace. Some report electronically, others like Connecticut still have paper systems. It can take weeks for deaths to get counted.\n\nIt's been four weeks since Terhune died with all the signs and symptoms of the coronavirus, but no place on the official tally of its victims. His wife said that while the official designation wouldn't have had any effect on his outcome, it does matter for society at large.\n\n\"People who go by the number of deaths that's broadcast, I know that it's far more,\" Suzanne said. \"It has to be far more.\"",

    "One doctor vs. the DEA: Inside the battle to study marijuana in America": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Since 1968, the Drug Enforcement Administration has required scientists who want to study cannabis's effects to use marijuana from a 12-acre farm at the University of Mississippi.Chelsea Stahl / NBC News; Redux; Getty Images\n\nEarly in Dr. Sue Sisley's medical career, military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder told her that smoking marijuana prevented nightmares and helped them sleep. Sisley, a primary care physician and psychiatrist in Scottsdale, Arizona, who has treated vets for two decades, said she was initially skeptical of her patients' claims, but their families vouched that pot was helping with their symptoms.\n\n\"Even though I was dubious, they never really gave up,\" Sisley said of the patients. \"They were so relentless.\"\n\nAbout a decade ago, Sisley decided to study pot's psychiatric effects to see if she could prove what her patients were experiencing. But, because of marijuana's federal status as an illegal drug, this turned out to be far from a simple task.\n\nSince then, Sisley has been fired from her job at the University of Arizona; lost a study partner at another university; and had the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs block her attempts to recruit patients for research. By 2016, her scientific study was underway through the Scottsdale Research Institute, and she finally had federally approved cannabis in hand to provide to 76 military vets.\n\nBut she was not happy with the weed she received.\n\nThe marijuana was a \"powdery mishmash of stems, sticks and leaves,\" Sisley said. The level of tetrahydrocannabinol -- or THC, the chemical that gets people high -- was around 8 percent, far lower than the smokable products at pot dispensaries that often surpass 20 percent. The research weed also tested positive for yeast and mold, she said.\n\n\"I'm astonished by that,\" Sisley said. \"As a physician, how do I hand out moldy weed to study subjects?\"\n\nSisley couldn't shop around, though, because since 1968, the Drug Enforcement Administration has required scientists who want to study cannabis's effects to use only marijuana from a 12-acre farm at the University of Mississippi. While the director of the farm disputes Sisley's characterization of the cannabis supplied, Sisley and other scientists argue that government rules forcing them to use only the Mississippi weed have stifled research because it doesn't match what people are actually using.\n\n\"We haven't done any research on the stuff that people are buying and consuming today -- that's the problem,\" said Cindy Kiel, executive associate vice chancellor for research administration at the University of California, Davis.\n\nThe DEA promised a few years ago it would let more people grow marijuana for research purposes, but it wasn't until late last month -- as the country hunkered down under stay-at-home orders to combat the coronavirus pandemic -- that the agency unveiled a plan for how it would do that. Under the DEA's newly proposed rules, the agency would allow more scientists and companies to grow marijuana for research, but they would have to turn it over to the DEA, which would then dole it out to scientists.\n\nSisley saw this as another way to slow-walk marijuana research. So she sued the government, demanding it reveal its legal justification. On Wednesday, the Department of Justice unveiled a secret 2018 memo that blocked the DEA from approving additional cultivators like Sisley, in the absence of stricter rules. The memo also raised questions about the existing arrangement with the University of Mississippi, and whether it must change to comply with an international treaty.\n\nSisley never envisioned that her attempt to study marijuana's potential benefits would become a decade-long quest involving fights with universities and the federal government, and attempts to uncover a confidential legal document. Yet this is the complicated maze scientists studying cannabis have been navigating for years.\n\nNow, Sisley and others hope the DEA will finally expand the kind of marijuana available for research -- even if the government adds onerous requirements for those who want to grow it -- which could ultimately determine its benefits and potential harms, and whether it will ever be legalized federally.\n\n\"We're trying to make sure the public is aware of what we believe is an injustice, a suppression of scientific freedom,\" Sisley said, \"and to understand the myriad ways that the government has ensured that cannabis drug development research will never proceed.\"\n\nLegal pot is already a bigger industry than organic produce in the United States, and the demand for products with cannabidiol -- a nonpsychoactive component often referred to as CBD that has therapeutic properties -- is projected to top $23 billion within three years. A majority of the country now has medical marijuana programs on the books, and 11 states have legalized weed for adult recreational use.\n\nHowever, the DEA still classifies marijuana as a Schedule I drug -- a restrictive category reserved for substances believed to have no medical value and be susceptible to abuse. The DEA has repeatedly said it won't support reclassifying marijuana because there aren't well-controlled studies or scientific evidence approved by the Food and Drug Administration to show medical benefits. Yet scientists say that if evidence of those benefits is ever going to exist, they need to put real-world weed -- not what's made available from the University of Mississippi -- through these studies.\n\nThis sets up a paradox, in which practically no one can show through an FDA-approved clinical trial that the cannabis products on the market are safe or beneficial because researchers can't legally study them.\n\n\"Effectively 200 million Americans can access cannabis right now, but a doctor or scientist can't,\" said George Hodgin, founder of the Biopharmaceutical Research Company, a marijuana analytical firm. \"It is at best irresponsible, and, at worst, it's dangerous.\"\n\nCannabis research is so tightly controlled that the DEA denied a request by UC Davis faculty two years ago to buy CBD products for pets from a nearby dispensary to study their effects on animals, said Kiel, the research administrator at the university. The DEA shot down the study because the scientists weren't going to use cannabis grown by the University of Mississippi operation, Kiel said.\n\nIn 2016, following requests from scientists, the DEA announced that it would allow more facilities to cultivate cannabis for research. Sisley, Hodgin and UC Davis were among at least 33 applicants that lined up for a license, hopeful that this was the beginning of a renaissance in marijuana research.\n\nThen Jeff Sessions became attorney general.\n\nA former senior DEA official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share internal agency deliberations, told NBC News that Sessions was \"adamantly opposed\" to expanding the options to study marijuana, and in 2017 he halted the government's plans to allow more growers. When members of Congress later pressed Sessions on the pending applications, he suggested that allowing more than one producer could put the country at risk of violating the U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, a 1961 international treaty.\n\nFrustrated, Sisley said she essentially went on \"a nationwide tour to speak to every Bob's Burger Barn or American Legion post, anyone who would have me,\" to talk about the government's stonewalling of cannabis research. That's how she met Texas-based attorneys Matt Zorn and Shane Pennington, who took on Sisley's case pro bono last year.\n\nTogether, they sued the DEA for not processing Sisley's application, and in July 2019, a court ordered the agency to explain itself. Just before a court deadline last August, the DEA said it planned to issue new regulations for how it would permit additional growers.\n\nThe new rules proposed by the DEA last month were the result of an opinion written by lawyers in the DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel in June 2018, while Sessions was still attorney general. The opinion concluded that the Single Convention treaty required the DEA to \"monopolize\" the exchange of all legal marijuana for research. The existing set-up -- letting the University of Mississippi grow and ship marijuana -- didn't satisfy the Single Convention treaty, the memo concluded, and the DEA needed a new framework in which the agency takes control of the cannabis before distributing it to scientists.\n\nThat opinion was kept secret until Sisley and her legal team filed a lawsuit in March against the department, which settled this week with the release of the document.\n\nPennington said the memo reveals that the limitations under the treaty were not based on who is growing the marijuana. \"It's about who's possessing it, purchasing it, and doing wholesale trade in it, so it's been a myth that we've had to have this University of Mississippi weed this whole time,\" he said.\n\nA spokesman for the DEA defended the agency's handling of marijuana for research.\n\n\"DEA must operate within the bounds of law, regulations, and international treaties,\" the spokesman said in an email. \"DEA must ensure the Schedule I substance is procured from a lawful source, and therefore requires the researcher identify the controlled substance, source, and amount involved. Because many state dispensaries comport only with state law and not federal law, a Schedule I substance from a state dispensary cannot be used for research.\"\n\nThe proposed regulations, the spokesman added, \"could permit a greater range of product available for scientific research.\"\n\nThe grow operation on the University of Mississippi's Oxford campus has heavy security, with dozens of cameras, guards on duty, motion-activated sensors and multiple security gates equipped with vibration detectors. It's a far cry from 40 years ago, when undergraduates once tried to cast fishing rods over a fence to snag a marijuana plant. The farm is set up through a contract with the National Institute on Drug Abuse, which decides what kind of marijuana should be grown and is involved in the lengthy approval process for researchers who want to study it.\n\nMahmoud ElSohly, the longtime director of the Marijuana Project at Ole Miss, bristles at the criticisms of his products, including that it has tested positive for mold and has lower THC levels than advertised. He says these complaints are untrue and part of \"propaganda to push an agenda that's mainly going toward legalization.\"\n\n\"I welcome the opportunity for other growers to get involved,\" ElSohly said, \"so people can't complain about that anymore.\" He notes that studies showing benefits of cannabis \"are coming from the material we produce. So it's not that bad after all.\"\n\nElSohly, a professor who also researches cannabis, said that on top of ensuring their material is clear of salmonella and E. coli, the project now tests for yeast and mold.\n\nThe National Institute on Drug Abuse said all marijuana provided to scientists for studies is safe, and there's never been \"any known health consequences from contaminants.\"\n\nA typical growing season at the University of Mississippi yields over 1,100 pounds of plant material, which is dried and prepared to researchers' requests, like being rolled into joints. ElSohly acknowledged that he can't match the many marijuana products on the market, but he said he offers a range of potency levels, which is what he believes should matter most to scientists.\n\n\"If we match one, what about all the others?\" he said. \"Are we supposed to match all of the growers that a dispensary has? It makes no sense.\"\n\nBut Staci Gruber, director of the Marijuana Investigations for Neuroscientific Discovery program at McLean Hospital in Massachusetts, said the menu from the Ole Miss farm -- which is largely confined to smokeable flower and THC extract -- excludes high-potency products like edibles, shatter or wax.\n\n\"It's not as if we can get gummies with a standardized amount,\" Gruber said. \"That's inherently limited.\"\n\nSisley said this is the result of having only one supplier of marijuana for research.\n\n\"I'm a lifelong Republican, and as a conservative I think monopolies are inherently problematic because they promote apathy,\" Sisley said. \"The University of Mississippi has enjoyed a government-enforced monopoly for over 50 years. They've had no competition, no need, no drive to be responsive to the public, to scientists' needs.\"\n\nElSohly scoffed at the idea of a monopoly, noting that the University of Mississippi submits a bid for the government contract every few years, and \"anyone who has the capabilities the infrastructure\" is welcome to compete.\n\nIt's difficult to find someone who publicly opposes expanding marijuana research. Members of Congress who oppose legalizing pot have called for more research. Major scientific groups want it. Even the National Institute on Drug Abuse would like to have more competition, because only having one grow operation at Ole Miss \"slows the development of cannabis-based medications,\" the agency's director, Nora Volkow, testified to Congress this year.\n\nDr. Kevin Sabet, former drug policy adviser in the Obama administration, said more research is needed so that lawmakers can understand the effects of high-potency marijuana.\n\n\"For the vast majority of products, we don't have the long-term research to establish their safety at all,\" said Sabet, president of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a nonprofit opposed to legalizing recreational pot.\n\nUnder the current restrictions, scientists have had to get creative to study weed.\n\nWashington State University researchers are conducting a study in which they ask participants to buy cannabis at a legal dispensary, go home and smoke it, and then take an Uber or Lyft to the lab to give a blood sample. Michael McDonell, a psychology professor at the university, acknowledges that the system isn't perfect, but it circumvents prohibitions on university staff possessing marijuana.\n\n\"I'd like to be able to go buy one strain of cannabis, send it to a lab to know what's in it, know what's exactly the dose that's in it, and then study that,\" McDonell said.\n\nScientists are cautiously optimistic about the direction things are heading for marijuana research. Attorney General William Barr has promised to expand the number of marijuana growers approved by the DEA.\n\nBut while the public comment period on the proposed regulations ends on May 22, there's no deadline after that for next steps by the DEA. And some are concerned the expansion of growers isn't enough. Kiel, of UC Davis, said the DEA hasn't clarified whether newly approved growers will have to use marijuana seeds from the only approved source -- the University of Mississippi farm.\n\n\"Which isn't going to solve the research problem,\" Kiel said. \"It just won't.\"\n\nSisley's study with Arizona veterans wrapped up last year, and she expects it will be published in the coming weeks. She said it took her awhile to shake her medical school training that marijuana is dangerous and addictive, but she's come to believe it \"is so much more benign than the prescriptions I write for patients every day.\"\n\n\"People recognize this plant has significant medical properties,\" Sisley said. \"We just don't know how to harness them specifically to treat various illnesses. That's why people are still skeptical. We still don't know what varieties to use to treat different illnesses because the research has been systemically impeded by our federal government.\"",

    "Opinion | America deserves coronavirus accountability  --  including from Fauci and Birx": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, talks to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a briefing on April 22, 2020.Alex Brandon / AP\n\nA popular narrative about the COVID-19 pandemic is that President Donald Trump cares little about science and data and that his top public health officials must regularly and valiantly try to restrain him from making foolish decisions or unsound assertions. The narrative gained momentum last week when video of Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, went viral showing her reaction to Trump's comments about light and disinfectant.\n\nWidespread acceptance of this narrative has contributed to fawning media attention for Trump's chief medical advisers, such as Birx, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and (to a lesser extent) Surgeon General Jerome Adams.\n\nIn Florida, for example, 62 percent of voters say they rely on public health officials the most for accurate information about the coronavirus. By contrast, only 18 percent say the same for Trump.\n\nCertainly, the president should be held accountable for his policies and actions during the gravest public health and economic crisis the country has faced in decades, but public health professionals should not be immune from tough -- but informed -- questioning, either. The high level of trust placed in them by the American public should be matched by serious scrutiny.\n\nAlas, Trump's public health advisers are too often viewed as infallible. The change in guidelines on mask-wearing in early April is a great example. With notable exceptions in conservative media, the original guidelines and the subsequent pivot were largely accepted without much second thought or criticism. Yet much is troubling about the instructions issued by the U.S. government on a consequential public health issue.\n\nIt was Feb. 25 when a senior official from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first loudly rang the alarm about the coronavirus' reaching U.S. shores. But Adams hectored the American people against buying masks.\n\nAdams tweeted: \"Seriously, people- STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus.\"\n\nFauci did not hector, but he conveyed the same message. In interview after interview, Fauci emphasized that only those who were already infected needed to wear masks to avoid exposing others. For ordinary Americans, he said in mid-February, \"there is absolutely no reason whatsoever to wear a mask.\"\n\nCDC guidelines reflected those sentiments.\n\nAnd yet, experience overseas showed those recommendations to be misleading.\n\nIn an interview March 24 with Asian Boss, an Asia-based online media channel, the most prominent coronavirus expert in South Korea, a country hailed for its effective response to the outbreak, disagreed with the surgeon general and said wearing a mask was \"definitely effective.\"\n\nKim Woo-joo, a professor of infectious diseases at Korea University College of Medicine, said mask-wearing by nearly everyone in South Korea was one of the reasons the country has had a relatively low rate of infection.\n\n\"Why else would doctors in hospitals wear masks?\" Kim asked rhetorically. \"They wear them because they prevent infection.\"\n\nSimilarly, the Czech Republic, which had a significantly lower rate of infection compared to fellow European countries such as Spain and Italy, produced a video advising all other countries to \"implement population-wide use of face masks, even homemade ones.\" Adam Vojt\u011bch, the Czech health minister, stated, \"Today we see this was one of the most important decisions we have made, and if it helped here, it can help anywhere.\"\n\nWhy were top U.S. public health officials telling Americans otherwise?\n\n\"I did read [the surgeon general's] tweet and you have to understand the context,\" Kim told Asian Boss. \"I think the point was to prevent people from hoarding masks because medical professionals need them more. ... In other words, because masks are in short supply in the U.S., medical professionals should be prioritized.\"\n\nAmerica's lack of protective equipment is indeed a crisis. But that was not what the public health officials were telling Americans, not really. You had to read between the lines to get to that conclusion. Much more directly, these officials insisted that mask-wearing was not effective for healthy people.\n\nAs the pandemic raged on, this advice increasingly made less and less sense.\n\nThe White House's Birx was reported to have opposed recommending public mask-wearing for fear that it would create a false sense of confidence to dispense with social distancing. Almost all experts agree that social distancing is vital to flattening the curve. Yet Americans could simply have been advised that mask-wearing would be a complement to, not a replacement for, social distancing.\n\nKeep in mind that the White House, at the advice of its public health experts, first instructed Americans to practice social distancing on March 16. In other words, Americans were not practicing social distancing and were also being discouraged from wearing masks during those weeks before. Would mask-wearing have slowed the spread of the coronavirus, especially in densely populated areas like New York City? The national media have not really asked.\n\nTo be fair, the United States' waffling is not unique. Singapore, widely lauded for its early success at responding to the coronavirus, had originally favored social distancing and instructed its residents against mask-wearing, as well. It was not until April 14 that it made mask-wearing compulsory.\n\nOn April 3, the CDC finally reversed itself and recommended that Americans wear face coverings in public, claiming that new data had revealed many carriers of COVID-19 to be asymptomatic. Fauci estimated that as many as 50 percent of carriers of COVID-19 could be asymptomatic, even though in late January, he himself dismissed concerns that such \"silent carriers\" could drive transmission in an epidemic.\n\nBut here also, U.S. experts were contradicting experts elsewhere in the world. Gabriel Leung, the chair of public health medicine at the University of Hong Kong and a highly respected expert in the city, explained to a Cantonese cable news channel in late March that invisible carriers of COVID-19 were very dangerous transmitters. Indeed, according to Leung, silent carriers could be up to 20 percent or even 30 percent of infected people.\n\nMedical professionals in the U.S. knew about such silent carriers early on, as well. This month, The New York Times published frantic warnings made early this year by a group of public health officials and experts who nicknamed their email exchanges \"Red Dawn.\" The Times blamed Trump for not having heeded this advice earlier.\n\nThe \"Red Dawn\" group had come to the realization by the third week of February that many people in the U.S. were likely to have been infected already, even if they were not showing any symptoms.\n\nSo why did the top health experts advising Trump dismiss the dangers posed by such silent carriers until early April? For the most part, the media have not bothered to inquire. In a rare instance when a reporter tried to seek accountability at a White House coronavirus briefing last week, the surgeon general responded that he resented the implication.\n\nThat is not an attitude that inspires confidence. The point of asking pointed questions is not to malign public health officials or to undermine their influence. Science must guide health policy, just as science must inform economic policies made during a public health crisis. But even scientists make mistakes, and figuring out how and why can help us better understand this pandemic and our response to it. Just as important, it can help us avoid similar mistakes when a new wave of the coronavirus -- or any other epidemic -- inevitably occurs.",

    "Opinion | Researchers worry tobacco and marijuana smokers and vapers are face a greater risk for COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Caleb Banner, a former Queen's Palace vape shop employee, exhales a cloud of vape outside the store in Helena, Mont. on Oct. 17, 2019.Thom Bridge / Independent Record via AP file\n\nIn early March, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio told journalists that a 22-year-old Brooklyn man had been hospitalized with a COVID-19 diagnosis. The man didn't appear to have any pre-existing conditions; all doctors knew was that he had vaped. \"We do think the fact that he is a vaper is affecting this situation,\" de Blasio announced to the gathered press. It was a worrisome sign for young smokers.\n\nNow, almost two months later, researchers are still only beginning to investigate the link between vaping and serious complications from COVID-19. According to Dr. Nora Volkow, head of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), there appears to be an association, and increasing evidence, of the dangers. Volkow strongly advises people who are vaping to stop. Back in March, the American Lung Association's chief medical officer, Dr. Albert Rizzo, and the American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation also issued warnings.\n\nIt's not just a domestic suggestion. The World Health Organization also recently released information from China, where the coronavirus originated, showing that people who have cardiovascular and respiratory conditions caused by smoking or water pipes are at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. In April, NIDA announced that SARS-Cov-2 -- the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 -- could be an especially serious threat to those who smoke tobacco or marijuana, or vape, regardless of age.\n\nSince COVID-19 is a new disease, we may not know for some time the direct impact and how many of those who suffered from the virus were also smokers or vapers. The research is in its infancy, but we can't afford to wait for long-term studies. Health professionals must be proactive in educating the public and our youth about the potential dangers and the probable link between vaping, smoking and the increased risk of serious illness or death from the virus.\n\nThis is particularly frightening considering the prevalence of smoking and vaping among American youth. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, each day, over 300 people younger than 18 years become daily cigarette smokers. When it comes to vaping, last year alone we saw a 78 percent increase in the number of high school kids vaping. According to preliminary data from the National Youth Tobacco Survey, 27.5 percent of youth are now using e-cigarettes.\n\nHere's what we do know: COVID-19 causes significant inflammation of the lung tissue, and the pre-existing lung inflammation and damage caused by smoking or vaping can compound the effects of the virus, putting individuals at risk for serious complications and death.\n\nIt's already well known that smoking and vaping can lead to irreversible lung damage. According to the CDC, if smoking continues at the current rate among U.S. youth today, 5.6 million Americans younger than 18 are expected to die prematurely from a smoking-related illness -- and that's not taking into account the new concerns around potential complications from COVID-19.\n\nIn the second half of 2019, and into early 2020, more than 2,800 reported cases of severe lung injury related to vaping were recorded across all 50 states. Of that group, some 52 percent of all patients suffering these ill effects are under the age of 25 -- a direct correlation to the surge in e-cigarette use among teens and young adults.\n\nWe also know that those who vape are filling their lungs with a toxic soup of chemicals. Nicotine, of course. But also: isoprene, a main component of rubber; propylene glycol, used in antifreeze and to de-ice airplanes; formaldehyde, a known carcinogen used to preserve dead bodies; N-nitrosonornicotine, another Group 1 carcinogen; toluene, a solvent used in paint, nail polish and to tan leather; along with nickel, lead, cadmium and many other trace chemicals. Each of these chemicals can wreak havoc on the lungs, causing a host of pulmonary issues that can exacerbate the effects of COVID-19. There are also illnesses that can develop from the use of vapes/e-cigarettes that increase vulnerability to the virus:\n\nWhile health officials have been warning seniors and those with underlying medical conditions about their risks with the coronavirus, we are doing our young people a disservice if we don't sound the alarm for them as well. We don't yet know the exact level of susceptibility people who vape have to COVID-19, but it's been reported that current smokers face increased risk of disease progression. An early study out of China that looked at the differences between COVID-19 patients who were smokers and nonsmokers, found a higher percentage of smokers had severe COVID-19 illnesses compared to nonsevere symptoms. Another more recent study even found that of those who died of COVID-19, 9 percent were current smokers, compared with 4 percent of those that survived.\n\nWe must do everything we can to educate this group about the dangers of smoking and vaping. We can't assume that they know the risks of smoking and vaping and the effects that could arise as the number of COVID-19 cases increase. And now, as states begin to lift stay at home orders and reopen for business, this is particularly worrisome as people may not be as concerned about catching the virus.\n\nAs a nation we are in uncharted territory with COVID-19. We should not wait for the science to catch up. It could take months or years before we have all the answers to how much COVID-19 is exacerbated by smoking and vaping. If we act now, we may be able to save lives, prevent unnecessary hospitalizations and reduce the risk of overburdening our health care system at a time when we must all do our part to end this pandemic.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Mariana Atencio's mother was among the last people to leave Venezuela before the pandemic caused the government to shut down the airports.Courtesy Mariana Atencio\n\nGlobal pandemic. Those two words set my whole family in a frenzy. As the world's borders shut down, my biggest fear wasn't for my own health: it was for the life of my 66-year-old mami, living alone in Venezuela, our home country of 26 million people, where unofficial estimates indicate the number of intensive care beds is less than 100.\n\nAnd while being worried for the health of an elderly relative is perhaps one of the most common feelings at the moment, the trauma of losing my papi to the seasonal flu in Venezuela just two years ago intensified that worry into a panic.\n\nWhen he got ill there in 2018, there were power outages in some of the country's intensive care units, doctors were telling me how to get basic medicines on the black market and many hospitals just didn't have gloves, masks or even running water. We lost my dad in just 3 weeks -- and all of that was before the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"I won't let this happen again,\" I said to myself this March. My siblings and I had to get Mami out of Venezuela.\n\nThe country has been on the brink for a while.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund estimated that Venezuela's inflation rate would hit 10 million percent by the end of last year. Since the drop in oil prices -- the country's main source of revenue -- began in February of this year, the crisis has spun out of control, its effects getting worse by the day. Lines for gas are now so long that some doctors have to ride their bikes to get to the emergency room. In a video circulating on twitter, a doctor pleaded with the military to help them get gas. \"We've been in line for up to two days,\" he says. \"We're the soldiers now.\"\n\nLittle is known about the actual spread of the coronavirus in Venezuela; the government claims there are only 357 cases nationwide as of May 5, though the United Nations describes it as one of the countries most vulnerable to the disease due to the lack of sanitation and its collapsed health care system. Critics question those figures -- especially since, according to the opposition leader and National Assembly President Juan Guaid\u00f3, the country only performs 100 COVID-19 tests per day. (Neighboring Colombia is doing 17,000 tests a day.)\n\nWhat's worse, the ongoing humanitarian crisis is compounded by a shamelessly corrupt new revolutionary elite that didn't think the virus had anything to do with them.\n\nIn an Instagram post from March 21, Jesus Amoroso -- the son of dictator Nicolas Maduro's top anti-corruption official -- posed in front of a luxury SUV while giving the finger. The caption read: \"If I have it... If I don't... suck it, gossipers.\" He then posted a video rapping: \"I'm enjoying it 'cause I can.\" In 2017, his father Elvis Amoroso was sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury for alleged corruption and undermining democracy.\n\nAmoroso Jr.'s post was a response to news reports which revealed he hosted an island party on the white sand beaches of Los Roques, an archipelago off the coast of Venezuela (where George H.W. Bush once famously fished) on the same week when I was trying to get my mom out. By then, news of the pandemic and what it could do to the country's depleted health system were widely known. People watched online as the offspring of Venezuela's rulers cheered bikini-clad women -- with cigarettes, luxury handbags and cellphones in hand -- twerking on the beach to house music.\n\nThere were drugs, specifically psychedelic 2C-B drugs or pink cocaine, known as \"tusi\" (which is also a local nickname for high level Venezuelan models and prostitutes, some flown in from Europe, then a pandemic hot spot, for the festivities). Famous reggaeton artists Zion, Justin Quiles, Noriel, Nakary and Kevvo were also seen on the tiny island with Amoroso (although Zion later said they were only there to shoot a music video). The virus, of course, was there, too.\n\nMaduro recently admitted that around 20 cases of COVID-19 emerged after the island party, and that the revelers even infected some of the local population of 1,500, who are dependent on tourism. There's only one outpatient clinic in Los Roques that can hold a maximum of 20 people; contagion there would be catastrophic. He said the government was forced to bring those sickened by the virus to the mainland.\n\nIt wouldn't be the last party. The island posse then flew to Caracas and continued the spree. Videos showed an international DJ, \"Cuky\" (who is originally from Morocco), in front of a mixing board on a balcony with the backdrop of the Avila mountains. Apparently, 18 people were arrested, including the DJ, who has since closed her Instagram account.\n\nAnd yet it didn't end there. Nine people were arrested April 23 in Caracas, after a third so-called #CoronavirusParty hosted by yet other figures of the new bourgeoisie. Beauty queens from the Miss Venezuela and Miss Earth Venezuela pageants were among the invitees of the latest event. (The organizations behind both put out press releases barring them from competition and taking their crowns, respectively.)\n\nTo Venezuelans, none of this is surprising. For years, Maduro and his inner circle have amassed enormous wealth while Venezuela just became one of five countries most at risk from famine, according to the latest report from the World Food Programme.\n\nIronically, the country's geographical isolation may have actually curbed the spread of the virus, since such few flights were already coming in and out of the country to begin with. But, when, not if, it does spread, it'll be due to the negligence and corruption of those in the highest echelons of power.\n\nThe U.S. government charged Maduro and some of his senior government officials on March 26 with drug trafficking and conspiring with terrorists. But if President Donald Trump will make a wider move on Venezuela remains to be seen.\n\nWith a refugee crisis, a crumbled health system, ongoing power outages and a hunger-stricken population, Venezuela had become a failed narcostate that could destabilize the whole region ... and then along came the coronavirus.\n\nMy family and I became determined to get my mother out of there and to safety.\n\nAfter dozens of frantic phone calls, a friend was able to secure a spot for Mami on a chartered flight to Grenada, a small island-nation in the Caribbean, on Mar. 17. From there she'd be able to fly to Miami, where my sister and I live.\n\nMidflight, however, the Maduro government issued a nationwide shutdown of the entire airspace, including private aircrafts. We breathed sighs of relief upon learning that her plane was already flying over international waters -- but it meant the pilot couldn't go back home.\n\nShe was probably among the last people to leave Venezuela during the pandemic. When she finally made it to the United States, we worried she could have gotten infected on the flight over -- and surprised by the fact that no health inspection was conducted upon her entry (or anyone else's in that last commercial flight) into the U.S. Thankfully, she didn't have any symptoms.\n\nAs I finally spotted her outside the airport terminal, I felt the tears rolling down my cheeks. It was a bittersweet reunion, though. We still don't know what will become of our cousins, our aunts and uncles, our childhood amigos or millions of other people who lack the most basic sanitation and medical care. We got Mami out, but everyone else is still suffering in a ticking time bomb scenario managed by a few corrupt individuals who can't go one weekend without a party.\n\nMy dad already died from one virus. We still have time to save people from this one. The #CoronavirusParty of insolence and corruption must stop. Now.",

        "body": "NBC's Dasha Burns shares what it's like having coronavirus under 30\n\nThe question on everyone's mind right now is when can we go back to life as usual? Quarantine is dragging on and people, especially young people, are getting restless. But we are asking the wrong question. It was this same defiance that contributed to the spread of the coronavirus in the first place.\n\nI was one of likely hundreds of thousands of Americans who suffered a \"mild\" case of COVID-19, and recovered. And it was not like any flu or cold I had ever experienced. All of us, millennials included, need to commit to hunkering down for as long as it takes.\n\nIt was subtle at first. I felt a little fatigue. My temperature crept to 99.5 -- a little high but not a fever. I had a slight cough.\n\nI brushed it off. After all, my job had never been busier. Californians were sheltering in place, the NBA suspended its season, and President Donald Trump gave his second-ever Oval Office address. As a reporter, I was focused on the story and how to cover it.\n\nBut then on March 20, I came down with a fever. My cough got worse and my chest felt tight. I called my doctor and described the symptoms. They aligned with COVID-19. I became a \"presumed positive\" case. But I live in New York City, where tests were mostly reserved for those who needed hospitalization. My case (thankfully) didn't come to that and I was not considered \"high risk,\" so my diagnosis was never confirmed.\n\nStill, my world suddenly became very small. My husband and I realized we now needed to fully quarantine. We had already been staying home except for the occasional trip to get essentials -- but now even getting those was going to be a challenge. Figuring that out became my husband's job as my symptoms got much worse.\n\nMy fever hovered above 102 and I couldn't get it down for days. The headaches and body aches that accompanied it became unbearable. I felt like all my joints were arthritic. I couldn't sleep at night and I was immobile all day. The fatigue was extreme. When the fever finally broke, my respiratory issues got worse and it hurt to breathe. At one point, I had about 24 hours of reprieve and then the symptoms came back with a vengeance. I added extreme nausea to my repertoire. Staying hydrated became a challenge and my primary focus.\n\nIn total, these symptoms lasted more than 18 days. The relentlessness of this disease was the hardest part.\n\nBut even as I drowsily scrolled Twitter and Instagram in bed, I saw images of spring breakers crowding beaches, of large groups picnicking in the park, of people gathering in apartments. Now, some of those beaches are already reopening again.\n\nYoung adults were some of the last to fall in line with social distancing and isolation guidelines issued by federal, state and local governments. And now they're some of the most eager to get back to life as usual. Many of us have a bit of a bulletproof mentality. It's why we go skydiving, take dangerous hikes, eat suspicious street food (speaking for myself here, too). But this isn't a backpacking adventure.\n\nThat sense of invincibility might have been reinforced early by an initial focus from officials and the media on risks to the elderly and the immunocompromised populations. But as more data has rolled in, it's become clear that young people are far from immune. In the epicenter of the global pandemic -- New York City -- individuals between the ages of 18 and 44 account for 38 percent of cases, according to data from the NYC Health Department. And a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study showed those ages 18-49 comprised 24.7 percent of hospitalizations in the month of March.\n\nDespite these numbers, many young, healthy people still assume they will be asymptomatic or that their case will be mild.\n\nI am under 30. I have no underlying conditions. I was one of the luckier ones. And this was the sickest I've ever been. It disrupted my work, my husband's work, and terrified my family who live on the other side of the country. I'm still regaining strength and catching up to the new normal.\n\nI am only one example, but if my generation isn't careful, we could still make this pandemic worse for everybody -- including ourselves.",

        "body": "Pence distanced himself from others this weekend \"out of caution,\" a senior administration official told NBC News.\n\nVice President Mike Pence was putting \"a little distance\" between himself and others this weekend after a staffer tested positive for COVID-19, a senior administration official told NBC News.\n\nThat official said Trump would take the advice of the White House medical unit and continues to test negative for the virus. The vice president chose not to attend a national security meeting on Saturday, the official said, adding that there is \"no restriction\" on his activities.\n\nPence distanced himself from others \"out of caution,\" the official said.\n\n\"At this point, for a day or two, give a little distance,\" the official said of Pence's actions. \"It doesn't mean anything for next week\" or beyond.\n\nDevin O'Malley, a spokesperson for Pence, said that Pence \"is not in quarantine\" and that he plans to be at the White House on Monday.\n\nPence's decision to stay \"a little low key\" over the weekend, as the official described, came after his press secretary, Katie Miller, and one of Trump's personal valets both tested positive for COVID-19 last week. The White House has ramped up testing from once weekly to daily for administration officials, including Trump and Pence, who White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said both tested negative for the novel coronavirus on Friday.\n\nMiller, who is married to top Trump administration official Stephen Miller, said she tested positive Friday after testing negative the day before. An administration official told NBC News Friday night that her husband tested negative for the virus. A White House official told NBC News that Miller was at the White House in the morning before testing positive, adding that she was showing \"symptoms.\"\n\nPence's distancing also comes as three members of the White House coronavirus task force are self-quarantining after the potential exposure, administration officials said Saturday. Those officials are Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Dr. Stephen Hahn, head of the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nOn Sunday, White House senior adviser Kevin Hassett said it's \"scary\" to go to work in the West Wing after two Trump administration staffers tested positive for COVID-19 within the past week.\n\n\"It is scary to go to work,\" Hassett, who formerly served as President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, told CBS's \"Face the Nation.\" \"I was not part of the White House in March. I think that I'd be a lot safer if I was sitting at home instead of going to the West Wing. But, you know, it's a time when people have to step up and serve their country.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people who recently had close contact with someone who came down with COVID-19 should stay at home for 14 days following their last exposure, should check their temperature twice daily and stay away from those who are at a high risk of getting ill.",

Roche said its test relies on intravenous blood draws, with higher accuracy than finger-prick tests.\n\n\"If you take blood from a finger prick, you will never be able to achieve the same level of specificity that you will achieve ... when you take blood from the vein,\" Schinecker said.\n\n\"You have to have very, very high specificity.

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Five sailors on the U.S. aircraft carrier sidelined in Guam due to a COVID-19 outbreak have tested positive for the virus for the second time and have been taken off the ship, according to the Navy.\n\nThe resurgence of the virus in the five sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt underscores the befuddling behavior of the highly contagious virus and raises questions about how troops that test positive can be reintegrated into the military, particularly on ships.\n\nAll five sailors had previously tested positive and had gone through at least two weeks of isolation. As part of the process, they all had to test negative twice in a row, with the tests separated by at least a day or two before they were allowed to go back to the ship.\n\nThe Roosevelt has been at port in Guam since late March after the outbreak of the virus was discovered. More than 4,000 of the 4,800 crew members have gone ashore since then for quarantine or isolation. Earlier this month hundreds of sailors began returning to the ship, in coordinated waves, to get ready to set sail again.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Navy said that, while onboard, the five sailors self-monitored and adhered to strict social distancing protocols.\n\n\"These five Sailors developed influenza-like illness symptoms and did the right thing reporting to medical for evaluation,\" the Navy said, adding that they were immediately removed from the ship and put back in isolation. A small number of other sailors who were in contact with them were also taken off the ship.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the outbreak has been a learning process.\n\n\"This is a very stubborn, infectious disease,\" he told Pentagon reporters during a briefing on Friday. He said that because of the Navy's quick action, medical crew were notified right away and determined who might have also been exposed and got them all off the ship.\n\nAs of Thursday, more than 2,900 sailors have reboarded the ship, and about 25 percent of the more than 1,000 who had tested positive have now recovered, according to the Navy.\n\nOne U.S. official familiar with the situation on the ship said commanders don't know why this is happening but suggested it could be related to questions about testing accuracy. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that screening has been intensified on the ship. And, anyone who exhibits any flu-like symptoms at all is being tested and removed.\n\nThe sailors have been tested using the nasal swab. And in some cases the infection can be at such a low level that it is not detected by the test.

        "body": "LONDON -- A British scientist advising the government on its coronavirus response resigned from his role on Tuesday, after the Daily Telegraph newspaper reported he had broken lockdown rules by meeting a female friend.\n\nEpidemiologist Neil Ferguson, a professor at Imperial College in London, said he was standing down from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) which plays a key role in shaping government policy.\n\nThe Telegraph said he had been visited by a 38-year old woman on two occasions. This would breach rules which say citizens must only leave their homes to shop for food, for exercise or medical needs, or if they cannot work from home.\n\n\"I accept I made an error of judgement and took the wrong course of action. I have therefore stepped back from my involvement in SAGE,\" Ferguson said in a statement.\n\nFerguson's academic team produced modelling on the likely spread of the virus which has been repeatedly cited by ministers, and is seen as a turning point in their response to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nThe model showed that under a reasonable worst-case scenario as many as 500,000 people could die. It contributed to the decision to impose the most far-reaching restrictions on daily life in Britain's peacetime history to stop the spread of the virus.\n\n\"I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms,\" Ferguson's statement said.\n\n\"I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devastating epidemic. The government guidance is unequivocal, and is there to protect all of us.\"",

    "Some Southern governors begin lifting coronavirus restrictions": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Georgia Gov. Kemp announces phase one of reopening businesses\n\nSome governors in the South have begun loosening restrictions put in place to contain the spread of coronavirus.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Monday granted businesses across the state permission to reopen later this week, an announcement echoed by a handful of other Republican governors who are beginning to lift stay-at-home orders.\n\nKemp's decision, which will apply to barber shops, gyms and other businesses that include close contact, comes days after President Donald Trump issued guidelines for the reopening of state economies. Protestors across the country have been gathering at rallies outside state capitols demanding an end to shutdown orders.\n\nIn a series of tweets last week, the president called for demonstrators to \"LIBERATE\" certain states.\n\nSome health experts have expressed concern that it's too early to be backing off lockdown measures.\n\nIn South Carolina, Gov. Henry McMaster said Monday that beaches and retail stores can reopen Tuesday. Businesses including sporting good shops and florists will have to observe social distancing guidelines that limit how many customers can shop at once, he said.\n\nIn Tennessee, Gov. Bill Lee said he won't extend the state's stay-at-home order beyond April 30, while state parks can reopen Friday. In Nebraska, Gov. Pete Ricketts said that elective surgeries will resume May 4.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott made a similar announcement Friday.\n\nKemp said that Georgia theaters, restaurants and social clubs can reopen Monday, while bars, nightclubs and concert venues will remain closed. He said the state appeared to be on track to meet the first phase of Trump's guidelines, which were developed by the administration's public health officials and recommend a \"downward trajectory of documented cases within a 14-day period.\"\n\n\"Reports of ER visits for flu-like illnesses are declining, documented COVID-19 cases have flattened and appear to be declining, and we have seen declining ER visits in general,\" Kemp said. He called testing for the disease a \"key component\" of reopening and said that the state is seeking to expand its ability to test people with and without symptoms.\n\nReopened businesses will also be subject to guidelines that include wearing gloves and masks \"if appropriate\" and maintaining six feet from other people, he said.\n\nKemp ordered the shuttering of businesses across the state April 1 and said he did so after learning that the virus could be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers -- a possibility that public health experts had been warning of since January.\n\nGeorgia has recorded nearly 19,000 confirmed cases, one of the highest tallies in the region, and more than 700 people have died, according to data collected by NBC News.\n\nData compiled by John Hopkins University showed the number of cases in Georgia rose from 7,300 on April 6 to just over 18,000 on Sunday.\n\nAsked during a news conference if the measures could trigger more cases and lead to another cycle of shuttering businesses, Kemp said he'd consulted with experts about the state's \"measured\" approach.\n\n\"It's not just throwing the keys back to business owners,\" he said, adding: \"I think our citizens are ready for this.\"\n\n\"People know what social distancing is,\" he said. \"They're learning what mitigation was when we went through it and are still trying to do.\"\n\nBut Gerardo Chowell, an epidemiologist at Georgia State University's School of Public Health in Atlanta, worried that Kemp's measures are coming too soon. He said that the state appeared to have just passed its peak in confirmed cases and that reopening without adequate public health measures could lead to another wave of infections.\n\n\"If we go back to business as usual, it's going to happen,\" he said.\n\nBefore reopening, he said, the state needs to launch a rigorous contact tracing effort, offer robust support for telecommuting and remote learning, and mandate face masks in public.\n\n\"This takes time, and you need to communicate it,\" Chowell said. \"You need to launch a communication campaign to inform the public how our new life will be. That doesn't happen in a couple of days.\"\n\nStacey Abrams, Kemp's gubernatorial challenger in 2018, ridiculed the governor for the move, saying the state has a low testing rate, a high infection rate, a health care system in shambles and thousands of low-wage workers \"forced to risk their lives to make a living.\"",

        "body": "A medical worker in a booth takes samples from a visitor for a coronavirus test at a walk-through testing station at Jamsil Sports Complex in Seoul, South Korea, on April 3, 2020.Jung Yeon-Je / AFP - Getty Images\n\nAt least 14 sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt who had recovered from COVID-19 have tested positive for a second time, raising questions about immunity and whether people can catch the coronavirus shortly after getting better.\n\nThe sailors who \"previously tested COVID positive and met rigorous recovery criteria have retested positive,\" a U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesperson said in a statement. The sailors are now off the ship and are required to isolate for at least 14 days.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nExperts said the perplexing test results don't necessarily establish that a person can become infected twice -- the positive results following negative tests may be a quirk related to the type of test that was used.\n\nNearly all of the diagnostic tests for COVID-19 in the U.S. look for snippets of the virus' RNA, or genetic code. (Another type of diagnostic test, called an antigen test, looks for proteins from the virus.)\n\nBut according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \"detection of viral RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present.\" In other words, the test may be picking up a piece of the viral RNA that's been left behind, rather than a fully intact, infectious virus particle.\n\nA second positive test after a negative result may mean the virus is simply taking its time leaving the body, doctors said, and is no longer able to infect others.\n\n\"It's possible that people could shed remnants of the virus for some period of time. That doesn't mean anything is wrong with them or that they are contagious,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\n\nA study from South Korea bolsters that idea. Researchers at the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention analyzed data on 285 COVID-19 patients who also tested positive after having appeared to recover.\n\nScientists were unable to find evidence that the patients remained infectious. And viral samples taken from the patients couldn't be prompted to grow and thrive in lab studies, suggesting that the samples were duds.\n\n\"What we're finding more and more is that the fragments of virus that are being picked up on these swabs weeks later are not able to replicate,\" said Dr. Ania Wajnberg, associate director of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. \"They're not live virus.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nStill, the world has known about COVID-19 only for mere months, giving scientists no indication yet of how the virus acts long term.\n\n\"We just don't have enough details yet to make confident statements about immunology,\" said Dr. John Sanders, chief of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.\n\nSanders said the different diagnostic results might also be explained by false negatives. \"I think that there is a lot to be learned about the testing and about the protective impact of having been infected or having developed an antibody,\" he said.\n\nSanders and a team of researchers at Wake Forest have embarked on an ambitious study to get a feel for how the virus acts in people, how long symptoms last and how COVID-19 might lead to immunity from secondary infections, at least for a certain period of time.\n\nThe group has enrolled 15,000 volunteers, some of whom have had COVID-19 and others who haven't. Each day, the volunteers are asked to record any possible symptoms they're experiencing. If a person reports any kind of symptom, such as fever or a cough, researchers ask for more information.\n\n\"We will send them a home test collection kit to send back to us. We'll test them to see if they have the virus and then continue to track them for antibodies after that,\" Sanders said.\n\nThe research team will upload the results into a database, tracking symptoms in real time. Ideally, public health officials could then compare the information with electronic health records. Sanders said the project aims to tease out whether an uptick in cough, for example, correlates with a true rise in COVID-19 or simply with allergy season.\n\nThe research group plans to conduct antibody testing on 10,000 of the volunteers six times over the next year. So far, all of the volunteers are from health systems in North Carolina, but researchers are working to expand the study along the East Coast.\n\n\"We have dozens of unanswered research questions about whether or not an antibody protects you against future infection, about whether or not you get complications after a COVID infection,\" Sanders said.\n\n\"This also allows us to collect the information necessary to start answering those more detailed questions.\"",

    "These disinformation researchers saw the coronavirus 'infodemic' coming": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Joan Donovan, Kate Starbird and Claire Wardle talk about what it's like to track coronavirus misinformation that has become prevalent online. Claire Merchlinsky / for NBC News\n\nFor a handful of disinformation researchers, the information crisis that has unfolded around the coronavirus pandemic seemed inevitable.\n\nJoan Donovan, Claire Wardle and Kate Starbird have been preparing for this moment for a decade, capturing the data of the internet, tracking disinformation campaigns and calling for traditional and social media platforms to take responsibility for their spread.\n\nSome of those calls resonated. Tech platforms have taken steps to banish hate groups and include context around misleading information. But the efforts also highlight the severity of what the World Health Organization declared \"a massive infodemic.\"\n\nNBC News spoke with Donovan, Wardle and Starbird as they continue to work on the front lines of the coronavirus information war to get a sense of what we should be watching for and what the internet might look like after the virus has passed.\n\n\"The Internet hasn't been built for a pandemic,\" Donovan said on an April episode of her webinar series, \"Big, If True.\" \"It hasn't been built for giving timely, relevant, local and redundant information, which is what everyone needs in this moment.\"\n\nThe series is one of seemingly constant pandemic education and outreach efforts from Donovan. She and her team of researchers have published research in peer-reviewed journals and op-eds and publish a weekly newsletter, Meme War Weekly, that decodes memes as political communication. She hosts the weekly pandemic-focused web series and gives daily interviews to reporters and other researchers. In April, she met with the WHO to advise on coming recommendations to combat misinformation.\n\nDonovan studied disinformation and media manipulation at the Data & Society Research Institute, an independent nonprofit that covers the social and cultural impact of technology. She leveraged her research to implore journalists to practice what she coined \"strategic silence,\" editorial discretion that diminishes the profiles of violent extremists and slows the spread of hateful messages.\n\n\"Misinformation researchers have been dealing with platform accountability and content moderation issues for several years now, and public health is just now seeing how broken our internet infrastructure really is,\" Donovan said in a phone interview.\n\nDonovan stays in touch with her team through a long-running text chain, getting messages as late as 3 a.m. from researchers who document misinformation as it bubbles up. She wakes up around 7 and starts writing.\n\n\"It's like crazy on crazy,\" she said.\n\nFor Donovan, the coronavirus and the accompanying deluge of misinformation have laid bare a truth about the internet itself: The early notion that users could be both producers and consumers of information has turned platforms into information landfills, where people are forced to sift through increasingly dangerous garbage in the search for real information.\n\n\"Information is extremely cheap to produce,\" she said. \"That's why misinformation is a problem, because you don't need any evidence, you don't need any investigation, you don't need any methods to produce it. Knowledge is incredibly expensive to produce. Experts are sought after, and they aren't going to work for free. So platform companies can't rely on the idea that the web is something we build together.\"\n\nDonovan is watching coronavirus misinformation that goes unnoticed or undocumented because its virality is hidden -- spread inside private messaging apps and within secret groups or by users who employ tactics to evade detection like web archivers.\n\nThe volume of misinformation and its potential for widespread harm is unprecedented, and the only real solution would have to be, too, Donovan said, suggesting that the platforms should move beyond moderation to a kind of curation.\n\n\"Believing that platform companies can clean this up is like believing that you're going to win the lottery,\" Donovan said. \"They need to hire 10,000 librarians to get in there and to look at what's on the shelves, to sort, to document and to cull what is not viable, what is not useful, what is not serving the public's interest.\"\n\nFor the last half-decade, Claire Wardle, the co-founder and director of First Draft, a nonprofit that provides research and training for journalists, has been lobbying the platforms, particularly Facebook, to exercise greater collaboration, transparency and accountability in the fight against misinformation.\n\n\"We just kept saying the same thing, and they would nod and smile and say, 'We'll do what we can,'\" Wardle said. \"And then, this flipping infodemic. And no surprises -- they weren't ready.\"\n\nWardle's misinformation work had mostly meant looking at elections. Indeed, Wardle and her newly expanded team of 18 -- 10 in New York and the rest in Sydney, India, London and France -- were training journalists on topics surrounding the coming U.S. election when the coronavirus started spreading in Washington state.\n\nIn March, as Wardle and many on her U.S. team quarantined in their New York apartments, First Draft shifted focus.\n\n\"I think it was a bit of self-preservation,\" Wardle said. \"We didn't know how to deal with what was happening, and we all threw ourselves into work\"\n\nIn a month, First Draft created a training course for journalists on how to navigate coronavirus misinformation, as well as a hub for reporters with a database of debunked claims and a toolkit for verifying content in the wild.\n\nWardle hosts weekly video chats on which local reporters throughout the country can talk with the team about local angles on national issues and share tips on how to cover misinformation responsibly. First Draft also hosts a 24/7 workspace where journalists and academics collaborate in real time, debunking hoaxes, tracking disinformation campaigns and feeling for \"the tipping point,\" a phrase now widely known to journalists that Wardle coined to describe when reporting on mis- and dis-information is worthwhile.\n\nCoronavirus misinformation has had a life cycle. In early March, a wave of inaccurate viral private messages warned of a federally enforced lockdown. As the virus began to spread in the U.S., so did ads and articles pushing unapproved and even dangerous treatments. Now, with most states still ordering residents to stay at home, conspiracies around vaccines and government control have overwhelmed the conversation over reopening.\n\nFor those who might be financially, politically or otherwise motivated to spread false information, the coronavirus has provided an unprecedented opportunity. The pandemic has also blurred lines between normally separate groups, uniting fringe activists and conspiracy theorists around a similar distrust of institutions like public health organizations and other government agencies.\n\n\"Second Amendment groups, anti-vaccine groups, these different networked groups that normally we monitor separately, were all there together,\" said Wardle, referring to small but vocal and potentially dangerous anti-quarantine protests that have popped up in nearly every state.\n\nAs for the platforms, their efforts haven't gone nearly far enough, Wardle said.\n\n\"They trumpet these transparency initiatives, but they're marking their own homework,\" Wardle said, noting Facebook's unwillingness to provide useful data to researchers and its recent announcements claiming successful cleanup of coronavirus misinformation. \"I just think it's a massive wasted opportunity,\"\n\nWhere opportunity lies, Wardle said, is with the public. First Draft has created a guide for it, too.\n\n\"As dark as this pandemic is, I feel like it has helped people recognize how harmful misinformation can be in a way that, previously, when it was around political disinformation, people could dismiss,\" Wardle said. \"If we can use that to have tough conversations with the platforms, then there'll be a tiny silver lining in the middle of all the horror.\"\n\nIn December, Kate Starbird and several colleagues presciently launched the Center for an Informed Public with a mission to \"resist strategic misinformation, promote an informed society, and strengthen democratic discourse.\"\n\nFor more than a decade, Starbird's work has focused on how misinformation and disinformation spread during crisis events, including mass shootings, natural disasters, terrorist attacks and war.\n\nWhile Starbird and her colleagues are collecting data -- nearing half a billion coronavirus-related tweets by now, she suspects -- they're also personally navigating a crisis.\n\nStarbird's parents live in a senior community, and in March, amid shocking reports of increased infections and deaths among older people, she and her brother were sharing articles and information over text, trying to decide whether and when their parents should move.\n\n\"Looking back to all the things I shared with my brother as we were trying to make that decision, some of it was not true. Some of it was misinformation,\" Starbird said. \"I have a lot of empathy for people who are sharing things that turn out not to be true, because it's so hard to get everything right right now.\"\n\nStarbird said the early responses to misinformation have been heartening overall, but she worries about the next wave of disinformation, which she predicts will be more exploitative.\n\n\"Where we had rumors and misinformation that looked natural, with people just trying to figure things out early on, we're seeing more disinformation, conspiracy theorizing and politicization,\" Starbird said. \"More people intentionally -- because they want to mislead or due to their own confirmation biases -- are picking and choosing information that is misleading and spreading information that may be leading us away from the best collective understanding of what's going on.\"\n\nStarbird noted several current disinformation campaigns, the most concerning of which undermined trust in a coming vaccine and targeted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and the most vocal public proponent of emergency measures on the White House's coronavirus task force.\n\n\"If the medical providers and scientists that we've been relying on for good information are delegitimized by disinformation campaigns, then we're put in a vulnerable situation as we try to continue to deal with this virus, maybe for years to come,\" she said.\n\nThe pandemic has also provided a superhighway for some of the wildest and longest-running conspiracy theories to enter the mainstream: baseless claims, including those that 5G towers cause coronavirus symptoms, a hostile government created the virus as a bioweapon and Bill Gates is plotting to inject vaccine recipients with microchips, have all gone viral across every social media platform.\n\nConspiracy theories are powerful because, unlike science, they are uncomplicated and explain a chaotic world in a way that gives the believer a feeling of control. When those become embedded, Starbird said, they can be difficult to refute with evidence.\n\n\"You think, 'I'll just show this person one piece of information that's so clear, then that will make their house of cards fall down,'\" Starbird said, referring specifically to anti-vaccination activists. \"But no, they just build another wing that supports it from the back side.\"\n\nStill, Starbird said, disasters can bring unity. Whether the pandemic will here remains to be seen.\n\n\"Coming together to deal with COVID could be a bit of a healing moment,\" she said. \"But the forces that have been pulling us apart are so active right now. With the protests and people congregating when they've been asked not to, and the rhetoric, you can see people resorting back to only picking the information that aligns with their political views. And the same kinds of swindlers are in the space trying to take advantage of that to sell their ads and their nutritional supplements.\"\n\n\"I hope that we're better than that. I hope that we can do it,\" she added. \"I'm hopeful but maybe not very confident.\"",

    "They became parents during the pandemic  --  but can't show their new babies the world": {

        "body": "Jamal Gathers Sr., seen with his son Henry, has weekly Zoom sessions with his therapist to cope with the challenges of having a newborn in a pandemic. \"Bourbon helps, too,\" Gathers joked.Courtesy Jamal Gathers, Sr.\n\nWhen Emily LaCosse gave birth to twins, she knew her world had changed. What she didn't expect was that at the same time, the coronavirus pandemic would alter everyone else's, too.\n\nLaCosse, of Grand Rapids, Michigan, had her babies March 9. When she went to the hospital to deliver them, the coronavirus still felt like a vague threat: A nurse downplayed the health risks of it, and her hospital had no restrictions on visitors.\n\nBut during the five days that LaCosse and her newborns were in the hospital, President Donald Trump declared a national emergency to fight the growing outbreak. Schools shuttered and grocery stores began running low on essentials.\n\nSoon, there was a statewide lockdown, too.\n\n\"We went into the hospital while everything was normal. When we got home, everything changed: No toilet paper, no visitors, no help,\" LaCosse said. \"All of our plans went out the window.\"\n\nBringing home a newborn is always an adjustment. But the pandemic has made it unusually complex, and has new parents wondering when they can safely introduce their babies to family, friends and life beyond their own four walls.\n\nLaCosse was one of 14 parents who spoke to NBC News about the challenges of welcoming a baby during the coronavirus crisis. For most, it has been bittersweet: Their joy has been tinged with the sadness of not being able to share their excitement with others in person.\n\nWhile there have been some benefits, including unexpected time with both parents home in many households, the pandemic has complicated even the most routine activities -- which can already feel intimidating for sleep-deprived mothers and fathers.\n\n\"I want to take him to the park. I want him to smell things, I want him to hear the birds and feel the sun,\" said Jamal Gathers Sr., of Newton, Massachusetts, whose second son, Henry, was born March 14. \"With social distancing, it's just not the same. I stand at the patio door with him and we just peer outside like a sad puppy, waiting for our owner to come home.\"\n\nEven errands and appointments, instead of being an excuse to get out of the house, feel risky.\n\n\"I had all these plans to take my child everywhere, and you can't take her anywhere,\" said Farrah Kokkosis, of Ronkonkoma, New York, whose daughter, Ridley, was born March 4. \"Now, it's like life is on hold -- everything is on hold.\"\n\nWhile children, including infants, generally appear to have more mild symptoms of the coronavirus, there have been severe or fatal pediatric cases. Researchers do not have a clear answer why.\n\nWith so many unknowns and no vaccine or cure, some parents of newborns are wrestling with depression and anxiety -- even if they did not experience that after prior pregnancies.\n\nKristen, a mother of three in the Tacoma, Washington, area who asked that her last name not be used to protect her family's privacy, was diagnosed with the coronavirus in March, three weeks after she had her son, Valentine.\n\nShe isolated in her bedroom with the baby, wearing a mask whenever she breastfed him, while her husband took care of their two older children. When Kristen's fever spiked, she panicked.\n\n\"Oh man, am I going to be around for my kids? Is Valentine going to catch this? Is he going to have to be hospitalized, are we going to be separated?\" she recalled thinking.\n\nShe recovered and no other family members got sick. But the experience, plus other difficulties such as not being able to meet up with close friends during the pandemic, prompted her to start antidepressants.\n\n\"It's been hard to pinpoint: Is it postpartum depression? Or is it just because everything is insane right now?\" she said.\n\nShe is far from the only mom asking herself that question.\n\nIn the first two weeks after Brittany Culbertson of Beaufort, South Carolina, had her daughter, Gwen, she found herself crying often.\n\nWhile filling out a postpartum depression screening from Gwen's pediatrician, she said she was stumped by a question that asked whether she had been \"anxious or worried for no reason.\"\n\n\"I was like, well, I have been extremely anxious, but I don't know that it's for no reason. I think it's heightened because of the very real fear of coronavirus,\" Culbertson, who gave birth on March 27, said.\n\nWhile the pandemic could have mental health ramifications for anyone, experts say exhausted new parents may be particularly vulnerable to depression and anxiety, especially with no one around to give them a break.\n\nDr. Kimberly Yonkers, a professor of psychiatry, epidemiology and obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive sciences at the Yale School of Medicine, urged overwhelmed parents to find help through virtual therapy, online support groups or medication. She said overpowering anxiety or depression -- whether it's for seemingly no reason or because of the pandemic -- is a reason to get support.\n\n\"If you are anxious for a very good reason, you are still in distress,\" she said.\n\nSome second-time parents say life with a newborn now has highlighted how easy they had it the first time around, even if it did not feel that way then.\n\nAndrea Foran, of Long Island, New York, has a 2-year-old and an infant, born March 3. Her husband is an officer with the New York City Police Department who has been self-isolating in a hotel since mid-April to avoid bringing home the virus, should he get exposed through work. Her mother is helping out with the kids, but Foran said it is hard not having her husband home.\n\n\"With the first one, I had a lot of anxiety because it was my first time, and now, thinking back, I'm like, 'Wow, you idiot! Everything was fine, you worried about nothing,'\" she said. \"We had visitors. We had people who could help. I wish I savored the peacefulness of the first time now.\"\n\nLeann Svoboda, of Nashville, Tennessee, has the same mindset. She used to take her first child, now 6, to playdates with other new moms and to baby exercise classes. Now, with her daughter Violet, who was born March 6, even a walk down the street feels frightening.\n\n\"We're holed up, waiting for it to pass,\" she said. \"I just don't trust other people to stay away from me. It's terrifying for me.\"\n\nSometimes, going out with a newborn is unavoidable.\n\nVisits to the pediatrician have been the only outings that Mariel Prince of Sellersburg, Indiana, has made since she came home after giving birth to her son, Declan, on March 20.\n\nThe appointments are anything but ordinary: Instead of going into the waiting room, she checks in at a drive-through out front, then waits with Declan in her car until the pediatrician's office calls her on her cellphone. Newborns are only seen in the morning, and every single person's temperature is taken at the door, she said.\n\n\"There's so many more steps involved in everything now, and all the steps involved in taking him anywhere -- it's a lot,\" she said. \"I joked with my husband, if we do decide to have a second, we're kind of prepared for everything at this point.\"\n\nPrince's husband, Josh, said besides not being able to have his parents meet his son, his biggest issue since Declan arrived has been trying to help his wife cope with cabin fever.\n\n\"She was planning on going to a zoo and all these other things where she could go out,\" he said. \"But those places are all closed, or she just doesn't feel safe going.\"\n\nElsewhere, parents are being told to stay at home, even for some doctor appointments.\n\nLindsay Preseau lives in Cincinnati and gave birth to her son, Ludo, on March 16. Right after Ludo was born, she took him to the pediatrician twice to check if he was gaining enough weight. But his one-month well-visit was canceled to avoid unnecessarily exposing him to any illnesses, and the pediatrician's office said the two-month one might be, too.\n\n\"I wasn't upset about the one-month visit because I know not much happens, but I'm nervous about the two-month, because I want him to get the vaccinations,\" she said.\n\nIn Cleveland, Sierra Heiskell had a virtual pediatrician visit for her daughter, Gianna, who was born April 10. A nurse came to her house to weigh Gianna a few days before and then Heiskell did a telemedicine consultation with the pediatrician for the rest of the appointment. While the doctor watched through the phone, Heiskell did things the pediatrician normally would -- like pressing on Gianna's belly to make sure it felt soft.\n\nHeiskell was also told by her obstetrician-gynecologist that her own six-week postpartum follow-up appointment will be virtual. Such appointments typically involve a physical exam to see how a woman is healing after birth and a discussion of how she is feeling, physically and mentally. Others who have had their OB-GYN follow-ups via telemedicine said the virtual meetings omitted exams and just consisted of questions.\n\n\"I have no idea how that's going to go,\" Heiskell said. \"I don't like it.\"\n\nDespite the obstacles, new parents say there have been some unexpected silver linings.\n\nGathers' wife, Sarah Cohan, was excited to be a part of a new mom support group. The group can't meet face-to-face, so it meets over Zoom. While it's not the same as sitting in a room with other new moms, Cohan found another member whom she could relate with, and the two exchanged numbers so they could text one-on-one.\n\nBetween that and a couple mom groups on Facebook, including one of about 400 women who were all due in March, Cohan has found a community -- even if it's not the one she pictured.\n\n\"It's been so nice to have a bunch of women from across the world who can commiserate, and post funny things, and who I can ask for recommendations,\" she said.\n\nLaCosse, the Michigan mother of twins, has figured out a way to have relatives see the babies, even though she does not feel comfortable having visitors over. Family comes -- but only as far as her front porch. Her in-laws have stopped by a few times to say hi to the twins from the safety of outside, gazing at the twins through the living room window.\n\n\"Their reaction is, I think, bittersweet,\" LaCosse said, adding that because it was hard for her to get pregnant, relatives, especially her mother-in-law, were extra eager to spend time with the twins. \"There was all this excitement -- and now she can't hold the babies, hold her grandchildren.\"\n\nOn the other hand, LaCosse's husband, Randy, is getting much more time with the babies: Had the pandemic not happened, he would have been in his office, working up to 12-hour days as a project manager. With shelter-in-place orders, he is working from home instead.\n\n\"It's kind of great that we all got stuck together,\" LaCosse said. \"We're spending time together like we never have before, and he gets to have an insane amount of time with them.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Glenda Johnson and her 83-year-old mother, Linda Hopkins, shared a hospital room. Courtesy of Glenda Johnson; NBC News\n\nGlenda Johnson sat on her mother's hospital bed, took her hand and told her it was OK to go.\n\nBut Linda Hopkins, her face tensed against the smothering pain of coronavirus-related pneumonia, was not ready.\n\n\"I don't want to die,\" Linda, 83, replied, tubes feeding oxygen into her nostrils, her daughter later recalled. \"It just hurts so bad.\"\n\nThe two of them had a wonderful life in Detroit, about as close as a mother and daughter could be. They lived together, traveled together, shopped together, worshipped together, partied together. When they both fell ill in late March, they drove together to Beaumont Hospital in nearby Royal Oak, where they tested positive for COVID-19. They ended up in the same room, where they battled the disease together. Glenda, Linda's only child, watched over her mother's final moments.\n\n\"I have no husband, no kids, no brother and sister. My mother was all I had in the world,\" Glenda said in a recent interview. \"Now my heart is broken.\"\n\nGlenda, 58, a retired social worker, had been Linda's caregiver since 2014. That was the year Glenda's father, Clyde, died; her parents had been married for 57 years. Glenda quit her job, left her condo in the suburbs and moved back into the four-bedroom house in Detroit's Bagley neighborhood where she was raised.\n\nLinda, who had been head of acquisition and receiving at the University of Detroit Mercy, and Clyde, a former director of engineering for the city of Detroit, had traveled the world together. When he died, Glenda took his place on trips to Hawaii, Hilton Head, South Carolina, Washington, D.C., Chicago. In late February, as the coronavirus was just starting to spread through the United States, they canceled a visit to Las Vegas and instead spent the night at the MotorCity Casino in Detroit, where they gambled and ordered room service.\n\nBoth of them had busy worlds beyond their singular relationship; Linda belonged to the Red Hat Society and several card-playing groups and was active in her church and local library, and Glenda worked as an event planner. They cut back on their social activity in early March, but Glenda got sick later that month, and Linda followed about a week after, Glenda said. They first thought they had the flu, but grew concerned as their symptoms worsened. After Linda's fever spiked on March 28, they decided to go to the hospital.\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nJust getting out of the house was an ordeal, both women stopping to catch their breath every few minutes as they dressed and packed, Glenda recalled. They drove slowly, in a caravan that included a cousin and a neighbor, to Beaumont, where, after waiting in the emergency department for a few hours, they tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nGlenda asked a doctor if her mother was going to die. \"And of course they didn't know, because they didn't know anything about the virus,\" she recalled.\n\nDiagnosed with pneumonia, they were put in rooms on different floors of Beaumont, and spoke by phone multiple times each day. Glenda pressed her mother's doctors and nurses for updates on her condition, and to make sure she was getting enough attention. On their fifth day in Beaumont, without their asking, Glenda and Linda were moved to the same room, a decision that Glenda said has made her grateful to the hospital. They talked, watched movies together, and called friends.\n\nGlenda slowly improved, but Linda, who had diabetes, kidney disease and arthritis, deteriorated. She was put on dialysis. Her breathing grew more labored. Glenda tried to make her mother comfortable, helping her eat and adjusting her oxygen mask when it slipped off her mouth.\n\nAt one point, the doctors told Glenda that she had progressed enough to be discharged and go home, she said. But she still felt weak and short of breath. She'd also heard stories about families of coronavirus victims who were unable to see their loved ones in the hospital and had to instead speak to them by phone or video; many died alone.\n\nGlenda said she refused to leave, telling hospital staff that she felt her health remained in jeopardy and she feared she'd never see her mother again. She said she asked whether the hospital planned to put someone else in her mother's room, and the staff said no. The hospital allowed Glenda to stay, and continued to treat her.\n\n\"I wondered about the bill, but I said I could care less,\" Glenda recalled.\n\nBeaumont Hospital said it could not immediately comment on Glenda's case, citing privacy rules.\n\nOn April 10, Linda seemed to rebound. She ate well and phoned friends, telling them she'd see them soon, Glenda said. But two days later, a Sunday afternoon, her pneumonia worsened, and she was unable to focus on much else other than the pain.\n\nGlenda held Linda's hand and fed her ice chips. Linda told Glenda that having her had been as good as having four daughters. Glenda said she couldn't have asked for a better mother.\n\nAs difficult as it was to watch her mother suffer, Glenda knew she was fortunate to remain by her side.\n\n\"It was a blessing, a bittersweet blessing, that we both got it and we were there together, and I was able to take care of her in a manner she was accustomed to, even in the hospital,\" Glenda said later. \"I made her days as pleasant and as happy as I possibly could. She was my heart, my life.\"\n\nGlenda's vigil continued into the following day, April 13. That morning, Linda's pulse was racing. The end seemed near.\n\nGlenda gave her mother permission to die. \"I told her I was going to be OK and if she saw my dad, to go with him. She said she hadn't seen him because she did not want to die. She was fighting to live.\"\n\nGlenda asked if there was something the doctors could give her mother to ease her pain. The medication did not arrive in time.\n\nLinda died holding Glenda's hand.\n\nLater, Glenda returned home alone. Her parents' house was unkempt from the weeks of immobilizing illness and the hasty departure for the hospital. But she found some solace in being surrounded by elephant figurines, which Linda collected on her travels. Linda said they brought good luck. Glenda said the elephants symbolized Linda: majestic, loyal, protective.\n\nGlenda believed her mother deserved a large and celebratory funeral that could accommodate all of her relatives and friends; 300 had attended her 80th birthday party. Instead, because of social distancing rules, the service would be limited to 10 people.\n\n\"I'm trying not to be bitter with God,\" Glenda said recently from her parents' house, where she fielded calls and deliveries of food and flowers. \"But she did not die alone. So many people are dying alone.\"\n\nShe turned on the television, but the news of the coronavirus' toll overwhelmed her. More than 1,000 Detroit residents have died.\n\n\"I'm just so sick of coronavirus I don't know what to do,\" Glenda said. \"It's just too much. Every time I see the death total, I know my mother is in that number.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak\n\nOn April 30, Glenda and a small group of friends and relatives, along with Linda's pastor, all wearing face masks, attended an hourlong service at the Kemp Funeral Home in Southfield. Linda's gleaming white casket was surrounded by bouquets of flowers.\n\nGlenda did not speak. But she wrote a letter to her mother, which one of the mourners read aloud.\n\nGlenda thanked Linda for making her feel loved and beautiful and for being her biggest fan.\n\n\"From time to time, you'd ask me if you were a good mother,\" Glenda wrote. \"I'd reply, 'Momma, you're the master at being a good mother.'\"",

This marks the first time a pet has tested positive for the virus in the United States.\n\nThe cats, who live in separate areas of New York state, presented mild respiratory symptoms but are expected to make full recoveries.\n\nOne cat is believed to have caught the virus from its owner, who was positive for COVID-19. Officials believe the other cat was infected by an asymptomatic or mildly ill household member or through contact with a neighbor.\n\nWhile officials said they are still learning about the virus, they noted that there is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading it.\n\nIn order to protect pets, the CDC recommends keeping them indoors and preventing them from interacting with people and other animals outside the household. In addition, people who test positive for COVID-19 should restrict contact with their pets and wear a face mask during necessary interactions.\n\nThe pet cats' positive tests come after a 4-year-old Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for the virus on April 4. That tiger, Nadia, along with four other tigers -- one that never developed a cough -- and three African lions have tested positive for COVID-19, zoo officials said in a statement released Wednesday.\n\n\"This testing was done by using a fecal sample test developed by our laboratory partners that does not require the animals be placed under anesthesia,\" zoo officials said in the statement. \"The fecal tests confirmed our suspicion that all seven cats had the infection, and also determined that one tiger at Tiger Mountain that never developed a cough was also positive for the disease.\"\n\nThe big cats \"continue to do well. They are behaving normally, eating well, and their coughing is greatly reduced.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Tyson Foods suspended operations Wednesday at an Iowa plant that is critical to the nation's pork supply but had been devastated by a growing coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe company said that the indefinite closure of the Waterloo, Iowa, pork plant would deny a vital market to hog farmers and further disrupt the nation's meat supply. Tyson had kept the facility, its largest pork plant, open in recent days over the objections of the mayor and local elected officials.\n\nThe plant can process about 19,500 hogs per day, accounting for nearly 4% of U.S. pork processing capacity, according to the National Pork Board.\n\nMore than 180 infections had been linked to the plant earlier this week and officials expect that number to dramatically rise. The company said that mass testing of its 2,800 workers would begin later this week.\n\nIn addition to those sick, hundreds of workers had stayed home from work out of fear of catching the virus. The plant had been running at reduced production levels as a result.\n\nThe announcement comes as employers have struggled to contain the virus in large meatpacking plants, where workers toil side by side on production lines and often share crowded locker rooms, cafeterias and rides to work.\n\nSeveral other packing plants have temporarily closed across the country after large outbreaks, including a Smithfield Foods plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and a JBS USA plant in Worthington, Minnesota. Others have stayed open or resumed production after brief pauses for worker testing and cleaning.\n\n\"Despite our continued efforts to keep our people safe while fulfilling our critical role of feeding American families, the combination of worker absenteeism, COVID-19 cases and community concerns has resulted in our decision to stop production,\" Tyson Fresh Meats president Steve Stouffer said in a statement.\n\nHe warned that the closure would have \"significant ramifications beyond our company\" since it's part of a supply chain that includes farmers, truckers, distributors and grocers.\n\nTyson said that workers would be compensated while the plant is closed and the timing of its reopening would depend on several factors, including the outcome of COVID-19 testing of workers.\n\nThe suspension came one day after the Black Hawk County Board of Health called on the company or Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds to temporarily close the plant. The board warned that its continued operation would exacerbate the spread of the virus through the county, where confirmed cases and hospitalizations have skyrocketed in recent days.\n\nWaterloo Mayor Quentin Hart and scores of local officials had also called for a temporary shutdown, saying that the company was putting its workforce in danger. Iowa's worker safety agency said Tuesday that it had begun an investigation at the plant.\n\nThe plant employs many blacks, Latinos and refugees, populations that comprise a hugely disproportionate share of Iowa's coronavirus cases.\n\nThe governor and the Iowa Department of Public Health had rejected calls for a closure and said they were working with Tyson to keep the plant open, even at partial capacity.\n\nReynolds argued Monday that the economic harm caused by meat plant closures would outweigh the health risks to workers, warning that farmers with no markets may have to euthanize their pigs.\n\nShe said Tuesday that \"people are gonna get\" the virus in large workplaces and that most will experience only mild or no symptoms.\n\nEarlier this week, Tyson resumed operations at its pork processing plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa. That plant had been shut down for two weeks due to an outbreak linked to hundreds of infections and the deaths of two workers.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- The United Kingdom could have the highest death toll from the coronavirus outbreak of any nation in Europe, according to data published Tuesday.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics, which is independent and releases figures separately from the U.K. government, said there had been 29,648 deaths related to COVID-19 in England and Wales in the week ending April 24 -- compared to the official figure for the same period of 21,399.\n\nWhen figures are included for Scotland and Northern Ireland, the total provisional figure rises to 32,313 -- higher than that of Italy, so far the worst hit country in Europe, which had reported 29,079 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe ONS figure, which is a third higher than the government number, includes all deaths where COVID-19 is mentioned on a death certificate, including as a suspected cause of death. The lower government figure is based on deaths following positive tests, which mostly take place in hospitals.\n\nFigures are not directly comparable between nations due to differences in population density and differing statistical practices -- Italy's figure does not include suspected cases, for example -- and government scientific advisers and medical experts have cautioned against a straight numerical ranking.\n\nBut in any case the U.K. has seen a higher number of deaths than several similar-size economies and the new data will add to the chorus of criticism the government faces in how it has handled the outbreak.\n\nMany of the U.K. deaths occurred in nursing homes where elderly people, often with underlying health conditions, are typically not offered coronavirus tests when presenting symptoms. The Care Quality Commission, which regulates residential and respite care of the elderly and other vulnerable people, has reported 6,391 deaths related to COVID-19 in nursing homes from April 10 to May 1.\n\nSuch is the scale of the coronavirus outbreak in the U.K., in the week ending April 24 more than 11,000 more people died in England and Wales than compared to a five-year average, the ONS said. Coronavirus accounted for more than half of all deaths in London in the week ending April 24, and more than a third in the northwest and northeast of England.\n\nIn a rare piece of good news, the overall death toll reported by ONS for England and Wales for the week ending April 24 was 354 lower than the previous week, a possible sign that social distancing is working.\n\nWhereas millions of people have gone back to work across Europe, the U.K. was late to impose social distancing and the country remains under lockdown, amid growing complaints from frustrated Britons and some lawmakers.\n\nThe economy has been brought to a near standstill, with a historic business bail-out underway, and schools are shut to all but a handful of children. New car sales fell by 97 percent annually in April to the lowest point since the end of World War II, according to an auto industry survey.\n\nThe U.K. government has been strongly criticized for not recognizing the dangers of the outbreak and imposing a lockdown sooner.",

Lee has confirmed the majority of detected cases originate in migrant worker dormitories, with most patients presenting mild symptoms - none requiring intensive care.\n\nThe circuit break measures implemented in the country include the closure of workplaces and schools, except for essential services. Increased safe distancing measures have been introduced, limiting traffic in stores and public areas. The Prime Minister urged citizens to \"reduce movement to a minimum\" asking the public to shop and exercise individually, then go straight home.\n\nThe circuit breaker measures were initially set until May 4th. They have now been extended to June 1st, at which time further adjustments may be made \"easing some measures\". According to the PM, \"the circuit breaker is working, but now we need to do more\".",

        "body": "The incident ended with three detainees sent to a hospital and $25,000 in damage to the detention center, officials said. Congressman Joe Kennedy is calling for an investigation.\n\nAn altercation over coronavirus tests broke out between federal immigration detainees and officers at a detention center in Massachusetts, ending with three detainees sent to a hospital and $25,000 in damage to the center, authorities said.\n\nThe incident Friday at the C. Carlos Carreiro Immigration Detention Center in Bristol County also sparked calls for an investigation of what occurred.\n\nBristol County Sheriff Thomas Hodgson said Friday that 10 ICE detainees refused to go to the center's medical unit for testing for coronavirus after \"each reported having at least two symptoms of COVID-19.\"\n\n\"The health care professionals told me they had to be tested in the medical unit because of the reported symptoms. The detainees refused to go into the medical unit for testing,\" said Hodgson in a statement. \"The detainees refused to comply, became combatant and ultimately put the lives of themselves and many Bristol County officers at risk with their reckless actions.\"\n\nHodgson said that detainees caused extensive damage to the center after breaking windows and ripping washing machines and pipes off the walls. The detainees have been moved to single cells pending disciplinary action, COVID-19 testing and criminal charges, he said, adding that damages are estimated at $25,000.\n\nThree detainees were taken to a hospital after the altercation. One was hospitalized with \"symptoms of a panic attack,\" another was hospitalized due to a pre-existing condition and a third \"for a medical incident after being removed from the ICE wing.\" All three are expected to recover, officials said. No staff injuries were reported.\n\nThe Boston Immigration Justice Accompaniment Network, an immigrant advocacy group, said it received a call Friday evening from a detainee who said, \"the sheriff approached me violently, grabbed my arm and scratched me, police came with pepper spray, spraying in everyone's face and spraying in my mouth, and I suffer asthma.\"\n\n\"They want to take us to the other unit to be tested. We don't want to go on the other unit for cross contamination. We want to be tested, but not moved,\" the detainee said, according to the group.\n\nThe Connecticut Bail Fund, another advocacy organization, shared a written declaration of a woman whose brother was at the detention center at the time of the altercation.\n\nIn the declaration, which is written in Spanish, she said she received a phone call from her brother, who is at Bristol detained by ICE, at 6:16 p.m. Friday.\n\n\"We are in trouble here. I need you to help me!\" the man said, according to the written declaration. \"They came to throw pepper spray because we did not want to sign a paper that says that everything is okay with the conditions in here, even though that is not true.\"\n\n\"Law enforcement officials started breaking glass, so they could blame us for causing a disturbance. There were more people outside with dogs,\" the declaration reads.\n\nThe sheriff's confirmed on Friday it used security, special response teams and the K9 unit to \"restrain detainees\" -- adding that detainees \"rushed violently at Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson and corrections officers.\"\n\nCarol Rose, executive director of the ACLU of Massachusetts, is calling for an independent investigation after receiving \"deeply disturbing\" reports on the incident.\n\n\"Matters like these require transparency in order to ensure trust in government during a pandemic,\" she said in a written statement. \"That is particularly true where the leader of that institution has been accused of personal misconduct during the incident.\"\n\nRep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., tweeted that he is \"closely monitoring the treatment of detainees at Bristol County House of Corrections\" and also called for an independent investigation into what happened.\n\n\"All people held at this facility deserve to be treated with humanity and dignity. We need an independent investigation and the release of surveillance footage to ascertain exactly what happened and ensure accountability,\" Kennedy said.\n\nICE did not respond to a request for comment on Saturday. However, Hodgson said in a press conference Saturday that ICE is investigating the incident.",

        "body": "Dr. Joseph Fair: 'Best guess' is I got coronavirus through my eyes\n\nVirologist Dr. Joseph Fair, an NBC News contributor who has been hospitalized with coronavirus despite being in good health and taking precautions against getting sick, said Thursday that he believes he contracted the virus through his eyes on a crowded flight.\n\nThe 42-year-old virologist and epidemiologist, who has responded to multiple outbreaks around the world, got sick about three days after a flight to his home in New Orleans.\n\n\"I had a mask on, I had gloves on, I did my normal wipes routine ... but obviously, you can still get it through your eyes,\" Fair said on the \"TODAY\" show from his hospital bed. \"And of course I wasn't wearing goggles on the flight.\"\n\n\"That's one of the three known routes of getting this infection that we just don't pay a lot of attention to; we tend to pay attention to the nose and mouth because that is the most common route,\" he said. \"But you know, droplets landing on your eyes are just as infectious.\"\n\nHe said the airline \"had us packed in like sardines,\" and \"instinctively, I probably should have gotten off.\" But he didn't.\n\nSince Fair had protected his nose and his mouth during the flight, hadn't gone anywhere but to his home after the flight and starting feeling ill a few days later, he suspects he contracted the virus through his eyes on the plane. \"It's the best guess I could give,\" he said.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the main way the coronavirus spreads is \"from person to person, mainly through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\"\n\n\"These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs,\" according to the CDC. \"The virus does not spread easily in other ways.\"\n\nHowever, \"it may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes,\" the CDC advises. \"This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus,\" the CDC says.\n\n\"I think there's so much we don't know about it,\" Fair said.\n\nFair initially just had flu-like symptoms that started with a loss of appetite, so he didn't immediately go to the hospital in an effort to not overwhelm the system. Eventually, he said he could only take in 25 percent of the oxygen he was trying to breathe, and he called an ambulance.\n\nHe asked not to be intubated but to be given oxygen instead, and within a few days started responding to the oxygen and medications he was taking for lung infections that came along with the virus.\n\nOn Wednesday night, he was downgraded from critical condition.\n\nHe has tested negative for COVID-19 four times, but said that's not surprising since he waited a while to go to the hospital -- so the virus may not be detectable -- and the \"tests are far and away not 100 percent accurate.\"\n\nFair, a runner, who said he was at \"the peak of health in my life\" had a warning for healthy, younger people who might feel invincible against coronavirus: \"If it can take me down it can take anybody down.\"\n\n\"You don't want have it, that's all I have to tell you, Fair said. And \"you don't want to spread it on to anyone that is at any point at a high risk because you know looking at me, healthy and exercising and all of that, I can't imagine being someone with a high-risk condition.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- To some, Thomas Harvey may have come across as macho. But for those who knew him best, it was his quirks and idiosyncrasies that stood out.\n\nLike the fact that he used to build miniature trucks or liked electronic music, as well as reggae. Or else, it was that time he turned up to a party wearing a kilt.\n\n\"I'd never ever in my lifetime seen a black man wear a kilt to a party,\" his sister, Sonia, told NBC News by phone. \"When I saw him, I said, 'Bloody hell, it could only be Tommy.'\"\n\nThat was the thing about Harvey. He could light up a room.\n\nAlways the first up dancing and cracking jokes. And in quieter moments, the person to whom his family felt they could turn -- a ready ear for whoever might need it.\n\nOn March 29, Harvey, 57, a health care assistant at Goodmayes Hospital in London, died at home after having suffered from coronavirus-related symptoms for 18 days. He left behind his wife, Marcia, a care worker at a home for the elderly, and seven children, ages 11 to 32.\n\nHarvey's family said they called the emergency services three times over the course of his worsening illness, but he was never taken to a hospital or officially tested despite being told by paramedics that he likely had the disease.\n\nAs he neared the end, his 19-year-old daughter, Tamira, said she could hear him downstairs, from her bedroom upstairs, as he struggled to breathe. On the day he died, his family had to kick, punch and stab their way through the door of the bathroom where he had collapsed.\n\nBehind the news last month that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was released from a London hospital where he was treated for coronavirus -- and where, he says, his time in intensive care saved his life -- are the stories of those who didn't make it.\n\nSome say their loved ones died because the country wasn't locked down soon enough, which allowed the infection to spread more widely -- the decision on timing having been made by Johnson's government.\n\nFrom a lack of testing to shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers, Harvey's daughter, like thousands of others bereaved by the coronavirus, said her family was frustrated by the British government's apparent lack of preparedness.\n\nAs of Thursday 901,905 tests for coronavirus have been carried out in the U.K., according to U.K. government figures, with 171,253 people found positive.\n\nBritain's government pledged to undertake 100,000 tests per day by the end of April but it was touch and go Friday whether the target would be met. The government has come under criticism for a slow and patchy rollout of tests, citing huge international demand for materials such as swabs and chemical reagents.\n\n\"Given that finite capacity, we've had to prioritize,\" the health minister, Matt Hancock, said in a report published in April. \"My overriding goal is to protect life and I stand by that decision.\"\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nCurrently, tests are mostly being given to hospitalized patients suspected of having the virus, as well as front-line health and social care workers and their families and other essential workers, according to the government.\n\nAs of Thursday 48 regional testing sites, 21 satellite testing sites and 50 mobile testing units were also in operation across the country. But thousands of ordinary people with corona-like symptoms are frustrated at not being able to establish definitively whether or not they carry the virus.\n\nA month after his death, Harvey's family had yet to receive his death certificate, however, Tamira, said the coroner had told the family he had died of COVID-19.\n\nThis week, the government announced a scheme to financially compensate families of those who die from the coronavirus in the course of front-line work, with each to receive a payment of around 60,000 pounds ($74,600).\n\nSo far 85 NHS staff and 23 care worker deaths have been reported in England, as of Wednesday, according to the government, which this week said the country had overcome the peak of the crisis.\n\n\"Nothing can make up for the tragic loss of a loved one during this pandemic. We owe a huge debt to those who die in service to our nation and are doing everything we can to protect them,\" Hancock said in a statement.\n\nThe grim U.K. coronavirus death toll breached 26,700 people Thursday. Figures included for the first time this week those who died while hospitalized and elsewhere such as in nursing homes.\n\nThe latest figures make Britain's death toll among the highest in Europe.\n\nOther European capitals are beginning to ease social restrictions, with countries such as Germany thought to owe a relatively low death toll to massive national testing programs.\n\nThose perhaps most at risk in Britain, as elsewhere, are front-line workers.\n\nIn the weeks before his death, Tamira said, Harvey was concerned about the quality of his PPE at the hospital where he worked, in the northeast of the city.\n\n\"He more so expressed that to my mother, so that we wouldn't worry,\" Tamira said referring to herself and her siblings. \"But he did just say that everything was sort of flimsy and not intact, low-quality plastic aprons. ... Everything just wasn't up to standard in a sense.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the North East London NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital where Harvey worked, said it was following national PPE guidelines and that at the time he went off sick, there were no symptomatic patients in the ward.\n\n\"Thomas was a longstanding dedicated member of our intermediate care team. This is a huge loss to both NELFT and the wider NHS,\" the trust's chief executive, Oliver Shanley, said in a statement, referring to Britain's beloved National Health Service.\n\nTamira said her family was frustrated with the government for not being prepared and not having enough protective equipment for those on the front line.\n\n\"We're not only pushing for our dad but we're pushing for everybody else who is still on the front line, and essential workers within society,\" she said.\n\nThe apparent lack of protective equipment has also become a source of concern for the public, with the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warning last month that NHS staff had reported \"dangerously low levels\" of PPE, putting medics and patients increasingly in harm's way. Meanwhile, some hospital workers protested Tuesday against inadequate PPE supplies.\n\nA spokesperson for Britain's Department of Health and Social care told NBC News it was \"working around the clock\" to support health and social care workers with the equipment they needed to tackle the virus. Last week, it also announced a plan to widen testing to include the families of essential workers in England, who are showing coronavirus symptoms.\n\n\"Since the start of the outbreak, we've delivered over 1 billion pieces of PPE to the frontline and have published clear guidance setting out the safest levels of PPE to protect healthcare workers in different settings, in line with WHO advice,\" a spokesperson for the department said by email, referring to the World Health Organization.\n\n\"We are working hard to increase testing capacity and have now tested over 170,000 essential workers or members of their household.\"\n\nAway from hospitals, Britain's nursing homes have long felt underfunded and overlooked; and the pandemic appears to have only exacerbated this sense of neglect.\n\n\"I am bitter,\" said Elys Poppy, who lost her 96-year-old grandmother, Barbara Wells, to suspected coronavirus on April 13. \"I think the elderly are taking the brunt force and my personal opinion would be that, yeah, the government thinks that's fine.\"\n\nHer grandmother was one of 17 residents of the Stanley Park Care Home in northeast England to die after displaying symptoms of the virus since the outbreak began, making it one of the worst-affected care facilities in the country.\n\nFew residents have been officially tested for the virus, according to the care home, leaving grieving families with unanswered questions. The government has recently promised to test social care workers and residents in care homes, whether or not they show symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\"It's absolutely crazy. No one could get tested,\" Poppy said. \"In fact, Grandma still hasn't been tested. On her death certificate is 'suspected Covid-19' because the government aren't doing anything with them -- they are forgotten.\"\n\nPoppy's anger is not directed at the staff, whom she hails as \"angels\" for the love they showed her grandmother in her final hours, but rather at the Conservative lawmakers whom she accuses of abandoning the vulnerable residents and those -- often on the lowest wages -- who look after them.\n\n\"They are completely second class as far as the government is concerned,\" she said, criticizing the lack of PPE offered to front-line carers.\n\n\"The NHS workers, they're getting a lot of press at the moment and that's excellent and I'm chuffed to bits for them. But what the government have to realize is that care workers are equally as important. I'm sure they feel second class, but not in my eyes.\"\n\nOther families bereaved by COVID-19 also feel frustrated at both the governmental and the public response to the pandemic.\n\nNeil Hames' 75-year-old father, Walter, known as Wally, died of the coronavirus March 22 in a hospital in Birmingham, one of the U.K.'s largest cities.\n\nWatching his father from a distance rushed into an ambulance, struggling to breathe, Hames didn't know it would be the last time he'd ever see him.\n\nHames, 48, said he was angry at the \"slow\" implementation of lockdown measures by the government and at those still recklessly defying the bans.\n\n\"This virus doesn't transport itself,\" he said. \"It's moved by people, and these people are making horrendous decisions to go and socialize.\"\n\nHe said that while he had been a Johnson supporter, he now believed the government had wasted critical time in shutting down the country.\n\n\"If we went into lockdown quickly, people didn't need to die,\" he said as he cried on the phone. \"I do think the government got this wrong and it probably has cost my dad his life.\"\n\nHames said he hoped Johnson's personal battle with the virus would \"open his eyes\" to the urgency of getting the right equipment, from ventilators to masks, to those who need it the most.\n\nMeanwhile, questions about whether his father would have survived had he been taken to the hospital sooner play on his mind.\n\nFollowing national guidelines, Walter Hames called emergency health hotlines on multiple occasions, his son said, each time being advised to stay home and told he would not be tested, as the tests were primarily reserved for those admitted to hospital.\n\nAfter several days, his breathing deteriorated and he was rushed to the emergency room, dying two hours after arrival -- and one day before his wife's birthday.\n\nNHS England said they could not comment but a spokesperson for the West Midlands Ambulance Service said the trust had launched an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the care provided to him.\n\n\"We would like to pass on our deepest condolences to his family at such a sad time,\" the service added.\n\nHames attended his father's funeral, with only six people allowed. He traveled in a car separate from his mother and sister, and they were forced to stand apart at the cremation -- in keeping with social distancing rules to limit the transmission of the virus.\n\n\"I can't even give my mum a hug. I have to stand and keep my distance,\" Hames said the day before the funeral. \"It's the most horrendous of situations.\"\n\nThe niggling question -- 'what if' -- is familiar to Harvey's daughter, Tamira, as well.\n\nShe said part of her felt that the National Health Service -- the organization under whose umbrella her father worked for 20 years -- had let him down to some extent.\n\n\"I understand the workload they're currently facing, but in a sense, I feel his death could have been prevented,\" she said.\n\nThe first time paramedics came to the house March 22, Tamira said, they diagnosed her father with the virus but did not test him and told the family to self-isolate at home.\n\nThe second time the family called, on March 26, she said they were told to follow guidelines on the health service website.\n\nThe third time they called March 29, the paramedics who arrived and tried to save her father's life instead pronounced him dead.\n\nThe London Ambulance Service confirmed they had sent a crew to an address in Shoreditch on March 22 and then again March 29, the latter in response to reports that the same patient was in cardiac arrest.\n\nThey said they did not have a record of another call, on March 26, but were checking other triaging systems to try and track it.\n\n\"Sadly, despite the best efforts of our staff, the patient died at the scene,\" a spokesperson for the service said of the March 29 call.\n\n\"One of the paramedics came upstairs and I remember the exact words, I'll never forget,\" Tamira recalled.\n\n\"He said, 'the virus has got him and we're going to have to stop.'\"",

    "Why are viruses hard to kill? Virologists explain why these tiny parasites are so tough to treat": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The virus that causes COVID-19 seen under an electron microscope.National Institutes of Health / AFP - Getty Images\n\nViruses are among the biggest threats to humanity, with the current pandemic showing how these pathogens can shut down countries, halt entire industries and cause untold human suffering as they spread through communities.\n\nViruses have also evolved in such a way that they are difficult to kill. What makes them, including the novel coronavirus, so tricky to cure?\n\nPart of the problem is the nature of viruses themselves, which exist like freeloading zombies -- not quite dead, yet certainly not alive.\n\n\"Viruses don't really do anything -- they're effectively inert until they come into contact with a host cell,\" said Derek Gatherer, a virologist at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom. \"But as soon as that happens, they switch on and come to life.\"\n\nThe odd makeup of these infectious agents is part of what makes them difficult to defeat. Compared to other pathogens, such as bacteria, viruses are minuscule. And since they have none of the hallmarks of living things -- a metabolism or the ability to reproduce on their own, for example -- they are harder to target with drugs.\n\n\"The fact that they are not alive means they don't have to play by the same rules that living things play by,\" said Britt Glaunsinger, a virologist at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nAntibiotics, which are used to fight bacterial infections, attack the bacteria's cell wall, block protein production and stop bacteria from reproducing. But these drugs aren't effective against viral infections, because viruses don't carry out any of these processes on their own. Rather, viruses need to invade and take over host cells in order to replicate.\n\nBut a virus can't break into just any cell in the human body. Instead, one of its proteins will bind to another protein -- akin to a key fitting into a lock -- that then allows the virus to hijack certain cells. With this outbreak, the coronavirus' so-called spike protein primarily fits \"locks\" that are present on lung cells, which is why COVID-19, the disease it causes, is a respiratory illness.\n\nOnce the invasion takes place, the cell is essentially transformed into a factory that churns out hundreds and hundreds of copies of the virus, based on instructions encoded in its genetic material -- RNA, or ribonucleic acid, in the case of the coronavirus.\n\n\"It basically acts like a thief inside the cell, stealing all of the cellular machinery and repurposing those machines to make more of the virus,\" Glaunsinger said.\n\nThe human body has evolved defense systems to protect against these kinds of infections.\n\nFirst, cells have a built-in alarm system to detect viral invaders. The presence of an intruder triggers what's known as an innate immune response, which can involve the host cell releasing a protein that attempts to interfere with the virus' replication or can involve the immune system attempting to shut down the compromised cells.\n\nBut, sometimes, these defense mechanisms are not enough.\n\n\"Occasionally if you have a high dose of virus, or if a virus has found ways to evade these protective measures, then this innate response can call in reinforcements,\" said Charles Rice, head of the Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease at Rockefeller University in New York City.\n\nThe work of these reinforcements to try to defeat the virus is typically what causes the symptoms of a viral infection -- in other words, it's at this point in the process when a person may come down with a fever and start to physically feel sick.\n\nBut viruses are sneaky, Glaunsinger said, and are often able to fly under the radar and cause a lot of damage before any alarms are triggered and any reinforcements are called in. By the time an immune response kicks in, it's often too late.\n\n\"At that point, the virus has already been amplifying, it has already been transmitted from that person to other people and nobody feels terrible yet,\" she said.\n\nWhen the immune system is finally triggered, it can also kick into overdrive, causing what's called a cytokine storm, which is thought to be the root of some of the most severe coronavirus cases.\n\n\"There's a lot of data coming out that some of the damage might be due to a very strong and brisk immune response, where the body is fighting back and sort of throwing everything it has at the virus,\" said Dr. Adam Lauring, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. \"While that may control the virus, it also causes a lot of damage to the lungs.\"\n\nThis extreme immune response can worsen pneumonia and cause severe inflammation in the sickest patients, according to Gatherer.\n\nThe ability of a virus to evade detection in the human body is another reason why it is difficult to treat with medications.\n\n\"The earlier you take the drugs, the better, but by the time someone comes into a clinic, there's already been a lot of growth of the virus, so drugs may slow the virus down, but it may be too late to stop the damage at that point,\" Lauring said.\n\nBut antiviral drugs are also challenging to develop, because they need to work very specifically to combat certain viruses. This is different from antibiotics. which can be used to treat a variety of bacterial infections.\n\n\"The features that antibiotics target -- the cell wall or the protective coating of bacteria -- those things are the same for many different types of bacteria,\" Glaunsinger said. \"That's why you can generate a drug like penicillin that doesn't work against one bacteria, but many.\"\n\nBut because viruses hijack human cells, antiviral drugs can't readily target those same features without doing even more damage to the host. Viruses are also more varied, so even pathogens that are closely related -- such as the current coronavirus and the coronavirus that causes SARS -- don't necessarily respond to the same treatments. Similarly, drugs that are used to treat the herpes simplex virus aren't effective against other herpes viruses.\n\nAnd because viruses have different \"keys\" to break into cells, there are fewer common targets for drugs to block infections.\n\n\"There isn't a common Achilles' heel for all of these viruses,\" Rice said. \"Viruses are just too different.\"\n\nEven where antiviral drugs are available for some viruses, they don't necessarily cure the infection. Drugs used to treat HIV, for instance, are effective at suppressing virus replication, but don't eradicate it. Seasonal influenza can be treated with an antiviral medication called Tamiflu, which can help shorten the duration of the illness, but it's common to be able to detect the virus even after a patient recovers, Lauring said.\n\nPerhaps the only virus that can truly be cured by drugs is Hepatitis C, according to Rice, resulting in the virus being completely eradicated after treatment.\n\nThe resilience of viruses is what has made them such a menace throughout history, ranging from flu pandemics to outbreaks of Ebola. And their ability to rapidly evolve, combined with the challenges of developing treatments and cures, will ensure they remain a significant threat.\n\n\"Viruses just want to make more of themselves and find new hosts to infect,\" Lauring said. \"It's truly survival of the fittest.\"",

    "Why so many people are experiencing weird pandemic dreams": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "People around the world may be physically separated in pandemic lockdowns, but they are joined in at least one way -- many are experiencing vivid and bizarre coronavirus dreams.\n\nNighttime visions of bugs, natural disasters and difficulties breathing are just a few of the recurring themes, traded in countless Zoom get-togethers, WhatsApp conversations and on social media, as \"quarandreams\" spread as quickly as the pandemic itself.\n\nFlorida-based dream analyst Lauri Loewenberg, who uses psychology to interpret people's dreams, says lockdown stress, job and relationship worries and the sudden loss of familiar comforts have triggered a wave of surreal overnight encounters. Since the beginning of the lockdowns, she has found her Facebook inbox full of requests for appointments from people wanting to talk through their experiences.\n\nNot only are people reporting more vivid dreams, but they are also recalling them in more detail and they are lasting longer, Loewenberg says, likening them to \"feature length films.\"\n\n\"A lot of people are also having dreams about hands,\" she notes. \"They fall off, skin comes off them, they don't work.\" It's a vision with a simple explanation. \"We're afraid to touch anything. If you touch something, you could kill someone.\"\n\nWhile for many, these dreams are little more than conversation fodder between friends, for others the consequences could be serious. In an ongoing survey for the general public, Dr. Deirdre Barrett, a psychologist at Harvard University has been collecting thousands of dream case studies since widespread lockdowns began.\n\n\"I collected dreams after 9/11 and I am seeing very similar patterns now,\" she said.\n\nFrontline doctors, nurses and first responders \"absolutely look like a group of people who are in an acute trauma situation.\"\n\n\"Their most typical dream is that they're trying to take care of a patient. It's their responsibility to save their life. And they're failing,\" Barrett said.\n\nOverloaded wards, shortages of equipment or equipment failures are common themes. \"They are trying to get a tube down the throat of someone whose passages are so constricted that they're not getting it down. Then the ventilator machine stops working.\"\n\nBarrett estimates that up to 30 percent could develop symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, with nightmares, flashbacks, anxiety and difficulty sleeping.\n\nPsychological trauma in the wake of outbreaks is well-documented. The World Health Organization noted that the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa resulted in \"profound psychosocial implications at individual, community and international levels.\"\n\nFull coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\nLauren Bateman, a humanitarian worker during the Ebola outbreak, developed PTSD upon her return to the United States from Guinea in 2014. Her task was a demanding and dark one, collecting data of all the burials that had taken place across the country, numbers she couldn't stop tracking even after she was home.\n\nShe suffered from sleeplessness, panic attacks and nightmares, ranging from \"lines of people asking me for data I couldn't get,\" to \"having to put on the PPE and just feeling how hot and oppressive it was,\" Bateman said.\n\n\"You weren't allowed to touch people in West Africa, so for months when people would want to shake my hand, I would sort of take a step back,\" she added.\n\nAt the time, few could relate to it. Many in America had yet to experience the anxiety that breeds in the midst of a serious outbreak.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak\n\n\"I probably got a reputation of someone who was kind of odd,\" she said.\n\nNow, as the coronavirus pandemic continues, Bateman says her nightmares have come back. The difference now is, she has many more people to talk to about them. And she can offer advice.\n\n\"Years ago, when I started working in disaster response, I worked for a mental health professional,\" she explains. \"He had a great line I keep repeating to myself: for the most part what we are experiencing are normal reactions to abnormal events.\"",

    "Why some nurses have quit during coronavirus pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A nurse performs tests on a possible COVID-19 patient inside a tent on the grounds of the Sophiahemmet private hospital in Stockholm on April 22, 2020.Jonathan Nackstrand / AFP - Getty Images\n\nFor weeks, Kelly Stanton wasn't sleeping. She lay in bed gripped with the anxiety of having to go to work at a Washington, D.C.-area hospital not knowing if she might bring home the coronavirus to her husband and their three children.\n\nIt was inevitable, she thought. She wasn't protected.\n\nStanton, a veteran nurse of 28 years, had seen federal safety protocols for health care workers begin to crumble amid the global pandemic by early March.\n\nGuidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding personal protective equipment, or PPEs, changed consistently. At Stanton's hospital, nurses were told they would have limited access to an already low stockpile of PPEs and were being asked to reuse single-use masks multiple times, she said.\n\n\"Never in my time as a nurse have I seen this,\" she said. \"It was a position I could never have imagined I'd be in, even in my wildest dreams.\"\n\nEach time a safety regulation changed, she says she began to feel more like \"a sheep sent to slaughter\" than a front-line nurse, and started agonizing between her job and her family.\n\nBy late March, the risks weighed too heavy and Stanton submitted her resignation.\n\n\"It was an extremely difficult decision, but as a mother and wife, the health of my family will always come first. In the end, I could not accept that I could be responsible for causing one of my family members to become severely ill or possibly die.\"\n\nAs COVID-19 has infected more than one million Americans, nurses working on the front lines of the pandemic with little protective support have made the gut-wrenching decision to step away from their jobs, saying they were ill-equipped and unable to fight the disease and feared not only for their own safety but also for that of their families.\n\nMany of these nurses, who have faced backlash for quitting, say new CDC protocols have made them feel expendable and have not kept their safety in mind, leaving them no choice but to walk away from a job they loved.\n\n'We're not cannon fodder, we're human beings'\n\nAs the nation took stock of its dwindling medical supplies in the early days of the pandemic, CDC guidance regarding personal protective equipment quickly took a back seat.\n\nN95 masks, which had previously been the acceptable standard of protective care for both patients and medical personnel, were depleting so commercial grade masks, surgical masks, and in the most extreme cases homemade masks such as scarves and bandanas were all sanctioned by the CDC -- which did not return a request for comment -- to counter the lacking resources.\n\nNurses, among other health care workers, were expected to pivot and adapt with no evidence that new guidelines would provide any significant protection from a novel and contagious disease.\n\n\"Things they were telling us we had to now do, you would've been fired if we did that three weeks before,\" Stanton said. \"How is this suddenly OK?\"\n\nThere had been warning that a pandemic was coming, she said. \"Hospital administrators, states and the federal government should have stockpiled PPEs. All three failed.\"\n\nCOVID-19 patients had only slowly started trickling in, but Stanton could see where things would head. It was almost guaranteed that nurses would be at risk under those conditions, she said.\n\n\"We're not cannon fodder, we're human beings.\"\n\nIn many respects, nurses who have had to treat COVID-19 patients with little or no protection, especially in the early days of the pandemic, have become collateral damage.\n\nNearly 10,000 health care workers on the front lines, including nurses, have tested positive for the virus, according to a preliminary survey by the CDC conducted from February to April.\n\nSince data collection has been slow and not comprehensive, and many people with COVID-19 have been asymptomatic, actual numbers are likely much higher.\n\nAt least 79 nurses have died from the coronavirus, the American Nurses Association, which has been independently tracking reports, said Thursday.\n\n\"There are huge ethical dilemmas that nurses are now facing,\" Liz Stokes, the director of the American Nurses Association Center for Ethics and Human Rights, said.\n\n\"Just imagine having to make decisions every day on whether you're going to fulfill your professional obligation to care for patients versus sacrificing your personal safety or even that of your family because you're in a situation where you don't have adequate resources.\"\n\nNurses have a duty to their patients but they also have a duty to themselves under the nursing code of ethics, Stokes said.These are equal obligations, and if you feel morally torn you have to make the decision that's right for you, she said.\n\nStokes adds that it's important to also be thankful to the nurses who have made the decision to step away because they recognized they were not in the best situation physically or mentally to provide care.\n\n'No, we didn't sign up for this'\n\nFor Rebecca, a nurse in the Albuquerque, New Mexico, area who didn't want her full name used for fear that she won't be rehired in the future, the writing was on the wall when she saw a member of her hospital management collect all N95 masks from her floor and lock them in a cabinet in early March, before the country went into full-blown crisis.\n\n\"It's really demoralizing to see someone lock them up in front of you knowing that you might need one of those,\" she said. \"The whole scene was very symbolic of how all this was going to go down. And it was a bad sign for what's to come.\"\n\nRebecca, who had been a nurse for four years, said communication and infrastructure at her hospital began to break down fairly quickly after that and nurses were expected to make terrible compromises.\n\nMasks were rationed to one per week and sometimes shared between personnel. Only nurses who dealt with patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were given an extra N95 mask, even if the patient showed symptoms.\n\nDuring the course of one 16-hour shift, Rebecca was repeatedly in close contact with a patient who later tested positive -- and she wasn't wearing a mask.\n\n\"I knew it was something I could no longer handle,\" she said. \"I know my limitations.\"\n\nRebecca quit in mid-April, one week after testing negative for COVID-19 after exposure to that patient.\n\nSince quitting, she has been sensitive to the criticism many nurses like her have faced for stepping away during a pandemic. That's why many of them have kept their decisions private, she said.\n\nIt's especially hurtful when she reads comments on social media that nurses should not raise complaints because they \"signed up for this.\"\n\n\"We didn't sign up to be sacrificial lambs. We didn't sign up to fight a deadly disease without adequate resources.\"\n\n\"We're told we're soldiers. Well, you don't send soldiers to war without a gun and expect them to do their job, but you are doing that to us.\"\n\nThe sentiments have been shared by thousands of other nurses who feel they are also being put in dangerous environments.\n\nLast month, the New York State Nurses Association representing more than 3,000 nurses filed three lawsuits against the New York State Department of Health and two hospitals over the health and safety of nurses treating COVID-19 patients.\n\nAmong other things, the lawsuits call out the state for not providing appropriate PPEs for nurses, not properly training nurses deployed from hospital units, and inadequate provision of safe working conditions for high-risk employees.\n\nWhile the health department declined TO comment directly on the lawsuit, it did say it was \"deeply grateful for the ongoing efforts of New York's health care workers to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by testing people who may be infected and treating those who are most in need.\"\n\nQuitting has been on the minds of many nurses, said Cara Lunsford, a nurse and founder of Holliblu, an online community for nurses.\n\nAccording to a survey conducted by Holliblu, 62 percent of over 1,000 respondents said they are planning to either quit their jobs or the profession altogether.\n\n\"They didn't sign up to go into work and be unprotected from an invisible enemy, and the pressure is really starting to mount for a lot of nurses,\" Lunsford said.\n\nThis is an unprecedented time, and nurses were not trained to be soldiers or handle biological threats with little protection and resources, she said. And if they leave for their sanity or safety, they should not be treated as defectors.\n\nConstantly being anointed a \"hero\" by the public has also not helped the added pressure, Rebecca said. While it's a nice gesture, it gives the connotation that you should be risking yourself without help, and if you don't you're a \"coward.\"\n\nShe added that several colleagues reached out to her about wanting to quit after she left, but many just don't have the option.\n\n\"I've realized that I'm very fortunate that I had a choice,\" she said. \"A lot of nurses have student loans, car loans, and they are single parents. They can't quit, and that bothers me because they are being taken advantage of right now.\"\n\n'It was one of the most difficult decisions of my life'\n\nKate, who didn't want her full name used for privacy, quit her job at a Virginia hospital in April after she was pulled from her floor as a post-anesthesia care unit nurse and reassigned to critical care after only four hours of training.\n\nThroughout her hospital, PPEs were siphoned for COVID-19-positive patients, but with testing not fully widespread she never knew if someone was infected, and worse she didn't know if she was bringing it home.\n\nKate would go directly to the attic and quarantine away from her husband and children after getting home from work. But the emotional toll was high and she could no longer be away from her 1- and 3-year-old children.\n\nShe knew she had to walk away from her job.\n\nWhile putting her family first has got her through the painful decision, she still feels tremendous guilt for leaving.\n\n\"It's not just a job, it's a calling, and to walk away from it is extremely difficult and painful.\" she said. \"I wish I could have stayed with my patients. It's not like I didn't want to be there.\"\n\nHad masks been available and pre-pandemic precautions preserved, \"without a doubt I'd still be working,\" Kate said.\n\n\"One of the issues that we are trying to emphasize is that nurses must be supported in whatever decision they make whether they take the risk or choose not to take the risk to protect families,\" Stokes of the American Nurses Association said.\n\n\"It's a heart-wrenching decision and many nurses have expressed that they feel sadness and sorrow that they are leaving their colleagues and patients. It's a difficult decision and that in itself can be emotionally traumatic.\"\n\nStokes believes that the psychological consequences of putting nurses in these dilemmas amid a pandemic are going to be profound and long lasting. She predicts high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder and secondary trauma syndrome trailing the pandemic.\n\n\"Nurses were already burned out before, and this pandemic might push many of them completely out,\" she said.\n\nThe mental health toll on medical workers was put into sobering perspective after New York City emergency room doctor Lorna Breen died by suicide. A hotline created by physicians to help doctors deal with the anxiety of combating the coronavirus crisis said it averages up to 20 calls a day. Another hotline, For The Frontlines, has also been set up as a 24-hour resource for other health care and essential workers.\n\n\"I would anticipate increased apprehension possibly extending into anxiety or mood problems,\" said psychiatrist Sheetal Marri, referring not only to nurses who continued to work but those who stepped back. \"These effects will impact the way nurses and other health care professionals will deal with workplace health hazards even after this pandemic is over.\"\n\nStanton said she would like to return to nursing, but only once guidelines are restored and she can feel safe going to work again. While she is taking this time to focus on her family, she still misses her job.\n\n\"I loved being a nurse. You do it because you care, you want to help people,\" she said. \" But right now, nurses don't feel like heroes, we feel expendable.\"",

    "Will oil's price slump be worse for the economy than the effects of the coronavirus?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Workers secure drilling pipe sections on an oil drilling tower near Almetyevsk, Russia, on July 31, 2015.Andrey Rudakov / Bloomberg via Getty Images file\n\nThe prospect of cheaper gas at a time when most Americans are holed up at home is not much of a silver lining to the coronavirus pandemic. Energy analysts say there is little upside to the unprecedented plunge in oil prices that sent crude oil futures spiraling into negative territory on Monday, spooking Wall Street.\n\nPatrick DeHaan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, predicted that the national average gas price could drop below $1.50 a gallon in the coming weeks, noting that a few states have already hit this benchmark. But he said drivers shouldn't expect to see gas fall as sharply as crude prices. \"Unfortunately for motorists, it may not fully make it to the pump, given that stations are trying to keep the doors open -- even with volume down 50 to 70 percent,\" he said.\n\nAnalysts also note that the concept of \"negative oil,\" as President Donald Trump referred to it in a news briefing on Monday, is more theoretical than actual. Although it suggests that a seller would have to pay a buyer to physically take a shipment of oil, it is largely a \"paper transaction\" by the financial instruments that hold oil futures contracts.\n\nPaper or not, prices tumbling into negative territory is a symptom of a very real problem: With demand for everything from gasoline to jet fuel plummeting, producers are literally running out of places to store oil once it leaves the ground.\n\nTrump on Monday floated the idea of solving that problem by purchasing roughly 75 million barrels of oil, the spare capacity in the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as well as banning imports of Saudi Arabian oil. Neither is likely to be terribly effective, analysts say.\n\n\"Refineries are set up to handle specific slates of crude. You can't simply disallow Saudi oil and replace it with American oil,\" said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. Oil has variations in density and sulfur content, and refineries can't process the kind of oil extracted from American soil.\n\n\"Putting a tariff on Saudi crude would do nothing to address the underlying problem,\" said Jim Burkhard, vice president and head of oil markets research at IHS Market. \"A tariff will not conjure up demand growth.\"\n\n\"It's not a terrible idea to fill the SPR with prices where they are, but there is a limit,\" Glickman said.\n\nGlickman said American oil producers need prices of at least $20 a barrel just to cover day-to-day operations. For the industry to make money in the longer term, including investing in exploration and equipment, prices need to be roughly double that.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nIf prices don't regain stability, analysts' biggest fear is that the U.S. energy sector won't be able to bounce back. \"The longer oil remains this low, the more risk there is that when demand rebounds, oil production won't,\" DeHaan said.\n\nMichael Moebs, CEO and economist at financial consulting firm Moebs Services, said plummeting oil prices could drive interest rates -- already at historic lows -- down even further, a prospect that could have negative implications for banks and destabilize financial markets already shaken by the coronavirus pandemic. \"It would be a double-whammy. We see COVID causing a problem... But that's going to pass,\" he said.\n\nBy comparison, the hangover from the oil crash could linger well into 2021.\n\n\"Oil and gas investment has grown to be a large and important source of U.S. business investment and employment over the past 10 to 15 years, so the decline in prices and falling investment will have a negative impact on the U.S. economy,\" Burkhard said.\n\nAlthough jobs in energy will be the first dominos to fall -- especially smaller producers who don't have the financial cushion to withstand a sustained downturn -- they won't be the last, said Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor.\n\n\"There also will be spillover effects to businesses that service those industries, everything from car sales to retail spending to real estate,\" he said.\n\n\"It's not just drilling wells and producers, it's everything that goes downstream... pipelines, refineries, petrochemicals, oil field services,\" said Peter McNally, global energy sector lead at investment and research firm Third Bridge.\n\n\"There are much broader economic implications this time. It's not just oil seeing demand drop -- it's pretty much every industry,\" McNally said.\n\n\"Employment in the oil industry is probably going to stay under pressure until we start to see futures prices go above $40 a barrel, and we don't see that,\" Glickman said.\n\n\"On a net basis, this is pretty atrocious for the U.S. economy,\" he said.",
