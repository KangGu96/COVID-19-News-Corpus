        "body": "When the Krewe of Zulu parade rolled out onto Jackson Avenue to kick off Mardi Gras festivities on Feb. 25, the party started for black New Orleans. Tens of thousands of people lined the four-and-a-half-mile route, reveling in the animated succession of jazz musicians, high-stepping marching bands from historically black colleges and universities and loose-limbed dancers dressed in Zulu costumes, complete with grass skirts and blackface makeup, an homage to the Zulu people of South Africa and, for some, a satirical spit in the eye to the past, when Mardi Gras was put on by clubs of white men who barred black people from taking part.\n\nThough some black critics have chided the Zulus for continuing to \"black up,\" their costumes and traditions are a way of reclaiming and redeploying the most toxic stereotypes of black Americans. Founded in 1909, the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club is a brotherhood of some 800 men, nearly all of them black, known for community service, civic pride, black excellence and that Mardi Gras parade. And so on that late February day, as people stood shoulder to shoulder and several feet deep, hoping to catch a painted coconut, the \"throw\" that is the Zulu parade's signature and coveted prize, no one had any idea that this joyous gathering would turn out to be a coronavirus hothouse.\n\nFor the Zulu club, the Carnival season involves a series of meticulously planned and eagerly awaited ceremonies, balls and festivals, almost every day in January and February. The Zulu Ball, one of the group's three grand-scale, marquee events, fell on Friday, Feb. 21, this year. Some 20,000 people, floor-length ball gowns and tuxedos required, packed into the New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center -- one of the few venues large enough to hold the crowd that came to eat and drink and dance and witness the crowning of the Zulu King and Queen of Mardi Gras. At the parade, the king, elected by club members, wears a golden crown and an elaborate festoon of feathers. He rides on a float, waving a glittery scepter at the crowd, flanked by two hand-painted leopards rearing up on their hind legs.\n\nAs Mardi Gras festivities began, bringing over a million visitors from around the world streaming into the warm, welcoming city to celebrate face to face and elbow to elbow with local residents in a progression of street parties and parades, dozens of coronavirus cases had already been documented in China, which reported its first death on Jan. 11. On Jan. 20, the first known case was confirmed in the United States: a Washington State resident who had recently returned from Wuhan, China. Behind the scenes, Louisiana health administrators had begun discussing the growing situation, seeing it as low-risk, according to emails obtained by Columbia University's Brown Institute for Media Innovation.\n\nOn Feb. 5, four days after Surgeon General Jerome Adams tweeted, \"Roses are red/Violets are blue/Risk is low for #coronavirus/But high for the flu,\" New Orleans officials held a multiagency coronavirus planning meeting. The same day, a statement posted on the city's website read: \"Our public\u202fhealth and health care\u202fsystems are ready for Mardi Gras,\u202fand the coronavirus poses a very\u202flow risk to the Carnival celebrations.\" At the time, just 12 cases had been reported in the United States and none in Louisiana.\n\nOn Sunday, Feb. 23, two days after the Zulu Ball, President Trump set the tone for the country, the state of Louisiana and the city of New Orleans when he said at a news conference: \"We have it very much under control in the country.\" On Monday, Feb. 24, when an estimated 200,000 people spent the day at Lundi Gras, sponsored by the Zulu club, enjoying a smorgasbord of New Orleans food and music on three stages at Woldenberg Park along the Mississippi River, he reiterated on Twitter that the disease was \"under control.\" According to an internal memo, however, Trump had already been warned by his own trade adviser about the potential of half a million deaths and an economic hemorrhage of trillions of dollars as a result of the pandemic. According to reports, his health and human services director had alerted him twice about the possibility of a pandemic; the president accused him of being alarmist.\n\nThe day after Lundi Gras, the Zulu club member Cornell Charles -- everybody called him Dickey, a childhood nickname -- rose early and put on a honey yellow jacket, part of the group's signature uniform. As part of the Zulu Krewe parade organizing committee, he spent the next 10 hours fussing over the logistics of the exuberant, chaotic parade. Larry A. Hammond, 70, a former Zulu king and a club member, waved to the crowd from one of the many floats. On that same day, officials from the C.D.C. issued a far bleaker warning than any before about the spread of the virus in the United States, recommending social-distancing measures. Yet the president himself was still playing down the risk; that same day, while traveling in India, Trump said, \"We have very few people with it.\" The people who did have it, he said, \"are getting better, they're all getting better.\" The following day, he reassured the country that the number of confirmed cases \"within a couple of days is going to be down close to zero.\"\n\nMayor LaToya Cantrell of New Orleans stood on St. Charles Avenue during the Feb. 25 parade next to Jay H. Banks, chairman of the Zulu club's board, raising a glass and joyfully shouting, \"Hail Zulu!\" as the king passed by on his float. She would later defend not canceling the festivities. \"When it's not taken seriously at the federal level, it's very difficult to transcend down to the local level in making these decisions,\" Cantrell told CNN on March 26.\n\nOn March 9, the same day Louisiana reported its first presumptive case of Covid-19, Trump compared the virus to the flu on Twitter, and also tweeted: \"The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant.\"\n\nBanks, a city councilman who first became involved with the Zulu club as a boy, remembers the rush of panic he felt on March 16, when he saw a Facebook post about the first of his Zulu brothers to get sick, Dickey Charles, who was just 51. Written by the chaplain of the Zulu club, Jefferson Reese Sr., it read, \"Zulu Brother Cornell 'Dickey' Charles is very ill and in need of prayer. Amen\" followed by three brown praying-hands emojis. \"When I saw the post, I thought, Oh, man,\" Banks says. \"I knew we were going to have a problem.\" Eight weeks after Mardi Gras, at least 30 members of the club had been found to have Covid-19. Eight would be dead.\n\nBanks, who believes he knows at least 16 people who have died of the disease, says if he and the Zulu leadership had had the slightest clue that the pandemic was a direct danger, they would have canceled their events. \"The president was saying that this was not a big deal, and nobody in the federal government raised a red flag,\" Banks says. Gov. John Bel Edwards of Louisiana could have canceled the parade. But like Mayor Cantrell, he said he had little useful guidance from Washington. \"There was not one person at the state or its federal government, not at the C.D.C. or otherwise, who recommended canceling any event, not just Mardi Gras, but I don't think anywhere across the country,\" he told \"Face the Nation\" on March 29.\n\n\"Zulu is 800 men, predominantly black,\" Banks says. \"Like all black communities, we have a large contingent of people who have pre-existing conditions. Our members come from all walks of life, and many of them don't have jobs with sick days and don't have the luxury of working at home. When you add these factors to a disease that capitalizes on these kind of circumstances, you get a perfect storm.\"\n\nOn April 6, Louisiana became one of the first states to release Covid-19 data by race: While making up 33 percent of the population, African-Americans accounted for 70 percent of the dead at that point. Around the same time, other cities and states began to release racial data in the absence of even a whisper from the federal government -- where health data of all kinds is routinely categorized by race. Areas with large populations of black people were revealed to have disproportionate, devastating death rates. In Michigan, black people make up 14 percent of the population but 40 percent of the deaths. (All data was current as of press time.) In Wisconsin, black people are 7 percent of the population but 33 percent of the deaths. In Mississippi, black people are 38 percent of the population but 61 percent of the deaths. In Milwaukee, black people are 39 percent of the population but 71 percent of the deaths. In Chicago, black people are 30 percent of the population but 56 percent of the deaths. In New York, which has the country's highest numbers of confirmed cases and deaths, black people are twice as likely to die as white people. In Orleans Parish, black people make up 60 percent of the population but 70 percent of the dead. Data from the Louisiana Department of Health shows that neighborhoods in the parish with large numbers of black residents have been hit hardest.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has stripped bare the racial divide in the health of our nation. A complex and longstanding constellation of factors explains these higher death rates. On April 8, a C.D.C. study suggested that about 90 percent of the most serious Covid-19 cases involve underlying health conditions -- hypertension and cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, chronic lung disease -- that are more common and more deadly in black Americans and strike at younger ages. According to the C.D.C., the rate of diabetes is 66 percent higher in black Americans than in white Americans; the rate of hypertension is 49 percent higher. The average black life expectancy, from birth, is about 3.5 years lower than white life expectancy. In fact, the health outcomes of black Americans are by several measures on par with those of people in poorer countries with much less sophisticated medical systems and technology. And though these health disparities are certainly worsened by poverty, they are not erased by increased income and education. The elevated rates of these serious illnesses have weaponized the coronavirus to catastrophic effect in black America.\n\nEarl Benjamin-Robinson is deputy director of the Louisiana Department of Health's Office of Community Partnerships and Health Equity, created in 2019 to identify and target health disparities in vulnerable populations. \"When we first started hearing about Covid in China,\" he says, \"and learned that those who got severely ill and who subsequently died dealt with underlying conditions like hypertension, diabetes, lung disease and so on, I became concerned and kept in the forefront knowing that African-Americans in the U.S. and in our state are overrepresented when it comes to those conditions.\" Benjamin-Robinson, who lives in New Orleans, says he also had begun hearing rumors in the local community and on social media that black people were immune to the coronavirus, supposedly because melanin protected against it. These false theories became so rampant that on March 17, the day after the actor Idris Elba announced that he had tested positive for the disease, he posted a Twitter live video to denounce the rumors. \"There are so many stupid, ridiculous conspiracy theories about black people not being able to get it,\" he said. \"That's dumb, stupid.\"\n\n\"As public-health officials, we knew about the clear, distinct racial health disparities, as it relates to chronic illnesses in our state, in the early months,\" Benjamin-Robinson says. \"But in the absence of racial data and with no real sense of urgency coming from the federal government, we weren't able to put a plan in action to create targeted messaging and get information directly to African-Americans.\" After the release of racial data for Louisiana in early April, Benjamin-Robinson's office helped develop public-health promotional materials about Covid-19 specifically for black Louisianans, which were distributed via email and social media.\n\nOn March 27, Senators Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Cory Booker of New Jersey, and Representatives Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Robin Kelly of Illinois, all Democrats, sent a letter to Alex Azar, secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, urging the agency to reveal racial data on testing and treatment for the virus. \"Although Covid-19 does not discriminate along racial or ethnic lines, existing racial disparities and inequities in health outcomes and health care access may mean that the nation's response to preventing and mitigating its harms will not be felt equally in every community,\" the lawmakers wrote. \"Lack of information will exacerbate existing health disparities and result in the loss of lives in vulnerable communities.\"\n\nOn April 3, the American Medical Association, the professional organization that represents some 250,000 physicians, residents and medical students, also implored the Department of Health and Human Services to release coronavirus data by race. \"It is well documented that social and health inequities are longstanding and systemic disturbances to the wellness of marginalized, minoritized and medically underserved communities,\" read its letter, co-signed by organizations including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the National Medical Association. \"While Covid-19 has not created the circumstances that have brought about health inequities, it has and will continue to severely exacerbate existing and alarming social inequities along racial and ethnic lines.\"\n\nAmid this pressure from lawmakers, physicians, scientists and advocacy groups to release national Covid-19 statistics by race, on Wednesday, April 8, the C.D.C. put out a limited data set of 1,482 coronavirus patients hospitalized in 14 states. It indicated that despite making up 18 percent of those studied, black people accounted for a third of all severe cases.\n\nAt the daily White House press briefing the day before, President Trump, apparently aware of the C.D.C. numbers that were about to be released, asked Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who has served under six American presidents and is the most visible member of the White House coronavirus-response team, to address Covid-19 among black Americans. Dr. Fauci highlighted the underlying health conditions that are more common among black Americans and that raise the risk of death from Covid-19. \"We're very concerned about that,\" he said. \"It's very sad. There's nothing we can do about it right now, except to try and give them the best possible care to avoid those complications.\"\n\nTrump then referred to the racial statistics as \"very nasty numbers. Terrible numbers.\" As the news conference went on, the president expressed confusion about the disproportionate rates of infection. \"Why is it that the African-American community is so much, you know, numerous times more than everybody else?\" he asked.\n\nFifty years after the legislative and societal advances of the civil rights movement, America remains deeply segregated. Black people are more likely than white people to live in communities with high rates of poverty, where physical and social structures are crumbling, where opportunity is low and unemployment high. Even educated, affluent black people live in poorer neighborhoods, on average, than white people with working-class incomes.\n\nThe conditions in the social and physical environment where people live, work, attend school, play and pray have an outsize influence on health outcomes. Those in the public-health field call these conditions social determinants of health. Living in safe communities with adequate education and health care services, outdoor space, clean air and water, public transportation and affordable healthful food all contribute to lower rates of disease and longer, healthier lives. Living where the streets are unsafe and the air and water are polluted, where adequate health care facilities and outdoor space are lacking and where a dearth of healthful and affordable food creates a \"desert\" all leads to poorer health outcomes.\n\nAs scientists and policymakers have known since the 1980s, black and poor communities shoulder a disproportionate burden of the nation's pollution. Covid-19 typically attacks the lungs and is especially dangerous to those with existing respiratory conditions, and a paper released on April 5 by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that a majority of the conditions that increase the risk of death from Covid-19 are also affected by long-term exposure to air pollution. After analyzing over 3,000 U.S. counties, the researchers concluded that even a small increase in exposure to fine particulate matter -- tiny particles in the air -- leads to a significant increase in the Covid-19 death rate. Less than two weeks after the report was released, the Trump administration declined to impose stricter controls on the lung-corroding industrial matter that the Harvard researchers underlined as hazardous.\n\nNew Orleans is at the southeastern end of what has been called Cancer Alley, the 85-mile stretch of the Mississippi known for its concentration of polluting petrochemical manufacturers. \"As soon as I heard about Covid, I started getting nervous about the relationship between PM 2.5 and this virus,\" says Beverly Wright, the founder and executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice in New Orleans. PM 2.5 refers to the width of the airborne particles: 2.5 micrometers or less, a small fraction of the width of a human hair. \"We have long known that emissions coming from these facilities are very dangerous to the health of people who live nearby, and it is black people who live the closest. So I'm getting tired of being told our Covid death rates are only because we're obese or have diabetes or are eating badly, without any regard to the systematic harm pollution has caused us.\"\n\nThe accumulated effects of environmental inequality are compounded by the physiological ramifications of an atmosphere of bias and discrimination, which have been documented to lead to higher rates of poor health outcomes for black Americans. Dr. Arline Geronimus, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, termed this phenomenon \"weathering.\" The landmark research she and her colleagues published in 2006 pointed to early health deterioration, caused by stress that required high-effort coping, evident across multiple biological systems even when adjusted for poverty. The authors concluded that the lived experience of being black exacted a physical price on the bodies of African-Americans. Dr. Camara Phyllis Jones, a physician and epidemiologist and a former president of the American Public Health Association, describes this effect as \"accelerated aging.\" \"We have evidence that the wear and tear of racism, the stress of it, is responsible for the differences in health outcomes in the black population compared to the white population,\" Dr. Jones says. In a 2019 study comparing 71 individuals, 48 of them black, a team of U.C.L.A. scientists found evidence that racist experiences may lead to increased inflammation in black Americans, heightening the risk of serious illness including heart disease. In the study, published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, the scientists compared participants with similar socioeconomic backgrounds to rule out poverty as a determining factor in the changes in inflammation.\n\nThe societal discrimination that harms the bodies of those on the receiving end is also present in the health care system itself. In 2003, the National Academy of Sciences documented the effects of bias in the medical system in a report that laid out the facts in damning detail. \"Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care\" examined 480 previous studies and found that in every medical intervention, black people and other people of color received poorer-quality care than white people, even when income and insurance were equal. This unequal treatment in the health care system persists today in numerous studies showing that black patients receive inadequate pain management for a variety of illnesses, surgeries and other medical procedures, both in the emergency room and in other settings, compared with people of other races. New York City's health department is among a number of health departments and medical facilities around the country that have acknowledged the problem by mandating anti-racism training for their employees. During the current pandemic, health care providers are putting themselves in the line of fire to save lives, but they are working within a flawed system. \"Research on implicit bias shows it's more likely to operate when people are working under time pressure,\" explains Dr. David Williams, chairman of the department of social and behavioral sciences at Harvard's T.H. Chan School. Dr. Williams suggests that this kind of pressure could be worsened by long shifts, fatigue, the need to make quick judgments and even a shortage of protective gear and ventilators. \"All of those are factors that are more likely to make health care providers go into autopilot,\" he says. \"And when they do, they are more likely to rely on the shorthand social categorization to navigate their decisions. So I worry about what it means in terms of the life-or-death decisions in the context of coronavirus.\"\n\nDr. Clyde W. Yancy, chief of cardiology in the department of medicine at Northwestern's Feinberg School of Medicine, has studied racial health inequities for most of his career. As a black man and a native of the Baton Rouge area who grew up during segregation, he also understands them on a personal level. \"These disparities are real, they are deep and they are exacting a terrible price,\" says Dr. Yancy, who wrote an article pulling together research about the connection between black Americans and Covid-19, published online in The Journal of the American Medical Association on April 15. \"If there ever was a moment to have a rallying cry, to have a call to action, to have a wake-up call, there should be a moment of epiphany right now. And that epiphany should be: This is not the way a civil society allows its population to exist.\"\n\nAbout 10 days after the end of Mardi Gras, Dickey Charles told his wife, Nicole, that he wasn't feeling well. Charles, a courier for GE Healthcare, rose most days around 2 a.m. to work an early route driving a van to deliver medical supplies to hospitals and clinics. His second shift, as a supervisor at the New Orleans Recreation Development Commission and the baseball, football and girls' basketball coach at Lusher Charter School, left him little time for rest. Adding the annual whirlwind of Zulu Carnival activities was taxing for Charles, though he rarely let on. He was an easygoing, humble mountain of a man and father of two grown daughters. At six feet and 260 pounds, he carried his weight well. But he also had a number of health conditions: hypertension, diabetes and kidney disease. His wife, who worked as a medical administrator, kept a watchful eye on him but also says he tried to take good care of himself. \"He had been fighting those things for 20 years,\" says Nicole Charles, who added that her husband took three different blood-pressure medications, two kinds of insulin and another medication for his kidneys. \"He was very good with taking his medications. I didn't have to fight him, never had to fuss.\"\n\nBurnell Scales Sr., Nicole's father, who goes by Slim, knew something was wrong on Sunday, March 8, when he showed up at the Charleses' home in Uptown Carrollton, expecting to see his son-in-law stirring a giant pot of gumbo or red beans or heaping shrimp, crawfish and crabs onto plates for the procession of friends, family and Zulu members who came by every week after church for an open-door hangout and to watch Saints games during football season. \"I came in thinking he'd be handing me a plate of something he was cooking up, but he wasn't in the kitchen like usual,\" says Scales, who joined the Zulus decades ago and introduced his son-in-law to the group in 2004. \"He was in bed. That's when I started to worry a little.\"\n\nOn March 12, it was clear to Nicole that Charles still didn't feel well. His fever had been up and down, spiking close to 102. She stayed close to him, administering fluids and Tylenol, assuming he had the flu. That day, after it proved difficult to get a fast appointment with his primary-care doctor, she insisted that he go to urgent care, where he was tested for the flu. When the test was negative, he was sent home -- with no mention of Covid-19.\n\nNicole's anxiety rose the following day when he completely lost his appetite. \"My husband is a big man, and food was definitely something he loved,\" she says. She also worried that he needed to eat something because he couldn't take medications to control his blood pressure, diabetes and kidney problems on an empty stomach. \"Even if he was sick, he would still eat, but I couldn't even get him to eat soup.\"\n\nThat Friday, Nicole says, she told him, \"Baby, we're going to the hospital.\" \"Of course, that was an argument,\" she says, \"because he's a man.\" They agreed to go the next day. \"I said to him, 'You're going, because you don't have a choice.'\"\n\nThe next day, Saturday, March 14, her husband told her he felt weaker, and Nicole took him to the emergency room. Security was high at the hospital as the growing coronavirus cases had begun to grip the city: That day, the Louisiana Department of Health reported 77 cases of the virus, 53 of them in Orleans Parish, and the first death. \"It was like Fort Knox,\" Nicole recalls. \"They directed me to one area so I could register him and took him off to another where I couldn't go. And of course you had to put on a mask; they gave everybody one.\"\n\nIn the E.R., Charles was again tested for the flu, and again the test was negative. But Nicole says no one suggested a Covid-19 test at that time. By that evening, Charles was lying in a hospital bed, attached to IV fluids. \"It just all happened so fast,\" says Nicole, her voice catching. \"It was like zero to 100.\"\n\nIn the late 19th century, W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent black sociologist and author, conducted research to better understand the diseases that contributed to high rates of mortality in black communities. Du Bois and his team did extensive shoe-leather fieldwork that he would turn into his 1899 opus, \"The Philadelphia Negro,\" canvassing neighborhoods and interviewing residents in 2,500 households. He also used census data to document the distribution of health status. Unlike most experts at the time, who blamed racial inferiority and genetic flaws for health inequities, Du Bois highlighted the social conditions they studiously ignored. In a later work, \"The Health and Physique of the Negro American,\" Du Bois wrote: \"With the improved sanitary condition, improved education and better economic opportunities, the mortality of the race may and probably will steadily decrease until it becomes normal.\" Du Bois was unsparing on the lack of empathy for the health and well-being of black Americans, who were still reeling and recovering from 250 years of enslavement and struggling through the reactionary years of Jim Crow. \"The most difficult social problem in the matter of Negro health is the peculiar attitude of the nation toward the well-being of the race,\" Du Bois wrote in \"The Philadelphia Negro.\" There were, he continued, \"few other cases in the history of civilized peoples where human suffering has been viewed with such peculiar indifference.\"\n\nThis \"peculiar indifference\" was infamously sanctioned by the federal government between 1932 and 1972, when the United States Public Health Service conducted a study on hundreds of black day laborers and sharecroppers in Alabama. The \"Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male\" examined the progression of untreated syphilis, under the assumption that the infection manifested differently in black people. The subjects were told they would receive treatment for what was described as \"bad blood,\" but they never did. Instead, they were poked and prodded while the illness was allowed to progress. Once the men died, doctors autopsied their bodies to compile data on the ravages of the disease. The effects of the Tuskegee syphilis study still reverberate in the form of distrust and sometimes avoidance of the health care system among black Americans. In our current moment, this medical distrust has shown up in the form of those conspiracy theories and low-information rumors about Covid-19 -- akin to the false theories and rumors that were also prevalent during the AIDS era -- that Dr. Benjamin-Robinson of the Louisiana Department of Health warned against and Idris Elba tried to dispel.\n\nIn 1985, nearly a century after Du Bois made his observations about racial health disparities, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released the \"Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Black and Minority Health,\" better known as the Heckler Report. This 239-page study marked the first time the federal government had comprehensively examined the health status of black people and other people of color and elevated the issue of health inequality into the national arena. Named for Secretary Margaret Heckler of H.H.S., the report estimated more than 18,000 \"excess deaths\" each year among black people because of heart disease and stroke, compared with the number of deaths that would occur if their health were on par with that of non-Hispanic white people. It also cited 8,100 excess deaths from cancer, 6,200 from infant mortality and 1,850 from diabetes. Heckler called this shameful inequality \"an affront both to our ideals and to the ongoing genius of American medicine.\"\n\nBut the Heckler Report recommended no new government funding to address the crisis. Instead, the report essentially advised black Americans to save themselves by improving their health through education, self-help and self-care. Dr. Edith Irby Jones, president of the National Medical Association, a black medical society, was one of many critics of the report's emphasis on merely health education and lifestyle changes. \"If black people would only 'behave,' their health problems would be solved,\" she wrote in 1986 in the association's journal. The insidious conclusion was that black people, individually and collectively, were poor, irresponsible, careless, uneducated and making thoughtless choices that led to the health crisis in the first place. There was -- and remains -- little focus on the societal conditions that erode the health of black Americans, and little mention of discrimination and bias either inside or outside the health care system.\n\nSurgeon General Jerome Adams echoed this trope when he recently implied that individual behavior was leading to higher deaths from Covid-19 among African-Americans. At a White House press briefing on Friday, April 10, he told \"communities of color\" to \"step up and help stop the spread so that we can protect those who are most vulnerable.\" Adams, who is black and has spoken openly of his own struggles with high blood pressure, asthma and pre-diabetes, nonetheless added that African-Americans and Latinos should \"avoid alcohol, tobacco and drugs.\" He went on: \"We need you to do this, if not for yourself, then for your abuela. Do it for your granddaddy. Do it for your big mama. Do it for your pop-pop.\"\n\nDr. Williams of Harvard cautions against such suggestions. \"It's important to recognize and to acknowledge that the higher death rates of African-Americans from the coronavirus are not linked to the individual decisions black people have made or their communities have made,\" he says. \"We are looking at societal policies, driven by institutional racism, that are producing the results that they were intended to produce.\"\n\nMany of the same experts who had pushed to release coronavirus data by race also worried that racial disparities in infections, hospitalizations and deaths would be used against black people. And like clockwork, after cities with sizable populations of black people began to report large numbers of Covid-19 infections at the beginning of April and statistics showed disproportionate death rates for African-Americans, a counternarrative began to arise: The national, state and municipal shutdowns were too draconian; the coronavirus pandemic was not as much of a threat -- at least, not to all Americans -- as had been argued. A smattering of demonstrations broke out the week of April 13, as protesters gathered in a handful of states to push back against stay-at-home orders.\n\nPresident Trump fanned the extremist flames on April 17 in a series of tweets that encouraged his supporters to flout state policies put in place to keep residents safe during the pandemic. \"LIBERATE MINNESOTA!\" Trump wrote. \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\" \"LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!\" The next day in Austin, Tex., at a \"You Can't Close America\" rally, hundreds of demonstrators, nearly all white, defied social-distancing guidelines by gathering on the steps of the Capitol. The protesters -- many without masks but outfitted with Trump hats and flags -- shouted \"Let us work\" and \"Fire Fauci.\" A woman wearing a Keep America Great cap waved a sign reading, \"My Life, My Death, My Choice, Personal Responsibility,\" and another protester held a hand-drawn poster that read, \"My Life! Not Yours!\"\n\nDr. Jones notes that even before the coronavirus struck, the country had veered toward an ominous distrust of legitimate science that spread down from the White House and into the streets. But the pandemic has intensified the peril of such thinking. \"These protesters don't understand that nobody is immune to this infectious disease that doesn't respect state borders, city borders, neighborhood borders,\" she says. \"We are not the land of the free and the home of the brave individually, but their individual actions have profound impacts on the collective. We're in a dangerous situation by letting ideology take priority over the health interest and well-being of the nation.\"\n\nOn Sunday, March 15, the day after he was admitted to the hospital, Dickey Charles's oxygen levels had become unstable, with his fever spiking and breaking. Late that evening, a chest X-ray showed potential signs of pneumonia. Nicole, who had been sleeping on a pullout chair next to her husband in his room, said one of the doctors told her it was time for an honest conversation. \"They said, 'Your husband is much sicker than he looks,.\" she remembers. .'His lungs will not be functioning much longer. We need to vent him.'\" That day, her husband was finally tested for Covid-19.\n\nNicole was able to stay with Charles for the next three days, locked to his side. Attached to the ventilator, unable to speak, he looked surprisingly peaceful to her, even vital. She kept up a vigil of prayer, whispering \"I love you\" over and over. She streamed gospel music on Pandora on her phone, taking comfort in the song \"The Blood Still Works.\" \"It's still healing,\" she sang to him. \"There is power in the blood of Jesus, the blood still works.\" She had Charles's phone with her and did her best to field an avalanche of calls from worried family members and Zulu brothers. \"I told them, 'Please keep him in prayer,.\" she says.\n\nOn Wednesday, March 18, while Nicole was in the midst of praying, Charles opened his eyes. \"I said to him: 'Baby, you opened your eyes for me! I love you so much,.\" she recalls. \"That was the last time I saw my husband with his eyes open.\" The next day, Nicole says, hospital administrators told her she could no longer visit her husband because of a shortage of personal protective equipment. Louisiana's caseload had increased to 392 cases from 280 the day before. At a news conference, Governor Edwards announced that the state's health care system could be overwhelmed in seven to 10 days on its current trajectory.\n\nFive days later, on Tuesday, March 24, a team of hospital medical providers called Nicole. Charles's blood pressure had dropped, and his kidneys had failed. They told her that he wasn't going to make it. They asked if she would like to see him in person or use FaceTime. She wanted to see him and asked if his two daughters could come too. The hospital ran through a series of questions to assess the daughters' own exposure to the coronavirus, and then administrators allowed Bethaney, 24; Le'Treion, 32; and Nicole to come to his room. Wearing gowns, gloves and masks, they prayed over his body and said goodbye. At 1:30, when Charles took his last breath, Nicole, his wife of nearly 30 years, was by his side. \"I told God, 'I love him; I'm leaving him in your hands,.\" she says. \"I said, 'Please let him rest, let him go in peace.'\"\n\nThe following day, as Nicole was subsumed by staggering grief, she received a call that Charles's Covid-19 test had come back positive. Since his death, she and Le'Treion have tested negative for the virus. Bethaney and Nicole's father, Burnell Scales, have tested positive; Bethaney has remained asymptomatic, while Scales had mild symptoms and has since recovered.\n\nThe afternoon Charles died, Jay Banks was crushed to learn that two other friends had died as well. The same day, at a White House briefing, President Trump stated, \"There is tremendous hope as we look forward and we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel.\" At a Fox News town hall, he said: \"I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.\" Since then, Reese, the Zulu club's chaplain, has posted a heart-wrenching scroll of deaths on his Facebook page: the Zulu warriors who have received, he wrote, \"their wings.\" On March 26, Earl Henry Jr., 63, died. He was a Zulu member for nearly half his life. Three days later, Terry Sharpe Sr., 49, died. He drove a truck for a living and was a loyal member of Pilgrim Baptist Church. On March 31, Larry A. Hammond died. A retired postal worker, he was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity and a veteran of the Air Force; he died in the local V.A. hospital. On the day of his death, Mayor Cantrell tweeted that he had been \"a vital part of our city's rebirth after Katrina, and a culture bearer in the truest sense.\" She included a picture of them smiling together. Hammond was wearing his Zulu jacket.\n\nThe Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club had its origins at the intersection of discrimination and death. After Emancipation, formerly enslaved Africans often could not afford to bury their dead. So they pooled their money by forming social-aid clubs to provide dignified, respectful funerals. But the coronavirus has broken the Zulu club's 111-year tradition of sending off passing members with respect and grace. On April 3, fewer than a dozen people came to Zion Travelers First Baptist Church to say goodbye to Dickey Charles. They sat scattered throughout the pews in the chapel in observance of the guidelines Mayor Cantrell put into place on March 16 prohibiting gatherings of more than a few people. Nicole and her family managed to live-stream the service, and another 600 people watched from home. Elroy A. James, an assistant attorney general for Louisiana and the president of the Zulu club, tuned in, saddened that the organization wasn't able to celebrate its fallen brother in style. \"He deserved a second-line funeral,\" James says, referring to the New Orleans tradition of commemorating life with a spirited procession of pageantry, jazz and dance. \"Man, it would have been great.\"\n\nAs a boy and later a student at Southern University and the Tulane University School of Medicine, Dr. Clyde W. Yancy, the cardiologist at Northwestern, remembers being fascinated with the decorated coconuts, the sought-after prize of the Krewe of Zulu parade. \"Everybody, including me, wanted a gold Zulu coconut,\" he says. \"There was no status, no privilege, we were all just standing on the sidewalk, hoping we got lucky enough to catch the gold coconut.\"\n\nHe says this precious memory has been marred by the racial health disparities he has spent much of his career studying, the disparities that have come to define the American outbreak of Covid-19 -- and the harm this lethal combination has inflicted on the Zulu club. \"These men were doing something as seemingly harmless as socializing, as networking, and just because of that moment of fellowship to celebrate their heritage, they're now dead?\" he says. \"That just made me pause. It makes you understand the pain, the hurt of this gap in health care outcomes as a function of race that have been with us for decades. Covid-19 has basically taken off the Band-Aid that was covering the wound, pointed out how deep it is and left us no other choice but to finally say: We get it, we see it.\"\n\nLinda Villarosa is a contributing writer for the magazine, focusing on race and health.

Now we have a new issue that we're looking at, which is something we're just investigating now. But while rare, we're seeing some cases where children affected with the Covid virus can become ill with symptoms similar to the Kawasaki disease or toxic, toxic-shock like syndrome that literally causes inflammation in their blood vessels. This past Thursday, a 5-year-old boy passed away from Covid-related complications and the State Department of Health is investigating several other cases that present similar circumstances. This would be really painful news, and would open up an entirely different chapter because I can't tell you how many people I spoke to who took peace and solace in the fact that children were not getting infected. If you see any of the symptoms that are on the chart that your child is evidencing, caution should be taken because this is something that we're looking at. And again, there has been at least one fatality because of this. And there may be others that are now under investigation. So this is every parent's nightmare, right?",

        "body": "Bridget Ryan, a peer supporter and assistant nurse manager at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Del., hugged Christina Burke, a nurse, after a recent counseling session.Credit...Erin Schaff/The New York Times\n\nThe coronavirus patient, a 75-year-old man, was dying. No family member was allowed in the room with him, only a young nurse.\n\nIn full protective gear, she dimmed the lights and put on quiet music. She freshened his pillows, dabbed his lips with moistened swabs, held his hand, spoke softly to him. He wasn't even her patient, but everyone else was slammed.\n\nFinally, she held an iPad close to him, so he could see the face and hear the voice of a grief-stricken relative Skyping from the hospital corridor.\n\nAfter the man died, the nurse found a secluded hallway, and wept.\n\nA few days later, she shared her anguish in a private Facebook message to Dr. Heather Farley, who directs a comprehensive staff-support program at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Del. \"I'm not the kind of nurse that can act like I'm fine and that something sad didn't just happen,\" she wrote.\n\nMedical workers like the young nurse have been celebrated as heroes for their commitment to treating desperately ill coronavirus patients. But the heroes are hurting, badly. Even as applause to honor them swells nightly from city windows, and cookies and thank-you notes arrive at hospitals, the doctors, nurses and emergency responders on the front lines of a pandemic they cannot control are battling a crushing sense of inadequacy and anxiety.\n\nEvery day they become more susceptible to post-traumatic stress, mental health experts say. And their psychological struggles could impede their ability to keep working with the intensity and focus their jobs require.\n\nAlthough the causes for the suicides last month of Dr. Lorna M. Breen, the medical director of the emergency department at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital, and John Mondello, a rookie New York emergency medical technician, are unknown, the tragedies served as a devastating wake-up call about the mental health of medical workers. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, their professions were pockmarked with burnout and even suicide.\n\nOn Wednesday, the World Health Organization issued a report about the pandemic's impact on mental health, highlighting health care workers as vulnerable. Recent studies of medical workers in China, Canada and Italy who treated Covid-19 patients found soaring rates of anxiety, depression and insomnia.\n\nTo address the ballooning problem, therapists who specialize in treating trauma are offering free sessions to medical workers and emergency responders nationwide. New York City has joined with the Defense Department to train 1,000 counselors to address the combat-like stress. Rutgers Health/RWJ Barnabas Health, a New Jersey system, just adopted a \"Check You, Check Two\" initiative, urging staff to attend to their own needs and touch base with two colleagues daily.\n\n\"Physicians are often very self-reliant and may not easily ask for help. In this time of crisis, with high workload and many uncertainties, this trait can add to the load that they carry internally,\" said Dr. Chantal Brazeau, a psychiatrist at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School.\n\nEven when new Covid-19 cases and deaths begin to ebb, as they have in some places, mental health experts say the psychological pain of medical workers is likely to continue and even worsen.\n\n\"As the pandemic intensity seems to fade, so does the adrenaline. What's left are the emotions of dealing with the trauma and stress of the many patients we cared for,\" said Dr. Mark Rosenberg, the chairman of the emergency department at St. Joseph's Health in Paterson, N.J. \"There is a wave of depression, letdown, true PTSD and a feeling of not caring anymore that is coming.\"\n\n____\n\nScrew all of you now I see exactly why the only thing left to do is suicide. -- a Facebook post by a St. Louis paramedic in April\n\nAfter Kurt Becker, a paramedic firefighter in St. Louis County saw that post, which included a profanity-laced screed of frustration and despair over the job, he sent a copy to the man's therapist with a note saying, \"You need to check this out.\"\n\n\"I'm reading this, and I'm ticking off each comment with, 'stress marker,' 'stress marker,' 'stress marker,' \" said Mr. Becker, who manages a 300-person union district. (The writer is in treatment and gave permission for the post to be quoted.)\n\nThe paramedics are part of a \"warrior culture,\" Mr. Becker said, which sees itself as a tough, invulnerable caste. Asking for help, admitting fear, is not part of their self-image.\n\nMr. Becker, 48, is himself the grandson of a bomber pilot and son of a Vietnam veteran. But his local has been hit by a dozen suicides since 2004, and he has become an advocate for the mental health of its members. To maintain his equilibrium, he works out and sees a therapist.\n\nRecently, he has been getting more requests than usual for the union's peer-support team and its roster of clinicians who understand the singular experiences of emergency medical workers.\n\n\"The virus scares the hell out of our guys,\" he said. \"And now, when they go home to decompress, instead, they and their spouses are home schooling. The spouse has lost a job, and is at wit's end. The kids are screaming. Let me tell you: The tension level in the crews is through the roof.\"\n\nMany besieged health care workers are exhibiting what Alynn Schmitt McManus, a St. Louis-based clinical social worker, calls \"betrayal trauma.\"\n\n\"They feel overwhelmed and abandoned\" by fire chiefs who, she said, rarely acknowledge the newly relentless demands of the job.\n\nMany paramedics, she added, are \"aggressive and depressed. They are so committed to the work, they are such good human beings, but they feel so compromised now.\"\n\nBrendan, who asked for his last name to be withheld to protect his privacy, is a 24-year-old paramedic firefighter who works 48-hour shifts on the tough north side of St. Louis. His unit has been so busy running calls that he goes for long stretches without showering, eating or sleeping. He is terrified he might infect his fianc\u00e9e and their daughter.\n\n\"We got a letter from our chief saying that there's a national shortage of gloves, gowns, masks and goggles because the public is taking them,\" he said. \"Then we walk into Walmart and see that 90 percent of the people have better masks than we do.\"\n\nWith no end in sight to the crisis, Brendan sought out a therapist.\n\n\"We are a lot quicker to be angry with each other,\" he said. \"Any little thing sends us over the edge. But among the older guys in their late 30s and 40s, it's not OK to talk about things. So all anyone talks about is alcohol.\"\n\n____\n\n\"They were coming in very sick and deteriorating so fast. I was carrying a lot inside me, and I was very sad when I came home. I was feeling like I wasn't doing a good job. My mother-in-law is a nurse, and she saw I needed help so she connected me with a therapist.\" -- Kristina, a nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens\n\nTherapists around the country, many affiliated with the Trauma Recovery Network, which includes a large New York team, have been lining up to offer free treatment to medical workers. But the number of requests for help has been modest.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Cases have declined and deaths have slowed, but it's a delicate moment to reopen. The House's vote to allow remote balloting will fundamentally change how Congress operates. New York City beaches, a beloved summer standby, will stay closed as others in the state reopen. See more updates Updated 5m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"People are nervous that if they pause to get treatment, they'll crash, \"said Karen Alter-Reid, a psychologist and the founder of the Fairfield County Trauma Response Team in Connecticut, who has treated disaster-relief workers at school shootings and hurricanes.\n\nThe reasons to offer front-line workers specialized trauma therapy now are both to forestall destructive symptoms from settling in long-term, and to patch up depleted people so they can keep doing their jobs with the intensity demanded of them.\n\nSince mid-March, Dr. Alter-Reid's group has been treating dozens of emergency medical technicians, doctors and nurses. What distinguishes this pandemic as a traumatic experience, she said, is that no one knows when it will end, which protracts anxiety.\n\nMedical teams, she noted, keenly miss the familial, visceral contact. They are used to hugs, backslaps, and sharing beers after a rough shift. Now, safety strictures have shut all that down.\n\nThrough Zoom group therapy, the crews have been regaining some semblance of solidarity as they unburden with each other, unmasked, through a computer screen, hearing everyone talk about similar struggles: Living away from families, to keep them safe. The smell of disinfectant in their clothes and hair. The clumsy haz-mat gear.\n\nIn the sessions, Dr. Alter-Reid instructs them to tap on their desktops. The tapping is integral to her technique, a well-studied trauma treatment called eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.\n\nAs they tap, which can sound like group drumming, she asks them to recall a challenging case when they each prevailed, and to share it.\n\nThrough these sessions, she tries to help them subdue memories of fear, failure and death so they can summon their innate resilience: Remember what you can do.\n\n____\n\nI have nightmares that I won't have my P.P.E. I worry about my patients, my co-workers, my family, myself. I can't turn my brain off. -- Christina Burke, an I.C.U. nurse at Christiana Hospital, Newark, Del.\n\nA nagging detail sticks in Christina Burke's mind like a burr. Not only is hers the last face that patients see before they die, but because of her mandatory mask, all they glimpse are her eyes.\n\nHer identity as a compassionate nurse feels diminished. She longs to lift up her mask and reveal her full self to patients.\n\nAt 24, Ms. Burke has already worked in an intensive care unit for three years. She has loved the connections she made with patients and their families, but those experiences are now largely gone.\n\n\"I can't imagine one of my relatives on their last breath with a stranger,\" said Ms. Burke, who is close to her own family but hasn't been able to visit them for two months.\n\nOne recent day, overcome with sleeplessness and despondency, she contacted Bridget Ryan, a member of the hospital's peer support program. In Ms. Ryan's office, she tearfully unloaded.\n\nA March study in JAMA Psychiatry looked at the psychological impact of the epidemic on health care workers in 34 Chinese hospitals, reporting that nurses, especially women, carried the heaviest burdens. They had elevated rates of anxiety, depression and insomnia.\n\nThe prevalence of burnout and suicide among medical professionals has been widely studied. As the pandemic invaded the West Coast earlier this year, Stanford psychologists gathered focus groups in their medical system to explore how to shore up mental health.\n\nResearchers flagged workers' limited capacity to manage Covid-19; their fears of contaminating family members; the moral code-bending decisions about when to use limited, life-saving resources. But much distress could be headed off if hospital leadership created a proactive, supportive culture that included ways for workers to express concerns and feel heard, the researchers wrote in JAMA.\n\nChristianaCare, a four-state health system, began assembling such a protocol five years ago. The program provides group support and daily inspirational texts. Twice a week, doctors and staff meet senior leaders. It set up designated \"oasis\" rooms, outfitted with low lights, massage chairs and meditation materials, where stressed workers take a breather.\n\n\"We're trying to provide them with psychological first aid,\" said Dr. Farley, an emergency medicine physician who directs ChristianaCare's Center for WorkLife Wellbeing.\n\nPeer counselors are quickly available. \"No one else understands what we're going through,\" Ms. Burke, the I.C.U. nurse, said. \"It doesn't sound like much, but that program has changed the world for us.\"\n\nAt the end of her meeting with Ms. Ryan, the two women, both in surgical masks, shared a social-distance-defying hug. Ms. Burke said she emerged refreshed. For the first time in two months, she slept through the night.\n\nTo address safety fears, ChristianaCare offers disposable scrubs, which workers tear off at the end of a shift. It also has a gratitude program, in which former patients return to thank their healers. At a time when so many Covid-19 patients are dying, such exchanges, said Dr. Farley, reconnect demoralized staff to \"why we do what we do.\"\n\nDr. Farley and her team check on hospital crews, pushing carts loaded with hand lotion, anti-fog lens cleaner, protein bars, chocolate and solace.\n\nEvery time, Dr. Farley said, \"There is someone crying with me, and it's 3 a.m. They're exhausted. They need this.\"\n\n____\n\nI see all these people coming in to the hospital now who are really sick, and I'm wondering, could this be me one day? There are a lot of unknowns. And the anxiety is amplified, knowing what happened in my household. -- Dr. Andrew Cohen, an emergency medicine physician at St. Joseph's University Medical Center, Paterson, N.J.\n\nWhen Dr. Andrew Cohen, 45, is working his shift at the hospital's emergency department, he is fine. He has the thick emotional skin characteristic of his high-octane profession. He dons his gear, turns his adrenaline up to a quiet, steady hum and focuses on saving lives.\n\nBut hours before the shift starts, he becomes foggy, anxious, hesitant. And as soon as it ends, he performs a cleansing ritual that even he labels \"over the top.\" That is because he has discovered, in a brutal manner, that he cannot leave the job behind.\n\nFor nearly a decade, Dr. Cohen and his wife shared their home with her parents, a practicing pulmonologist and a retired nurse, who often babysat for the Cohens' children, now 8 and 11. But in March, both in-laws became ill with Covid-19 and were admitted to the hospital within a day of each other.\n\nDr. Cohen's mother-in-law, Sharon Sakowitz, 74, died first.\n\nOn the day of her funeral, the hospital called the Cohens: now the father-in-law's organs were shutting down. The Cohens rushed to the hospital. Dr. Barry Sakowitz, 75, died that morning. A few hours later, they buried Mrs. Sakowitz.\n\nStill mourning, Dr. Cohen wonders, \"Did I bring this virus into my house?\" As he prepares to go to work, \"My son says, 'Daddy, be very, very careful,' and I know what he's thinking.'\"\n\nThe guilt threatens to swamp him. What if he is the third person in this household to die?\n\nAfter the shift, Dr. Cohen photocopies his notes, so there's no risk he leaves with paper that might have coronavirus on it. He cleans his stethoscope, pens, goggles, face shield and the bottom of his sneakers with antimicrobial wipes. He does a surgical hand wash, up to his elbows.\n\nHe changes into a clean set of scrubs, putting the dirty ones in a plastic bag, and walks through the hospital parking lot. Sitting in his car, he sprays the bottom of his shoes with Lysol.\n\nAt home, he removes his sneakers and scrubs, leaving them in a box in the garage, and heads to the shower. Only after will he allow himself to embrace his family.\n\nHow long will Dr. Cohen march through this meticulous ritual? When will fear loosen its grip?\n\n\"We've always been told to suck it up and move on,\" he said. He wonders: When his own emotional crash comes, when colleagues start unraveling, \"Will there be people there to help us?\"",

        "body": "LONDON -- At his darkest moment with the coronavirus, Dr. Poorna Gunasekera glimpsed three rays of light.\n\nFollowing a severe deterioration in his COVID-19 symptoms, Gunasekera was rushed to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, southwest England, in the early hours of March 30, and three former students came to treat him.\n\nUpon entering the \"red zone,\" which is one step below the intensive care unit, the 57-year-old associate professor of biomedical sciences at the city's university was put into isolation.\n\n\"It was wonderful that during that time, two of my former students, who are doctors, and another, who is a nurse, actually came and they identified themselves,\" he told The Associated Press following his discharge from the hospital on April 9.\n\nHis voice choked with emotion as he remembered the encounters.\n\n\"It made a world of a difference to me,\" he said. \"I couldn't have seen their faces, they were all in their protective things, but they came, and they not only treated me, they did some really difficult procedures ... it gave me so much strength to know that these wonderful people were actually there.\"\n\nThe feeling of respect was mutual.\n\nGertrude Magama, a 45-year-old nurse from Zimbabwe who has known Gunasekera since she volunteered for one of his projects, said it was an \"honor\" to look after him.\n\n\"I was touched when he reassured me that I was doing well when he was going through pain and discomfort,\" she said. \"In my eyes, he will forever be a valuable part of my future success in my nursing profession.\"\n\nGunasekera, better known to friends and colleagues as P.G., grew up in Kandy, Sri Lanka, and led the Guard of Honour accorded to Queen Elizabeth II during her visit in October 1981.\n\nHe came to the U.K. in 1999 on a Commonwealth scholarship to study for a Master's at University College London and has been in the academic field ever since, and at Plymouth since 2012.\n\nMedical knowledge doesn't necessarily bestow wisdom. He readily admits he underestimated his deterioration, even when his temperature soared above 39 C (102 F) and he lost 6.5 kilograms (around 14 pounds) with diarrhea. While people infected with the coronavirus often experience mild or moderate symptoms, possible complications like pneumonia can put their lives at risk.\n\n\"As he is a doctor and trains doctors on a daily basis, I trusted him and gave him the benefit of doubt when he told me he was slowly starting to feel better,\" said his 26-year-old daughter Saki. \"In hindsight, I think he was just trying to channel crazy levels of positive thinking so as to calm both his and my own worries.\"\n\nEventually, Saki, who had mild symptoms along with her boyfriend George, \"decided to overrule\" her father and had him rushed to hospital. It was a decision he acknowledges ultimately saved his life.\n\nGunasekera spent about a week hooked up to oxygen supplies as his lungs had taken a \"battering.\"\n\nSomething curious occurred to Gunasekera on the \"crucial\" third or fourth day. He entered a pain-free phase \"where the body stopped kind of talking to me\" and his sense of proprioception -- the awareness of one's body in space -- switched off too.\n\n\"I wouldn't call it levitation, but I lost senses,\" he said. \"It was the most peaceful state in life I've ever been in. It was almost as if some authority up there said 'stop worrying' and it was so convincing I actually stopped worrying.\"\n\nHe thinks it was a taste of nirvana, the ultimate goal of Buddhism when individuals enjoy indescribable peace.\n\n\"It was a state of absolute bliss,\" he said.\n\nYet the worrying resurfaced as his health improved and a few days later, Gunasekera was moved to a ward with three other recovering patients: \"I was the baby of the bunch.\"\n\nOn their first day, none could speak, since they were all hooked up to oxygen. But on the second day, an 80-year-old ex-Royal Navy officer, known only as Robert, single-handedly raised their spirits.\n\n\"He was a piece of pure magic,\" Gunasekera said.\n\nAll four shared the same guilt of becoming new sources of outbreaks.\n\n\"All of us were ready for a kind of stigmatization that could come and we understood it,\" he said. \"If the roles were reversed, I'd be careful of meeting someone who has been diagnosed as COVID-positive even if it was a long time ago.\"\n\nNow he can't wait to see his new partner, Hayley, and her family again after his 14-day self-isolation is over. He's recuperating with Saki and George and his dog Barney in the tiny village of Filham in south Devon, and reflecting on how fortunate he is to get a second chance, unlike so many thousands of others. Britain has already had more than 15,000 people die in the pandemic and expects eventually to have the worst death toll in Europe.\n\nGunasekera is especially admiring of the current generation of medical practitioners, of whom he has taught many, for being so much more \"humble\" than his.\n\n\"Having gone through medical school myself, I remember we came out with this feeling that we are God's gift to humanity, we were the supreme beings,\" he said.\n\nThe new generation, he said, are \"taught to acknowledge that there is a limit to our knowledge, and that there is so much uncertainty out there.\"\n\nGunasekera hopes a more \"cohesive society\" will emerge that relates betterto the struggles of Britain's National Health Service and that bridges the gap between generations.\n\n\"Social distancing, though it's physical distancing, the beauty is it's brought emotional connections,\" he said.\n\n\"This is almost a reset button that society needed and perhaps we'll come out of this a far better society, far better group of people than ever.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nNeal Nibur has lived in a nursing home for about a year, ever since he had a bad bout of pneumonia. Now, the 80-year-old man has not only his own health to worry about but that of his neighbors at the Poughkeepsie, N.Y., residence. Four new patients recently arrived from the hospital with Covid-19.\n\nThey were admitted for one reason, according to staff members: A state guideline says nursing homes cannot refuse to take patients from hospitals solely because they have the coronavirus.\n\n\"I don't like them playing Russian roulette with my life,\" said Mr. Nibur, who is on oxygen. \"It's putting us at risk. I am 80 years old with underlying problems. Everybody here has an underlying problem.\"\n\nThe disease caused by the virus has killed more than 10,500 residents and staff members at nursing homes and long-term care facilities nationwide, according to a New York Times analysis. That is nearly a quarter of deaths in the United States from the pandemic. On Saturday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York described nursing homes as a \"feeding frenzy for this virus.\"\n\nBut states are increasingly turning to nursing homes to relieve the burden on hospitals and take in Covid-19 patients considered stable enough to be released. Although there is no evidence so far that the practice has allowed infections to spread in nursing homes, many residents and advocates fear that it is only a matter of time. One lawsuit in New Jersey alleges that a worker was likely to have been sickened by a Covid-19 patient readmitted from a hospital.\n\nAt the epicenter of the outbreak, New York issued a strict new rule last month: Nursing homes must readmit residents sent to hospitals with the coronavirus and accept new patients as long as they are deemed \"medically stable.\" California and New Jersey have also said that nursing homes should take in such patients. Homes are allowed to turn patients away if they claim they can't care for them safely -- but administrators say they worry that refusing patients could provoke regulatory scrutiny, and advocates say it could result in a loss of revenue.\n\nIn contrast to these states, Connecticut and Massachusetts designated certain facilities for Covid-19 patients alone -- considered the safest way to free up hospital beds. The Washington Health Care Association, which represents long-term care facilities in Washington State, has asked officials to adopt a similar policy; so far, they have not.\n\n\"It's got to happen,\" said Robin Dale, the association's president. \"Then we would not have this hodgepodge of every nursing home in the state having one or two positives and crossing your fingers that it works out.\"\n\nBeth Martino, spokeswoman for the American Health Care Association, which represents nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, said her association had heard that a number of states were considering measures similar to those in California, New Jersey and New York. But many others haven't offered any guidance on the matter.\n\nThe fears that moving coronavirus patients to nursing homes might spark outbreaks is compounded by the lack of protective equipment at many facilities, as well as shortages in staffing, requiring workers to interact with more patients. And not all hospitals are testing to check whether stable patients are still infectious before releasing them.\n\nIn a national survey released on Thursday of almost 9,000 nursing homes, fewer than 10 percent said they were able to take in new Covid-19 patients from hospitals. The survey was done by CarePort Health, a company that works with hospitals to manage the release of patients to long-term care facilities.\n\nJay Lawrence, spokesman for the Grand Healthcare System, which has 17 homes in New York, including the one in Poughkeepsie, said the company was doing everything possible to meet state needs and keep residents safe. He said the virus had not spread from those initial four patients in Poughkeepsie to anyone else in the building.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Navy leaders recommend reinstating the Roosevelt captain fired over a virus warning.

No one knows where and how this is going to rear its ugly head.\"\n\nThe New Jersey lawsuit, filed on Wednesday against Alaris Health at Hamilton Park in Jersey City, alleges that a certified nursing assistant was probably exposed to the virus from a patient readmitted from a hospital.\n\nThe assistant was not given protective equipment and not properly isolated while treating the patient, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by a former nurse at the home. It also said that workers and residents were not told about the patient's Covid-19 diagnosis. The patient died around March 29, the lawsuit said. Cheryl Roberts, the nursing assistant, was put on a ventilator and died on April 5, said her brother, Darryl Roberts.\n\n\"I was devastated, because not only did they put my sister in jeopardy, they put the whole facility in jeopardy,\" Mr. Roberts said.\n\nMatt Stanton, a spokesman for Alaris Health, said workers had proper protective equipment and called the claim that residents got staff members sick \"ludicrous.\"\n\nSince its original guidance, New Jersey has opted to prohibit admissions to facilities that say they cannot safely care for patients. So far, more than 130 facilities have been exempted.\n\nIn New York, the new rule has increased strain on nursing homes, many of which are now staffed at less than 50 percent, said Stephen Hanse, the president and chief executive officer of the New York State Health Facilities Association and the New York State Center for Assisted Living.\n\n\"This puts nursing home providers in a really precarious position,\" he said. \"If you want to do everything to protect your residents and staff, your hands are tied.\"\n\nMina Ebrahem, 31, a physical therapist in New York City, works for agencies that have sent him to several nursing homes over the past month. All were admitting Covid-19 patients from hospitals while providing only limited protective equipment, he said. At one home, he helped check in new patients, about five a day. He said 90 percent of them had been treated for coronavirus symptoms at hospitals.\n\n\"Whoever made this decision, whoever did this, I consider this a sentence of death for all the older patients, whoever is in a nursing home,\" he said.\n\nAsked about admissions of Covid-19 patients in light of nursing-home deaths at a briefing on Monday, Mr. Cuomo seemed unaware of the state rule. \"It's a good question,\" he said. \"I don't know.\"\n\nHoward Zucker, the state health commissioner, said that nursing homes needed to readmit positive patients and that \"necessary precautions will be taken.\"\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Cuomo reiterated that nursing homes had to accept the patients -- but only, he clarified, if they could do so safely. Homes unable to comply should transfer them to other facilities or notify the state Health Department, he said.\n\nThe department, responding to questions from The Times, said that nursing homes were not permitted to discriminate against Covid-19 patients, but that they should avoid taking patients if not \"medically prepared.\" Mr. Zucker said on Thursday that he did not know of any homes in that position.\n\nRichard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York, an advocacy group for residents, said he had heard of several nursing homes that had declined. But the vast majority, he said, have a \"tremendous financial incentive\" to take in new patients.\n\nJonathan G. Jacobson, a Democratic assemblyman whose district includes Poughkeepsie, has urged New York health officials to reverse the directive, calling it \"misguided.\"\n\n\"Nursing homes are simply not equipped to act as hospitals and should not be used as depositories for infected individuals,\" he wrote in a letter to health officials last week, adding that patients should instead be sent to facilities designated for Covid-19 patients, separate from large populations of elderly residents.\n\nWhile the rule is still in effect, Mr. Jacobson said he was heartened by the governor's remarks on Thursday and hoped nursing homes ill equipped to handle Covid-19 patients would reject them.\n\nConnecticut and Massachusetts both set aside facilities to care for Covid-19 patients. One in Connecticut started accepting patients from hospitals last week. Massachusetts emptied one site of other residents and reopened seven closed facilities to treat positive patients.\n\nNursing homes in Massachusetts are also being asked to take coronavirus patients, but only if they verify that they have adequate staff and protective gear and can isolate the infected. In return, those homes will collect 15 percent more in reimbursements for every Medicaid patient.\n\nWithout clear guidelines, patients in hospitals faced the question of where they should go if nobody wants them.\n\nJohn Stubits, 96, a former civil engineer, was sent by a Michigan memory care center to a nearby hospital on March 30, where he tested positive for the virus. He briefly improved, and the hospital searched for somewhere to discharge him, according to his daughter, Eva Stubits. His previous residence would not accept him unless he tested negative for the infection; no other home in the state would take him.\n\nMs. Stubits said she was told that her father would be sent to a home in Ohio, more than an hour away.\n\nThose plans unraveled when Mr. Stubits became much sicker. Last week, his daughter learned that the hospital planned to send her father to a nursing home in Detroit with poor ratings. After many phone calls, Ms. Stubits found another home about 30 minutes away from his previous residence.\n\n\"The hospitals are desperate to get them out, and they don't care where they go,\" she said. \"If you don't know any better, your relative could end up in a really bad place.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Sarah Almukhtar, Jake Holland, Danielle Ivory, Jesse McKinley, Alison Saldanha, Mitch Smith, Timothy Williams and Karen Yourish.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nFor seven and a half hours, the two New York City paramedics had worked a surprisingly normal shift: a few people with difficulty breathing, one trip to the hospital -- and, miraculously it seemed, no clear cases of coronavirus.\n\nThey were about to head back to their station when an urgent call flashed over their dispatch screen: cardiac arrest, with a patient who had been feeling sick for a week.\n\n\"Heads up,\" a radio barked. \"Possible Covid.\"\n\nThe paramedics, Sean Mahoney and Kenny Cheng, rushed to the apartment building, donned gowns, goggles and face masks and restarted the patient's heart. But then the person crashed. The ambulance doors closed as Mr. Cheng frantically began chest compressions. Moments later, the patient was dead.\n\nSuch is the disturbing new normal for the city's paramedics, whose days can be mundane until -- suddenly -- they are not.\n\nThe peak of the coronavirus epidemic in New York City -- when paramedics were declaring scores of people dead a day -- has passed, at least for now. Yet the virus still casts a shadow over everything they do. And when it resurfaces, it does so swiftly and with a vengeance.\n\nLike the rest of the city, paramedics are facing an unnerving uncertainty: When can they see their loved ones again? When, if ever, can they return to normal? And what if the virus comes back when they do?\n\n\"It's a little bit overwhelming,\" said Mr. Mahoney, 40. \"But that's what we signed up to do, right?\"\n\nNearly two months into the coronavirus crisis, the strain has taken a heavy emotional and physical toll on paramedics. The city employs around 4,500 paramedics and emergency medical technicians, who are buttressed by privately employed ambulance crews paid by hospitals. Though the city's medics work for the Fire Department, they are paid significantly less than firefighters and do not receive the same benefits.\n\nFor weeks, they have worked exhausting days trying to save people, facing the threat of exposure each time they responded to a call. And after their shifts, they have had to isolate themselves at home to protect their relatives, spouses and children from infection.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Governor Cuomo said that some businesses in less hard-hit regions might open after May 15. Deaths dropped sharply in New York and New Jersey. How to reopen New York City? De Blasio announces a number of groups to guide the effort. See more updates Updated 9h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nMr. Mahoney moved into a separate bedroom in his upstate home, and for weeks has not interacted with his wife and three young children. Mr. Cheng, 36, swapped residences with his parents, who have an apartment in Manhattan. They have moved to Queens to stay with Mr. Cheng's wife and daughter.\n\nMr. Cheng and Mr. Mahoney were reactivated for duty out of the Fire Department's E.M.S. training academy in Fort Totten, Queens, a storied supplementary fleet known as \"Station 60.\" Its instructors have periodically gone back on the job during the city's crises -- like the Sept. 11 attacks and Hurricane Sandy -- and they are staffing 10 ambulances now.\n\nEach day, Mr. Mahoney and Mr. Cheng gather with their colleagues for a moment of silence and updates on friends and co-workers who have contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. One ill colleague named during the meeting on Monday morning, an emergency medical technician named Idris Bey, had died by Friday.\n\nMr. Cheng and Mr. Mahoney find out each morning whether they will be on an ambulance duty, at high risk of exposure, or working in an office on the training academy's campus.\n\nThe nature of the job requires a certain detachment from pain. Neither Mr. Mahoney nor Mr. Cheng is easily rattled by death or suffering. Still, the virus has shocked them in unexpected ways, chilling them with its rapid spread, the havoc it wreaks on bodies and its bizarre symptoms.\n\nMany patients have vital signs -- like low blood-oxygen levels -- that indicate that they should be unconscious or dead, Mr. Cheng said. He recalled one patient whose oxygen levels were so low he was surprised the person was still coherent.\n\n\"They were still awake and talking, which scientifically, should not be possible,\" he said.\n\nBeyond the day-to-day horror of dealing with coronavirus victims, Mr. Mahoney and Mr. Cheng are also wrestling with the loss of normal comforts, like most New Yorkers. Mr. Cheng said he missed ordering Chinese food and had found many of the restaurants around him have closed indefinitely. Mr. Mahoney, a lifelong Boston Red Sox fan, feared baseball season was slipping away.\n\nNeither will seriously entertain visiting family members. Mr. Mahoney said he hoped to get a coronavirus test so he could see his wife, twin daughters and their baby brother this month. But that window, he said, would be brief -- by the next shift, he would again be at risk of exposure and would have to isolate himself again.\n\nMr. Cheng video chats daily with his young daughter, but said he had no idea when he might return home. Even when the city begins reopening, paramedics would still be at high risk of exposure, he said. He was recently reminded why he had taken pains to protect his family, when his father-in-law, who was not quarantining with them, died of the virus.\n\nAs they wait in the ambulance in between calls, the men wear surgical masks, and they put them on whenever they are off-duty and go out in public. Mr. Cheng fashioned a headband that held the straps away from his ears, which he said got \"shredded\" by the elastic.\n\nEven when he is at home, Mr. Mahoney said, the feeling haunts him.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I still feel like I'm wearing the mask,\" he said.\n\nAt the peak of the virus's rampage through the city, paramedics were pronouncing hundreds of people dead in their homes every day. The 911 calls were constant, and many of the patients were too ill to save.\n\nSome days, the calls were relentless. Mr. Mahoney recalled one shift this month when he and his partner had been assigned to Brooklyn, but they were diverted almost immediately after leaving Fort Totten.\n\n\"We got hit from the academy and just bounced from one call, as soon as you hit the button,\" he said. \"We never made it out of Queens.\"\n\nThat pace has abated in recent days, indicating that the virus's first wave might be ending; fewer New Yorkers were making emergency calls.\n\n\"They're either recovered, or, most of them are dead,\" Mr. Cheng said.\n\nCall levels soared to record highs in early April, rising to around 7,000 a day compared with the normal 4,000.\n\nNow, they have dropped to levels even lower than that -- so many people are staying inside that injuries related to car accidents and crime, for example, have plummeted. And many people have decided against calling ambulances for maladies unrelated to the coronavirus because they are fearful they could be exposed to the illness if they go to a hospital.\n\nOn one call last Monday, for example, Mr. Cheng and Mr. Mahoney responded to a patient who had difficulty breathing. It was unclear if the person had coronavirus, but the medics donned their protective gear anyway.\n\nThe patient had mostly normal vital signs and was unlikely to be admitted at a hospital, the medics said. In the end, the patient opted to stay home.\n\nSuch calls were growing more and more common. People were scared, the paramedics said, and often they just wanted a medical professional to come and make sure they were not dying of the virus. Many of them were equally afraid of going to a hospital.\n\nRarely do Mr. Cheng or Mr. Mahoney know for sure if a patient has the virus, so they treat every call as a potential exposure. Each time they were called to an apartment last week, they lined up next to their ambulance, putting on gowns, gloves, goggles and N-95 respirator masks. Curious residents, huddled in windows, looked on as the men were transformed.\n\nThroughout the day, as Mr. Cheng and Mr. Mahoney wove their way through the Bronx, dozens of residents could be seen lining up at grocery stores and banks. People were walking through parks, or standing talking to neighbors on street corners.\n\n\"Seems like a lot more cars are on the road today,\" Mr. Mahoney said. \"I think people are starting to slowly filter back into society. \"\n\nThe implication of his statement needed no explanation: As people begin to relax their social distancing efforts, it could mean the start of the virus's next wave.\n\nThe juxtaposition of the dangers they face and the returning normalcy on the street can be disorienting.\n\nAs the paramedics lifted the limp body of their last cardiac arrest patient into the ambulance that afternoon, four other medics, suited up with personal protective equipment, raced frantically around the gurney. They moved silently, with urgency -- like faceless extras from a biohazard movie.\n\nNext to them on the sidewalk, a couple out for an afternoon stroll stepped aside for the stretcher, looking on with passing interest as they continued on their walk. Neither was wearing a mask.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nJoseph Morales puts on a mask and gloves whenever he is delivering truckloads of wine, vodka and gin to a thirsty city.\n\nBut he can do nothing about the person who coughs or comes too close in cramped stores.\n\n\"I'm basically risking my life,\" said Mr. Morales, 41, a truck driver for a liquor distributor. \"If that person has it, I'm doomed because I'm right there.\"\n\nEven as the coronavirus pandemic has shut down New York City, thousands of truck drivers like Mr. Morales are still rolling through its mostly deserted streets.\n\nThey are doing what they always do -- moving groceries, household staples, and supplies and equipment -- but with new urgency as they keep New York running and help people cope with the worst health crisis in a century.\n\nTruck drivers have been designated essential workers, along with doctors, nurses, police officers, transit workers and many others who have been thrust to the front lines, at risk to themselves and their families. Some UPS and FedEx workers even worry that their trucks and warehouses have become breeding grounds for the virus.\n\nMany truck drivers began working longer hours as the outbreak spread. Manolo Sosa carried virus-fighting essentials -- disinfectants, hand sanitizer, wipes and gloves -- to senior centers, health clinics and apartment buildings in Manhattan and the Bronx.\n\nOn his busiest days, he has made up to 25 deliveries for a maintenance supply distributor, Kandel and Son, or twice as many as before. Grateful customers thank him. \"I try to come back again and bring more,\" Mr. Sosa, 37, said.\n\nRecognizing the hardships faced by truck drivers, city officials recently opened two rest areas with portable toilets in the South Bronx and on Staten Island that can be used around the clock.\n\n\"Truck drivers are truly heroes,\" said Avi Kaner, a co-owner of Morton Williams, whose 15 city grocery stores rely on deliveries. \"New York City supermarkets would be empty within days without trucking.\"\n\nMore than 280,000 people over age 18 work as truck and delivery-service drivers in the New York region, which includes New Jersey and Connecticut, making up about 8 percent of the 3.6 million such civilian drivers nationally, according to an analysis of census data by Social Explorer, a research company.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Governor Cuomo said that some businesses in less hard-hit regions might open after May 15. Deaths dropped sharply in New York and New Jersey. How to reopen New York City? De Blasio announces a number of groups to guide the effort. See more updates Updated 11h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nThe analysis found that 96 percent of New York region truck drivers are men. About 52 percent are white, while 42 percent are black or Hispanic.\n\nThey earn a median annual income of $37,956, compared with $42,827 for all workers.\n\nAs the outbreak has paralyzed the New York region, it has fallen to truck drivers to make sure that food and supplies keep moving.\n\nFour times a week, Steven Thomas, 56, makes the nine-hour drive between Brooklyn and Akron, Ohio, in a double tractor-trailer filled with medical equipment, auto parts and household products, including refrigerators and televisions.\n\n\"We're trying to help people get the things they need,\" he said.\n\nNow, whenever he stops on the road, he wears a mask, keeps his distance and squirts on hand sanitizer. \"As a truck driver, my hands have never been so clean,\" he said.\n\nThough trucks drivers have come to the rescue after other crises -- including the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks and Hurricane Sandy in 2012 -- they have never before worked under such constant threat to their health and safety, said Kendra Hems, the president of the Trucking Association of New York, an industry group.\n\nIt is not known how many truck drivers have gotten sick from the coronavirus, according to trucking industry groups. But the largest union representing truck drivers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, said thousands of its members in the New York region reported having symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nTo better protect drivers, many trucking companies have provided them with disinfectant, masks and gloves. Some have also encouraged drivers to stay inside their trucks when possible.\n\nThe trucking association has ordered 16,000 masks to give out free to drivers and others who need them, and is looking into buying hand sanitizer in bulk.\n\n\"They are out there and they are putting themselves at risk,\" Ms. Hems said. \"Being exposed and getting sick from Covid-19 is a very big concern.\"\n\nRalph Blasi wipes down his seat with disinfectant before heading out to deliver milk, eggs, cheese, yogurt and bottled water to supermarkets, bodegas, nursing homes and hospitals in Queens and on Long Island. He takes along a mask and hand sanitizer to use after handling cash payments.\n\nSome nursing homes no longer allow him inside, so he leaves their orders at the door. Others require him to pass a medical check -- taking his temperature and medical history -- and that can add 10 to 15 minutes to each delivery.\n\nFor his trouble, Mr. Blasi, 53, actually earns less than he did before. His last weekly paycheck was just under $1,200, down from his average of $1,350, he said. Even though supermarkets are ordering more, he is making fewer deliveries overall and earning less commission with so many restaurants closed.\n\n\"I'm just trying to deal with it for now, until hopefully things get better,\" Mr. Blasi said.\n\nIn Queens on a recent morning, Mr. Morales was hauling 566 cases of assorted alcohol for Empire Merchants. Mr. Morales, whose father was a truck driver, earns $38 an hour.\n\nHe started at 7:30 a.m. at a warehouse in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, where he picked up his delivery route, which changes daily. By 8:30 a.m., he was on the road in his 20-foot-long, burgundy-colored truck\n\nAn upside of the pandemic is that traffic has all but disappeared. \"It's almost like driving through a no-man's land,\" he said. Parking is easier, too.\n\nBut Mr. Morales, who calls himself a people person, does not like the emptiness. When he does see people, \"you don't know who's who because everyone is walking around in masks and gloves.\"\n\nHe has fewer stops, mainly at liquor stores. Most of his regular customers were restaurants and bars, many of which have closed for now. He often makes his last delivery by 2 p.m., hours earlier than before.\n\nMr. Morales, the father of two sons, ages 6 and 9, said he was scared of bringing the virus back to his family. Yet, there he is going in and out of stores, and handling boxes with no idea who else has touched them.\n\nHe tries to keep his distance from people, only to find himself often trapped beside them in narrow aisles.\n\nHe started having chest pains recently and assumed the worst. It turned out to be a pulled chest muscle from lifting a case the wrong way.\n\nBut what about next time?\n\n\"At the end of the day, I have to work,\" he said. \"I have no choice. But nobody really wants to be outside right now.\"",

        "body": "Jack McMorrow, 14, awoke in agony, with heart failure. His case may help doctors understand a frightening new affliction in children linked to the coronavirus.\n\nWhen a sprinkling of a reddish rash appeared on Jack McMorrow's hands in mid-April, his father figured the 14-year-old was overusing hand sanitizer -- - not a bad thing during a global pandemic.\n\nWhen Jack's parents noticed that his eyes looked glossy, they attributed it to late nights of video games and T.V.\n\nWhen he developed a stomachache and didn't want dinner, \"they thought it was because I ate too many cookies or whatever,\" said Jack, a ninth-grader in Woodside, Queens, who loves Marvel Comics and has ambitions to teach himself \"Stairway to Heaven\" on the guitar.\n\nBut over the next 10 days, Jack felt increasingly unwell. His parents consulted his pediatricians in video appointments and took him to a weekend urgent care clinic. Then, one morning, he awoke unable to move.\n\nHe had a tennis ball-size lymph node, raging fever, racing heartbeat and dangerously low blood pressure. Pain deluged his body in \"a throbbing, stinging rush,\" he said.\n\n\"You could feel it going through your veins and it was almost like someone injected you with straight-up fire,\" he said.\n\nJack, who was previously healthy, was hospitalized with heart failure that day, in a stark example of the newly discovered severe inflammatory syndrome linked to the coronavirus that has already been identified in about 200 children in the United States and Europe and killed several.\n\nThe condition, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is calling Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children, has shaken widespread confidence that children were largely spared from the pandemic. Instead of targeting lungs as the primary coronavirus infection does, it causes inflammation throughout the body and can cripple the heart. It has been compared to a rare childhood inflammatory illness called Kawasaki disease, but doctors have learned that the new syndrome affects the heart differently and erupts mostly in school-age children, rather than infants and toddlers. The syndrome often appears weeks after infection in children who didn't experience first-phase coronavirus symptoms.\n\nAt a Senate hearing last week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a leader of the government's coronavirus response, warned that because of the syndrome, \"we've got to be careful that we are not cavalier and thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.\"\n\nJack's recovery and the experience of other survivors are Rosetta stones for doctors, health officials and parents anxious to understand the mysterious condition.\n\n\"He could have definitely died,\" said Dr. Gheorghe Ganea, who, along with his wife, Dr. Camelia Ganea, has been Jack's primary doctor for years. \"When there's cardiovascular failure, other things can follow. Other organs can fail one after another, and survival becomes very difficult.\"\n\nNew York state has reported three deaths and, as of Sunday, 137 cases were being investigated in the city alone. Last week, a C.D.C. alert urged doctors nationwide to report suspected cases.\n\n\"Everyone is doing everything they can to help look into this from all different angles just to get the answers that parents want, that we want,\" said Dr. Thomas Connors, a pediatric critical care physician who treated Jack at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital.\n\nNeither Jack nor his parents, John McMorrow and Doris Stroman, know how he became infected with coronavirus. After cleaning out his locker at Monsignor McClancy High School on March 18 to continue school online at home, he only left the apartment once, they said, to help his mother wash clothes in their high-rise building's laundry room. His parents and 22-year-old sister also avoided going out and the tests they've had turned up negative.\n\nLast week, in their apartment festooned with welcome-home balloons, the family -- Jack wearing a blue bandanna as a mask, his mother in a mask with the Rolling Stones tongue logo on it -- recounted their story. His father, a recently laid-off truck driver for the film industry, briefly choked up and Jack bounded over to hug him.\n\nThe week after his hand rash and stomachache, about a month after he'd last set foot in school, Jack developed a 102 degree fever and sore throat. Worried, his mother arranged a video visit with their pediatricians, who started him on an antibiotic for possible bacterial infection. For several days, he felt about the same, but then other symptoms rapidly emerged: swollen neck, nausea, dry cough, a metallic taste.\n\nOn Saturday, April 25, his fever spiked to 104.7, his chest felt tight, and when he took deep breaths, \"it hurt down in the bottom,\" he said.\n\nThat morning, Dr. Camelia Ganea video-conferenced with the family while still in her pajamas, discovering Jack could barely open his mouth. She prescribed steroids and suggested they visit an urgent care clinic. There, Jack was tested for the coronavirus, but it would be two days before results arrived.\n\nBy Monday, pain was \"flowing through me like lightning,\" Jack said, and a rosy rash covered his feet.\n\n\"I was very very emotional,\" Jack said. He paused. \"I'm using the word emotional to cover up the fact I was crying like a baby.\"\n\nLying on the sofa, he couldn't move on his own and grasped for words to describe what was happening.\n\n\"Rooftop,\" he implored his parents, seeking a shorthand way to ask them to bend his leg like a peaked roof.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The federal agency that issues visas is almost broke, its fee income ravaged by the pandemic. Reopenings are a much more difficult balancing act than closings, governors say. Economic recovery may take until late 2021, the Fed chairman says. See more updates Updated 42m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"I didn't know what I was trying to say, but I knew what I meant,\" he explained later.\n\nWith a home monitor, they discovered his blood pressure was very low. Mr. McMorrow lifted him, placing Jack's feet on top of his own, and shuffled him to the car. At NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital, doctors gave Jack intravenous fluids and tried to diagnose his condition. He didn't have the obvious respiratory distress of Covid-19. And then they got the results of his Saturday coronavirus test: negative.\n\nSuspecting he might have a condition like mononucleosis, they prepared to discharge him, thinking he could be safely watched at home with instructions to return if his blood pressure dropped again, his parents said.\n\nHis mother was urging them to keep Jack longer when his eyes turned red with a \"raging case of pinkeye\" and rolled back in his head, she said. After a conversation with Jack's pediatrician, the hospital conducted its own coronavirus test. It was positive.\n\nThe doctor decided Jack should be transferred to NewYork-Presbyterian's pediatric affiliate, Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, which is treating many coronavirus cases. Jack begged to go home.\n\nThe doctor responded bluntly, saying that she knew teenagers often think they're invincible.\n\n\"She told me if I go home now, by tomorrow, I'll be dead,\" Jack said. \"I would say that scared me to death, but it more scared me to life. It scared me to fight as hard as I could.\"\n\nJack arrived at the children's hospital so feverish that his father was \"washing me down with ice-cold water and it only felt like a tingle,\" he said.\n\nHis resting heart rate was 165 beats per minute, about twice as high as normal, as his heart struggled to compensate for his alarmingly low blood pressure, which was hampering its ability to circulate blood and supply his vital organs with oxygen and nutrients.\n\nThis condition is a form of heart failure called cardiogenic shock, and Jack's was \"pretty severe,\" said Dr. Steven Kernie, chief of pediatric critical care medicine at the hospital and Columbia University. \"Over all, his heart wasn't working very well,\" he said. \"It wasn't pumping as strongly as normal.\"\n\nDoctors couldn't explain why Jack's heart function had suddenly become impaired. Its structure and rhythm were normal. But blood vessels throughout his body were inflamed, a condition called vasculitis, so the vessels' muscles were \"not controlling blood flow as well as they should,\" Dr. Kernie said.\n\nDoctors also suspected the heart was inflamed, known as myocarditis, which in untreated serious cases can cause lasting damage.\n\nJack's condition wasn't only distressing, it reflected a frightening new pattern. \"I remember that morning having admitted multiple children with a similar syndrome,\" Dr. Connors said, \"and it was kind of like, 'What's going on here?'\"\n\nThe inflammation seemed driven by a hyperactive immune response, and Jack received medication for bacterial infection until tests ruled that out. \"Whenever kids come in in shock you have to treat for everything,\" Dr. Kernie said.\n\nJack's positive coronavirus test was a clue, but others with similar symptoms had negative diagnostic test results, Dr. Connors said. The doctors then decided to check the other children for evidence of the coronavirus with a different test, one for antibodies, which signal they had an earlier, no-longer-active infection. Most children ended up having either a positive diagnostic or antibody test result.\n\nBy April 29, Jack's third day in I.C.U., the blood pressure medication wasn't helping enough and doctors began planning to insert a central line through his groin to deliver additional medications. They also prepared to put Jack, who was receiving nasal oxygen, on a ventilator, something doctors deem necessary when \"your heart's not doing its job,\" Dr. Connors said. \"We didn't know which way this was going.\"\n\nThe situation, especially the prospect of a ventilator, was terrifying to Mr. McMorrow, 51, who stayed in Jack's hospital room round-the-clock, and Ms. Stroman, 52, who was at home communicating by text and FaceTime because only one parent was allowed in the hospital.\n\n\"You had a cardiologist, a pulmonary specialist, infectious disease experts all throwing numbers and prescriptions to each other, and this is stuff that's French to me,\" Mr. McMorrow said.\n\nJack mustered the energy to ask the doctors questions. \"I needed to know because how am I supposed to fight something I don't know I'm fighting,\" he said.\n\nHe concluded that his condition essentially boiled down to: \"Your coronary and pulmonary responses come back and bite you in the butt.\"\n\nBut then doctors began giving Jack steroids, which can have anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects. At last, something seemed to work. Within hours, Jack needed less blood pressure medication. As the family's pediatrician, Dr. Ganea, who has training in infectious diseases and spoke to the hospital team, put it: \"Jack turned into a normal Jack.\"\n\nDoctors aren't sure the steroids made the difference, but since then, they've administered them much earlier to children with the syndrome, with encouraging results, Dr. Kernie said.\n\nBut Jack wasn't out of the woods even after moving to a regular hospital room. His heart rate was in the 30s, about half what it should be. The low heart rate might have been because of the steroids, doctors said, but they couldn't be sure, so they moved Jack to a unit with continual cardiac monitoring.\n\nOver the next week, Jack recovered. He emailed his biology teacher from his hospital bed: \"I would like to thank you for educating me as you did, and for providing me the educational support to understand my body when I need to most.\"\n\nHis mother knew Jack was his old self when, on the phone, he asked to speak with his sister, quoting the family's favorite movie, \"Midnight Run\": \"Is this moron No. 1? Put moron No. 2 on the phone.\"\n\n--\n\nOn May 7, 10 days after being hospitalized, Jack went home and traipsed around the apartment channeling Pinocchio: \"I'm a boy! There are no strings on me!\"\n\nHe'll require follow-up cardiology appointments and will take steroids and blood thinners for a while. He may have some heart-valve tears and residual cardiac inflammation, but doctors expect those to heal on their own. Jack and his family have taken genetic tests as part of research into the syndrome, and he and other survivors will be followed as doctors strive to learn how to recognize and treat it.\n\nPausing near a model of Darth Vader's castle on his desk, Jack said he once considered becoming an actor. He was even an extra on the TV show \"Gotham,\" playing a kidnapped orphan. But before getting sick, he was thinking about studying medicine. \"I was really into the heart,\" he said. Now, he's even more interested.\n\n\"I just want to do more with my life now that I have it back,\" he said, gesturing with his Captain America shield.",

        "body": "Cruising down Broadway without crowds sounds like a total joy ride. Until you remember why it's like this.\n\nWhen Giorgio Milella, a graphic designer, started working from home in mid-March, he figured out how to break up the tedium: by leaving his Harlem apartment and hitting the newly empty streets on his motorcycle.\n\n\"The first week, I was like, This is amazing. Going down Fifth Avenue and there are no cars,\" recalled Mr. Milella, 33, who was once able to catch a wave of green lights all the way from the West Village to 135th Street.\n\nBut gradually the experience, which he called \"surreal,\" started to change for him. \"I've been like, There's something wrong with this whole scenario,\" he said. \"Why am I not staying home?\"\n\nSince the pandemic has largely cleared the New York's streets, few motorcyclists have been able to ignore the singular, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity: speeding through the city free of the annoyances that can make riding here such a frustrating and dangerous experience: distracted drivers, swerving taxi cabs, sclerotic traffic. All that, and it's spring, too.\n\n\"Thank God for quarantine,\" said Mateo Pagan, 27, who joined a huge pack of stunt riders on motorcycles, ATVs and dirt bikes over Easter weekend to ride his Honda dirt bike. \"Manhattan was like our playground,\" he said.\n\nBut many other motorcyclists feel conflicted. \"This should be nirvana for us right now,\" said Cheryl Stewart, 57, a founding member of the Sirens Women's Motorcycle Club, \"but a pleasure ride feels selfish.\"\n\nWith hospitals and medical workers overburdened, a crash not only means drawing on resources desperately needed elsewhere, but also potentially life-threatening treatment delays, in addition to exposure to the virus. For many motorcyclists, keenly aware that it's always a matter of when, not if they crash, that's an unreasonable risk to add to an already risky activity.\n\n\"We access the risk/rewards equation every time we throw a leg over a bike,\" Ms. Stewart said. \"Now the risks are much higher.\"\n\nBoth motorcycle crashes and moving violations have declined since the pandemic hit the city. Between March 15 and May 15, there were 161 motorcycle crashes, down from 329 during the same period last year, a decrease of 51.4 percent, according to an analysis of police data by the nonprofit OpenTheBooks.com.\n\nSome riders have curbed their habits. Vassili Shishkin, a financial manager, usually rides his Ducati every day. \"And I take pride in that,\" he said. \"It's my biggest passion. I rode all winter, in the rain, cold, freezing weather.\" At the start of the pandemic, he continued to ride, calling it \"a guilty pleasure.\"\n\nBut after listening to news reports, the gravity of the situation started to sink in and Mr. Shishkin, 40, \"got spooked,\" he said. Now he only rides once a week -- reluctantly -- to gather material for his Ducati vlog.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Here's where you can go to the beach this weekend. Subway ridership is up 50 percent from last month, but still far below normal. A time-honored city ritual resumes: moving the car. See more updates Updated 5m ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nOther motorcyclists, however, are happy to have a legitimate excuse to be riding. Jan Eggers, 45, who is considered to be an essential worker because he is a doorman, commutes to Manhattan from Montvale, N.J., on his BMW F850GS, an adventure bike.\n\n\"It's been blissful. Instead of being ultra-defensive, you can actually enjoy your time,\" Mr. Eggers said.\n\n\"Last week on Friday, I was heading home and it was windy but crystal clear. I got on the West Side Highway and you could see the Hudson River, the GW Bridge and beyond that the Palisades on one side and Yonkers on the other,\" he said. \"I was struck by the sheer beauty. On a normal day, I'd be worried about this guy three cars ahead looking over his shoulder.\"\n\nAlthough many motorcycle groups have not been as showy since the Easter ride, the city recently intervened in a crowding situation at Shore Boulevard in Astoria, Queens, a popular gathering place for motorcyclists.\n\n\"The local precinct decided to place barricades at each end of the Boulevard to completely restrict vehicle access,\" said Anthony Liberatoscioli, chairman of the Astoria Park Alliance. \"But the revving continues.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nOn a weekend in late April, Brandon Garcia, 22, was among the bikers hanging out by the new barricades. \"Most of the people I know are still riding,\" Mr. Garcia said. \"We're in a group chat and everyone is like, 'Who's riding, who's riding?' People are ecstatic. It's like a New York State racetrack, for free.\"\n\nEven so, Mr. Garcia said he was riding more cautiously these days. \"The hospitals are crowded and ambulances busy,\" he said. \"They probably won't even care if they hear 'motorcycle crash' on the radio.\"\n\nOther motorcyclists are taking advantage of the empty roads to help their fellow New Yorkers. Kirsten Midura, 34, decided to organize riders into a volunteer delivery network, bringing P.P.E., food and other supplies to essential workers.\n\n\"I recognize people are going to be on their bikes anyway,\" Ms. Midura said. \"It's a great form of therapy and social distancing.\"\n\nMathew Adreini, a manager at Jane Motorcycles, said that his commutes certainly help him to de-stress these days. But his experience of the city has been altered, and not necessarily in a good way.\n\n\"You see the expanse of the virus,\" Mr. Adreini, 32, said. \"When you ride down Fifth Avenue sometimes all you see is the National Guard, cops and the homeless.\"\n\nThe novelty wears off quickly, Mr. Adreini added. \"I didn't move to New York City to ride a motorcycle. It's everything else that makes New York New York.\"",

    "'Will You Help Save My Brother?': The Scramble to Find Covid-19 Plasma Donors": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nHOLLYWOOD, Fla. -- The doctor was dying.\n\nWithout a way to improve his breathing, Dr. Vladimir Laroche was not likely to survive Covid-19. An internist who spent almost four decades caring for the sick, Dr. Laroche contracted the disease last month while treating patients at a health center and drive-up testing site for the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn a week's time, he quickly spiraled. He went from noticing a stubborn sore throat to experiencing flulike symptoms that forced him to leave work early to fighting the virus in the intensive care unit of a Florida hospital.\n\nDr. Laroche's body was overwhelmed by the blunt force of a virus that public health experts are still struggling to understand. One of his doctors, Dr. Leslie Diaz, an infectious disease specialist and a colleague, had an idea she believed would give Dr. Laroche a fighting chance: an infusion of blood plasma donated by someone who had recovered from the virus, to bolster his immune system.\n\n\"The idea was to give him more soldiers in his body to fight this war,\" said Dr. Diaz, who is part of the team treating Dr. Laroche at Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center in South Florida.\n\nBut there was no donor and no prospects and no time.\n\nSo Dr. Laroche's family in Port-au-Prince, Miami and New York began a desperate search on social media to find someone who beat Covid-19 and was willing to donate blood. Some 80 miles away from Dr. Laroche's hospital bed, an administrator of a Miami seaport was just returning to work after a mild bout of the disease. He was in his office one morning when the phone rang. He picked up and received an urgent plea: \"Will you help save my brother?\"\n\nThus began a frantic journey to deliver hope to a critically ill doctor, with stops at a mobile blood donation bus in Hialeah, a laboratory in Orlando and, finally, the first floor of a Palm Beach Gardens hospital.\n\nIn the absence of a vaccine or proven treatment, Covid-19 survivors are being viewed as potential saviors for patients with a disease that has killed more than 52,000 people in the United States. Demand for what is known as \"convalescent plasma\" has outstripped supply by roughly two to one, setting off a kind of pandemic free-for-all for survivor good will.\n\nUnder a national program overseen by the Mayo Clinic and authorized in early April by the Food and Drug Administration, about 2,500 patients at U.S. hospitals have been given the experimental treatment that Dr. Laroche's family sought. The F.D.A. has also granted \"numerous\" applications from individual doctors to use convalescent plasma for Covid-19 patients, the agency said in a recent statement.\n\nIn St. Louis County, Mo., an Army veteran with Covid-19 received plasma from a lawyer who had recently recovered. In Westchester County, N.Y., a college student who previously had a mild Covid-19 case donated to a man in his 70s on a ventilator. Convalescent plasma shipped from a blood bank in San Diego was given to a hospitalized Covid-19 patient in a Philadelphia suburb, according to Doug Martindale, the patient's friend and business partner.\n\nBut donors need to have obtained a positive test for the virus and to have gone two to four weeks without symptoms -- a challenge given the early restrictions on testing. With a limited pool, panicked relatives of Covid-19 patients have resorted to social media campaigns and mass emails to seek out survivors with a compatible blood type. And Covid-19 survivors have found themselves facing unanticipated ethical dilemmas about the potentially lifesaving antibodies circulating in their blood.\n\nOver the last two weeks, Meg Chamberlin, a stay-at-home mother in Manhattan, has fielded requests from families of Covid-19 patients in Boston, Los Angeles and Youngstown, Ohio. \"Willing to pay for travel or whatever it takes,\" texted Jarret Jones, 32, whose fianc\u00e9e's 87-year-old grandmother was on a ventilator in Youngstown.\n\nAnother potential donor said she had committed publicly to one patient on the Facebook group Survivor Corps, only to be privately messaged by the relative of another. As each donation can supply enough plasma for three patients, he asked, could she list his relative's patient identification on her form as well?\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. New C.D.C. data suggests the virus death toll is higher than reported. Trump wants to keep open meat plants, many of which are virus hot spots. The U.S. surpasses 1 million known coronavirus cases. See more updates Updated 4h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"It seems like we have fairy status or something,\" said Ms. Chamberlin, who ended up flying from Richmond, Va., where she was visiting her mother after she recovered, to Atlanta to make a plasma donation. \"And we'd better use it for good.\"\n\nAs it turned out, Mr. Jones's fianc\u00e9e's grandmother was discharged and is recovering without having received convalescent plasma.\n\nFor the recipients, it is also unclear whether having antibodies to the virus that are not their own will help -- or possibly harm -- them. Convalescent plasma has been tried for over a century in patients suffering from other infectious diseases, including influenza in 1918 and Ebola in 2014, with mixed results. In a limited study of 10 Covid-19 patients in China, researchers found that the convalescent plasma therapy appeared to help seven of them. In the Mayo Clinic program, how patients who get plasma fare will be compared with the outcomes of patients who did not.\n\nAnother study, which starts this week at Montefiore Health System in the Bronx, will use the gold-standard clinical trial design -- controlled, double-blind, randomized -- to enroll 300 patients, half of whom will receive convalescent plasma and half of whom will get a placebo.\n\n\"The million-dollar question is 'Will convalescent plasma work?'\" said Dr. Johanna Daily, an infectious disease specialist at Montefiore.\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, before he contracted the coronavirus, Dr. Laroche worked with patients at FoundCare, a nonprofit health center, to determine if they needed to be tested for Covid-19.\n\n\"We talked about the exposure of working with patients who might have Covid-19,\" said his younger brother, Paul Laroche, 59, of Miami. \"He understood the risks but wanted to help as much as possible.\"\n\nAfter developing the telltale fever, body aches and shortness of breath, Dr. Laroche tested positive for Covid-19 on March 29 -- nine days after his eventual plasma donor, Basil Binns II, received the same diagnosis. Within weeks, their lives would be inextricably linked by a virus and its antibodies.\n\nDr. Laroche, 68, was admitted to the hospital on March 31. Doctors treated him with interleukin inhibitors to slow inflammation, along with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin. Dr. Laroche was not responding. \"He was getting weaker and weaker,\" said Dr. Diaz, who works with Dr. Laroche as FoundCare's infectious disease medical director.\n\nHis kidneys and liver were functioning but his breathing became so labored that doctors placed him in a medically induced coma and on a ventilator within days. And then they delivered the bad news to his family: Dr. Laroche was not getting better.\n\n\"We knew his age might diminish his chance of survival and that we were in this for the long haul -- if we were lucky,\" said Mr. Laroche, an addiction therapist specialist. \"His lungs were not working. The machine was pushing 100 percent of the oxygen in. The doctors did not tell us they were giving up, but we knew we were in a day-by-day situation.\"\n\nHis siblings, children and girlfriend could not hold his hand to comfort him. His 100-year-old father could not travel from Haiti to Florida.\n\nAnd then there was the worst-case scenario. \"In the back of our minds, we were thinking, 'We will not be able to honor our brother properly,'\" Mr. Laroche said.\n\nMayor Francis Suarez of Miami, who learned he had the coronavirus in mid-March, became Florida's first Covid-19 donor by giving plasma to OneBlood, a blood donation center, and hundreds more have reached out to make donations.\n\nBut when Dr. Diaz requested plasma from OneBlood, there was not any available. So Dr. Laroche's family began frantically calling friends, reaching out to journalists and posting urgent requests on Facebook to find a matching donor. Mr. Binns was connected to Mr. Laroche through a mutual friend who saw the Facebook post.\n\nMr. Binns, 38, had just completed a 14-day self-quarantine in his Miami home, where he had been social distancing from his pregnant wife. Weeks before, his mother fell ill with Covid-19 after a ski trip to Sun Valley, Idaho. Others in her ski club also tested positive.\n\nThree days after Mr. Binns had returned to work healthy on April 6, Mr. Laroche called and shared his brother's plight.\n\n\"My question was, how can I help?\" said Mr. Binns, an assistant director at the Port of Miami. The treatment two weeks ago appears to have helped Dr. Laroche, who is still in intensive care and faces a long recovery but now requires less than half the oxygen he did before the therapy.\n\nAs hundreds of thousands more Americans recover from Covid-19 in coming weeks, researchers, doctors and blood bank officials said they were aiming to administer convalescent plasma on demand, in a process that does not rely on family members recruiting their own donors.\n\nBut for now, Mr. Binns is working with Mr. Laroche to help match donors with Covid-19 patients. \"It felt like I was helping out a friend rather than a stranger,\" he said.\n\nAudra D.S.

Zucker, said state officials were also investigating the unexplained syndrome.\n\nThe syndrome has received growing attention in recent weeks as cases began appearing in European countries hit hard by the coronavirus.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York As deaths fall, Governor Cuomo gives criteria for reopening.

See more updates Updated 2h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\n\"There are some recent rare descriptions of children in some European countries that have had this inflammatory syndrome, which is similar to the Kawasaki syndrome, but it seems to be very rare,\" Dr. Maria Van Kerkhove, a World Health Organization scientist, said at a news briefing last week.\n\nIt was not immediately known whether children in other parts of the United States have come down with this illness. New York City has been the center of the pandemic.\n\nCovid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, tends to be much more dangerous for older people and those with underlying health conditions. Children are less likely to become seriously ill than adults. But some do. In New York City, six children have died of Covid-19, according to data from the health department.\n\nReports of children sick with the unexplained syndrome in New York City have been circulating for several days, but Monday's bulletin was the first time the city's health authorities warned doctors to be on the lookout for patients who might have it.\n\nThe bulletin said that most of the 15 children had a fever and many had a rash, vomiting or diarrhea. Since being hospitalized, five of them have needed a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe, and most of the 15 \"required blood pressure support.\"\n\n\"The full spectrum of disease is not yet known,\" the bulletin said. Of the 15 patients, most either tested positive for the coronavirus or were found, through antibody testing, to likely have been previously infected.\n\nThe city's health commissioner, Dr. Oxiris Barbot, said in a statement: \"Even though the relationship of this syndrome to Covid-19 is not yet defined, and not all of these cases have tested positive for Covid-19 by either DNA test or serology, the clinical nature of this virus is such that we are asking all providers to contact us immediately if they see patients who meet the criteria we've outlined.\"\n\n\"And to parents,\" she added, \"if your child has symptoms like fever, rash, abdominal pain or vomiting, call your doctor right away.\"\n\nConjunctivitis, or inflammation of the eye, and swollen lymph nodes are also symptoms of Kawasaki disease.\n\nThe health department identified the 15 patients by contacting hospital pediatric intensive care units across the city in recent days. \"Only severe cases may have been recognized at this time,\" the bulletin said.\n\nThe 15 patients were all hospitalized on or after April 17.\n\nWNBC-TV previously reported that Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital had treated some patients believed to have this syndrome -- and that some had developed heart problems and low blood pressure.\n\nDr. Zucker, the state health commissioner, was asked last week about reports of toxic shock in younger patients. He responded that officials were aware that the virus attacks different organs, including the lining of blood vessels, something some doctors believe may be contributing to blood clots in some coronavirus patients.\n\n\"What we have been seeing is that there are some children who may have an inflammation of those blood vessels, and are developing a toxic-shock-like syndrome,\" he said, adding that he had spoken to number of hospital directors about a small number of cases.\n\nOn Monday night, Dr. Zucker reiterated that state health officials were aware of multiple cases of this syndrome in New York City hospitals, and that he had spoken with medical providers statewide about it. Dr. Zucker said the state health department was also looking at possible Kawasaki cases in children and adolescents in Europe, which were the subject of an international webinar last weekend.\n\n\"So far, from what we understand, this is a rare complication in the pediatric population that they believe is related to Covid-19,\" Dr. Zucker said, adding, \"We are following it very closely.\"\n\nJesse McKinley contributed reporting.",

        "body": "They did not treat patients, but Wayne Edwards, Derik Braswell and Priscilla Carrow held some of the most vital jobs at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens.\n\nAs the coronavirus tore through the surrounding neighborhood, their department managed the masks, gloves and other protective gear inside Elmhurst, a public hospital at the center of the city's outbreak. They ordered the inventory, replenished the stockroom and handed out supplies, keeping a close count as the number of available masks began to dwindle.\n\nBy April 12, they were all dead.\n\nThe pandemic has taken an undisputed toll on doctors, nurses and other front-line health care workers. But it has also ravaged the often-invisible army of nonmedical workers in hospitals, many of whom have fallen ill or died with little public recognition of their roles.\n\nThe victims included the security guards watching over emergency rooms. They were the chefs who cooked food for patients and other hospital workers. They assigned hospital beds and checked patients' medical records. They greeted visitors and answered phones. They mopped the hallways and took out the garbage.\n\n\"You know how people clap for health workers at 7 o'clock? It's mainly for the nurses and doctors. I get it. But people are not seeing the other parts of the hospital,\" said Eneida Becote, whose husband died last month after working for two decades as a patient transporter. \"I feel like those other employees are not focused upon as much.\"\n\nHer husband, Edward Becote, made about $45,000 a year moving patients around the Brooklyn Hospital Center on stretchers and wheelchairs. He was among at least 32 nonmedical hospital workers in New York City who have died during the pandemic, according to an analysis by The New York Times.\n\nThese workers make some of the lowest wages in hospitals, and they are more likely than medical staff members to be black or Latino. In New York City's public hospitals, 79 percent of the workers who assist doctors and nurses are black or Hispanic, compared with 44 percent of the medical staff, according to the most recent city data.\n\nIn the early weeks of the pandemic, when even emergency room nurses had to reuse N95 masks for days at a time, nonmedical workers were often given less protective gear than their colleagues who treated patients -- or none at all -- according to union leaders and hospital employees.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York The governors of seven Eastern states agree to coordinate on purchasing medical equipment. Governor Cuomo says hospitals will be required to build a 90-day supply of protective medical equipment. Death numbers in New Jersey continue to fluctuate.

At least 11 members have died, she said.\n\nA spokesman for Health and Hospitals, the city's public hospital system, acknowledged that it saved N95 masks for clinical employees who treated Covid-19 patients and other employees in \"hot zones,\" such as the emergency department. Early in the pandemic, the spokesman said, most government guidance on masks focused on clinical employees. He said the agency offered surgical masks to its nonclinical workers.\n\nElmhurst did not require every employee to wear at least a surgical mask until April 15, the same day Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced an order mandating New Yorkers to wear face coverings in public, according to emails viewed by The Times.\n\nIn March, Ms. Carrow, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Braswell handed out supplies in the materials management department, in the hospital's subbasement. Their deaths have shaken other nonclinical employees at Elmhurst who hoped that their distance from patients offered some protection against contracting the virus.\n\nMs. Carrow, 65, died on March 30 after working at Elmhurst for 25 years. Mr. Edwards, 61, died two days later, after a friend found him on the floor of his apartment, gasping for air. Both of them had expected to retire within the next year.\n\nMr. Braswell, Mr. Edwards's supervisor, died on April 12. He was 57.\n\n\"As you start mending your heart for one, then the next one came,\" said Gary Johnson, who previously worked in their department and discovered Mr. Edwards in his apartment. \"You wonder when the pain stops.\"\n\nHospitals generally have not released the names of employees who have died, leading workers to collect the names through word of mouth and organize their own memorials. The Times compiled its list through obituaries and interviews with hospital employees and relatives.\n\nAt the Brooklyn Hospital Center in Fort Greene, at least five employees have died in recent weeks, according to interviews.\n\nRafael Cargill handled medical records at the hospital, including sometimes retrieving them from floors with virus patients, said his sister, Lillian Cargill. She said that he was concerned about a colleague who showed up to work despite testing positive for the virus, and that he had not received any protective gear when he developed a dry cough in late March.\n\nMr. Cargill, 60, died at home on March 30.\n\n\"We ran over there and had to stand outside,\" his sister said. The paramedics \"wouldn't allow us to go in. They came out and said they couldn't save him.\"\n\nKim C. Flodin, a spokeswoman for the Brooklyn Hospital Center, said the hospital was following state and federal protocols to \"protect our staff, clinical and nonclinical, from the transmission of this virus.\"\n\nIt is difficult to pinpoint how any hospital employee contracted the virus; many commute by public transit and live with family members who are also unable to work from home. But anyone working in hospitals inundated with patients was potentially exposed.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed on April 20, the largest nurses' union in New York accused the state's Department of Health of enacting policies that turned hospitals into \"petri dishes where the virus can fester and then spread to other health care workers.\"\n\nNurses and other health care workers were denied testing even though they exhibited symptoms, the lawsuit said.\n\nIn response, a Health Department spokesman said the state was taking every step to ensure health workers have the support and supplies they need.\n\nThat support may have come too late for Adiel Montgomery, who worked as a security guard in the emergency department of Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn.\n\nHe spoke out in March about lacking the protective suits that he saw doctors wearing around Covid-19 patients, according to a colleague who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retribution. After Mr. Montgomery and other security guards complained, the colleague said, more protective gear arrived.\n\nIn late March, Mr. Montgomery lost his sense of taste and smell and experienced flulike symptoms, according to his brother.\n\nMr. Montgomery, 39, was hospitalized at Kingsbrook a week later with chest pains. While waiting hours for the results of his blood work, he began coughing up blood.\n\nHe died on April 5. The hospital told his family that he died of a heart attack, but his family believes he had the virus.\n\n\"I just feel that being an employee of the same hospital, he was neglected,\" his mother, Griselda Bubb-Johnson, said. \"I feel they should have done more.\"\n\nAfter the deaths of at least five Kingsbrook employees, nurses there protested outside the hospital about the shortage of protective gear. A spokeswoman for Kingsbrook did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nMany hospital employees worked as long as they could after they felt sick, driven by financial necessity and a desire to help their overstretched colleagues.\n\nThe last day Gary Washington reported to work at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital in northern Manhattan was March 29. His body was aching, and a colleague saw him lying down in the cafeteria.\n\nRosalyn Washington, his wife, thought he was growing too old to keep working as a housekeeping employee there. He cleaned the rooms of virus patients after they were discharged, and his brother thought he should stop going to work, she said.\n\nSo many housekeepers called out sick that the hospital began bringing in temporary workers, one of his colleagues said. But Mr. Washington was the family's primary breadwinner.\n\n\"He was not going to quit his job and not take care of his family,\" Mrs. Washington said.\n\nMr. Washington, 56, died from the virus on April 8, the day before his wedding anniversary.\n\nBefore his death, he texted his wife from his hospital bed: \"I can't explain how much I truly love you. I didn't want to tell you how I cried like a baby thinking about how good you've been to me.\"\n\nHis wife had his urn engraved with Boop P Doop, the pet name they called each other.\n\n\"I had 25 years with this man. I'm so empty. Now I'm getting calls about widows' benefits,\" she said, her voice breaking. \"He's trying to take care of me still.\"\n\nRobin Stein contributed reporting. Susan C.

        "body": "Professional golf is making plans to resume play even as coronavirus concerns linger, leaving players and caddies to figure out how close is close enough for a consultation.\n\nMissy Pederson is eager to get back to work caddying for the two-time major winner Brittany Lincicome on the L.P.G.A. Tour, which is scheduled to resume its season in July, five months after it was suspended because of the coronavirus crisis. \"I'm chomping at the bit,\" Pederson said on Tuesday in a telephone interview from her home in Minnesota.\n\nPederson's enthusiasm, however, had been tempered by the results she had just received. Despite taking what she thought were all the necessary precautions -- venturing out only to shop for food for herself and to deliver food to others in her community while wearing a face covering -- she tested positive for Covid-19.\n\n\"It's definitely caused me to stop and really think about how we want to approach this,\" Pederson said.\n\nPederson's diagnosis illuminates the challenges confronting golf -- especially the caddies, swing coaches and trainers whose jobs typically bring them into close contact with players -- as the sport snaps out of its pandemic-induced hibernation. How can caddies communicate effectively with their players about distances or club choices when they are standing at least six feet apart?\n\nPederson said she was the first person she knew to have tested positive for the virus. \"That's why it makes me so nervous when people are so confident that it's absolutely time to get back playing or are absolutely against it,\" she said. \"You can't with 100 percent certainty say how you might contract it.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A whistle-blower tells a House panel that lives were lost because the administration did not heed warnings about the virus.

Burr steps down from a Senate committee chairmanship as the F.B.I. examines his stock sales amid the outbreak. See more updates Updated 2m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nOn the same day that Pederson received her diagnosis, the PGA Tour, which is eyeing a mid-June return in Texas, sent its members a 37-page document outlining a course of attack that it hopes will provide \"an example for other professional leagues out of the gate\" as they seek to resume suspended seasons and begin delayed ones.\n\nThe tour's plan calls for insulating the players in a kind of made-for-TV diorama that includes their caddies, a limited number of tour personnel, clubhouse staff, swing coaches and independent trainers at each tournament site. They will all be required to submit to pre-event viral testing, daily health questionnaires and temperature checks, and to follow six-foot social distancing guidelines. Tournaments will be off-limits to agents, managers, family members and spectators to reduce potential exposure to the virus.\n\nOff the course, the players and caddies will be encouraged not to stray from the tour's isolated environs, which includes a designated hotel and chartered flights from one tournament city to the next. \"This is an effort to maximize the health and safety of all participants inside the bubble,\" the plan said.\n\nDespite the tour's best laid plans, the protective bubble may burst the first time a player is uncertain about the yardage or the break of a putt and requires a second set of eyes.\n\n\"Your caddie is going to be the one person that it's going to be very difficult to always practice social distancing from,\" Dustin Johnson, the former world No. 1, said Thursday in a teleconference.\n\nAnother player on the teleconference, Rickie Fowler, joked that he'll hold a club like a fencer's sword to keep his caddie, Joe Skovron, from getting too close. When talking over yardage or club selection, Fowler said there will be no more whispering. \"We might have to speak up a little bit more than normal to talk from more than a few feet away,\" he said.\n\nMatthew Wolff, the third player on the call, envisioned a scenario in which nobody comes between a player and his or her caddie.\n\n\"One thing that I heard is that I think it's important to maybe stay with your caddies, or anywhere that you go, your caddies goes as well,\" Wolff said, \"because that way if you're being safe and you're making sure that you don't have it, your caddie would be like following the same rules as you, and if you both get it, then I'm sorry.\"\n\nJohn Wood, who caddies for the nine-time tour winner Matt Kuchar, said he will consider wearing surgical or golf gloves on both hands as an extra precaution but would probably eschew a face covering unless it is required.\n\n\"I won't be able to breathe out there and my glasses will get all fogged up,\" Wood said in a telephone interview.\n\nHe added, \"The only thing I'd worry about is a secondary outbreak.\"\n\nPederson shares Wood's concern. She decided to get tested for Covid-19 after developing a few of the telltale symptoms, including a loss of smell and taste. It took two weeks for her to receive her results.\n\n\"It's not something that any of us should be taking lightly,\" Pederson said, adding, \"It has to be one of those things where there's an absolute, unwavering commitment to ensure that everybody is safe.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Weeks before there was evidence that the coronavirus was spreading in U.S. communities, a 57-year-old woman developed flulike symptoms and abruptly died in her San Jose kitchen, triggering a search for what had killed her. Flu tests were negative. The coroner was baffled. It appeared that the woman had suffered a massive heart attack.\n\nBut tissue samples from the woman, who died on Feb. 6, have now shown that she was infected with the coronavirus -- a startling discovery that has rewritten the timeline of the virus's early spread in the United States and suggests that the optimistic assumptions that drove federal policies over the early weeks of the outbreak were misplaced.\n\nThe unexpected new finding makes clear that the virus was circulating in the Bay Area of California as early as January, even before the federal government began restricting travel from China on Feb. 2. It also raises new questions about where else the virus might have been spreading undetected.\n\nWith little local testing throughout February -- in part because of botched testing kits from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, along with strict guidelines that limited who could get tested -- officials were not aware of the virus transmitting locally in the country until Feb. 26, in Solano County, Calif.\n\nPrevious cases had involved people who had traveled to China, where the outbreak began, or who had been exposed to someone who was sick. But the Feb. 26 case in Solano County was of unexplained origin. Similar cases of community transmission were quickly identified in nearby Santa Clara County, which includes San Jose, as well as in Washington State and Oregon.\n\nThe new test results made public late Tuesday show that even this timeline failed to reveal how long the virus had been circulating. The woman in San Jose had not recently traveled outside the country, the authorities said, and yet she died a full 20 days before the earliest recorded case of community transmission. Another previously unconnected death in Santa Clara County, on Feb. 17, has also now been linked to the coronavirus.\n\n\"Each one of those deaths is probably the tip of an iceberg of unknown size,\" Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County's medical officer, said in an interview.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Wednesday that there could be \"subsequent announcements\" as investigations across the state further examine the early origins of the virus. He said investigators are looking at coroner and autopsy reports going back to December in some counties.\n\nThe earliest case discovered this week, friends and family members said, was of a woman who worked at a Silicon Valley semiconductor manufacturing company with offices worldwide, including in Wuhan, China, the city where the outbreak began.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A doctor says he was removed after pressing for rigorous vetting of treatments embraced by Trump. The timeline of the virus's arrival in the U.S. shifts with the revelation of an early death in California. Not so fast, Trump tells Georgia as it moves to let barbershops and tattoo parlors reopen. See more updates Updated 20m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nA longtime friend said that on Feb. 2, the woman had complained of flulike symptoms. Four days later, he said, she was working from home, still feeling under the weather. Her daughter came home and found her collapsed at the breakfast bar in her kitchen, according to the friend, who asked not to be identified because he did not want the woman's identity to be disclosed.\n\nFamily members said they initially had wondered if she had been suffering from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Her work as a company auditor for her firm, they said, brought her into contact with employees from all over the world and involved frequent travel.\n\nAcross the country, doctors and public health officials have reported earlier cases of serious illnesses and deaths that preceded official diagnoses of the coronavirus. Only now are some of them being examined, and the new findings in Santa Clara County -- suggesting that these suspicious earlier cases were instances of community transmission -- shed light on the understated public health response to the widening outbreak.\n\nHad there been earlier proof that the virus had already found a foothold in the United States, experts said, public health officials would have had more urgency to ramp up testing, prepare hospitals and assemble protective gear that might have prevented infections among health care workers and others.\n\nInstead, the focus in February was on quarantining thousands of travelers who were returning from China in the hope that infections could be identified, isolated and contained.\n\n\"What in the end was that really going to accomplish if it was already here?\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease specialist and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nOfficials in Santa Clara County said on Wednesday that the new cases were among more than a dozen deaths in the county that the medical examiner had suspicions about and ordered investigated.\n\nDr. Michelle Jorden, the Santa Clara County medical examiner-coroner, said the case of the San Jose woman had piqued her curiosity, leading the county to examine it further. \"It was when we were looking at the microscopic tissues and we decided -- whoa! -- this still looks infectious, and we are going to send the tissue to the C.D.C.,\" she said.\n\nTissue samples were sent to Atlanta for testing in mid-March, but the results confirming the coronavirus did not come back until Tuesday.\n\nIt is unclear how the virus reached the people in these earliest deaths. In January, health officials identified a series of people who had traveled from China and then tested positive for the virus, but those cases were largely contained. At the time, President Trump said he did not think the virus would become a pandemic and declared that public health authorities \"have it totally under control.\"\n\nFederal health officials initially limited testing largely to those who had traveled from Wuhan, then expanded it to people coming from mainland China. Mr. Trump ordered travel restrictions, including health screenings for U.S. residents returning from mainland China, that began on Feb. 2.\n\nBy Feb. 26, Mr. Trump claimed that the limited number of cases in the country \"within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero. That's a pretty good job we've done.\"\n\nThat was the same day community transmission began to emerge, first in California, then in the Portland, Ore., area, and near Seattle.\n\nDr. Cody led the effort to issue the nation's first stay-at-home orders on March 16. But she said she would have issued them even earlier had she known about the February deaths.\n\n\"I think if we had had widespread testing earlier and if we had been able to document the level of transmission in the county, if we had understood then that people were already dying, we probably would have acted earlier than we did,\" Dr. Cody said. She said officials had been hearing about a lot of people who were ill but did not meet the criteria for testing.\n\n\"It was just sort of this understanding that the testing capacity at the C.D.C. was very, very, very limited,\" she said. When doctors would call them with suspicious cases, she said, county health authorities would have to explain that the cases did not qualify for testing.\n\n\"It got increasingly uncomfortable, right?\" she said. \"It didn't make any sense. How are you going to detect community transmission if you're only testing people with a travel history? Well you're not.\"\n\nThere have been signs that the virus established itself long before community transmission was recognized.\n\nResearchers believe that cases circulating in New York probably began in mid-February. Trevor Bedford, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who studies the spread and evolution of viruses, has estimated that an outbreak in the Seattle area likely has roots back to about Feb. 1, or perhaps could be linked to the first reported case in the United States -- a man who flew from China to the Seattle area on Jan. 15 and later tested positive.\n\nBut, until now, the first known deaths from the coronavirus were recorded in the Seattle area on Feb. 26.\n\nWhether and how the early cases might be related to later cases remains unclear. C.D.C. scientists are attempting to discern the genetic sequences of the virus from the three cases, which can be challenging when tissues are obtained after death.\n\nSo far, only relatively short pieces of genetic material have been obtained, said Kristen Nordlund, a spokeswoman for the agency. That was enough to confirm the diagnosis, but not large enough to detect the specific subtype of the virus, which could help identify potential links to other cases.\n\nDr. Charles Chiu, who has been examining the genetic signatures of the viruses circulating in the Bay Area, had previous suspicions about the Santa Clara cases. While many of the viruses landing in the United States have several mutations compared with the original strain in Wuhan, one of the cases examined at the end of February in Santa Clara had only one mutation.\n\nThat indicated that the cases there had a strong link to the original Wuhan strain.\n\n\"It suggested that it was an early introduction,\" Dr. Chiu said. Even still, he was surprised that a virus-related death occurred as early as it did in February. He is interested in seeing the genomic sequence of the new cases, although he suspects they are likely connected to the larger cluster in Santa Clara linked by the same signature mutation.\n\nThe virus has an incubation period of up to 14 days, and people can be infectious before symptoms begin. Because the person who died on Feb. 6 had been ill for several days, it is possible that she could have transmitted the infection to others as early as January.\n\n\"This offers evidence of what many of us in the field had been saying,\" said Dr. Adalja, the infectious disease specialist. \"That restricting testing was going to miss cases that could have a chain of transmission that ended up with somebody dying.''\n\nThomas Fuller reported from San Francisco, Mike Baker from Seattle, Shawn Hubler from Sacramento and Sheri Fink from New York.

In the United States, only one -- remdesivir -- has been shown to be effective in speeding recovery.\n\nIn the new study, published in The Lancet, researchers at six public hospitals in Hong Kong and the University of Hong Kong followed 127 adults with Covid-19, including 86 on the three-drug cocktail and 41 in a comparison group.\n\nTheir study was a preliminary Phase 2 trial, intended to see if a treatment works. (It does not determine whether the treatment is better than other options, but there are few other options for the coronavirus.)\n\nThe patients who were started on the cocktail within seven days of having their first symptoms stopped shedding the virus -- meaning they were recovering and no longer infectious -- earlier than patients in the comparison group, the researchers found.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The F.D.A. approved the first home saliva test for the coronavirus.

The patients on the triple-drug combination also appeared to get better faster, and they had significantly shorter hospital stays than the comparison group, according to the study.\n\nIncluded in the cocktail were three antiviral drugs: lopinavir-ritonavir (sold under the brand name Kaletra), taken orally; ribavirin, an antiviral drug used to treat hepatitis C, also taken orally; and interferon beta 1b, an injectable drug used to treat multiple sclerosis that regulates inflammation and suppresses viral growth.\n\nSome experts have suggested interferon may boost the body's ability to fight the new coronavirus.\n\nParticipants in the comparison group of the trial were treated only with lopinavir-ritonavir, which some physicians have stopped using after a recent clinical trial found it did not significantly improve outcomes in severely ill Covid-19 patients.\n\nPatients given the three-drug cocktail tested negative for the coronavirus within seven days, on average, compared with an average 12 days among those treated with the one drug. The cocktail also cut the duration of Covid-19 symptoms in half, to four days from eight days.\n\n\"This is good news,\" said Dr. Sarah Shalhoub, an infectious disease specialist at Western University in Ontario, Canada, who wrote a commentary accompanying the article. \"It tells us that patients get better faster, and the time they need to be hospitalized is shorter, and their viral shedding is of shorter duration.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nBut she cautioned that all of the patients in the study had mild to moderate disease, and the important question is whether the drug combination will benefit critically ill patients.\n\n\"Whether these results will be reproducible in the patients who require a lot of oxygen and end up in the intensive care unit is a different story,\" Dr. Shalhoub said.\n\n\"We can't extrapolate from these results and assume they would apply to patients on ventilators or those who are expected to go on a ventilator soon.\"\n\nThe study was designed as a randomized trial: Patients who enrolled were assigned at random to the triple-drug therapy group or the comparison group, and the participants in the two groups were similar.\n\nThe triple-drug treatment appeared to be safe. There was no difference between the two groups in side effects, which included fever, nausea and diarrhea, though one patient in the comparison group had to discontinue treatment because of liver problems.\n\nA limitation of the study was that it was an open-label trial, meaning that both the researchers and the patients knew which drugs were being given. This can subtly bias assessments of the data. In addition, some patients who were admitted seven days or more after their symptoms started were not offered interferon, but were analyzed as part of the combination group.\n\nPrevious research has found that a combination of lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin significantly reduced respiratory failure and death in patients with another coronavirus, the SARS virus. Interferon beta-1b has been shown to reduce viral load and improve lung problems in animal studies of the MERS virus, also a coronavirus.\n\nThe authors plan to conduct a larger trial to examine the effectiveness of the cocktail in critically ill Covid-19 patients, and they may also evaluate the effectiveness of interferon alone.",

        "body": "Here's what we know about the mysterious and frightening ailment that doctors are seeing in a small but growing number of very young Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe coronavirus has largely spared children. Most confirmed to be infected have had only mild symptoms. But doctors in Europe and the United States have recently reported a troubling new phenomenon: Some children are becoming seriously ill with symptoms that can involve inflammation in the skin, eyes, blood vessels and heart.\n\nThe condition, which doctors are calling \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome,\" is so new that there are still many unanswered questions about how and why it affects children. Here's a summary of what is and isn't known so far.\n\nWhat are the symptoms?\n\nSymptoms can include fever, rash, reddish eyes, swollen lymph nodes and sharp abdominal pain. They do not usually include two common hallmarks of Covid-19: cough and shortness of breath.\n\nThe syndrome can bear some resemblance to a rare childhood illness called Kawasaki disease, but as doctors learn more, they are emphasizing that the two conditions are not the same.\n\nBoth involve a surge of inflammation in the body and can have serious effects on the heart. But Dr. Steven Kernie, chief of pediatric critical care medicine at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, said the new syndrome appears to affect the heart differently. While Kawasaki disease can produce coronary aneurysms when left untreated, the new syndrome seems to mostly involve inflammation of coronary arteries and other blood vessels.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Nearly 1 in 5 young children in the United States are not getting enough to eat, new research found. Trump contradicts his administration's plans to shut down the coronavirus task force. A firm set up by two G.O.P. operatives said they could supply medical gear. Customers are still waiting. See more updates Updated 2m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAnd though shock is a rare complication of Kawasaki disease, the new syndrome has sent many of the children into a kind of toxic shock with very low blood pressure and an inability of the blood to effectively circulate oxygen and nutrients to the body's organs, Dr. Kernie said.\n\nThe coronavirus primarily affects adults by entering cells in their lungs and replicating, often causing respiratory failure. But this childhood syndrome \"seems to be less a lung-specific disease,\" Dr. Kernie said.\n\nWhile most of the hospitalized children with the syndrome need some additional oxygen, and a few have required ventilators, the effect on the lungs seems to be driven by an inflammatory response that affects many other parts of the body as well.\n\nCan it be fatal?\n\nSo far, one death has been reported, that of a 14-year-old boy in England, according to a study published Wednesday in the journal Lancet.\n\nHow common is it?\n\nThere is no good data on how many children have developed the syndrome, but it appears to be a small number so far. Interviews with doctors in New York City and Long Island suggest there have been at least 50 cases of children treated in area hospitals for the condition. A handful of cases have been reported in other states, including Louisiana, Mississippi and California. There have been at least 50 cases reported in European countries, including Britain, France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy.\n\nHow old are the children who have gotten it?\n\nHospitals have seen cases in children of all ages, from infants to older teenagers.\n\nWhat should parents do if their child has symptoms?\n\nDr. Katie Schafer, a general pediatrician who has a private practice in Birmingham, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit, said that because there were still many unknowns about the condition, parents of children who have symptoms should take them to pediatricians rather than assuming that a rash or fever or abdominal pain is only a sign of a typical childhood illness.\n\n\"This is presenting very much like a common childhood illness, which it is not,\" she said. \"This is a novel diagnosis that doesn't exactly have a name, doesn't exactly have a timeline, doesn't exactly have a protocol. We didn't learn about this in medical school.\"\n\nHow do we know it's related to the coronavirus?\n\nMany of the children who have become sick with the syndrome either tested positive for the coronavirus at the time of their symptoms, or had positive antibody tests suggesting they may have been infected weeks earlier. Dr. Schafer said it was possible that \"this may be a post-infection condition and not necessarily part of the acute phase of Covid.\"\n\nWhat is the treatment?\n\nTreatments have included steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, high-dose aspirin and antibiotics, as well as supportive oxygen through the nose, a mask or, in the most serious cases, a ventilator. Most children who are intubated can be removed from the ventilators within a few days, doctors said.\n\nWill there be long-term effects?\n\nIt's unclear. Children who have had serious effects on their hearts will need to be monitored by cardiologists in case there is residual heart damage. Others will undoubtedly need to be followed by their pediatricians to keep track of any lingering effects.\n\nWhy would children get this and not adults?\n\nChildren may be at greater risk for this syndrome because their immune systems are not fully developed, Dr. Kernie said. But there are no clues yet as to why some children get sick and not others. Many of the children have been previously healthy. And the syndrome doesn't seem to run in families, but Dr. Kernie's hospital and others are doing genetic testing to see if there is a predisposition or genetic reason one child becomes very sick while siblings seem unscathed.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "body": "In a medical research project nearly unrivaled in its ambition and scope, volunteers worldwide are rolling up their sleeves to receive experimental vaccines against the coronavirus -- only months after the virus was identified.\n\nCompanies like Inovio and Pfizer have begun early tests of candidates in people to determine whether their vaccines are safe. Researchers at the University of Oxford in England are testing vaccines in human subjects, too, and say they could have a one ready for emergency use as soon as September.\n\nModerna on Monday announced encouraging results of a safety trial of its vaccine in eight volunteers. There were no published data, but the news alone sent hopes soaring.\n\nAnimal studies have raised expectations, too. Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center on Wednesday published research showing that a prototype vaccine effectively protected monkeys from infection with the virus.\n\nThe findings will pave the way to development of a human vaccine, said the investigators. They have already partnered with Janssen, a division of Johnson and Johnson.\n\nIn labs around the world, there is now cautious optimism that a coronavirus vaccine, and perhaps more than one, will be ready sometime next year.\n\nScientists are exploring not just one approach to creating the vaccine, but at least four. So great is the urgency that they are combining trial phases and shortening a process that usually takes years, sometimes more than a decade.\n\nThe coronavirus itself has turned out to be clumsy prey, a stable pathogen unlikely to mutate significantly and dodge a vaccine.\n\n\"It's an easier target, which is terrific news,\" said Michael Farzan, a virologist at Scripps Research in Jupiter, Fla.\n\nAn effective vaccine will be crucial to ending the pandemic, which has sickened at least 4.7 million worldwide and killed at least 318,000. Widespread immunity would reopen the door to lives without social distancing and face masks.\n\n\"What people don't realize is that normally vaccine development takes many years, sometimes decades,\" said Dr. Dan Barouch, a virologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston who led the monkey trials. \"And so trying to compress the whole vaccine process into 12 to 18 months is really unheard of.\"\n\n\"If that happens, it will be the fastest vaccine development program ever in history.\"\n\nMore than one hundred research teams around the world are taking aim at the virus from multiple angles.\n\nModerna's vaccine is based on a relatively new mRNA technology that delivers bits of the virus's genes into human cells. The goal is for cells to begin making a viral protein that the immune system recognizes as foreign. The body builds defenses against that protein, priming itself to attack if the actual coronavirus invades.\n\nSome vaccine makers, including Inovio, are developing vaccines based on DNA variations of this approach.\n\nBut the technology used by both companies has never produced a vaccine approved for clinical use, let alone one that can be made in industrial quantities. Moderna was criticized for making rosy predictions, based on a handful of patients, without providing any scientific data.\n\nOther research teams have turned to more traditional strategies.\n\nSome scientists are using harmless viruses to deliver coronavirus genes into cells, forcing them to produce proteins that may teach the immune system to watch out for the coronavirus. CanSino Biologics, a company in China, has begun human testing of a coronavirus vaccine that relies on this approach, as has the University of Oxford team.\n\nOther traditional approaches rely on fragments of a coronavirus protein to make a vaccine, while some use killed, or inactivated, versions of the whole coronavirus. In China, such vaccines have already entered human trials.\n\nFlorian Krammer, a virologist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, predicted that at least 20 additional vaccine candidates will make their way into clinical trials in the weeks to come.\n\n\"I'm not worried at all about it,\" he said of the prospects for a new vaccine.\n\nMany of these vaccines will stumble as the trials progress. As more people are inoculated, some candidates will fail to protect against the virus, and side effects will become more apparent.\n\nBut from what scientists are learning about the coronavirus, it ought to be a relatively easy target.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Medical experts show cautious optimism that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready sometime next year. A prototype vaccine has protected monkeys from the virus, researches have found. See more updates Updated 2m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe coronavirus sports tempting targets on its surface, unique \"spike\" proteins the pathogen needs to enter human cells. The immune system readily learns to recognize these proteins, it appears, and to attack them, killing the virus.\n\nViruses can challenge vaccine makers by mutating rapidly, changing shape so that antibodies that work on one viral strain fail on another. Thankfully, the new coronavirus seems to be a slow mutator, and a vaccine that proves effective in trials should work anywhere in the world.\n\nHow Coronavirus Mutates and Spreads\n\nThe virus has mutated. But that doesn't mean it's getting deadlier.\n\nWhen work on a coronavirus vaccine started, some researchers worried that antibodies actually might worsen Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. But in early studies, no serious risks have emerged.\n\n\"That doesn't mean that there won't be, but so far there hasn't been any indication, so I'm cautiously optimistic on that point,\" said Dr. Alyson Kelvin, a researcher at the Canadian Center for Vaccinology and Dalhousie University.\n\nScaling Up\n\nEnsuring that vaccines are safe and effective demands large trials that require careful planning and execution. If successful vaccines emerge from those trials, someone's going to have to make an awful lot of them.\n\nAlmost everyone on the planet is vulnerable to the new coronavirus. Each person may need two doses of a new vaccine to receive protective immunity. That's 16 billion doses.\n\n\"When companies promise of delivering a vaccine in a year or less, I am not sure what stage they are talking about,\" said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunobiologist at Yale University. \"I doubt they are talking about global distributions in billions of doses.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nWhat should I do with my 401(k)?\n\nWatching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions -- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that \"free money.\"\n\nManufacturing vaccines is profoundly more complex than manufacturing, say, shoes or bicycles. Vaccines typically require large vats in which their ingredients are grown, and these have to be maintained in sterile conditions. Also, no factories have ever churned out millions of doses of approved vaccines made with the cutting-edge technology being tested by companies like Inovio and Moderna.\n\nFacilities have sprung up in recent years to make viral-vector vaccines, including a Johnson & Johnson plant in the Netherlands. But meeting pandemic demand would be an enormous challenge. Manufacturers have the most experience mass-producing inactivated vaccines, made with killed viruses, so this type may be the easiest to produce in large quantities.\n\nBut there cannot be just one vaccine. If that were to happen, the company that made it would have no chance of meeting the world's demand.\n\n\"The hope is that they will all, at some level, be effective, and certainly that's important because we need more than just one,\" said Emilio Emini, a director of the vaccine program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is providing financial support to many competing vaccine efforts.\n\nAs part of a public-private partnership the White House calls Operation Warp Speed, the Trump administration has promised to design a kind of parallel manufacturing track to run alongside the clinical trials, building up capacity well before trials are concluded, in hopes that one or more vaccines could be distributed immediately upon approval.\n\nPresident Trump said on Friday that the goal of the project was to distribute a vaccine \"prior to the end of the year.\" To do that, Mr. Trump is relying on the Defense Department to manage the manufacturing logistics related to vaccine development.\n\nBut in an interview on Thursday, Gen. Gustave F. Perna, who will manage the manufacturing logistics, said discussions about the equipment and facilities needed for production were just beginning.\n\nHe described his work as a \"math problem\": how to get 300 million doses of a vaccine that doesn't yet exist to Americans -- by January.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nFinding the supplies and planning their distribution would occur at the same time, he said. \"I need to have syringes,\" Gen. Perna said. \"I need to have wipes, right? I need to have band-aids. I need to have the vaccine.\"\n\nHe added: \"Now, how am I going to distribute it? What is it going to be distributed in? What do I need to order now to make sure I have the distribution capability? The small bottles, the trucks.\"\n\nDr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, said that seemingly minor aspects of production and distribution could complicate progress later on.\n\n\"This is on a scale we've never seen since the polio vaccine,\" he said. \"It's the little things like the syringes, the needles, the glass vials. All of that has to be thought about. You don't want something that seems so simple to be the bottleneck in your vaccination program.\"\n\nA coronavirus vaccine doesn't yet exist, but already there are questions about who will be able to afford it.\n\nAt the World Health Assembly meeting this week, a proposal from the European Union was adopted recommending a voluntary patent pool, which would put pressure on companies to give up their monopolies on vaccines they've developed.\n\nLast week, Oxfam organized an open letter from 140 world leaders and experts calling for a \"people's vaccine,\" which would be \"made available for all people, in all countries, free of charge.\"\n\n\"These vaccines have to be a public good,\" said Helen Clark, the former president of New Zealand who signed the open letter. \"We're not safe till everyone is safe.\"\n\nSui-Lee Wee contributed reporting from Singapore.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAs the Covid-19 pandemic spread across the world, many in the United States self-quarantined, and thousands of people died, one section of the daily newspaper seemed wholly untouched by the cataclysmic events: The comics pages. Characters carried on much as they ever did -- car-pooling, going to school, wandering into neighbors' houses. Each comic strip felt like a time capsule from the impossibly faraway era of 2019.\n\nOne reason for that cultural disconnection was the lead time in comics syndication: Unlike internet cartoonists, who can respond immediately to current events, creators of daily newspaper strips work about two weeks in advance, sometimes longer. And there can be many motivations for artists to exercise caution, from not knowing how to adjust a lighthearted formula to not wanting to trivialize a widespread tragedy. But in recent weeks, when a handful of daily newspaper cartoonists began running strips inspired by the coronavirus, it felt unusually vibrant and immediate; we spoke with six of them.\n\nThese are edited excerpts from the conversations.\n\nLio\n\nApril 1\n\n\"I thought I was going to distract people with gags that have nothing to do with the coronavirus because that's my job, to give people an escape,\" said Mark Tatulli, creator of the strips \"Lio\" and \"Heart of the City.\" \"But it was permeating my life and it was all I could think about, to the point where it was crippling. It found its way onto the page.\" \"Lio\" is a dialogue-free strip that frequently plays with the format's conventions; Tatulli discovered that the pandemic introduced new visual shorthand, such as the suddenly recognizable spiky ball that is the Covid-19 viral particle: When Lio blows bubbles, his bubbles float away looking like the spiky virions. \"Here's the irony of this: I got new material,\" Tatulli observed. \"I hate to say I'm benefiting from it creatively, but I am. These are the things that shake up our society.\"\n\nCurtis\n\nApril 7\n\n\"I've touched on social events infrequently,\" said the \"Curtis\" cartoonist Ray Billingsley. \"But I could see it getting worse and worse and I knew it was going to touch society so much that I had to do something about it. I wanted to write about not what the pandemic was doing worldwide, but how it affected one family.\" So Curtis's family, living in a cramped apartment, relieves tension by making pancakes -- but then their joyful mood is shattered by the news that Curtis's schoolteacher has tested positive for the coronavirus. \"I'm about characterization and continuity,\" Billingsley said. \"I hope that 'Curtis' is an emotional experience.\" This strip about Anne Frank was inspired by a friend of Billingsley's who complained about being unable to go to the movies. \"As Americans, we're very much spoiled,\" Billingsley commented. \"People tend to forget the past, and it wasn't even that far past.\"\n\nTank McNamara\n\nApril 10\n\n\"When they shut down sports, that's kind of unnerving if you do a comic strip about sports,\" said Bill Hinds, who has been drawing \"Tank McNamara\" since 1974 and writing it since 2012. \"I was able to move to Tank's personal life, rather than do too much on sports, because I have no idea what's going to happen with sports.\" Even so, the world can change rapidly in the two weeks between Hinds finishing a strip and it seeing print; a sequence where Tank visits his neighbors to do a jigsaw puzzle (with face masks and latex gloves) was out of step with the best social distancing practices by the time it saw print. Hinds said he's had to work to find the right tone, observing, \"I like to play off craziness and I don't know how appropriate that is right now.\" But he said his readers haven't objected so far: \"People were more angry about the Astros than they were about the pandemic. That makes sense -- nobody understands the pandemic.\"\n\nF Minus\n\nApril 6\n\n\"I have always thought of myself as kind of an anxious person, and suddenly everyone has that worldview,\" said the \"F Minus\" cartoonist Tony Carrillo. \"I've been making jokes about existential dread for a long time, but all of a sudden, everyone's looking for that kind of humor.\" While some of his recent panels are clearly about life under quarantine, others fit into his usual themes of ennui and social awkwardness. As a cartoonist, he noted, \"It's nothing new to sit down and to have to make a funny comic regardless of what horrific things are going on in the world.\" Carrillo said that he's well-prepared for this cultural moment: \"I have a number of comics about the growing pains of adjusting to a hermitlike existence. Fourteen years of working from home has put me in a unique position to know what everyone is dealing with.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Businesses reopen in some states, but conflicting messages stoke confusion.

See more updates Updated 20m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York La Cucaracha\n\nApril 7\n\n\"My strip is very news-oriented and political, so there was no way that I was not going to comment on the quarantine,\" said Lalo Alcaraz, creator of \"La Cucaracha.\" \"My strip is about what the Latino community is going through -- all the angles.\" Since Alcaraz's wife is a schoolteacher, he said, \"It felt good to comment on the teachers' remote-teaching and being appreciated more by parents who are having trouble logging into a website or paying attention to their own kids.\" The idea for this strip, however, was pitched by his art assistant, Joaquin Junco. Alcaraz said, \"We saw the anxiety surrounding people wearing masks inside of businesses.\" Alcaraz has found it easier to write strips about coronavirus's societal impact; jokes about actual illness have felt inappropriate to him. He is used to a steady drumbeat of hate mail, even on topics that he doesn't find controversial, such as praise for farmworkers, but he reported that he's gotten almost no negative feedback lately: \"My usual haters, hopefully they're not sick.\"\n\nPearls Before Swine\n\nApril 7\n\nStephan Pastis, creator of \"Pearls Before Swine,\" was traveling in Colombia in March when the country announced it was shutting its borders. He scrambled for a flight home to California; once he returned, he did a week of strips where he pretended that he had been stranded in South America without art supplies, drawing with pencil on a yellow legal pad to make his work look even sketchier than usual. \"It could very well have happened,\" he said. \"It's always confusing what part of my life is real.\" While Pastis normally works nine months ahead of schedule, he has been swapping in new topical material for strips he completed last year. \"Other than maybe 9/11, I can't think of another time when every single person was thinking of the exact same thing, and if you're not reflecting that, what are you doing?\" he asked. He considers the reruns of classic comic strips like \"Peanuts\" to be a sin against the medium, saying, \"You have strips on the page by great artists and they cannot speak to what we are doing right now, because they are repeats. I care about the comics, and I want them to stay relevant.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nFaced with a growing coronavirus threat, the governor of North Dakota last month posed a question to a friend from his private-sector days. The friend, a software engineer, had once created a location-tracking app for football fans at North Dakota State University who liked to meet up when traveling to big games.\n\n\"Can you track people for Covid?\" asked the governor, Douglas Burgum. Within days, the engineer, Tim Brookins, had reworked the football app to do just that, he recalled in an interview. The app is now being used in North and South Dakota as part of statewide efforts to ramp up contact tracing for people infected with the coronavirus.\n\nThe new app is part of a worldwide scramble to deploy smartphone tools to rein in the pandemic. If the virus's path can be tracked, even predicted, the hope is that more people will be able to resume at least part of their normal routines -- and fewer will need to confine themselves at home.\n\nAt their core, the apps are intended to gather information about the movements of people who have tested positive for the virus, alert others who might have crossed their paths, and in some cases make sure infected people stay quarantined. They use smartphone technologies, such as GPS and Bluetooth, to collect and share the data, which make them agile and easy to use but also provide an enticing target for hackers or government surveillance.\n\nSeveral dozen countries, states, universities and companies are racing to develop and begin using the digital tools, which public health experts said could improve person-to-person contact tracing but are not a panacea. The mad dash has left some places with a confusing mishmash of options, and has some computer security researchers worried about vulnerabilities in hastily written software.\n\nThere is no evidence that the apps will be effective without widespread testing for the virus and without enormous numbers of voluntary participants, which could be hampered by years of privacy scandals involving both governments and companies.\n\nAware of the problems, Apple and Google announced this month they were creating software that public health authorities could use to make apps. The tool will allow different apps to work together and has the support of many privacy experts. But several technology law scholars expressed concern that even well-intentioned digital surveillance tools could become problematic and are difficult to withdraw.\n\n\"We've already learned what moving fast and breaking things can do to society,\" said Woodrow Hartzog, a professor of law and computer science at Northeastern University, referring to the negative consequences of a tech mind-set that values speed and disruption above all else.\n\nOnly 25,000 people in North Dakota, about 3 percent of the population, have downloaded the state's app, which before last week was available only for iPhones. Last month, Singapore introduced a voluntary contact-tracing app, but only about 1.1 million people -- 20 percent of the population -- have downloaded it. Norway's app has caught on more quickly, with nearly 30 percent of residents signing up for it since it was released about a week and a half ago.\n\nStill, a recent study by epidemiologists at Oxford University estimated that 60 percent of the population in a given area would need to use an automated app that traces contacts and notifies users of exposure, combined with other tactics such as broader testing and the quarantining of the most vulnerable people, for the app to contain the virus.\n\nLatest Updates: Economy Global stocks are mixed as investors await answers. Airbus reports a loss of more than $500 million, citing 'gravest crisis.' A report on the U.S. economy is going to be bad, and there is worse to come. See more updates Updated 50m ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nWhile some compliance is better than none, the researchers found, low rates of adoption in many areas suggest voluntary programs may not provide a breakthrough.\n\n\"With 10 percent, 20 percent, 30 percent uptake of the app, you get a progressive reduction in the size of the epidemic,\" said Christophe Fraser, an expert in infectious disease dynamics and control at the Big Data Institute at Oxford, who has advised Britain's National Health Service on an app it is developing.\n\nDespite the uncertainty, some health experts say the virus spreads so quickly and stealthily that there is an urgent need for new mechanisms to combat it. Even with partial participation, for example, the apps can allow traditional contact tracing to focus on people without phones, who are often poorer, older and more vulnerable. Only about half of Americans age 65 or over have a smartphone.\n\n\"Automated contact tracing is a big idea, an ambitious idea,\" said Dr. Louise Ivers, the executive director of the Center for Global Health at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, who has been working with a team at M.I.T. to develop contact-tracing technology. \"But it's important to be ambitious right now.\"\n\nOn the Trail of the Pandemic\n\nThe proliferation of coronavirus apps has trailed the spread of the pandemic around the globe. Often, the differences among apps are technical ones but can create vast differences in their security, privacy and effectiveness.\n\nIn February, China began requiring residents in more than 200 cities to download a health code app that automatically dictates whether people must quarantine. Location data is sent to the government from the phones, but it is unclear how the quarantine decisions are made.\n\nBy contrast, Singapore's app uses Bluetooth rather than location data to identify nearby phones, and the information is stored on the phones unless a person tests positive for the virus and agrees to share the data with contact tracers, who can then notify others who may have been exposed.\n\nIn Norway, the app sends data from the phone's GPS and Bluetooth to central servers that can be accessed by government health authorities. A new law mandates that the information be used only for the pandemic, and that it be deleted every 30 days.\n\nTora Sanden Doskeland, a graduate student in Norway, said she had downloaded the app despite her concerns about governments and corporations that collect data on people.\n\n\"I'm not an expert in this disease or technology or law, but I trust people who are, and I believe the government is relying on them when it tells us to make this choice,\" she said. \"There are pros and cons, but we need to do something together.\"\n\nNorth Dakota's app, Care19, uses Wi-Fi, cell towers and GPS to gauge people's locations, usually within about 175 feet, making it much less accurate than Bluetooth-based apps. This means it is now useful only to help patients tell contact tracers where they were while they were contagious.\n\nAn analysis by The New York Times confirmed that the app sends people's location data to a private server hosted on Microsoft's cloud platform. Mr. Brookins, the developer, said only he and one other person have access to the server, and health officials can get the data only of people who test positive for the coronavirus and then agree to share it.\n\nIndia, which, like the United States, is relying on a combination of state and federal efforts to tackle the pandemic, is a case study in the rush for new technologies.\n\nA quarantine app in the Indian state of Maharashtra, which includes the country's most populous city, Mumbai, uses GPS data collected from people's smartphones to create a virtual perimeter around their homes. If users move beyond their permitted radius, the app notifies local authorities.\n\nAnother app, called Quarantine Watch, in the state of Karnataka, also records the locations of certain people under quarantine and requires them to take selfies to prove they are staying home.\n\nIn an effort to coordinate public health surveillance, the central government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced its own contact-tracing app in early April. The app, called Aarogya Setu -- or health care bridge -- uses smartphone location data and Bluetooth to log people's travel routes and the other phones they encounter. With urging from Mr. Modi, more than 77 million people, about 5.6 percent of the population, have downloaded it so far. Local authorities are now promoting the Modi government's app along with their own.\n\nAn expert advising the Modi government on its app said it had already helped public health monitors pinpoint hot spots for the virus and speed their door-to-door visits to certain neighborhoods to alert residents, many of whom did not own smartphones.\n\nBut civil liberties groups have warned that the rush to adopt virus-tracking technologies may entrench new forms of government surveillance and social control even if the apps do not prove effective in fighting the coronavirus.\n\n\"They just pilot it out, see how it works and, as the debate is taking place, they scale the project -- and once it's scaled, then it becomes a lot harder to roll back,\" said Sidarth Deb, the policy and parliamentary counsel for the Internet Freedom Foundation, a digital rights group in New Delhi.\n\nAn analysis by The Times found that the Quarantine Watch app, which is available on Google Android, lacked common security measures, and that the Android version of the Aarogya Setu app leaked a user's latitude and longitude to a YouTube server.\n\nGoogle, which owns YouTube, said that the Aarogya Setu app appeared to have sent the location data inadvertently and that YouTube would delete it. The app developers said on Sunday they had fixed the problem. An official in Karnataka said that the app used essential security measures and that the issues identified by The Times had been resolved.\n\nPreventing Surveillance\n\nThe wide range of efforts, and their varying quality, have led to calls for industry standards related to privacy and other matters.\n\nWhether to send data to central health authorities is the biggest sticking point.\n\nTechnologists who focus on privacy say the best way to prevent governments from using data to surveil people is to never let them have it in the first place.\n\n\"You can look at what happened after 9/11,\" said James Larus, the dean of the School of Computer and Communications Science at EPFL, a science-focused university in Switzerland. \"There were all these consequences for privacy made possible by a crisis.\"\n\nBut centralized collection of the data may be essential for effective contact tracing, others argue.\n\n\"Having location history helps you better identify where infections might be, helps you identify the hot spots,\" said Lalitesh Katragadda, the founder of Indihood, a group developing technologies for underserved populations, and an adviser on the Indian government's app.\n\nSome officials in Europe have said they also want information about nearby phones to be shared with public health officers, so they can then contact those people personally.\n\nThe Apple and Google program, which draws on ideas from Singapore and from academics, aims to answer the question in favor of privacy experts. The app software will keep track of nearby phones using secret codes, but the data will stay on users' phones. When people test positive for the coronavirus, they can allow their own codes to be put on a list. The phones of all other users will regularly check that list and provide an alert if there is a risk of infection.\n\nSo far, the companies have refused to change their system to allow governments to collect data about people's contacts, and it is unclear whether the gathering of more general location data will be possible. On Friday, the companies changed the name of their system -- to \"exposure notification\" from \"contact tracing\" -- to underline its focus on directly alerting people.\n\nAnother point of contention surrounds how virus symptoms are reported. Should people voluntarily self-report, or should health workers do so after confirming a diagnosis?\n\nAnd some significant technological questions need to be worked out, including making sure that the Bluetooth detection accounts for when people are separated by walls and that the apps do not drain batteries or interfere with headphones. Engineers working on programs at M.I.T. and Stanford said they thought the problems were surmountable.\n\nA key to making the apps successful, proponents said, is persuading people that the apps will help keep them safe and allow them to emerge from lockdowns.\n\n\"When you hear people saying there will never be takeup of the app,\" said Dr. Fraser, the Oxford epidemiologist, \"they are talking like we are not in the world we are currently in.\"",

        "body": "In March, New York City began moving homeless shelter residents believed to have Covid-19 to \"isolation units\" within existing facilities. In April, it began using the city's inventory of empty hotels, which were supposed to be for residents who weren't yet sick enough to need hospital care. There was plenty of space available; the problem was how to staff it. For one hotel, the city contracted with Housing Works, a nonprofit focused on homelessness and H.I.V./AIDS. Housing Works brought in Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, which serves L.G.B.T.Q. New Yorkers. Callen-Lorde's staff learned the hotel's exact location, in Queens, late in the morning on Friday, April 3. There were 133 rooms, expected to hold more than 170 patients. They had only a few hours to get the place ready: The first patients would begin arriving that night.\n\nThe chief nursing officer of Callen-Lorde, a 38-year-old named Anthony Fortenberry, already had his hands full. He had spent the first weeks of the coronavirus pandemic trying to build a system to track the center's thousands of patients, even as their care shifted from Callen-Lorde's offices in the Manhattan neighborhood of Chelsea to the internet. The center's origins trace back to the era following the Stonewall uprising, when a single doctor offered free health care, including methadone treatment, contraception and pregnancy counseling, from a small clinic on St. Marks Place in the city's East Village. Today the center has four different sites, with 66,000 square feet of offices, and serves some 20,000 people a year. One-quarter are H.I.V.-positive, and could be at greater risk of illness or death from Covid-19. Many deal with issues surrounding mental health, substance abuse or lack of housing. A number were shut out from traditional medical care because they lacked insurance; others decided to self-exile from a medical system that treated their sexual identities with confusion or even scorn.\n\n\"I would tell them that they needed to go to the E.R.,\" Fortenberry recalls of some transgender patients. \"They would say: 'Absolutely not. I would rather die than be misgendered or mistreated. It is not worth going through the trauma.'\" According to a 2017 poll, 18 percent of L.G.B.T.Q. Americans say that fear of discrimination has kept them from seeking medical care.\n\nIn March, at least, much of Fortenberry's work had involved doing everything possible to keep H.I.V.-positive patients away from hospital emergency rooms, where those who didn't already have the coronavirus would be at the greatest risk of contracting it. Callen-Lorde's main storefront clinic in Chelsea had cut back on staff, but Fortenberry continued to ride the subway from his home in Queens and work out of his windowless basement office, and a handful of other staff members remained on-site to advise patients who thought they might have Covid-19, or those with mental-health or substance-abuse issues who weren't yet aware that the city was in the process of shutting down. Hundreds of patients were calling in each day to ask about Covid-19-like symptoms; over the weekend of March 28, more than 700 voice mail messages were left in what Fortenberry calls \"a run on the pharmacy,\" as patients rushed to stock up on medication in case the quarantine disrupted supplies. Some patients who were being treated for H.I.V. or gender transition were living with family members or roommates who were unaware -- they needed to make arrangements to pick up medication at Callen-Lorde's pharmacy or have it discreetly delivered to their homes.\n\nCallen-Lorde continued monitoring patients through telemedicine, often laboriously chasing them down by phone and email. The center kept a close eye on its dwindling supplies of gloves, masks, gowns and hand sanitizer. Some staff members started to get sick; Fortenberry set up a team to monitor them in quarantine and decide when it was safe to return.\n\nThis wasn't the first time the center had dealt with the possibility of a pandemic: After a 2012 outbreak of fungal meningitis among gay men, Callen-Lorde helped other area health centers come up with protocols for dealing with outbreaks of disease. Two years later, it had a dry run when a doctor returned to New York from Guinea carrying the Ebola virus. Fortenberry already had a rough playbook for Covid-19 -- at least until April, when the city started moving people into its hotels and his job was transformed.\n\nMinutes after he learned the address of the new quarantine hotel, Fortenberry called an Uber, threw whatever supplies and equipment he could into the trunk and rode to Queens. By the end of the day, his staff had filled the hotel's basement gym with masks, gloves and gowns. They scoured nearby bodegas for more acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The staff turned the breakfast area into a triage space, with a row of tables serving as a makeshift barrier. Fortenberry had ordered a printer, scanner and filing cabinet for basic record-keeping, but these had not arrived yet. Handwritten files on the hotel's first two dozen occupants piled up on a conference table in the business center.\n\nOne of the first patients arrived in a wheelchair pushed by paramedics. He was middle-aged and homeless, suffering from diabetes and advanced kidney disease. Under normal circumstances, any American in his condition would have been situated in a hospital intensive-care unit, or hospice. His blood oxygen was dangerously low, aggravating problems caused by his diabetes and kidney disease. He was, Fortenberry told me by phone that weekend, \"actively dying.\" \"This patient is not going to make it,\" he said. \"Where that is going to happen is the question.\"\n\nMany of the patients in that first wave were in worse shape than Fortenberry was led to expect. The plan had been for the hotel to house \"low-acuity\" patients who were not at immediate risk of dying in order to free up hospital beds as the virus swamped New York. But as the crisis approached its peak, the meaning of \"low-acuity\" seemed to shift. Having stood up the equivalent of a field hospital in 24 hours, Fortenberry quickly realized he'd be receiving patients who were far more ill than his staff was equipped to deal with.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The White House will wind down the coronavirus task force in coming weeks.

See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAt the same time, the crisis was creating a third problem for Fortenberry: his budget. Even as the pandemic multiplied the needs of Callen-Lorde patients, the drop in face-to-face consultations was slowing the flow of Medicaid reimbursements to a trickle. The center applied for a loan from the federal government under the Paycheck Protection Program, but received no feedback beyond an acknowledgment that the application had been received. In April, senior staff members began discussions about the possibility that they would have to furlough staff. Outside New York, hundreds of other community health centers were grappling with similar problems -- a spike in the need for urgent medical care for their patients, coupled with a sudden shortfall in government funding. The virus was doing more than filling up hospital I.C.U.s beyond capacity; it was stretching the resources of the country's shadow medical safety net, the one that reaches patients whose location, economic circumstances or existing health status already puts them at greater risk.\n\nPart of Fortenberry's job, as he saw it, was compartmentalizing -- filtering out his own fears so as not to pass them on to colleagues or patients. Before joining Callen-Lorde, he worked as a nurse at a Greenwich Village intensive-care unit, and before that, at a Level 1 trauma center in the Bronx. But the equanimity he absorbed from these experiences was now being put to the test. \"I think it's very important for our staff to have the impression that I have everything under control and that everything is going to be OK,\" he said. \"The default is panic. Especially in this kind of situation, where we're in way over our heads. I think the last thing that everyone needs from me is to show uncertainty. But deep down inside, I'm, you know\" -- he laughed softly -- \"it's an untenable disaster.\"\n\nCallen-Lorde is one node in a network of more than 1,000 community health centers, or C.H.C.s, spread across the nation. By law, C.H.C.s work with \"medically unserved\" populations and receive federal funding from the Department of Health and Human Services. There are centers that specialize in treating farmworkers, non-English-speaking immigrants, public-housing residents and rural communities. They work at the nexus of medicine and social care, with dedicated intake workers who help the undocumented or the uninsured navigate health care bureaucracy before they have a problem that sends them to the emergency room. Many patients are unable to wall themselves off from infection because they take public transportation to subsistence jobs in agriculture, sanitation or front-line retail, and it is these patients -- the same ones who continue to arrive at the Queens hotel -- who would die in disproportionate numbers if policymakers decided to pare back social-distancing measures. Attention and resources continue to flow to hospitals, the first line of defense against the virus. But the nationwide safety net of C.H.C.s beneath them is being stretched to its limit.\n\nThe first C.H.C.s were founded by civil rights activists in the mid-1960s and began receiving federal funding as part of President Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society program. Today they treat nearly 30 million patients each year, two-thirds of whom live below the federal poverty line. One of the oldest and best-known centers, Eula Hall Health Center (previously known as the Mud Creek Clinic), serves families of coal miners in the Kentucky Appalachians. The federal government has used such C.H.C.s to screen coal miners for black lung and fund specific subsidiary programs to make sure that the homeless, public-housing residents and farmworkers have adequate health care. During the 2012 meningitis outbreak, the City of New York used Callen-Lorde to reach gay men, who were especially at risk, and provide free vaccinations.\n\nBeyond their humanitarian value, these programs save the health care system money by keeping uninsured patients healthy, as opposed to waiting for them to get sick enough to call 911 or show up in an emergency room. But the immediate needs faced by C.H.C.s are often so great that even long-established organizations exist on a hand-to-mouth basis, plowing whatever funding they receive immediately back into payroll and patient care. \"Many C.H.C.s don't keep profits in a bank account,\" says the University of Chicago's Dr. Marshall Chin, who researches health disparities. \"They're already under tremendous strain from the needs of their patients.\"\n\nFor many C.H.C.s, dealing with the immediate impact of Covid-19 is drawing down resources at the very moment they need to be making preparations for a more extended public-health crisis. One scenario is millions of newly vulnerable workers crowding patient rolls, even as the centers struggle to maintain their funding. \"It's the double whammy of the medical hit, and then the economic one,\" Chin says. \"If you're a front-line worker, you have to drive that bus or that Uber. You can't socially distance because your housing is too crowded. Then, if you get sick, you can't get into your C.H.C. because the centers are letting go of folks.\" The U.S. health care system suffers from a chronically under-resourced safety net. \"So when something like Covid hits,\" Chin says, \"you have a lot of people who get hurt.\"\n\nFor Albany, Ga., the metro area with the country's second-highest number of deaths per capita from Covid-19, the rural outskirts' local C.H.C. is Albany Area Primary Health Care. The center has been conducting much of its practice through telemedicine. Often this entails calling up patients who have missed appointments and walking them through how to download and use the right app. \"I've almost become a telemarketer,\" says Dr. Jim Hotz, the center's founder. \"People do not want to come into the office.\"\n\nHotz himself found out he had prostate cancer earlier this year, but postponed definitive treatment after regional hospitals put the type of surgery he needed on hold due to the pandemic. At A.A.P.H.C., the number of patient walk-ins, too, has fallen by about half. Only 40 percent of the center's patients have smartphones. \"The people who are poor, rural and don't have broadband are our highest-risk population,\" he says. \"And those are the ones we are least incentivized to take care of.\" Much of the Covid-19-related work that the center has been doing spills over from health care into social work, like counseling the grieving wife of a terminally ill man who had been discharged from the hospital to a hospice, which had no staff left to take care of him at home. For the 45 minutes that Hotz spent talking her through her grief by phone, the center got a reimbursement of $13.\n\nElsewhere, Dr. Laurie Zephyrin of the Commonwealth Fund has seen pregnant women forgoing prenatal care, and chronic conditions like heart disease and kidney disease left untreated. \"It's not that all of a sudden people are cured,\" she said. \"It's that they're not going to the doctor. People are losing insurance coverage, losing their jobs. There needs to be some focused investment on our health care infrastructure and policies for universal health care so we can provide for people as we bounce back.\"\n\nSocial distancing may be especially hard on the L.G.B.T.Q. community, particularly younger people who are estranged from their families. In April, the Trevor Project, another nonprofit, published a white paper outlining the risks related to Covid-19 for L.G.B.T.Q. youth. Considerable research already indicates that this group is at greater risk of mental health disorders and suicide; now they are being deprived of the community spaces where they do feel supported. The number of L.G.B.T.Q. youth reaching out to the Trevor Project's hotlines has at times more than doubled since the crisis began. \"We're seeing a lot of patients with mental health issues because of an oversaturation of news and fear,\" Fortenberry said. \"This is already a particularly vulnerable population at baseline. When these kinds of events happen, there can be relapses into substance abuse as well. People tend not to be able to take care of themselves as they normally would in these kinds of crises.\"\n\nIt will be years before anyone is able to tally up the damage Covid-19 is inflicting on the populations that community health centers serve, especially when one accounts for the secondary costs to those who may never even contract the disease. The problems already emerging -- in rural access to telemedicine, in access to medication for chronic conditions, in the dangerous isolation of L.G.B.T.Q. youth -- could be the first indications of a much broader, secondary health crisis affecting treatment for the diverse range of maladies, from opioid addiction to obesity to chronic depression, that are commonly addressed by C.H.C.s. As part of the current stimulus package, community health centers stand to receive some share of a $50 billion line item aimed at Medicare-funded providers. But that money, according to the Department of Health and Human Services, will be divided up based on existing revenue, and it remains unclear whether any money will be specifically dedicated to dealing with the crisis's secondary damage. Eventually, as epidemiologists compare mortality rates for 2020 and 2021 with previous years, the deaths caused by this lack of access to basic medical care may be lumped in with Covid-19 itself, despite a number of them having been more preventable.\n\nAs the geography of the virus's impact continues to spread from New York to the rest of the country, more C.H.C.s will likely feel the same strains Callen-Lorde has as they try to balance their commitments to existing patients with the surging demand for care. Yet even as C.H.C.s are called upon to do more, the federal government is asking them to make do with less. Most of the centers' funding comes from Medicaid, which compensates them for remote patient visits at a small fraction of the rate of live visits. The average reimbursement is $12 or $13, according to Dr. Ron Yee, chief medical officer of the National Association of Community Health Centers; there are likely millions of patients, meanwhile, who don't even possess the technology to connect with their C.H.C.s remotely. \"Once we get through the surge, we could have more problems later on if we are struggling to keep up with our patients,\" Yee told me. \"We're going to have to catch up on our chronic care, and kids who need vaccines. Our population of patients age 65 and up had already been increasing at a higher rate. It's even more critical that we stay on top of their care now.\"\n\nIn one of our first conversations, Fortenberry told me he planned on spending a day or two at the hotel, setting things up, until the regular staff settled into a rhythm. Two weeks later, he found himself still showing up most days at 8 in the morning and staying until 8:30 or 9 at night. Working behind a mask and goggles, he did what he could to form bonds, quickly and at scale, with individual patients. Sometimes he'd tell his Covid-19 patients that he was smiling behind his mask, though that may already have been clear from his large, almond-shaped eyes.\n\nThe rooms at the hotel lacked IVs, heart monitors, oxygen masks and resuscitation equipment. By the second week of April, the site held about 150 patients. With five to seven medical staff at any given moment, that meant that medical check-ins took place around four times per day. But \"if you're sitting in a hotel room and having trouble breathing, I don't want you to not call me,\" Fortenberry said. \"Someone who is otherwise healthy can take a turn for the worse really quickly. So it's important that you feel comfortable calling. I want you to err on the side of caution.\" That day he had met a woman in her early 20s, most likely pregnant, who was living in a women's shelter because of a violent partner. She had asthma, a high fever and pneumonia, and was awaiting the results of a Covid-19 test. Fortenberry delivered all of her meals personally and asked about her favorite foods. \"It's hard because you can't hold someone's hand,\" he said. \"You're all gloved up.\" He said that he had sympathy for those who chose to walk out of the hotel. \"People get stir-crazy,\" he said. \"Anyone would. Imagine you're sick and you get stuck in a hotel room and you're not allowed to leave for an entire week. You can only watch so much TV.\"\n\nBack at home, he stayed up attending Zoom meetings and catching up on email. There was just too much to be done. On the second or third day, the hotel's staff engineer walked off the job, along with most of the cleaning staff. They took access to room keys and cleaning supplies along with them. The city was able to find replacements within 24 hours, but there were still only enough hands to clean rooms during changes between patients. During a patient's stay, the job of changing sheets, cleaning toilets and providing for daily necessities like soap and toothpaste fell to the doctors and nurses on Fortenberry's staff. The staff's medical gowns and N95 masks were worn until they became visibly soiled. The risks to their own health were significant, which was part of why Fortenberry stayed. \"I don't want to ask them to do anything that I wouldn't do myself,\" he told me one evening during the third week of April. \"Morale has been harder to maintain the longer we have to keep this up. The adrenaline has worn off.\"\n\nIt was our seventh evening phone call. For the first time, he sounded tired. \"It's been increasingly difficult to compartmentalize emotionally,\" he said. Over the previous weekend, another homeless patient had come in who was suffering from diabetes, kidney disease and symptoms of Covid-19. He was on dialysis, but had grown confused and refused treatment for several days. He was close enough to death for Fortenberry to call 911. The paramedics who arrived refused to take him to the emergency room. \"You don't know what's happening in the E.R. right now,\" one of them told Fortenberry. \"People are dying in the hallway. We are beyond beyond capacity.\" Fortenberry reminded them that the hotel had no resuscitation equipment and that the patient was \"decompensating,\" his vital systems failing. \"They have to decompensate further before we can take them,\" the paramedic said. So Fortenberry waited another 24 hours. The patient got worse. Fortenberry called 911 again. This time, they took him.\n\nMany of the patients coming into the hotel had not been tested at the hospital, but were assumed to have Covid-19 because of their exposure and symptoms. This made Fortenberry skeptical about claims by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and others that the crisis was about to reach its peak. \"They're not testing people who I know to be sick,\" he said. \"Maybe that's being accounted for in these official projections, but it's hard for me to reconcile.\" By late April, what he saw on the ground had begun to reflect the story contained in the official statistics. For now, the crisis was slowing down.\n\nIn New York State, Callen-Lorde and other C.H.C.s will likely suffer from $2.5 billion in cuts proposed by the governor's Medicaid Redesign Team. After the center's cash flow plummeted in March, Callen-Lorde's senior staff members took pay cuts ranging from 10 to 15 percent, and management warned that there could be furloughs and layoffs ahead. Callen-Lorde received less than $600,000 from the federal stimulus bill, enough for one week of payroll. It never heard back about its initial loan application, made via a large commercial bank in New York. Loans for Shake Shack and Ruth's Chris Steak House, meanwhile, were approved. (After a public outcry, both said they would return the loans.) \"I'm infuriated,\" Fortenberry said. \"These are not small businesses. You would think there would be some prioritization of safety-net health care providers.\"\n\nCallen-Lorde's staff was well aware of how thin the center's resources were stretched. Several sent out calls for equipment and funding to their own networks. On Instagram, a doctor's partner asked for donations of handmade gowns, and a few days later, a box showed up on her Park Slope doorstep. Inside were 17 handmade gowns mailed from Overland Park, Kan. When Fortenberry saw the gowns, \"I went to the bathroom and just lost it,\" he said. He had his staff try them on -- they had been sewn from fabric he fondly described as \"the most hideous 1970s floral-patterned sheets\" -- and take a group photo. The gowns were sewn by Jan Durham, a quilter and self-described \"fabric hoarder\" who searches for her quarry at thrift stores and estate sales. \"I hope these will be of use, although I also wish they were not needed,\" she wrote in an accompanying letter. \"It just makes me furious that we're sewing P.P.E. at home,\" she told me by phone, a few days later. \"I'm glad to do it, but we are a great nation. We should not have to rely on seamstresses in their homes to provide these critical things.\"\n\nIn Queens, Fortenberry was troubled by a parallel set of worries. Late in April, there was still no word back from the bank. Without a loan, Callen-Lorde would not be able to make payroll, and it would be up to Fortenberry to decide who among the medical staff was essential and who was not. \"That's an impossible thing to ask me to do,\" he said. It was the first time that I had heard him complain.\n\nAs with the gowns, personal relationships compensated for the failings of the official infrastructure. A member of Callen-Lorde's staff had gone to college with someone who later became the chief loan officer at a small community bank in the South Bronx. By April 27, the bank was able to process a $6 million loan, enough for six weeks of payroll.\n\n\"It was such a huge relief,\" Fortenberry said. \"I didn't know how I was going to live with myself.\" It was almost May, and Fortenberry was busy setting up a second hotel for the city, this one for homeless L.G.B.T.Q. youth believed to have contracted the virus. The flow of patients into the Queens hotel had slowed, allowing him to catch up on paperwork and sleep. \"In the beginning I was on autopilot, just making it work,\" he said. But the brief break hadn't exactly left him reassured. \"It's almost more daunting,\" he said, \"to have more time to think about what's actually happening.\"",

        "body": "A report by the civil liberties group contends that reliance on thermal cameras and temperature-sensing guns to resume work at factories and offices and to encourage travel is flawed and intrusive.\n\nAirports, office buildings, warehouses and restaurant chains are rushing to install new safety measures like fever-scanning cameras and infrared temperature-sensing guns. But the American Civil Liberties Union warned on Tuesday against using the tools to screen people for possible coronavirus symptoms, saying the devices were often inaccurate, ineffective and intrusive.\n\nIn a new report, \"Temperature Screening and Civil Liberties During an Epidemic,\" the A.C.L.U. said that such technologies could give people a false sense of security, potentially leading them to be less vigilant about health measures like wearing masks or social distancing. The group also cautioned that the push for widespread temperature scans during the pandemic could usher in permanent new forms of surveillance and social control.\n\nThe organization's advisory reflects a wider tension in the United States over concerns about reopening the economy at a time when the virus is still spreading undetected in various regions of country.\n\nIn particular, the report said that infrared temperature-sensing guns can be unreliable partly because they gauge skin temperature, in contrast to oral thermometers, which calculate core body temperature. The guns provide a superficial measure, the report noted, that can vary if a person is sunburned, sweating or has just come in from outside.\n\nSimilarly, the report said that many free-standing thermal cameras, which gauge a person's temperature at a distance, can be inaccurate, finicky and may need to be frequently recalibrated.\n\nEven if the temperature-scanning tools were more accurate, however, the A.C.L.U. said they could miss many people who were infected with the coronavirus but not running a fever.\n\n\"Nobody should imagine that blanketing our public spaces with thermal sensors is going to serve as any kind of effective automated 'Covid detection network,'\" Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst with the A.C.L.U., wrote in the report, \"or that this technology is likely to contribute significantly to stemming the spread of the virus.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The president says the W.H.O. must change or he will permanently end funding.

Even so, guidelines on reopening the economy from the White House ask companies to monitor workers for symptoms like fevers. The idea is that such screening might at least reduce the risk of coronavirus outbreaks in the workplace.\n\nTo meet surging demand from factories, warehouses and office buildings, technology makers haven been rushing to market a range of thermal cameras as coronavirus fever-screening tools. Companies have been encouraged to do so by the Food and Drug Administration. The agency said in April that it would temporarily allow device makers to market thermal cameras, which have not been vetted by federal health regulators, for temperature checks in places like warehouses and factories.\n\nBut IPVM, an independent site that tests surveillance cameras, reported this year that numerous makers of temperature scanners had overstated their accuracy or made false claims. Among other things, the site identified systems that automatically adjusted people's temperatures to put them in the normal range or that failed to detect high fevers. The site also found companies that were marketing heat-sensing tools designed simply to detect the presence of humans, or for fire detection, as fever-screening devices.\n\n\"A core issue is there are no independent tests of thermal camera performance,\" IPVM said in a recent overview of the technology. \"This has allowed manufacturers to tout products meant for body/fire detection as a fever solution, or falsely claim pinpoint accuracy at long distances.\"\n\nIn its report, the A.C.L.U. recommended that public health experts study the effectiveness of temperature-scanning technologies \"to determine if the trade-offs are worth it.\" Otherwise, the group said, the fever-screening systems should not be deployed.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offers a lower-tech solution: \"Ask employees to take their own temperature either before coming to the workplace or upon arrival at the workplace.\"",

        "body": "BARCELONA (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - British actor and filmmaker Idris Elba launched a new United Nations fund on Monday to help farmers in poorer nations, calling on richer economies to provide aid to prevent \"needless hunger and suffering\" stemming from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nElba and his wife, model and activist Sabrina Dhowre Elba, gave their support to a fund set up by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), to help stop economic shocks caused by COVID-19 triggering a global food crisis.\n\nThe couple, who were also designated on Monday as goodwill ambassadors for IFAD, contracted the virus themselves in March although reportedly only suffered mild symptoms.\n\n\"The world's advanced economies are in the midst of this pandemic right now and, of course, they must do everything they can to help their own people,\" said Elba, 47, in a statement.\n\n\"But the fact is, global action is also a matter of self-interest. As long as the pandemic is still raging anywhere, it will pose a threat everywhere,\" he added, urging donors to ramp up financial support to keep rural food systems operating.\n\nIFAD, a U.N. agency that promotes rural development, said it would put $40 million into the new fund to counter the effects of the pandemic on food production, market access and employment in developing countries.\n\nIt also aims to raise at least $200 million more from governments, foundations and the private sector.\n\nIn December Elba and his wife visited rural Sierra Leone, where IFAD provided financial services to communities hit by Ebola.\n\nSince the coronavirus began to spread in developing nations, IFAD has been finding ways to help rural families - many of them poor farmers - deal with the deadly disease's ripple effects.\n\nIn eastern Senegal, where a curfew and market closures make it hard to sell produce or livestock, the agency is supporting cash transfers and subsidies via smartphones, and distributing seeds and fertilisers ahead of the planting season.\n\nIn India's Odisha state, it has worked with local authorities to get watermelons transported to markets, avoiding the loss of 600 tonnes of fruit due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nIFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo, who was raised in rural Togo, West Africa, said farmers were worried about losing their income during the pandemic as lockdown measures in many places could stop them selling crops and buying seeds and fertilisers.\n\nHe warned if this happened, progress in the fight against poverty could be upended for the first time in three decades.\n\n\"What we are talking about is the risk of a health crisis creating a food crisis,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\n\"(But) I think we have to go even beyond the risk of food insecurity and look at it as we, as a global community, going backwards in the fight against poverty.\"\n\n(Reporting by Megan Rowling @meganrowling; editing by Belinda Goldsmith.

        "body": "Stagnant plumbing systems in emptied commercial buildings could put returning employees at risk of Legionnaires' and other illnesses.\n\nWhen you finally return to work after the lockdown, coronavirus might not be the only illness you need to worry about contracting at the office.\n\nOffice buildings once filled with employees emptied out in many cities and states as shelter-in-place orders were issued. These structures, normally in constant use, have been closed off and shut down, and health risks might be accumulating in unseen ways.\n\n\"The buildings aren't designed to be left alone for months,\" said Andrew Whelton, an associate professor of civil, environmental and ecological engineering at Purdue University.\n\nDr. Whelton, other researchers and public health authorities have issued warnings about the plumbing in these buildings, where water may have gone stagnant in the pipes or even in individual taps and toilets. As lockdowns are lifted, bacteria that build up internally may cause health problems for returning workers if the problem is not properly addressed by facilities managers. Employees and guests at hotels, gyms and other kinds of buildings may also be at risk.\n\nThe biggest worry is Legionella pneumophila. The bacteria can cause Legionnaires' disease, a respiratory condition. It leads to death in about one in 10 cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine estimates that over 52,000 Americans suffer from the disease each year.\n\nA single small outbreak can sicken many people. During the water crisis that started in Flint, Mich., in 2014 after the city changed its water source and officials failed to inform the public of water quality problems, many people became sick. The crisis was linked to the deaths of 12 people from Legionnaires' disease.\n\nAfter an outbreak at the North Carolina Mountain State Fair last September, 135 people contracted the disease and four died, according to the state's department of health and human services. Investigators blamed a hot tub exhibit that sent Legionella through the air and was inhaled by passers-by.\n\nMost worrying, Legionnaires' disease tends to affect people with compromised immune systems.\n\n\"Covid patients and survivors could be more vulnerable to this, so when they go back to work we might be concerned about another infection,\" said Caitlin Proctor, a postdoctoral fellow at Purdue who, along with Dr. Whelton conducted a study that has been accepted for publication in the journal AWWA Water Science examining risks from water stagnation during the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nOnce forming in a building's plumbing, Legionella can be dispersed through the air when toilets are flushed. Even turning on taps, as employees wash their hands to limit the spread of the coronavirus, can send water droplets into the air that carry Legionella.\n\nTypically, facilities managers reduce the risk of Legionella and other bacteria by pouring small amounts of disinfectant into a building's water systems. But when the water is left stagnant for too long, the disinfectant disappears.\n\n\"Even just after a weekend, disinfectant can be gone in some buildings and the water is vulnerable to contamination,\" Dr. Whelton said.\n\nFacilities staff can also flush out old water and bring in a new and fresh supply. Or they can send a high dose of disinfectant through the building and raise temperatures to kill the microbes.\n\nShutdowns in the U.S. began in mid-March, meaning some buildings have now been closed for two months. And the researchers say that the consequences of long-term water stagnation are relatively unknown.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Disease models suggest tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented.

So while we're looking at these organisms, maybe other organisms pop up.\"\n\nWilliam Rudin, C.E.O. and co-chairman of Rudin Management Company which manages 16 commercial office buildings in New York, said his staff is being careful and cautious in their approach to reopening.\n\n\"Our engineers go through the building testing systems all the time,\" he said. \"That's standard procedure.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nOne problem for some property managers may be inconsistent and incomplete guidance from regulators and health authorities. Dr. Proctor and Dr. Whelton's study assessed 21 sets of guidelines developed around the world since the pandemic began, including the C.D.C.'s and 11 from states and counties.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\n\"Not all of the guidelines are created equal,\" said Dr. Proctor. \"The original C.D.C. guidelines only covered certain systems.\"\n\nBecause the effects of long-term water stagnation are so little understood, most of the guidelines are based on preventive measures and may not directly address reopening after long-term shutdowns.\n\n\"They all go different ways,\" said Mich\u00e8le Pr\u00e9vost, a co-author of the study and the industrial chair of drinking water on the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada. \"It's not ill-intended, there's not that much evidence to guide our choices.\"\n\nUnfortunately many of the public health officials who would normally be tackling these issues and getting information out are currently focused on responding to the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"Health officials are overstretched and have conflicting information,\" said David Dyjack, executive director of the National Environmental Health Association. \"Health officials simply cannot keep up. Public health is being asked to do things it's never had to do before.\"\n\nEven if only a small portion of buildings have problems, with so many reopening at once, the researchers fear there will be more outbreaks than usual.\n\n\"Not every building will have issues but based on what we know, enough of them probably will,\" Dr. Proctor said.",

        "body": "A new study adds to evidence of immunity among those who have already been exposed to the pathogen.\n\nA new study offers a glimmer of hope in the grim fight against the coronavirus: Nearly everyone who has had the disease -- regardless of age, sex or severity of illness -- makes antibodies to the virus.\n\nThe study, posted online on Tuesday but not yet reviewed by experts, also hints that anyone who has recovered from infection may safely return to work -- although it is unclear how long their protection might last.\n\n\"This is very good news,\" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York who was not involved with the work.\n\nAntibodies are immune molecules produced by the body to fight pathogens. The presence of antibodies in the blood typically confers at least some protection against the invader.\n\nHealth officials in several countries, including the United States, have hung their hopes on tests that identify coronavirus antibodies to decide who is immune and can go back to work. People who are immune could replace vulnerable individuals, especially in high-transmission settings like hospitals, building what researchers call \"shield immunity\" in the population.\n\nBut most antibody tests are fraught with false positives -- picking up antibody signals where there are none. The new study relied on a test developed by Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, that has a less than 1 percent chance of producing false-positive results.\n\nSeveral small studies have given reason to hope that people who have had Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, would gain some immunity for some period of time. The new study is the largest by far, with results from 1,343 people in and around New York City.\n\nThe study also eased a niggling worry that only some people -- only those who were severely ill, for example -- might make antibodies. In fact, the level of antibodies did not differ by age or sex, and even people who had only mild symptoms produced a healthy amount.\n\nHaving antibodies is not the same as having immunity to the virus. But in previous research, Dr. Krammer's team has shown that antibody levels are closely linked with the ability to disarm the virus, the key to immunity.\n\n\"It really shows that most people do develop antibodies, and that there's very good correlation between those antibodies and their capability to neutralize virus,\" Dr. Rasmussen said.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A battle has erupted between the White House and the C.D.C. over reopening guidelines. Latinos in many places are contracting the virus at significantly higher rates than the population as a whole. As millions more Americans join the jobless rolls, even more economic pain is in the forecast. See more updates Updated 7m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nResearchers at Mount Sinai tested people who signed up to be donors of convalescent plasma, antibodies extracted from blood. The project has enrolled more than 15,000 people so far, according to Dr. Ania Wajnberg, who is leading the effort.\n\nThe new study is an analysis of results of the first set of donors. Over all, only 3 percent of these participants had been seen in the emergency department or had been hospitalized. The remaining subjects had only mild or moderate symptoms.\n\n\"To my knowledge, this is the largest group of people described with mild disease,\" Dr. Wajnberg said.\n\nThe criteria for inclusion became more stringent as the team learned more about the coronavirus. For example, they initially required the potential donors to be free of symptoms for only three days but later extended that to 14 days.\n\nThe team tested 624 people who had tested positive for the virus and had recovered. At first, just 511 of them had high antibody levels; 42 had low levels; and 71 had none. When 64 of the subjects with weak or no levels were retested more than a week later, however, all but three had at least some antibodies.\n\nThat suggests the timing of testing for antibodies can greatly affect the results, the researchers said. \"We weren't looking exactly at this, but we had enough to say that 14 days is probably a little too early,\" Dr. Wajnberg said.\n\nThere was even a difference between levels at 20 days versus 24 days, she said, suggesting that the optimal time for an antibody test is well after symptoms begin. \"What we're telling people now is at least three weeks after symptom onset,\" Dr. Wajnberg said.\n\nBecause tests to diagnose coronavirus infection were unavailable to most people in New York City in March, the researchers included another 719 people in their study who suspected they had Covid-19 based on symptoms and exposure to the virus, but in whom the illness had not been diagnosed.\n\nIn this group, the researchers found a different picture altogether. The majority of these people -- 62 percent -- did not seem to have antibodies.\n\nSome of them may have been tested too soon after their illness for antibodies to be detectable. But many probably mistook influenza, another viral infection or even allergies for Covid-19, Dr. Wajnberg said.\n\n\"I think literally everybody in New York thinks they've had it,\" she said. \"People shouldn't assume the fever they had in January was Covid and they're immune.\"\n\nOther experts were more struck by the percentage of people who turned out to have antibodies, even though the coronavirus had never been diagnosed in them.\n\nThe number suggests that \"in cities like New York, there are a tremendous number of undiagnosed infections,\" said Taia Wang, a viral immunologist at Stanford University.\n\nAn antibody survey conducted by New York State officials found that 20 percent of city residents had been infected.\n\nAnother finding from the study -- that diagnostic PCR tests can be positive up to 28 days after the start of infection -- is also important, Dr. Wang said. These tests look for genetic fragments, not antibodies, and suggest an active or waning infection.\n\n\"As far as known unknowns about SARS-CoV-2, this one really stands out,\" she said. \"We really need to know, how long does it take the body to clear the virus? How long are people contagious? We don't know the answer to that.\"\n\nShe and other scientists said it was highly unlikely that a positive test so long after symptoms appeared represents infectious virus. Researchers in South Korea recently announced, for example, that several suspected cases of \"reinfection\" were a result of PCR tests picking up remnants of dead virus.\n\nGenetic material from the measles virus can show up in tests six months after the illness, Dr. Krammer noted. And genetic fragments of Ebola and Zika viruses are known to persist even longer in the body.\n\nStill, Dr. Wang said, \"Until we do know, it's prudent for everyone to proceed as if a positive PCR test means contagious virus.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms, but that period may need to be longer.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nExperts said the next step would be to confirm that the presence of antibodies in the blood means protection from the coronavirus. The body depends on a subset of antibodies, called neutralizing antibodies, to shield it from the coronavirus.\n\n\"The question now becomes to what extent those are neutralizing antibodies and whether that leads to protection from infection -- all of which we should presume are yes,\" said Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nIn Dr. Krammer's previous work, to be published in the journal Nature Medicine, his team tested whether the antibodies have neutralizing power. The researchers found that in about a dozen people, including some who had mild symptoms, the level of antibodies in the blood corresponded to the level of neutralizing activity.\n\nSo everyone who makes antibodies is likely to have some immunity to the virus, Dr. Krammer said: \"I'm fairly confident about this.\" Another way to assess immunity would be to show that purified antibodies can prevent coronavirus infection in an animal.\n\nBut perhaps the most urgent question, especially as research on vaccines ramps up, is how long that immunity might last.\n\nEven if the levels of antibodies fall over time to undetectable levels, people may still retain some protection from the coronavirus.\n\nImmune cells called T cells are valuable soldiers in fighting pathogens, and at least one study has shown that the coronavirus provokes a strong response from these cells. So-called memory cells, or B cells, may also kick into gear when they encounter the coronavirus, churning out more antibodies.\n\nUltimately, however, the answer to how long immunity lasts will come only with patience.\n\n\"Unless someone has come up with some way to speed that process up,\" Dr. Rasmussen said, \"the only way to tell that is by following these patients over time.\"",

He was a World War II veteran who attended college and medical school after the war, and had just completed a residency in surgical urology at Howard University College of Medicine in Washington.\n\nThey were married within six months, and he quickly became a surrogate father, and then just a father, to Mr. Loving.\n\nThe family moved to Tuskegee, Ala., where Dr. King worked at a V.A. hospital, and then to Atlanta, where Dr. King began building a medical practice in 1966.\n\nMrs. King delighted in being a doctor's wife, having supper on the table when he arrived home, playing bridge and raising money for organizations they both cared about, like the Sickle Cell Foundation of Georgia, which Dr. King helped found.\n\nAt night they would watch \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,\" sitting in the built-in recliners at either end of their couch and reaching their arms toward the middle, over the newspapers they had been reading, to hold hands.\n\nThey visited Barbados and Venezuela, traveled through the Panama Canal, and took a cruise through Europe with their best friends, Dr. Clinton E. Warner Jr. and Sally Warner. In the mid-90s, after Nelson Mandela was elected president of South Africa, the two couples traveled there to take part in the historic moment. The trip ended with a safari.\n\nDee, who had majored in zoology as an undergraduate at Case Western Reserve University, loved the excursion. Lois, who longed for air-conditioning, tolerated it.\n\n\"She was very opinionated,\" said Mrs. Warner, 73. \"If Lois thought something, she would say it. If Dee thought something, he would think about it long and hard.\"\n\nThe Kings were part of Atlanta's African-American professional elite. Their social circle included Andrew Young, the former mayor and ambassador to the United Nations. They celebrated the new year at the home of Billye and Hank Aaron, the Hall of Fame baseball player and executive, who helped Dr. King raise money to fight sickle-cell anemia.\n\nThe Kings' son, Mr. Loving, an Army veteran and former Atlanta police officer who had a long second career as a news cameraman for WXIA in Atlanta, revered his parents.\n\nHis wife, Freda Loving, remembers that when she and Ron began to date seriously in 2012, he told her, \"I want us to be like my mom and dad.\"\n\nAs the Kings slipped into old age, Lois developed dementia and Dee had Parkinson's disease. Their son visited them daily and arranged for visiting nursing aides, so that his parents could keep living in their house for as long as possible.\n\nBut by last year, it was clear that it was no longer safe for them to live independently. That's when they moved into Arbor Terrace. \"They were still going to be together, that was the important thing.\" Mr. Loving said.\n\nWhen you are 77 and your parents are 96, Mr. Loving said, you know that their deaths will come. But to lose them in such rapid succession, and have the virus deny him the chance to comfort them at the end or give them proper funerals to celebrate their lives, particularly his father's career and civil rights achievements -- he found that hard to cope with.\n\n\"This has been devastating,\" Mr. Loving said.\n\nAlmost 800 miles to the north, Maranda Lender is living through similar pain. \"It's the worst kind of situation,\" she said.\n\nBrad and Becky Lender's life together wasn't always easy. He had health issues, including diabetes and a hip injury that in recent years had left him unable to work. The couple squabbled often and fought some, most recently about Maranda's fianc\u00e9, whom Mr. Lender gave a hard time.\n\n\"It's not like their marriage was a love story, because it was not,\" said Bonnie Hammaker, one of Becky Lender's sisters. \"But they were committed to the marriage. You would never find them holding hands, but you would always find them together.\"\n\nThey were both raised in Enola, Pa., and were married in 1986. Their life revolved around family and work. He was a forklift operator. She was a clerk at the New Cumberland Army Depot, a job she left when Maranda was born in 1988 and then reclaimed several years later. She added a second job as a cashier at Karns Foods to help send Maranda, now a graphic designer, to Pennsylvania College of Art and Design.\n\nSue Hutchison, Ms. Lender's boss at the depot and a close friend, said Becky loved meeting new people.\n\n\"She had a magnet for the needful souls,\" said Ms. Hutchison, 63. \"We'd be sitting somewhere eating and I would leave the table, and when I would come back, she would know the life story of the person sitting next to us. I'd say, 'Dude, how could you do that? I went to the bathroom for five minutes!' She had that kind of draw.\"\n\nThe Lenders spent free time motorcycle-cruising and driving vintage fire trucks owned by Mr. Lender's uncle in parades and expos all over Pennsylvania. \"They were into racing, dirt tracks, NASCAR, they did a lot with the fire company, they had a ton of friends,\" Ms. Hammaker said.\n\nOver the winter they had made plans for a trip to Cincinnati to visit the zoo, which they had seen on a favorite program on the Animal Planet channel. They were supposed to go the weekend of May 9, to celebrate their 34th anniversary. \"It would have been the first vacation that they had together in my entire life,\" Maranda Lender said.\n\nBut Covid-19 intervened.\n\nOn March 21, Becky Lender told her daughter she had a fever. Neither woman was particularly worried, Maranda said. But the next day, Maranda and her father had developed fevers as well.\n\nThe next day, a Monday, Becky went to the family doctor and was tested for Covid-19. There was a six-day wait for the results, so she went home to rest. A few days later, she had terrible diarrhea and was nearly incapacitated. Her husband took her to the emergency room.\n\nDoctors gave her anti-nausea medicine and sent her home again, where Maranda waited, fighting a high fever that made her sweat and shiver. (All three Lenders ultimately tested positive for Covid-19.)\n\nMs. Lender continued to get worse. On March 29, Maranda heard her mother get out of bed and then collapse. She called 911. Becky Lender was admitted to the hospital and put on a ventilator.\n\nOn April 1, as Maranda and her father continued to deal with their own symptoms, the family doctor called Maranda and said Mr. Lender needed to go to the hospital as well. An ambulance was called. One of the EMTs had also been to the house three days earlier to take her mother.\n\nThat night, Mr. Lender called his daughter from the hospital. \"They want to put me in a coma and stick me on a ventilator,\" he told her. \"I just want you to know that I love you and that I always have.\"\n\n\"I love you too, Dad,\" Maranda replied. \"You're going to be home soon, and you're going to be fine.\"\n\nShe tried to set aside her anxiety. \"Both my parents are in the I.C.U. on ventilators, and I'm not well myself,\" Maranda remembered thinking. \"I was alone. You go into survival mode: 'What is it that I need to do for me right now?'\"\n\nHer mother's condition was worsening. Maranda had a conference call with her aunt Bonnie Hammaker and her mother's doctors. \"They said, 'It's not looking good, and we think at this point you may need to just make peace with it,'\" Maranda recalled.\n\nThe next day, nurses brought an iPad to her mother's bedside and put Maranda on speaker. \"I told her that I loved her,\" Maranda said. \"I said, 'I don't want you to suffer and I don't want you to be in pain. Go take care of Dad.'\"\n\nBecky Lender died about an hour later. Her siblings, including Ms. Hammaker, went to their mother's assisted living residence in Harrisburg, Pa., which is under quarantine. \"I had to tell my 85-year-old mother that her daughter died, through a window,\" Ms. Hammaker said.\n\nBack at home, Maranda Lender was fielding more hospital phone calls. On April 7, a doctor treating her father called and said that the ventilator was merely prolonging the inevitable. \"Give him eight hours to fight,\" she told the doctor. \"If he is worse in eight hours, we should look into making him comfortable.\" Her father died about 10 hours later.\n\nIn the weeks since then, Maranda has been hunkering down in the house she is now afraid to leave, healing physically from the virus and trying to manage its emotional toll. At moments, she has found dark humor in the situation, imagining her father tracking down her mother in heaven and her mother telling her father, \"Brad, you only gave me a three-day break!\"\n\nMaranda also has been scrubbing the house, and this week she finally let Aunt Bonnie and her husband come into the house, masked and gloved, to help disinfect the place and look for a will.\n\nAnd she has been FaceTiming with her fianc\u00e9, whom she hasn't seen in person since mid-March because she is terrified that she could spread the virus to him, too.\n\n\"We have the idea of next year getting married on May 9, their anniversary date,\" Maranda said. \"Every time we celebrate for us, we can celebrate for them, too.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAdding to growing evidence that the novel coronavirus can spread through air, scientists have identified genetic markers of the virus in airborne droplets, many with diameters smaller than one-ten-thousandth of an inch.\n\nThat had been previously demonstrated in laboratory experiments, but now Chinese scientists studying real-world conditions report that they captured tiny droplets containing the genetic markers of the virus from the air in two hospitals in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak started.\n\nTheir findings were published Monday in the journal Nature.\n\nIt remains unknown if the virus in the samples they collected was infectious, but droplets that small, which are expelled by breathing and talking, can remain aloft and be inhaled by others.\n\n\"Those are going to stay in the air floating around for at least two hours,\" said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who was not involved with the Nature paper. \"It strongly suggests that there is potential for airborne transmission.\"\n\nDr. Marr and many other scientists say evidence is mounting that the coronavirus is being spread by tiny droplets known as aerosols. The World Health Organization has so far downplayed the possibility, saying that the disease is mostly transmitted through larger droplets that do not remain airborne for long, or through the touching of contaminated surfaces.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump would like schools to reopen before the summer. Few states seem to be considering it. The U.S. surpasses 1 million known coronavirus cases. A mask for thee, but not for me: Pence declines a face covering at the Mayo Clinic. See more updates Updated 2m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nEven with the new findings, the issue is not settled. Although the coronavirus RNA -- the genetic blueprint of the virus -- was present in the aerosols, scientists do not know yet is whether the viruses remain infectious or whether the tests just detected harmless virus fragments.\n\n\"The missing piece is viable viral replication,\" said Harvey V. Fineberg, who leads the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. \"Could you culture this virus from the air?\"\n\nIn February and March, scientists collected samples at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University and at a makeshift temporary medical facility used to quarantine and treat patients with mild symptoms. They also sampled the air in public areas around Wuhan, including a residential building, a supermarket and two department stores.\n\nVery little virus was detected in the air of the isolation wards or in the patient rooms of the hospital, which were well ventilated. But elevated concentrations were measured in the small toilet areas, about one square yard in size, which were not ventilated.\n\n\"It kind of emphasizes the importance of avoiding small confined spaces,\" Dr. Marr said.\n\nThis 3-D Simulation Shows Why Social Distancing Is So Important\n\nWe visualized a cough to show how far respiratory droplets can spread. If you haven't been keeping your distance to fight the coronavirus, this may persuade you.\n\nThe researchers also detected viruses in the air in the locations where staff members took off their protective garments, suggesting that viruses that had settled on clothing could be knocked back into the air. These readings were greatly reduced after the hospitals implemented more rigorous cleaning procedures.\n\nThe Wuhan data echo findings at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, where other researchers also found coronavirus RNA in the air as well as on surfaces in rooms. That research, still in the process of being reviewed by other scientists before publication in a journal, did not determine the size of the droplets. But the presence of RNA from the virus in out-of-the-way locations, such as under a bed and on window sills, also suggested that small droplets were carried around the rooms by air currents.\n\nIn their paper, the Nebraska researchers detected the presence of coronavirus RNA, but not whether the viruses were still infectious. In additional experiments, the scientists are trying to grow the virus in cultures to determine if they are capable of sickening people.\n\n\"We've made a lot of progress the last couple of weeks,\" said Joshua L. Santarpia, a professor of pathology and microbiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. \"I really do hope that we'll start being able to say something more definitive in the next week or so.\"\n\nIn the Wuhan research, no viruses were detected in most of the public places they studied, including the residential building and the supermarket, although some levels were detected in crowded areas outside of one of the hospitals and in the department stores. Dr. Marr said she calculated it would take about 15 minutes for a person to breathe in one virus particle.\n\n\"It was interesting to see there were measurable amounts,\" Dr. Marr said. \"I think it adds good evidence to avoid crowding.\"\n\nThe paper did not state whether people passing through those areas were wearing masks, which would block much of the virus a sick person breathes out.\n\nKnvul Sheikh contributed reporting.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nCHICAGO -- In January, a mystery illness swept through a call center in a skyscraper on Michigan Avenue in Chicago. Close to 30 people in one department alone had symptoms -- dry, deep coughs and fevers they could not shake. When they gradually returned to work after taking sick days, they sat in their cubicles looking wan and tired.\n\n\"I've started to think it was the coronavirus,\" said Julie Parks, a 63-year-old employee who was among the sick. \"I may have had it, but I can't be sure. It's limbo.\"\n\nThe revelation this week that a death in the United States in early February was the result of the coronavirus has significantly altered the understanding of how early the virus may have been circulating in this country. Researchers now believe that hidden outbreaks were creeping through cities like Chicago, New York, Seattle and Boston in January and February, earlier than previously known.\n\nThe new timeline has lent credence to a question on the minds of many Americans: Did I already have the coronavirus?\n\nThe retroactive search is happening on many levels. People who had suffered dreadful bouts with flulike illnesses are now wondering whether it had been the coronavirus. Doctors are thinking back to unexplained cases. Medical examiners are poring over their records looking for possible misdiagnosed deaths. And local politicians are demanding investigations.\n\nBrian Gustafson, a coroner in Rock Island County, Ill., said he had no capability to perform post-mortem coronavirus tests, but firmly believed that coronavirus deaths and illnesses were missed across the country during weeks, early this year, when the authorities believed the virus was mainly overseas.\n\nIncluded in Mr. Gustafson's suspicions of an undercount: himself. He is convinced that he had the coronavirus in January, when he was so crushingly tired and feverish, he could scarcely summon the strength to walk to the bathroom from his bed.\n\n\"I think it was here long before we knew it,\" said Mr. Gustafson, who is also a nurse and said he believes that he contracted the virus from one of the recently deceased people who was brought to the coroner's office long before anyone in Illinois was looking for positive coronavirus cases. \"That's the only logical thing I can think of.\"\n\nSome people have spent part of their days sheltering at home going over the details of their bouts with what could have been the coronavirus. In Rothschild, Wis., Tommie Swenson and his girlfriend, Tammy Swikert, keep thinking of the illness they contracted during the winter that spread widely through their village of 5,000 people.\n\nIt was nothing like the flu, said Mr. Swenson, a retired truck driver. Milk and soda tasted funny, or like nothing at all. He could barely sleep at night, he had such a rattling cough and felt a crushing weight on his chest.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A $484 billion coronavirus aid package is headed to President Trump's desk after the House cleared it, 388-5, on a bipartisan vote. As states face a downturn worse than the Great Recession, McConnell suggests they consider bankruptcy. Wednesday was California's \"deadliest day,\" with 115 deaths, though Pence predicts an end by Memorial Day. See more updates Updated 11m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"We talk about it all the time,\" Mr. Swenson said. \"What if we did have the coronavirus? Are we immune to it now, or are we going to catch it again? What does this mean?\"\n\nInfectious disease experts say the answer is complicated. Many believe that between five and 20 times more people have been exposed to the coronavirus than have tested positive, and there is a growing body of data to support that.\n\nBut the likelihood that you are one of them varies based on where you live. Blood tests that can detect coronavirus antibodies may have high false positive rates when exposure to the virus in a given population is relatively low. It was also a bad year for seasonal influenza, so if you felt lousy in January or February, there is a decent chance you had the flu. And even as more reliable antibody tests become available, it is not known how long people who have antibodies may be immune to the virus.\n\n\"Everyone desperately wants to be immune to this thing,\" said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine, \"and they're projecting their hope onto the data.\"\n\nBeyond the yearning to know one's own status, knowing how many people in a population have been infected is important because of herd immunity. Since an infected person is thought to pass the virus on to two or three other people, for the virus to stop spreading, at least 50 percent of the population has to have been exposed.\n\n\"In terms of policy decisions, we're nowhere near herd immunity, so that's the answer,\" said Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida.\n\nIn hard-hit New York City, about 21 percent of supermarket customers who were tested for coronavirus antibodies tested positive, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Thursday. If that rate proved consistent across the city, that would mean that about 1.7 million people -- or 12 times the number of now confirmed cases -- have had it.\n\nBut in California, experts say, the number of infected people is most likely below 5 percent -- and as in other places where the cases and deaths per capita is lower, the size of the infected population is harder to gauge with currently available rapid antibody tests.\n\nExperts said it would take time to develop, validate and deploy antibody tests that are reliable, and to understand their significance when it comes to individual immunity.\n\n\"Yes, people will in this country be able to find out, but not today,\" said Eva Harris, a professor of infectious diseases of at the University of California, Berkeley, who is studying exposure to the virus over time in the Bay Area.\n\nDeaths from January and February are also getting new scrutiny after an announcement this week in Santa Clara County, Calif., that a woman who died on Feb. 6 had been found to have the coronavirus. Her death occurred weeks earlier than what had previously been thought to be the first death in the United States from the virus.\n\nDr. Michelle Jorden, the Santa Clara County Medical Examiner-Coroner, said her office was investigating other deaths as well. Her office has sent samples of suspicious cases to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and some are still pending.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California has said investigators were looking at coroner and autopsy reports going back to December in some of the state's counties to determine if there might be other, earlier deaths caused by the coronavirus.\n\nExperts said it would be difficult to distinguish, in hindsight, between the seasonal flu and the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Jeffrey V. Smith, the Santa Clara county executive and a medical doctor, said his wife, also a doctor, reported being puzzled by patients she was seeing in the Bay Area in December.\n\n\"I remember her telling me back in December of a number of patients who came in with flulike symptoms who were testing negative for the flu,\" Dr. Smith said. \"I just wonder if those were patients that had coronavirus.\"\n\nIn February, experts said, tests were scarce and C.D.C. guidelines for administering them were stringent, leaving all sorts of unanswered questions now.\n\n\"There was this weird, uncomfortable silent period,\" said Dr. Sara Cody, the chief health officer of Santa Clara County. \"We were hearing about all these people who were ill, but they didn't meet the test criteria so we weren't testing them.\"\n\nDave Cortese, a member of the board of supervisors of Santa Clara County, has requested a full list of deaths in the county from January to March, a period in which he says the county experienced more deaths than the year earlier.\n\n\"I am calling for the county to redouble its efforts to release information about all deaths from Covid-19,\" Mr. Cortese said, \"and tie data points together to provide a completely candid analysis of the information we have.\"\n\nFor those whose family members have been sickened, the gnawing question -- was it Covid-19? -- lingers.\n\nThe family of Ian Carrier, 36, has struggled to understand the underlying illness that sent Mr. Carrier to a hospital in San Francisco on Christmas Day with a fever and a severe cough. He spent two months there, and was intubated and put on a ventilator, before being released.\n\nApril Slone, Mr. Carrier's sister, said that he had long grappled with significant health issues, but that doctors could not explain his condition. He tested negative for the flu.\n\n\"Every day it was something new,\" said Ms. Slone. \"We couldn't figure it out.\"\n\nThen Ms. Slone read about a link between the coronavirus and kidney problems, an issue Mr. Carrier had begun experiencing.\n\n\"That's when the light bulb went on,\" Ms. Slone said. \"I called my parents and said, 'I think he had Covid' and they said, 'We do, too.'\"\n\nThis week, Mr. Carrier returned to U.C.S.F. Parnassus hospital for complications resulting from the kidney problems, his family said. They have been seeking antibody testing for Mr. Carrier, hoping that doctors will learn whether he was exposed to the virus in December, though it is uncertain whether a test will be available\n\nKristen Bole, a spokeswoman for the hospital, declined to comment on Mr. Carrier's case but said antibody tests were primarily being used as a tool to improve the diagnosis of patients with current symptoms and for people planning to donate plasma or take part in vaccine trials.\n\nIn Oakland, Calif., Kevin F. Adler said he wonders now about his grandfather, Jason Adler, 97, who died on Feb. 2. A nursing home director described his death as tied to \"respiratory issues,\" the younger Mr. Adler said.\n\nIn the days after his death, Mr. Adler said, another person in the small nursing home died, and Mr. Adler's family members grew ill with sore throats and fevers. That has left the family wondering.\n\n\"It's important to understand how something like the coronavirus was potentially affecting our communities, and especially vulnerable groups, way before there was a national understanding of what was going on,\" Mr. Adler said. \"In my family's case, it was just one person. But there are likely hundreds of families like us.\"\n\nJulie Bosman reported from Chicago, Thomas Fuller from San Francisco, and Amy Harmon from New York.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nBishnu Virachan was a bicycle deliveryman for a grocery store in Queens. With New York City locked down, he was busier than ever.\n\nBut in early April, as he was watching television, he felt \"a pain in my heart.\" It frightened him, but he did not go to the emergency room. Mr. Virachan, 43, was even more afraid of that.\n\n\"What can I do? What can I do?\" he asked. \"Everywhere, the coronavirus.\"\n\nAfter a few days, pain overrode fear and he went to Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. Doctors discovered a nearly complete blockage of his left main coronary artery.\n\nA surgeon opened the artery, but Mr. Virachan was left with a weakened heart. Had he waited much longer, doctors said, he would have died.\n\nFear of the coronavirus is leading people with life-threatening emergencies, like a heart attack or stroke, to stay home when ordinarily they would have rushed to the emergency room, preliminary research suggests. Without prompt treatment, some patients, like Mr. Virachan, have suffered permanent damage or have died.\n\nEmergency rooms have about half the normal number of patients, and heart and stroke units are nearly empty, according to doctors at many urban medical centers. Some medical experts fear more people are dying from untreated emergencies than from the coronavirus.\n\nA recent paper by cardiologists at nine large medical centers estimated a 38 percent reduction since March 1 in the number patients with serious heart attacks coming in to have urgently needed procedures to open their arteries.\n\nOn a recent day at the Cleveland Clinic, there were only seven patients in the 24-bed coronary care unit. Usually the unit is full.\n\n\"Where are the patients?\" asked Dr. Steven Nissen, a cardiologist there. \"That can't be normal.\"\n\nOne of the few was a man who lives in Cleveland. According to Dr. Nissen, the man felt chest pain while doing push-ups, but feared going to the hospital because there might be coronavirus patients there. He stayed home for a week, growing weaker -- out of breath with the slightest exertion, his legs swelling. Finally, on April 16, he went to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Some states are moving to reopen. But the path ahead is far from simple. Trump amplifies drugs and disinfectants as treatments, even as experts push back. The U.S. conducted 1.2 million tests in a week, but experts say that is not enough. See more updates Updated 15m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nWhat should have been an easily treated heart attack had progressed to a life-threatening disaster. He survived after a dicey operation and spent nearly a week in intensive care, including several days on a ventilator, Dr. Nissen said.\n\nThe inpatient stroke unit at Stanford University Medical Center in California usually has 12 to 15 patients, said its director, Dr. Gregory Albers. On one recent day in April, there were none at all, something that had never happened.\n\n\"It's frightening,\" Dr. Albers said. Yet few Covid-19 patients have been admitted to the hospital, and people needing emergency treatment have little to fear.\n\n\"We prepared for an onslaught, but it has not arrived,\" Dr. Albers said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Samin Sharma, who heads the cardiac catheterization lab at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, the number of heart attack patients fell from seven in February to three in March. So far in April there have been only two.\n\nIt's not just the United States. Dr. Valentin Fuster, editor of the Journal of American College of Cardiology, said he is getting so many papers from around the world on the steep decline in heart attack patients in hospitals that he simply cannot publish them all.\n\nA hospital in Jaipur, India, for example, that Dr. Sharma owns, treated 45 heart attack patients in January, he said. In February, there were 32, and in March, 12. In April, so far the number is just six.\n\nResearchers in Austria estimated that in March 110 citizens died from untreated heart attacks, compared with 86 who died of Covid-19. They based their calculations on a precipitous decline in patients going to hospitals, the expected number of heart attacks in Austria, and the mortality rates of untreated heart attacks.\n\n\"I am very very worried that we are creating a problem that will have long-term consequences for the health of the community,\" said Dr. Richard A. Chazal, medical director of the Heart and Vascular Institute at Lee Health in Fort Myers, Fla., and a past president of the American College of Cardiology.\n\nCould it be that there actually are fewer medical emergencies now? Dr. Fuster speculated that perhaps people are healthier because they are eating better, exercising more and under less stress now that so many are working from home. And, of course, the air is cleaner in urban areas.\n\nOther experts doubt that better health habits could have such dramatic and immediate effects. Far from eating better, Dr. Nissen said, many patients tell him they are overeating comfort food. There is no evidence that people are exercising more, and people are hardly under less stress.\n\n\"They are scared to death,\" Dr. Nissen said.\n\nAnd, he said, even if some people changed their habits, studies have failed to find any immediate effects of short-term lifestyle changes on heart attack rates.\n\nAt the moment, it is nearly impossible to know who is not showing up in emergency rooms, and why, said Dr. Harlan Krumholz, a cardiologist at Yale University. \"You can't find the dog that doesn't bark,\" he said.\n\nBut you can get a sense from the patients who do show up, even belatedly.\n\nKaplana Jain, 60, of Cresskill, N.J, was watching CNN late at night on April 18. She got up to go to the bathroom and collapsed on the floor. Her blood sugar was elevated, and her family called 911.\n\nWhen the paramedics arrived, Ms. Jain told them she did not want to go to the hospital. \"I was scared because of the coronavirus going on,\" she said.\n\nThe next day, unable to walk, she called Dr. Sharma, a family friend. He urged her to go to the hospital, but still fearful, she insisted on going to his office the next day.\n\nWhen she arrived, Dr. Sharma did an EKG that confirmed she was having a heart attack. He rushed her to the hospital and opened a blocked artery.\n\n\"She is one of the lucky people with this kind of heart attack who didn't develop cardiac arrest or go into shock,\" he said. Had she not gone to the hospital, she likely would have died at home.\n\nBack at the Cleveland Clinic, a man arrived with stroke symptoms on April 15. According to Dr. Thomas Waters, an emergency room physician, the man had waited two days to come in because he was afraid of the coronavirus. There was nothing doctors could do to prevent permanent brain damage.\n\n\"What's done is done,\" Dr. Waters said. \"Now we are at a point where we have nothing to offer but rehab.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThree weeks after Marc Lamparello was released early from Rikers Island jail because of concerns over the coronavirus, he drove his parents' van to the George Washington Bridge and tried to climb over an 11-foot fence intended to prevent suicides. The police stopped him.\n\nA week later, Mr. Lamparello tried again. This time he jumped from the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, killing himself exactly a year after he had made headlines for walking into St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan with two gasoline cans, lighter fluid and lighters. Prosecutors said he had intended to burn the iconic church down.\n\nAs a condition of his release, Mr. Lamparello, who had schizophrenia, was supposed to receive intense psychiatric treatment at a hospital in New Jersey, where he lived. But he entered a mental health system that had been disrupted by the outbreak, leaving him without psychiatric help for a crucial month, according to his family and his lawyer.\n\nSuicides are often hard to foresee or prevent, and motives are difficult to discern, even in hindsight. After his first attempt, Mr. Lamparello told his family he never intended to jump from the George Washington Bridge but wanted \"to see the water and the breeze.\" And in the days before his death, he said he was optimistic about his future.\n\nStill, Mr. Lamparello's death seems to highlight the fraying nature of psychiatric care for some people with mental illness who are being released from city jails as part of an effort to combat the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHis sister and mother blamed his death on the chaotic delay in the start of his treatment -- partly because of the pandemic. \"He was failed,\" Mr. Lamparello's sister, Lee Nelms, said in an interview early last week. \"My brother was a victim not only of his mental illness but also the mental health system.\"\n\nOfficials at the hospital, Bergen New Bridge Medical Center in Paramus, defended the care Mr. Lamparello received, without going into detail.\n\n\"The stress of something as significant as this pandemic will undoubtedly have far-reaching mental health impacts,\" said Donnalee Corrieri, a spokeswoman for the hospital. \"His interactions with our facility and the treatment we provided followed our protocols.\"\n\nOn March 20, a judge ordered the release of Mr. Lamparello, 38, from Rikers Island as part of the city effort to curb the spread of the virus behind bars. He had been held at the jail complex for about three months after being treated at a psychiatric hospital for inmates in upstate New York, according to his lawyer, Chris DiLorenzo.\n\nProsecutors did not object. They had already agreed that Mr. Lamparello, whose case was handled by a special court for defendants with mental illness, could be released in April to start psychiatric treatment with the understanding he would plead guilty to attempted arson on May 1. The case would have been dismissed after he completed treatment.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York 'I have no regrets about calling out this danger,' de Blasio said of a crowded Hasidic funeral. Transit officials announced a plan to address the issue of homeless people on subway. Murphy announced 329 deaths and said New Jersey parks would reopen on Saturday. See more updates Updated 8h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nBut Mr. DiLorenzo asked that Mr. Lamparello be freed early because of the virus. The disease had killed 10 correction staff and three inmates in the city's jails and had sickened hundreds.\n\nSix days after Mr. Lamparello's release, his mother, Dolores Lamparello, took him from their home in Hasbrouck Heights to the hospital to start what was supposed to have been an intensive program -- five days a week for six and a half hours each day.\n\nBut hospital staff told Mr. Lamparello that because he had come from Rikers Island, the hospital required that he isolate himself for a quarantine period. He was dropped from the program, his mother said.\n\nTwo weeks later, Ms. Lamparello completed the paperwork to have her son reinstated into the program on April 9, but was told, again, he could not start, she said.\n\n\"My son's without any help -- it's three weeks,\" Ms. Lamparello recalled\n\nOn Good Friday, Mr. Lamparello said he was going to take a walk, but instead he took the keys to his parents' van, drove onto the George Washington Bridge and made his first attempt to jump, according to his family.\n\nPolice in Fort Lee, N.J., stopped him and rushed him to the Bergen New Bridge Medical Center for psychiatric treatment. The hospital released him five days later, on April 15, after lowering the dosage of his antipsychotic medication, Ms. Lamparello said.\n\nAfter he got home, he played songs on the piano, baked a cake and made chili. \"He gave no indication he was depressed,\" his mother said. He was scheduled to finally begin the outpatient program on April 20.\n\nHe never made it. On April 17, he told his parents he was going out for a ride and to get a bagel with cream cheese. The police pulled Mr. Lamparello's body from New York Harbor after he jumped from the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge at about 2:30 p.m.\n\nMs. Lamparello said the hospital had erred in delaying the counseling sessions and deciding to release her son after his first attempted suicide. \"They dropped the ball twice,\" she said.\n\nThe youngest of four siblings, Mr. Lamparello had grown up in an old colonial house in Hasbrouck Heights where he lived for much of his life. He excelled at music and found joy in reading and staying abreast of current affairs. He graduated from Boston College, obtained a masters from the University of Pennsylvania and spent a semester at Oxford University in England.\n\nPeople close to him said he had always been an introvert and longed for more social connections. \"I got the sense he was lonely,\" said Joe Sasanuma, one of Mr. Lamparello's only friends.\n\nMr. Lamparello was initially treated in 2007 for depression and obsessive compulsive disorder, according to a report by his psychiatrist. As long as he took his medication, he was fine, his mother said.\n\nBut a few years later, he began to have psychotic symptoms. In 2012, he stopped bathing and told his doctor that his brother was trying to murder him. He also said the \"universe is trying to conspire against me in a metaphysical way to give me H.I.V.,\" according to his health records.\n\nBy 2017, Mr. Lamparello was tremulous, unkempt and had trouble maintaining eye contact, his psychiatrist noted in a report. The doctor increased his medication.\n\nYet he managed to write a book about philosophy, \"Reason and Counterpoint,\" which was published in 2016. He also got jobs as an adjunct professor of philosophy, teaching at Lehman College, a branch of the City University of New York in the Bronx, and Seton Hall University in New Jersey, starting in late 2017 or early 2018, his mother said.\n\nHe stopped seeing his psychiatrist in May 2018, records show. That October, he showed up at the Hasbrouck Heights police department and told officers he believed people from CUNY were trying to kill him for his political views. He also complained that helicopters were following him.\n\nThree months later, Mr. Lamparello traveled to the White House and asked to see President Donald Trump, his mother said. He told Secret Service agents he wanted to encourage the president to give his State of the Union address in the House chamber, despite a threat by the House speaker to bar the speech while parts of the government were shut down. Days later, Secret Service agents showed up at Ms. Lamparello's home and searched her son's room.\n\nAfter that incident, Ms. Lamparello begged him to take his medication, but he refused. He had also dropped his psychiatrist in December 2018, records show. When he finally returned to treatment in March, he was given a diagnosis of schizophrenia.\n\nOver the next few weeks, his mother said he began to read the Bible more. On April 15, 2019, he was arrested after he refused to leave Newark's Sacred Heart Cathedral after closing. \"I know all the sins the priests have committed,\" he told the officers. \"If you want me to leave tonight, you are going to have to handcuff me and arrest me and take me to jail.\"\n\nMs. Lamparello again pleaded with her son to take his medication, to no avail. \"I sensed there wasn't anything I could say to get through to him,\" she said. \"That was not my son. It was like something had taken possession of his body.\"\n\nTwo days later, Mr. Lamparello canceled his classes for the day. He bought a gold cross with a chain at a religious store, according to court documents. Then he took a three-mile walk in a park, purchased a one-way, $2,800 plane ticket to Rome for the next day and had lunch at the Saddlebrook Diner.\n\nLater that day, he drove to New York City, parked his van near St. Patrick's Cathedral and walked into the sanctuary with two cans of gasoline and lighter fluid. Ushers stopped him, and he said he was trying to take a shortcut through the cathedral to reach his van, which he said was out of gas.\n\nPolice officers questioned him as he left the cathedral and, discovering his van had gas, arrested him on charges of attempted arson and reckless endangerment.\n\nAt home, his mother watched a report on the evening news about an incident at St. Patrick's. Her doorbell rang: It was New York City detectives.\n\n\"Then, the nightmare began,\" Ms. Lamparello said.",

        "body": "The app, which allows people to record their symptoms, was remarkably effective in predicting infections. The most reliable indicators, researchers found, were loss of smell and taste.\n\nIn the absence of widespread on-demand testing, public health officials across the world have been struggling to track the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in real time. A team of scientists in the United States and the United Kingdom say a crowdsourcing smartphone app may be the answer to that quandary.\n\nIn a study published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers found that an app that allows people to check off symptoms they are experiencing was remarkably effective in predicting coronavirus infections among the 2.5 million people who were using it between March 24 and April 21.\n\nThe study, which tracked people in the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden, found that the loss of taste and smell, was the No. 1 predictor of whether a person was going to get sick with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, followed by extreme fatigue and acute muscle pain.\n\nUsing a mathematical model, the researchers were able to predict with nearly 80 percent accuracy whether a person was likely to have Covid-19 based on their age, sex and a combination of four symptoms: loss of taste or smell, persistent cough, fatigue and loss of appetite.\n\nTwo-thirds of those who later tested positive for the virus -- about 15,000 people -- had self-reported the loss of taste and smell, the study found. Fever and cough -- symptoms that have been considered the most reliable indicators of infection -- ranked fourth and fifth on the list.\n\n\"It's just such a weird symptom that doesn't occur with most other diseases so it's rarely wrong,\" said Dr. Tim Spector, a professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London and a lead author of the study.\n\nBecause loss of smell and taste is often associated with mild cases of Covid-19, Dr. Spector said health officials could act on information provided by a surveillance app to encourage participants to isolate themselves until they were able to get tested.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The White House plans to ask most officials -- but not Trump -- to wear face masks. As states rush to reopen, scientists fear the virus will come back. Trump uses misleading numbers to praise his administration's virus response. See more updates Updated 50m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"The more we collect this stuff and the more we document it properly, the better we can deal with new outbreaks,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers said they hoped the findings might persuade the World Health Organization and other health agencies to modify guidelines that currently rank fever and cough well above loss of taste and smell as symptoms for determining who to screen for Covid-19.\n\nDr. Andrew T. Chan, a professor at Harvard Medical School and the lead investigator on the study, said a surveillance app could help health authorities identify people at the early stage of the disease who are unknowingly spreading the virus to others.\n\n\"At the moment, we're mostly gathering data on the tip of the iceberg from those who are really sick and show up at the hospital. But there is a huge iceberg below of people with mild symptoms who we know are major culprits for community spread,\" said Dr. Chan, who is also chief of clinical and translational epidemiology at Massachusetts General Hospital. \"We have no ability to track these people at home and that's a real problem.\"\n\nIf more widely adopted, the study results could provide public health authorities an inexpensive tool for detecting outbreaks in cities, states and even individual neighborhoods. Given that the loss of taste and smell appears to be an early indicator of Covid-19, the information, the researchers said, would allow health officials to prepare for a spike of infections and help guide the allocation of scarce resources like ventilators for the most seriously ill, and the personal protective gear needed by medical workers.\n\nAs local outbreaks subside, the app can also guide decisions about the easing of lockdowns and social distancing measures.\n\nThe researchers said the app did not prompt significant privacy concerns because participants are not required to provide their names and any other personal information, only their ZIP codes.\n\nJohn Brownstein, an epidemiologist and chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital, said the study added to the growing body of evidence that highlights the value of smartphone apps as real-time disease surveillance tools. Dr. Brownstein, who was not involved in the coronavirus app study, has a decade of experience using crowdsource symptom apps, starting with an influenza app called Flu Near Me, and more recently, Covid Near You, an app that has already drawn more than 600,000 users in the United States.\n\nSurveillance apps, he said, can detect an outbreak well before people begin showing up at hospitals. \"Because we have such a lack of testing, this kind of data is going to give us insights into symptomatology, hot spots and the impact of social distancing,\" he said. \"Without this information, how are communities supposed to know we're on the other side of this pandemic and whether we can reopen?\"\n\nBut crowdsourcing apps do not provide a complete snapshot of the coronavirus pandemic. Because users tend to be younger, they are less than ideal for charting its progression among the elderly.\n\nAnd they are also not a replacement for testing, which is the most effective means for tracking the spread of the disease. The data can also be muddled by people who report symptoms shared by other illnesses.\n\n\"It's a sort of real-time experiment done on a massive scale that couldn't have been done a couple of years ago,\" Dr. Spector said.\n\nThe app he helped develop piggybacks on technology that King's College London has been using to track health outcomes among 14,000 twins in the United Kingdom. When the coronavirus outbreak temporarily idled the project, Dr. Spector realized their app could be easily repurposed to track the pandemic.\n\n\"It was a crazy idea, but four days later we launched the app and it went viral,\" he said. Within three days, more than a million people had downloaded the app, a number that has since grown to 3.3 million.\n\nDr. Cristina Menni, a research fellow at King's College and another lead author of the study, said the researchers continued to refine the app. Among their goals is finding a way to gauge whether pre-existing conditions or genetic factors might magnify the health risks for people infected with the virus.\n\nBut for now, she said, crowdsourcing apps may be a useful public health tool to help contain the pandemic.\n\n\"Because there hasn't been widespread testing, monitoring for symptoms of the coronavirus is a very cheap and simple way of doing it,\" she said. \"At the very least, anyone who reports a loss of taste and smell should self-isolate until they can get tested.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nDoctors around the world, trying to save seriously ill coronavirus patients, have been dosing them with rheumatoid arthritis drugs that can squelch immune responses. The theory was that many were dying because their immune systems went into overdrive, creating a fatal storm that attacked their lungs.\n\nBut now, preliminary results on treatments with one of these drugs, sarilumab, marketed as Kevzara and made by Regeneron and Sanofi, indicate that it does not help patients who are hospitalized but not using ventilators.\n\nThe rush to treat patients with rheumatoid arthritis drugs began with a tiny study in China in February. It involved just 21 patients, all of whom were hospitalized with Covid-19. All of the patients received a drug made by Roche, tocilizumab, that is very similar to sarilumab. The doctors reported that the patients' fevers disappeared within days and, the doctors wrote, that \"all other symptoms improved remarkably.\" They ended on an optimistic note, writing, \"Tocilizumab is an effective treatment in severe patients with Covid-19.\"\n\nDr. George D. Yancopoulos, chief scientific officer of Regeneron, said the company had rushed to start a clinical trial of its drug in coronavirus patients. But he was not optimistic. Drugs like sarilumab and tocilizumab were specifically designed for arthritis, not Covid, he noted.\n\n\"Repurposing existing drugs has not had a history of success in the pharmaceutical industry,\" he said.\n\nBut, with doctors around the world dosing ill patients with the arthritis drugs, Regeneron and Sanofi decided it was urgent to get reliable data.\n\nTheir clinical trial randomly assigned 457 hospitalized Covid-19 patients to receive either 400 milligrams or 200 milligrams of sarilumab, or a placebo. The patients fell into two groups -- \"severe,\" meaning they required oxygen but did not need a ventilator or so-called high flow oxygen, and \"critical,\" those who needed a ventilator, high flow oxygen or were in intensive care.\n\nAlthough the drug reduced c-reactive protein, which rises in severe inflammation, it did not help the severely ill patients, the companies reported on Monday. Many of those patients recovered on their own. Eighty percent were discharged from the hospital, whether or not they were given the drug. Ten percent remained hospitalized, and ten percent died.\n\nThe results for the critically ill patients are not conclusive but there is a hint that such patients may be helped, so the study will continue with only critically ill patients. More than 600 have been enrolled. Results are expected in early June.\n\nTo date, even small controlled studies of 25, 30 or 50 patients are misleading, Dr. Yancopoulos said. What is needed are rigorous studies with sufficient numbers of patients to get reliable results.\n\nThe companies are also conducting a second controlled trial of the arthritis drug in 400 critically ill patients outside the United States. Preliminary results will be available in the third quarter, the companies say.\n\nSanofi and Regeneron have also designed a monoclonal antibody drug that is targeted specifically to the coronavirus, in the same way they designed the only drug that has worked against Ebola. Clinical trials of the drug will start in June.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- When Vice President Mike Pence descended onto the tarmac in Colorado Springs last Saturday, his first appearance outside the White House grounds in over a month, he was greeted by the Democratic governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, who was wearing a face mask emblazoned with images from his state flag.\n\nMr. Pence tapped elbows with Mr. Polis, rather than offering a hand, but he kept his face uncovered, a decision in line with President Trump's position: Mr. Trump said this month that he would not follow guidelines from his own Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and wear a face mask.\n\nThe tarmac photo opportunity between two elected officials in various states of facial undress underscored how politicians are, or aren't, modeling the precautions they have recommended to their constituents.\n\nFor the most part, top officials -- from governors and mayors to Mr. Trump and his team -- have chosen not to use masks, at least in public or at televised events, even as they encourage people to wear them. Some political analysts say image-conscious politicians may resist masks, even if they are warranted, for fear that the coverings might make them look pessimistic or nervous.\n\nBut leaders inevitably risk looking hypocritical by preaching a message about masks and then forgoing, especially when they are surrounded by aides and others. Health experts say modeling behavior is the right thing for public officials to do.\n\n\"If you're instructing people to do stuff and you yourself aren't doing it, that often sends the wrong message, and that's an inconsistency in the guidance,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nFor leaders who do seek to promote best practices, they face the possibility of appearing alien to Americans who have yet to grow accustomed to wearing masks. Bill de Blasio, the Democratic mayor of New York City, for instance, was mocked for looking like an \"Old West bank robber\" after covering his face with a bandanna while leaving a news conference this month. And Gov. Ron DeSantis, Republican of Florida, committed a gaffe when he tried to put on an N95 mask in public and left one of the straps dangling from his chin.\n\nPolitical advisers acknowledged that more might go into the decision to don a mask than the advice of health experts. \"Masks, whether worn by superheroes or villains, hide your identity,\" said Philippe Reines, a longtime aide to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \"Not always a good idea when you're selling yourself.\"\n\nThe decision of whether to appear in public in a face mask does not seem to break down by political party, or by whether a lawmaker represents one of the hot spots of the outbreak.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Timeline of virus's arrival in the U.S. shifts with the revelation of an early death in California. Trump backs away from a broad ban on immigration, but many will still feel effect of the restrictions. Stocks and oil prices rebound from waves of selling. See more updates Updated 5m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nFor instance, Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, has been wearing a mask in public since the C.D.C. put out its recommendation, while Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, a Democrat, has defended his decision not to cover his face during news conferences. Both governors lead states with widespread outbreaks of the coronavirus.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer, Democrat of Michigan, was photographed in a mask on April 14 while she toured an alternative care facility.\n\nLast weekend, Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York, a Democrat who recently issued an executive order requiring New Yorkers to wear a mask in many public places, was seen leaving his house for a walk with what appeared to be a bandanna tied around his face, the first time the public had seen him cover up.\n\nHis rule of thumb, aides said, is to wear a mask or face covering, in public or in private, whenever he is less than six feet from anyone else. That doesn't include his daily news conference, where reporters and government officials sit far apart from one another.\n\nMr. DeSantis was slow to shut down his state but quicker to don a mask in public, being photographed wearing one on April 8.\n\nSeveral other governors have worn face coverings in public, including Larry Hogan of Maryland, a Republican, and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Jay Inslee of Washington, both Democrats.\n\n\"I've been wearing a mask when I go out,\" Mr. Pritzker told reporters on April 5, after entering the briefing room with his mouth and nose covered. \"I did it this morning when I was out, and I did it when I came here.\"\n\nGov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, also a Democrat, said at a news conference this month that he had taken his mask off \"because otherwise I'm not sure you'd be able to understand us.\"\n\n\"We'll keep them on for the balance of any amount of time we're remotely near anybody,\" Mr. Murphy said.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, many senators have not worn masks during their pro forma sessions. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican, was photographed in a surgical mask outside of the Senate on Monday, removing it to deliver his remarks on the Senate floor. And House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Tuesday simply pulled a blue patterned scarf over her face as she arrived at and departed from her news conference.\n\nAt the White House, aides have dismissed the few National Security Council officials who wear masks in the West Wing as \"alarmists.\" And Mr. Trump appeared to scoff at a reporter who tried to ask a question at a recent news conference while wearing a mask, saying he could \"barely\" hear his question.\n\nAdministration officials also dismissed Mr. Polis's decision to wear a mask while greeting Mr. Pence as a bit of political theater. (Mr. Polis's office did not return a phone call on Tuesday.) The vice president, aides said, did not need to wear one because he is tested regularly for the coronavirus -- a faulty argument, according to public health experts.\n\n\"When the face-covering guidelines were developed, it was with the intention to not only protect yourself, but primarily to protect others from asymptomatic spread,\" said Katie Miller, Mr. Pence's spokeswoman. \"Vice President Pence is negative for Covid-19 and is therefore not asymptomatic.\"\n\nMr. Pence could, of course, contract the virus between tests. More important, public health experts noted that the tests themselves were not infallible.\n\nEven in Covid-19 patients who are showing symptoms, diagnostic tests may detect the virus only 75 percent of the time, said Dr. Mark Loeb, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at McMaster University, and it isn't clear how sensitive the tests are in asymptomatic cases.\n\n\"We don't actually have the estimates for the sensitivity, the ability to rule out false negatives, for asymptomatic testing,\" Dr. Loeb said. \"So it's certainly something, but it doesn't necessarily rule out infection.\"\n\nAt a White House news conference on Monday night, Dr. Deborah L. Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator, also emphasized that tests were not always reliable.\n\nOther experts said that, while preventing asymptomatic transmission is the medical goal of the guidelines on masks, it is not the only reason for public officials to wear them. By wearing masks in public, officials model the behavior they are asking citizens to adopt and can help influence people to take the guidelines seriously.\n\nThere is disagreement within the medical community on how effective cloth masks -- as opposed to surgical or N95 masks -- are in preventing asymptomatic transmission, Dr. Adalja said, but \"if you're part of a team that's actually advocating people to wear those masks, then I think it becomes odd if you're not wearing a mask.\"\n\nMr. Trump undercut the mask recommendation even as he announced it on April 3, emphasizing repeatedly that it was voluntary.\n\n\"You can do it,\" he said. \"You don't have to do it. I am choosing not to do it.\"\n\n\"Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens -- I don't know,\" he added. \"Somehow, I don't see it for myself.\"\n\nAnnie Karni reported from Washington, and Maggie Astor from New York.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The White House threatens to veto a $3 trillion pandemic relief bill, and a study suggests that even talking can propel the droplets that spread the virus.\n\nThis briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's what you need to know:As the virus devastates tax revenues, states must follow balanced-budget laws.In swing states, reopening deepens the political divide.The C.D.C. releases checklists for schools and businesses seeking to reopen.The White House threatens to veto a $3 trillion relief bill.The virus killed a police officer. His town lined the streets to mourn him.Even talking can propel the droplets that spread the virus, a study suggests.The F.D.A. says a test used by the White House may produce false negatives.As the virus devastates tax revenues, states must follow balanced-budget laws.\n\nIn February, Ohio was running a $200 million budget surplus. Then the coronavirus pandemic struck, and two months later -- as tax revenue plummeted and public health expenses skyrocketed -- the state was facing a $777 million hole.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, ordered immediate cuts to close the gap. He had no choice. The pandemic, Mr. DeWine said, \"does not exempt us from balancing our budget, which we are legally obligated to do.\"\n\nOhio is hardly alone. Every state is grappling with a version of the same problem, and all but one -- Vermont -- have balanced-budget laws in place. And for most, the new fiscal year starts on July 1, leaving them desperate for help with just a few weeks to come up with a plan.\n\nA coalition of five Democratic governors said on Monday that state and local governments needed $1 trillion in federal relief or they would be forced to decide between funding public health care programs or laying off teachers, police officers and other workers.\n\nDemocrats in Washington have supported those requests, but some Republicans -- including President Trump -- have suggested that Democratic-controlled states are seeking a bailout for poor decisions that predate the pandemic.\n\nThe problem is that balanced-budget laws have left states with few options. And the coronavirus adds to the strain every day: Stay-at-home orders and frozen economic activity have cut state sales- and income-tax revenue, and services that are largely unused, like airports and public transit, still must be maintained.\n\nGeorgia has instructed all state agencies to reduce spending by 14 percent by May 20. California has already borrowed $348 million, and Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday proposed steep cuts to public schools and universities and health care as part of a revised budget.\n\nThe new California budget would cut spending by 9 percent over all, but like Mr. DeWine, Mr. Newsom said he had little choice.\n\n\"Our state is in an unprecedented emergency, facing massive job losses and shortfalls in record time,\" he wrote in a letter to legislators. \"This budget reflects that emergency.\"\n\nIn swing states, reopening deepens the political divide.\n\nIn Wisconsin, residents woke up to a state of confusion on Thursday after the conservative majority on the State Supreme Court sided with the Republican majority in the Legislature on Wednesday night, overturning a statewide stay-at-home order by Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat.\n\nIn Michigan, hundreds of protesters, many of them armed, turned out at the State Capitol in a drenching rainstorm. The state closed the building in advance and canceled the legislative session, rather than risk a repeat of an April protest in which angry protesters carrying long guns crowded inside.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, some Republican lawmakers urged defiance of the Democratic governor's orders to keep nonessential businesses closed, and President Trump flew to Allentown for a politically charged visit to a medical supply facility.\n\nThe response to the coronavirus in those three states, which determined the 2016 presidential election and could strongly influence the one in November, is becoming a confused and agitated blend of health guidance, protest and partisan politics -- leaving residents to fend for themselves.\n\n\"My anxiety for this pandemic is not having a unified plan, that we're all on the same page, and listening to science and the same rules,\" said Jamie O'Brien, 40, who owns a hair salon in Madison, Wis., that remains closed because of a local stay-at-home order.\n\nAcross Wisconsin, the court ruling left some residents in a festive mood, heading directly to one of the state's many taverns to celebrate. Others were determined to stay home, worried that it was too soon to return to crowded restaurants and shops.\n\n\"You have the one group that's like, 'Yay!'\" said Patty Schachtner, a Democratic state senator from western Wisconsin. \"And the other group is like, 'Man, life just got complicated.'\"\n\nIt was an unsettling microcosm of a country increasingly unable to separate bitter political divisions from plans to battle a deadly disease. Democratic governors in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, backed by public health experts, have urged caution before reopening. Republican legislatures in the states have pushed in the opposite direction, citing economic necessity and personal freedom.\n\nCoronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count\n\nA detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.\n\nThe C.D.C. releases checklists for schools and businesses seeking to reopen.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday released six flow charts meant to help schools, restaurants, transit systems and other businesses decide when to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic, the agency's first release of such guidance after a more comprehensive draft was rejected by the White House.\n\nThe decision trees are mostly composed of basic tips that can serve as a checklist for businesses before they reopen. In the slide for restaurants and bars, the C.D.C. says the establishments should feel comfortable opening if they do not violate local laws, promote good hygiene, increase cleaning, encourage social distancing and institute lenient sick leave policies, among other suggestions.\n\nThe public release of the guidance follows a tumultuous back-and-forth between the C.D.C. and the White House. Trump administration officials had sent back the C.D.C.'s initial recommendations, arguing that they were too prescriptive and rigid when the density of confirmed coronavirus cases can fluctuate widely from state to state, and even county to county. Some federal agencies also said the draft guidelines could harm businesses and the economy.\n\nNotably absent from the six decision trees released on Thursday was any mention of houses of worship, which had been a particularly contentious point in the C.D.C. guidance that was rejected. A draft of that guidance encouraged all congregants to wear masks and suggested religious institutions suspend the use of any \"choir or music ensemble.\"\n\nA C.D.C. spokesman said that further decision charts may be issued, and that the ones that were released emphasized the need for employers to work closely with local health officials.\n\nMuch of the guidance issued for the six sectors -- schools, workplaces, restaurants and bars, youth programs and camps, child care programs and mass transit -- mirrors the kind of advice that health officials have been espousing for months: the value of handwashing and social distancing, the need to protect more vulnerable populations, and the importance of regularly monitoring one's health. It is also less specific than the guidance the C.D.C. had proposed in April.\n\nBut the simple slides, which include arrows, stop sign graphics and links to further resources, could still aid principals, employers and others faced with tough decisions about whether to reopen. Nearly every state has eased restrictions on some businesses.\n\nThe White House threatens to veto a $3 trillion relief bill.\n\nThe White House threatened to veto a $3 trillion pandemic relief bill that Democrats planned to push through the House on Friday, as Republicans urged their members to reject a measure they said was a nonstarter.\n\nIn a message to the House on Thursday, White House officials called the legislation insupportable and said Democrats who drafted it were \"more concerned with delivering on longstanding partisan and ideological wish lists than with enhancing the ability of our nation to deal with the public health and economic challenges we face.\"\n\nOn a day when the two-month tally of jobless claims reached 36.5 million, the statement hinted at what Republican leaders and White House officials have suggested in recent days: That they are not certain additional economic aid measures will be needed, and that any such measure should be centered on tax cuts and liability protections for businesses.\n\nHouse Republican leaders urged their members to vote against the legislation, saying, \"Neither this bill nor anything like it will ever become law.\"\n\nEven as they prepared to muscle it through the House, Democrats were making last-minute revisions to the bill, including a provision to bar nonprofit organizations that had engaged in election activities, such as contributing to a political campaign, from receiving loans. They also added language ordering a study to examine the role of virus-related disinformation in the public's response to the pandemic.\n\nThe virus killed a police officer. His town lined the streets to mourn him.\n\nFor three weeks, a small town in northern New Jersey kept vigil over Officer Charles Roberts.\n\nEveryone in Glen Ridge knew Mr. Roberts, or at least had a story about him. He was the officer they saw in the morning at Starbucks, the one who secured their new car seats into back seats, the one who remembered their children's names from school, where his wife was a teacher and where Mr. Roberts, 45, was an officer in the drug education program.\n\nSince he had collapsed at home in April, they had prayed for him and placed signs on their doors, windows and lawns that read \"#ROBSTRONG.\"\n\nOn Thursday, three days after he died from complications of the coronavirus, the people of Glen Ridge, which is about 20 miles west of New York City, paid him one last honor.\n\nWith no central gathering spot available because of the state's lockdown orders, they filed out of their homes by the hundreds and stood on their porches, front yards and sidewalks. They placed their hands over their hearts as the hearse carrying his body made its way to the cemetery. Many wore blue and orange -- the colors of the New York Mets, Mr. Roberts's favorite baseball team -- and saluted as the hearse drove by, escorted by dozens of police cars and motorcycles from nearby towns and cities.\n\n\"He's just truly the poster image of what a Norman Rockwell police officer looks like,\" said Joseph Uliano, a fellow officer in the Glen Ridge Police Department, referring to the famous painting of a police officer chatting with a small child at a soda shop. \"If there was a 2020 version of that poster, it would be Rob sitting at that counter with that little boy.\"\n\nEven talking can propel the droplets that spread the virus, a study suggests.\n\nCoughs or sneezes may not be the only way people transmit infectious pathogens like the coronavirus to one another. Talking can also propel thousands of droplets so small they can remain suspended in the air for eight to 14 minutes, according to a new study.\n\nThe research, published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could help explain how people with mild or no symptoms may infect others in close quarters such as offices, nursing homes, cruise ships and other confined spaces.\n\nThe study's experimental conditions would need to be replicated in more real-world circumstances, and researchers still do not know how much virus has to be transmitted from one person to another to cause infection. But its findings strengthen the case for wearing masks and taking other precautions to reduce the spread of the virus.\n\nThe F.D.A. says a test used by the White House may produce false negatives.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said on Thursday night that a coronavirus test used by the White House to screen staff members and visitors may not be accurate.\n\nIn an unusual public notice, the agency said that early data suggested the Abbott ID Now test, hailed as a rapid test to diagnose infection with the virus, may return false negatives in patients who actually are infected.\n\n\"This test can still be used and can correctly identify many positive cases in minutes,\" said Dr. Tim Stenzel, director of the F.D.A.'s Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health.\n\nBut negative results should be confirmed with another high-sensitivity test, he added.\n\nThe product, which was given emergency authorization by the F.D.A. in late March, has been enthusiastically promoted by President Trump -- it was even used as a prop during at least one news conference. Mr. Trump has said the tests are \"highly accurate.\"\n\nThe agency's warning follows a study by researchers at N.Y.U. Langone Health that found the test could miss infections up to 48 percent of the time.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The White House threatens to veto a $3 trillion relief package being debated in Congress. Monthly retail report is expected to paint dismal picture, with pandemic compounding existing problems. Stay-at-home order for N.Y.C. is extended to June 13, while some areas upstate are allowed to reopen. See more updates Updated 58m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe F.D.A. also said it had received 15 so-called \"adverse event reports\" about Abbott's device, suggesting some users were receiving false negatives. The agency said it was continuing to evaluate the test.\n\nIn a statement to investors on Thursday night, Abbott defended the ID Now test, calling it reliable when used as intended. \"Negative test results should be considered in the context of a patient's recent exposures, history and the presence of clinical signs and symptoms consistent with Covid-19,\" the statement said.\n\nIf the negative results are inconsistent with signs and symptoms, Abbott said, patients should be given an alternative test.\n\nHonolulu extends its stay-at-home order but loosens the restrictions.\n\nHawaii's most populous island and city will allow certain businesses to reopen on Friday, while extending a stay-at-home order until June 30.\n\nOn the island of Oahu, where the Honolulu city and county government are consolidated, recreational facilities will also reopen on Friday for some one-on-one exercise, and drive-in religious services will be allowed, Kirk Caldwell, the mayor, said during a news conference on Thursday.\n\nMr. Caldwell said Honolulu officials were also examining a June 5 reopening for restaurants, which have been limited to takeout and delivery.\n\nOahu accounts for 11 of the 17 coronavirus deaths in Hawaii, which has the third fewest cases among U.S. states. Local health officials reported no new cases on the island on Thursday.\n\n\"We're being very cautious here,\" Mr. Caldwell said.\n\nRetail and repair businesses, real estate services, car dealerships, florists, mobile pet groomers and golf courses may reopen on Friday but must abide by social distancing rules. Occupancy at retail shops will be limited.\n\nMr. Caldwell said he would also seek approval from the state to reopen beaches on Oahu after the island of Kauai was allowed to do so on Wednesday. \"We'd ask that you'd be at least six feet away from the next person who may be lying in the sun,\" he said.'\n\nAfter 36.5 million jobless claims in two months, there are calls to cover wages.\n\nScattershot reopenings of retail stores, nail salons and restaurants around the country have not halted the flood of layoffs, with the federal government reporting on Thursday that nearly three million people filed unemployment claims last week, bringing the two-month tally to 36.5 million.\n\nThe weekly count of new claims has been declining since late March, but that hopeful flicker barely stands out in an otherwise grim economic landscape.\n\nA new survey by the Federal Reserve found that in households making less than $40,000 a year, nearly 40 percent of those who were working in February lost their jobs in March or the beginning of April.\n\nAnd despite attempts by states to keep up with the onslaught of claims, many workers are supremely frustrated, either by their inability to submit applications or by payment delays.\n\nIn places where the fitful process of reopening has started, workers who have been called back to their jobs often face reduced hours and paychecks as well as heightened risk of infection. Declining to return, however -- whether because of health concerns or the need to care for children while schools are closed -- is likely to put an end to any jobless benefits.\n\n\"It's a very tough choice for those in the service industry and those at the lower end of the pay scale,\" said Rubeela Farooqi, the chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics. \"Do you go back and risk getting sick, or have no money coming in?\"\n\nAs job losses mounted, two ideologically opposed lawmakers came to the same conclusion: It is time for the federal government to cover workers' salaries.\n\nRepresentative Pramila Jayapal, a progressive Democrat from Washington, and Senator Josh Hawley, a conservative Republican from Missouri, are making the case to their parties' leaders that guaranteed income programs should be part of the federal relief effort.\n\nSome young adults with the virus are having strokes.\n\nNeurologists in New York City, Michigan, New Jersey and other parts of the country have reported a flurry of cases in which young, otherwise healthy adults have had strokes. Many are now convinced that unexplained episodes are yet another insidious manifestation of Covid-19.\n\nThough the strokes may be rare, they can have catastrophic consequences, including cognitive impairment, physical disability and even death.\n\n\"We're seeing a startling number of young people who had a minor cough or no recollection of viral symptoms at all, and they're self-isolating at home like they're supposed to -- and they have a sudden stroke,\" said Dr. Adam Dmytriw, a University of Toronto radiologist who is one of the authors of a paper describing a series of patients who had strokes related to Covid-19.\n\nFor some of these patients, a stroke was the first symptom of a viral infection. They put off going to the emergency room because they did not want to be exposed to the virus.\n\n\"If you don't get help, you risk being permanently disabled and needing long-term care,\" said Dr. Johanna Fifi, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Health System in New York. \"It's not going to go away on its own.\"\n\nA Texas court rules against the state's attorney general, extending voting by mail.\n\nA Texas appeals court ruled against the state's attorney general on Thursday and allowed voters who feared getting infected by the virus to cast mail-in ballots instead of showing up at the polls.\n\nThe ruling is most likely just the latest step in a complex legal process, as other lawsuits on the state's efforts to limit access to mail-in voting during the pandemic proceed in federal and state courts.\n\nAt issue are rules for casting mail-in ballots and whether healthy voters who fear contracting the virus at the polls qualify for such ballots as disabled voters. The Texas Democratic Party, voting rights groups and others who sued the state say they do. But the Republican attorney general, Ken Paxton, has said that the election code \"does not permit an otherwise healthy person to vote by mail merely because going to the polls carries some risk to public health.\"\n\nIn a separate legal move on Wednesday, Mr. Paxton asked the Texas Supreme Court to order officials in five counties to stop encouraging voters to apply to vote by mail if they feared contracting the virus.\n\nIn the latest ruling on Thursday, the state's Fourteenth Court of Appeals upheld a lower court order issued last month. In that order, a judge found that voting in person during the pandemic presented a likelihood of injuring a voter's health, and that \"any voters without established immunity meet the plain language definition of disability\" and were entitled to mail in their ballots.\n\nA whistle-blower says 'lives were lost' because the government ignored warnings.\n\nThe whistle-blower who was ousted as head of a federal medical research agency charged on Thursday that top Trump administration officials failed to heed his early warnings to stock up on masks and other supplies to combat the coronavirus, and Americans died as a result.\n\n\"Lives were endangered and I believe lives were lost,\" Dr. Rick Bright, who was removed in April as the director of the Department of Health and Human Services's Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency, told a House subcommittee. \"The window is closing to address this pandemic.\"\n\nThroughout nearly four hours of testimony, Dr. Bright told lawmakers on a House health subcommittee that the outbreak would \"get worse and be prolonged\" if the United States did not swiftly develop a national testing strategy and predicted vaccine shortages if the administration did not draft a distribution plan now.\n\nAfter holding back for nearly a month, President Trump and his health secretary, Alex M. Azar II, hit back at Dr. Bright, elevating the confrontation. Mr. Trump dismissed Dr. Bright as a \"disgruntled employee\" while Mr. Azar insisted officials followed through on the scientist's ideas.\n\n\"Everything he was complaining about was achieved,\" Mr. Azar told reporters as he and Mr. Trump were preparing to board the presidential helicopter to leave for Allentown, Pa. \"What he talked about was done.\"\n\n\"This is like someone who was in choir trying to say he was a soloist back then,\" Mr. Azar continued, adding, \"His allegations do not hold water. They do not hold water.\"\n\nDr. Bright's testimony was the first time that a federal scientist -- or any federal official -- had gone before Congress and openly accused the administration of endangering American lives by bungling its coronavirus response. He said Americans would face \"the darkest winter in modern history\" if the administration did move quickly, as people become \"restless\" to leave their homes.\n\nChanges in New York: Five counties will open, and Broadway's 'Frozen' will close.\n\nIn New York, a five-county, central area has met the criteria to begin reopening some businesses this weekend, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said. Another 157 deaths were reported, the fourth straight day the figure was below 200.\n\nState officials are now investigating 110 cases of a potentially life-threatening pediatric inflammatory syndrome that appears to be related to the virus and has so far been linked to three children's deaths. Cases have been reported in other states, including California, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nOn Broadway, the stage adaptation of \"Frozen\" will not reopen once the pandemic eases, Disney Theatrical Productions said Thursday, making it the first musical to be felled by the crisis.\n\n\"Frozen\" had been the weakest of the three Disney musicals that had been running on Broadway -- the others were \"The Lion King\" and \"Aladdin\" -- but the decision to close it came earlier than anticipated. The move is a reminder that the pandemic is likely to alter the theatrical landscape, forcing producers to reassess the financial viability of long-planned projects because of expected challenges attracting audiences and investors.\n\nWhat Is the Real Coronavirus Death Toll in Each State?\n\nA New York Times analysis of C.D.C. data begins to show just how many lives are being lost to the pandemic in each state, and how many are beyond the norm.\n\nCalifornia's public universities, schools and health care providers face steep budget cuts, the governor says.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California proposed steep cuts to public schools and universities and health care among other programs as part of a revised state budget announced Thursday that reflected the sudden loss of income brought on by the pandemic.\n\nThe budget slashes spending by nine percent overall from the initial proposal the governor made in January.\n\n\"Our state is in an unprecedented emergency, facing massive job losses and shortfalls in record time,\" he said in a letter to legislators. \"This budget reflects that emergency.\"\n\nTo cushion the blow of a projected 22 percent decline in revenue, the governor proposed drawing down the state's so-called rainy day reserves of $16 billion over the next three years.\n\nThe $203.3 billion proposed budget, if approved by the Legislature, would bring spending back to around 2018 levels. But it would still be well above the levels seen during the Great Recession a decade ago.\n\nMr. Newsom said he would begin negotiating with unions to reduce the salaries of state employees by 10 percent. The pay cuts would include the governor and his staff. \"We recognize these cuts are devastating to so many people,\" he said.\n\nMany of the proposed cuts could be canceled if the federal government agreed to additional assistance, the governor said. \"The federal government, we need you,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nThe revised budget also scratched more than $80 million that Mr. Newsom had allotted in January to expand the state's version of Medicaid to undocumented people age 65 and over. The expansion, promised last year to progressives and the Legislature's Latino caucus, had been a priority in the Legislature this year.\n\nMr. Newsom's administration is projecting a nine percent drop in overall economic activity because of the crisis, according to the governor's cabinet secretary. The state is also projecting that unemployment will peak at 25 percent this quarter, she said.\n\nExperts warn of a long struggle ahead and a virus that 'may never go away.'\n\nThe cautions came from all corners but pointed in one direction: The struggle against the virus would be long and the economic consequences lasting.\n\nThe Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the United States was experiencing an economic hit that could permanently damage the economy. The Labor Department said that nearly 3 million more people filed new unemployment claims last week. And the World Health Organization cautioned that the virus might linger for a long time.\n\n\"It is important to put this on the table: This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,\" said Mike Ryan, the head of the W.H.O. emergency response team.\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci told a Senate panel this week that a vaccine for the virus would almost certainly not be ready in time for the new school year and urged caution in the face of a pathogen that continued to surprise and baffle the world's leading scientists.\n\n\"I think we better be careful, if we are not cavalier, in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects,\" Dr. Fauci said. \"Children in general do much, much better than adults and the elderly and particularly those with underlying conditions. But I am very careful and hopefully humble in knowing that I don't know everything about this disease. And that's why I'm very reserved in making broad predictions.\"\n\nThe warnings, like so many aspects of the response to the crisis in America, were quickly swept up in dysfunctional political discourse and variously disputed, distorted or dismissed -- including by Mr. Trump himself.\n\nThe president, whose administration is forecasting a rapid economic rebound as it pushes states to ease restrictions on public life, pressed to reopen the country's schools and criticized Dr. Fauci's testimony.\n\n\"I totally disagree with him on schools,\" Mr. Trump said in an interview on Fox Business on Thursday morning. \"And we will have, I call them embers. I call them spikes. And he called -- I noticed he used the word spike. Well, you might have that, and we'll put it out.\"\n\nMr. Trump also said he expected a vaccine to be available by the end of the year, a timeline health experts have advised is unlikely. He also said the military would help with the distribution.\n\n\"Our military is now being mobilized, so at the end of the year, we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly,\" Mr. Trump said without providing specifics.\n\nJust as in a natural disaster like a hurricane, in a public health emergency, the military can be authorized to provide assistance in areas such as distributing supplies and logistics.\n\nThe White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, said Thursday on \"CBS This Morning\" that the president still had confidence in Dr. Fauci but that they were \"on opposite sides of the equation\" when it came to the reopening schools. Mr. Trump takes the advice of several medical experts before making his own decisions, she said. \"He makes the best decision based on the data presented to him,\" Ms. McEnany said.\n\nTrump wants schools to reopen. 'I'm waiting for Dr. Fauci,' the head of the largest teachers' union says.\n\nThe leaders of the nation's largest teachers' union and parent volunteer organization pushed back on Mr. Trump's efforts to reopen schools, saying only one official could reassure them that it was safe to welcome millions of students back.\n\n\"I'm waiting for Dr. Fauci,\" Lily Eskelsen Garc\u00eda, the president of the National Education Association, said Thursday on a call with reporters. \"I'm waiting not for a politician; I'm waiting for a medical, infectious-disease professional to say, 'Now we can do it, under these circumstances.'\"\n\nMs. Eskelsen Garc\u00eda joined educators and members of the National P.T.A. a day after Mr. Trump had rebuked Dr. Fauci for expressing caution about reopening schools. Dr. Fauci told a Senate panel on Tuesday that a vaccine for the virus would almost certainly not be ready in time for the new school year. \"We better be careful, if we are not cavalier, in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects,\" he said.\n\nDr. Fauci's testimony irritated Mr. Trump, who believes that reopening schools is critical to restarting the economy and to his re-election campaign. \"I totally disagree with him on schools,\" Mr. Trump said Thursday in an interview on Fox Business.\n\nSchool leaders are bracing for severe budget cuts, as they anticipate large new expenses for additional staff members and protective equipment to help mitigate the spread of the virus.\n\nWhen is it safe to go back to the gym?\n\nAfter a forced period of inactivity, many are wondering whether it is wise to return to shared exercise bikes, weights and treadmills. Public athletic facilities tend to be breeding grounds for germs. But there are things you can do to mitigate the risk of infection if you want to get a workout in.\n\nKeep up with our correspondents around the world.\n\nA powerful typhoon hit the Philippines, complicating its virus battle. The U.N. confirmed the first cases in crowded refugee camps for Rohingya Muslims in Bangladesh.

        "body": "PARIS -- Coronavirus infections have dropped sharply in Paris following a strict two-month lockdown and a growing contact tracing effort, health officials say, and they have remained in check since the city began a halting return to life nearly two weeks ago.\n\n\"The drop is pretty spectacular,\" said Renaud Piarroux, head of parasitology at one of the main Paris hospitals and organizer of the city's mobile contact tracing teams. The decline has been sharpest in what were the city's viral hot spots, in the less affluent northern neighborhoods. \"For right now there are very, very few cases,\" he said. \"It's just a small number that are testing positive.\"\n\nBut if the initial signs are hopeful, the reopening of Paris has been muted, in keeping with the national mood: fearful of what lies ahead, and angry at the government.\n\nOn the streets of Paris, shops have reopened, though many still lack customers. The police no longer check self-signed permits to leave home, yet streets in normally crowded neighborhoods like the Marais remain quiet. Table service at cafes and restaurants remains forbidden, a source of despair for chefs and cafe owners.\n\nEven the ceaseless infighting of French politics is reclaiming its central spot, an unmistakable harbinger of normality. This week President Emmanuel Macron lost his absolute majority in Parliament as seven of his party's representatives joined a new parliamentary group, along with others, some of them previous defectors.\n\nIt was a blow to Mr. Macron, symbolizing the erosion of his political standing after three years in office. Still, allies predicted that he would have no trouble passing his bills as affiliated parties continue to back him. But the signs of disenchantment are unmistakable.\n\nA pensive-looking Mr. Macron was on the cover of the weekly Le Point under the headline, \"Will He Really Pull Us Out of This?\"\n\nNew polls suggest that for most French, unreasonably or not, top officials have not met their expectations in the crisis. Sixty-two percent of respondents in a recent poll conducted for BFM television said they were not confident that Mr. Macron was up to the challenge.\n\nThe French, more critical of their government than other Europeans, mostly disapprove of his handling of the crisis, though it has been no worse, and somewhat better, than that of most other Western leaders.\n\nIndeed there are signs that the confinement ordered by Mr. Macron on March 16 was bearing fruit.\n\nAt the height of the epidemic at the end of March, the Paris public hospital system was encountering more than 1,000 infections a day. On Sunday it found a mere 22, and often over the last two weeks the number has been under 100. The dense 18th, 19th, 20th and 13th arrondissements have gone from being large dark blobs on the hospital system's outbreak map to small light-colored circles.\n\n\"We have virtually reached a total halt to the circulation\" of the virus, said Fran\u00e7ois Bricaire, an infectious diseases specialist at the National Academy of Medicine.\n\nTwo factors have contributed, Mr. Piarroux said: the well-observed and enforced lockdown, and the contact tracing effort, where teams have been going to the homes of those infected or suspected of being infected, to help organize confinement and to trace possible chains of transmission.\n\n\"Confinement contributed enormously to the progress we're seeing in the situation,\" Mr. Piarroux said.\n\nHospitalizations continue to drop, as does the overall number of patients in intensive care. At more than 28,000 deaths, France has a per capita death rate lower than Britain, Italy and Spain, though higher than Germany or the United States.\n\n\"The number of risky contacts has diminished, and that's very good news,\" France's national health director, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Salomon, told journalists Tuesday evening. \"Objectively we've got the French very mobilized, and rigorous in applying defensive measures.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Brazil authorizes using hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients amid a debate over its efficacy and dangers. China's leader sees the pandemic as a crucible to strengthen his rule. Qatar Airways crews will don full protective gear on flights, as airlines try to entice nervous passengers. See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nMr. Piarroux credited the mobile tracing units. \"We've got enough teams on the ground to break the chain of transmission, and to reduce the size of the epidemic,\" he said. \"And that's what we're doing.\"\n\nStill, all urged caution, saying it was too early to measure the real effects of the end of the lockdown.\n\n\"We're not seeing any new growth in the circulation of the virus,\" France's health minister, Olivier Veran, told reporters on Wednesday. \"But that doesn't mean the virus isn't circulating,\" he said. \"We'll see in a few days the impact of deconfinement on the epidemic.\"\n\nMr. Bricaire suggested that perhaps just as important as the active measures France has taken is what he characterized as a natural decline in the intensity of the epidemic. \"Maybe we are simply seeing a natural drop. It is the intermingling of a natural phenomenon, and the lockdown,\" he said.\n\nStill, the poll conducted for BFM television by the ELABE polling firm found 62 percent proclaiming \"unease\" with the end of confinement. The country both yearned for it and was afraid the government had moved too quickly.\n\n\"People are being very timid,\" said Philippe Bonaventure, a leather-work artisan hanging out in the normally buoyant food-shopping neighborhood around the Place d'Aligre. Shoppers crept about timidly as if they didn't quite believe their new freedom.\n\n\"Personally, I find this situation absolutely sketchy,\" said Mr. Bonaventure. \"Sad. Desperate,\" he added, explaining that he remained \"pessimistic\" about the future. \"Half my existence is in the cafes,\" he said. And the cafes remained closed.\n\nDozens of legal and criminal complaints have been filed alleging administrative negligence. Support for Mr. Macron was already low before the virus hit.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nWhat should I do with my 401(k)?\n\nWatching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions -- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that \"free money.\"\n\n\"You can't ignore the context,\" said the political scientist Bruno Cautr\u00e8s. \"This crisis comes after a whole series of other crises,\" like the Yellow Vests and the furor over pension reform, which set off months of strikes. \"There has been a mixture of pessimism and disappointment in Emmanuel Macron.\"\n\nHere and there, glimmerings of exuberance have been quickly tamped down by the authorities. To celebrate their liberation, young people congregated joyously on the banks of the Seine and the Canal Saint-Martin with six-packs of beer. In response, officials, worried about crowds, moved to ban alcohol at these gatherings.\n\nJust to make sure Parisians didn't enjoy their new freedom too much, Mr. Macron's government kept the city's parks closed, to the fury of the Paris mayor, Anne Hidalgo. \"It can be all too tempting, with the sun out,\" Mr. V\u00e9ran, the health minister, explained.\n\nMs. Hidalgo insisted that cooped-up Parisians desperately needed the outdoors. \"We've got to loosen the vise,\" she said, pointing out that Paris is one of the world's densest cities. A doctor's group agreed with her to no avail.\n\nElsewhere, pessimism was the order of the day, with the restaurant industry, vital to both Paris life and the tourism business, warning of widespread bankruptcies.\n\nAim\u00e9 Cougoureux was slumped in a corner of his cafe's terrace on the Place des Vosges, lamenting the lost revenue and missing Americans. Normally packed with tourists and Parisians, it was so quiet recently in the iconic early 17th-century square in the Marais you could hear the birds singing in the newly leafed-out trees.\n\nIn the half-light inside the closed Ma Bourgogne, Mr. Cougoureux's tables and chairs were stacked up, gathering dust.\n\n\"It's only now that people are realizing how important conviviality is,\" Mr. Cougoureux said sadly. \"We didn't even realize how good we had it, before,\" he said. \"Now, the Frenchman, he's out there in the street, and he's looking around like a lost cat. And I'm looking around, and I'm saying, 'Good God, what the hell is going on?' \"\n\nAurelien Breeden contributed reporting.",

        "body": "MIDLAND, Mich. -- Along Main Street in the central Michigan city of Midland, residents crowded the sidewalk on Wednesday, watching the rising waters of the Tittabawassee River in stunned despair. Floodwaters lapped less than a block away, and a row of businesses, their electricity cut off, stood dark and quiet.\n\nFor many, including Jeff De Vaney, the owner of Amazing Deli, the sight was pain on top of pain. Mr. De Vaney was hoping to fully reopen his sandwich shop soon and begin to recoup the revenue he has lost during the coronavirus crisis. He had just brought in portable coolers to store all the extra stock he expected to need.\n\nThen came the flood.\n\n\"We can't seem to catch a break,\" Mr. De Vaney said.\n\nMichigan, one of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, was left reeling again on Wednesday after days of torrential rainfall breached two privately owned dams the night before. Thousands of residents were forced to flee their homes, and much of Midland, the home of Dow Chemical and some of its plants, was submerged in murky floodwaters.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat who has clashed with Republicans over the state's response to the coronavirus, found herself in an ever more complicated position: urging residents to flee their homes to avoid the rising waters while maintaining social distancing to avoid the spreading virus. Midland County has had 76 known cases, a relatively small number in a battered state.\n\n\"It's hard to believe that we're in the middle of a 100-year crisis, a global pandemic, and we're also dealing with a flooding event that looks to be the worst in 500 years,\" Ms. Whitmer said.\n\nFor years, federal regulators had warned that a dam in nearby Edenville Township could rupture. They had chided its corporate owner, Boyce Hydro Power, for failing to make required structural changes to the dam, revoked the company's license and declared that Boyce Hydro had displayed \"a pattern of delay and indifference to addressing dam safety requirements.\"\n\nOn Tuesday night, the dam gave way, sending a torrent of water gushing into streets, houses and businesses, and threatening Dow Chemical, the producer of plastics that sits along the Tittabawassee River. Ten miles south of the Edenville dam, water was spilling over a second dam, a structure feared to be on the verge of collapse on Wednesday.\n\nBy then, floodwaters had crept high enough that red stop signs were barely peeking out in downtown Midland, a city of 42,000 residents about 130 miles northwest of Detroit. Evacuees, carrying suitcases and wearing face masks, arrived at local schools that had been repurposed as emergency shelters.\n\nOfficials said there were no known injuries or deaths tied to the floods. One man who had driven his car into surging water was rescued.\n\nMs. Whitmer declared a state of emergency for Midland County and said she would appeal for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. By Wednesday, 130 soldiers from the Michigan National Guard were dispatched to help state police evacuate residents.\n\nIn balmy spring temperatures on Wednesday morning, a pair of jet skiers roared down the swollen river, which was expected to rise nearly 10 feet above its flood level.\n\nThe site of the city's farmers' market along the banks of the river was swamped, while floodwaters were beginning to lap at the bottom of a pedestrian bridge crossing the river.\n\n\"It's disastrous,\" said Sue Baranski, who had evacuated her home in nearby Sanford as the floodwaters rose. \"Between the devastation from the flooding and the virus and the small-business owners trying to make their way through that, it's just too much.\"\n\nDow Chemical said that floodwaters had reached containment ponds near its plants, but that there was no environmental damage or threat to residents.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Scientists express cautious optimism about developing a vaccine quickly. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Catholic and Lutheran churches say they will defy Minnesota's governor and resume in-person services.

Dow High School. Dow helped pay for a rebuilt downtown, transforming it into a wide pedestrian thoroughfare filled with benches, Adirondack chairs, fire pits and blooming trees.\n\nA short drive from downtown, at least 140 people evacuated from the flooding to Midland High School, a makeshift shelter. About 100 people spent the night on Tuesday; another 40 opted to sleep in their cars instead because of worries about the coronavirus.\n\nDot Costello, 101, had slept on a cot in the school after buses picked up residents from her apartment building.\n\n\"I'm afraid to see what's happened to my city,\" she said. \"I do not like 2020 right now.\"\n\nAnother displaced Midland resident, Steve Blackhurst, 64, a retired lawyer, woke up Wednesday morning to a flooded yard and water pouring through his basement windows.\n\n\"They had to bring an airboat to come get me out,\" he said. \"You've just got to get through it and make sure you stay alive. I'm going to miss my Scotch before I go to bed tonight.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nBrad Kaye, the Midland city manager, said that damage had been extensive, with the first floor of the Grace A. Dow Memorial Library swamped and four of the city's 42 sewage pumping stations underwater and not functioning. All the while, public health concerns remained.\n\n\"We've still got Covid-19, and it didn't go away miraculously because we had a flood,\" he said.\n\nMany in Midland expressed anger and frustration over the breaches of the dams, where failures were expected to require a costly and extensive cleanup.\n\nAccording to a database kept by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the two dams were rated in the highest risk category, along with about 300 other dams in the state. Both dams were last inspected in 2018.\n\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission revoked the license of the Edenville dam in 2018, citing the failure of Boyce Hydro to put in place safety measures that would help prevent a flood. That year, a state agency assumed regulatory authority of the dam.\n\nAccording to federal documents, Boyce Hydro insisted there was little chance that a catastrophic flood could happen.\n\n\"Boyce Hydro states that the probability of such a flood occurring in the next 5 to 10 years ranges from 5 to 10 in one million,\" one report said.\n\nAn official from Boyce Hydro did not return calls seeking comment.\n\nNick Assendelft, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy, said that inspectors in October 2018 found that the dam was in fair structural condition, but had concerns about its spillway capacity.\n\nA lack of investment and maintenance combined with excessive rainfall were factors in its failure, he said in an email.\n\nKathleen Gray reported from Midland, and Julie Bosman from Chicago.

        "body": "PATERSON, N.J. -- The Uber driver had lost his sense of smell and taste but otherwise felt fine. He kept driving passengers in this small, industrial city until last week, when he took a test for Covid-19.\n\nBy Friday, Jean Mugulusi of the Paterson Health Department was on the phone with him, breaking the news that he had tested positive and asking for a list of his recent passengers. He gave her eight phone numbers.\n\n\"You came into contact with somebody who tested positive for Covid-19, so I need you to self-isolate,\" Ms. Mugulusi told one of those passengers, a young man who worked in a factory.\n\n\"Can you tell me who?\" the man responded. Because of privacy laws, she could not, she told him, but he needed to self-isolate.\n\nMs. Mugulusi was doing contact tracing, a once obscure public health measure that has suddenly taken center stage in the fight against the coronavirus and the push to reopen regions for business.\n\nStates and cities around the country have begun with varying degrees of success to ramp up efforts to put contact tracing in place on a large scale. Last week, Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey said that his state would hire up to several thousand contact tracers to assist the 800 now working for local and county health departments.\n\nIn New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has announced that the state will build an army of up to 17,000 contact tracers. A political tangle between agencies has complicated efforts to expand tracing in New York City, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, but Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Sunday that he hoped to have 1,000 tracers in place by June.\n\nTwenty miles to the west of New York City, Paterson, a poor, largely nonwhite city of about 150,000, has been tracing the virus at a level that could be the envy of larger cities. The team has been able to successfully investigate and trace about 90 percent of the more than 5,900 positive Covid-19 cases in Paterson, said the city's top health officer, Dr. Paul Persaud.\n\nAs of Saturday, 306 Paterson residents have died, giving the city a Covid-19 death rate of 5.1 percent among those who have tested positive for the disease, compared to 7 percent statewide.\n\nPerry N. Halkitis, the dean of the Rutgers School of Public Health, said that it was impossible to know how much contact tracing has helped control the spread of the virus. But contact tracing, he noted, \"is one of the few tools that we actually have in the absence of a vaccine.\"\n\nWhen the first cases began to appear in Paterson in mid-March, the Board of Health added two dozen employees who had been trained in communicable disease investigation last year to join their regular team of two disease detectives.\n\nSince then, the full team, which the board calls its Covid-19 strike force, has grown to nearly 50 of the 60 board employees. Joining a dozen public health nurses are clerical staff, translators and health inspectors. The board's accountant, Bob Ardis, tallies total cases and deaths and asks the police to drop by homes where Covid-positive cases don't pick up the phone.\n\n\"We are almost like an extra arm of the Board of Health here,\" said Lt. Detective Louis Spagnola, the group's police liaison.\n\nCalls do not always go smoothly. On Saturday, Ms. Mugulusi called a 26-year-old man to let him know he had been exposed. \"Yeah, I know, my mom tested positive,\" he told her, with street noise in the background.\n\n\"If you are aware, then you know you should be in quarantine,\" Ms. Mugulusi told him. \"So what are you doing on the street?\" He hung up on her. She said the police will now visit him to see if he is staying home.\n\nMany of the residents whom Lenore Bertolero, a head public health nurse in Paterson, calls to tell that they have been exposed to Covid-19 also already know they've been exposed.\n\nThere were the son and daughter-in-law, recalled Ms. Bertolero, who had recently visited their parents. The mother was in the hospital with the virus, and the father had already died.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Reopening begins in Connecticut. Over 100 people were found gathered at a Brooklyn synagogue, officials said. Westchester County will open two beaches to residents only. See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nThere was the wife she called who tested positive after caring for her sick husband, who was quarantining in a room. Now the wife was also sick, and upset that she had to care for the children alone.\n\nThere was the brother she called to warn that his sister had tested positive. He already knew -- she lived upstairs.\n\n\"Sometimes they will text each other back and forth, and say 'Oh, the nurse needs to talk to you, too,'\" Ms. Bertolero said. \"You kind of get involved in their lives.\"\n\nThe contact-tracing team mostly works from their homes, making calls and entering their interview results into the state's communicable disease reporting system. Once a week, they put on their masks and come to the city's small public health headquarters to confer about the crush of cases.\n\nDuring last week's meeting, Andre Sayegh, the city's mayor, handed out a sheet showing a line curve that tracked the city's progress: From a high of about 260 daily positives on April 15, the city is now at about 50 to 70 cases per day, a level not seen since March.\n\n\"This is a testament to what you have been doing,\" the mayor, who had Covid himself, told the team. \"You kept me and many others alive.\"\n\nLast week, Ata Rahman, a new tracer, dropped by the office of Kate Horn, the department's lead nurse, to ask what he should do about a patient who told him that she had experienced symptoms since January, months before she tested positive.\n\nMs. Horn reassigned the case to a senior infectious disease nurse, who re-interviewed the woman and found out that she wasn't quite sure when the symptoms began. They tracked back through her calendars and memories to see whom they should call to warn of possible exposure, even if it was months ago.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March.

You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nSeveral health workers said contact tracing is an art as much as a science. The first step is to develop rapport with the person being interviewed, so they feel comfortable giving details about their health and lives.\n\nIn a city with a large immigrant population like Paterson, language skills are important, as is familiarity with the community.\n\nMuch of an interview can be spent providing health advice to families about how to isolate in small, crowded homes and when to seek medical attention.\n\nBecause of the statewide stay-at-home order, most new virus patients in Paterson have only been in close contact with family, extended family and sometimes co-workers. That will change once restrictions are eased, making contact tracing even harder.\n\nAfter gathering the list of contacts, the case investigator then hands most cases off to a support staff of 20 other workers, who call each contact, tell them they have been exposed and ask them to self-quarantine for two weeks from the date of exposure.\n\nThe monitors do daily check-ins with all the contacts and the original patient during quarantine to see how they are feeling and monitor their compliance.\n\nPaterson's tracing efforts have been aided by New Jersey's electronic communicable disease tracking system, which has been serving as the master database for all cases and contacts. That system pings Ms. Horn's phone throughout the day with new cases.\n\nA $95,000 state grant last year to train several dozen health workers staff in communicable disease investigation also helped, Dr. Persaud said. At the time, his main concern was that the city could have been swamped by a food-borne illness, because it is home to several large catering halls.\n\nBut the program also has limitations. The team only calls contacts who live in Paterson. They aren't sure other localities will follow up on cases. Only symptomatic patients have been tested until recently. And test results sometimes take days to show up in the system, giving the virus a big head start.\n\nStatewide, Dr. Halkitis said, coronavirus contact tracing has been haphazard and inconsistent across New Jersey.\n\n\"You have places like Paterson that have really revved up; Newark, which has begun training; and local health departments that haven't really begun,\" he said. In the absence of a coordinated federal response, he said, the state's new Community Contact Tracing Corps will attempt to standardize training and protocols so fewer cases fall through the cracks.\n\nIn Paterson, the work has gone on through nights and weekends, and the tracers said it can be tedious and emotionally grueling.\n\nThe goal may be to get information from each patient, but just as vital, the tracers said, is to develop enough trust so that their advice is followed.\n\n\"Usually, I start the call by saying, 'I see you had a Covid test, can you tell me why you went?'\" Ms. Bertolero said. \"One woman said to me, 'Because my brother died.' I just had to stop for a bit and tell her how sorry I was.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nMilwaukee health officials said they have identified at least seven people who contracted the coronavirus from participating in Election Day on April 7, which was held despite a stay-at-home order issued throughout the state.\n\nThe seven people were the first identified by Milwaukee officials, who contend that the number may be higher as they are still conducting testing. Other cities have not reported any cases tied to voting yet.\n\nThe officials, in a statement issued Tuesday, did not say how they traced the new coronavirus cases to in-person voting. Six of the cases they identified were Milwaukee voters; the seventh was a poll worker.\n\nPolling places opened across Wisconsin after the state's Republican-controlled legislature refused to take action to postpone the election or expand vote by mail. The Wisconsin Department of Health Services said they would also be studying any voters or election workers who contracted the virus from voting. They have not reported any cases yet.\n\n\"Please note that we only have 30 percent of the data back from new cases as of 4/7 and on,\" said Jeanette Kowalik, the Milwaukee health commissioner, in the statement. \"We hope to have these fields complete by Friday and will provide a more complete report then.\"\n\nDr. Kowalik said that the data is still incomplete because some patients may have declined to provide complete information, were delayed in presenting symptoms or experienced delays in testing and processing. She added that they are looking at any new cases that began after April 7 as the incubation period is 14 days, which ends tomorrow on April 21.\n\nBefore the election, thousands of poll workers, many of whom are older and are considered high risk for the coronavirus, said they would not be able to work during the in-person election, resulting in a severely depleted election staff in many parts of the state.\n\nIn Milwaukee, that meant their 180 polling locations were drastically reduced to just five. Voters across the city cited waits of well over two hours throughout the entire day.\n\nThe direct connection of contracting coronavirus from in-person voting in Wisconsin could further increase calls across the country for an expansion of vote by mail and absentee voting for the November elections.\n\nThere are multiple bills currently in the U.S. Senate seeking billions of dollars to vastly expand vote by mail before the November election. Democrats in Congress are also pushing to get more funding for the elections into the next stimulus plan.",

It will also be critical to the automakers, their dealers and their suppliers, which have lost billions of dollars in sales in recent weeks and have been forced to take on debt to ride out the pandemic.\n\nIn April, automakers, which were closing plants at various times, produced just 4,840 cars, pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in North America, according to Automotive News, down from 1.4 million a year earlier. Sales of new vehicles in April fell by about 50 percent, according to Cox Automotive, a market researcher.\n\n\"The auto industry is America's economic engine,\" Ford Motor's chief operating officer, Jim Farley, said during a recent conference call on the company's reopening plans. \"Restarting the entire auto ecosystem is how we restart the economy.\"\n\nFord, General Motors, and Fiat Chrysler plan to restart production on Monday, after Toyota, Honda and Tesla began reopening plants last week. Hyundai restarted a plant in Alabama on May 4.\n\nBut production will not bounce back quickly. The revival will unfold over a week or more as dozens of auto plants and hundreds of factories owned by parts suppliers gear up and start making and shipping products. The speed with which companies can move will depend in part on how quickly national, state and local governments loosen stay-at-home orders in the United States, Canada and Mexico, because the industry's supply chains are closely intertwined across North America.\n\nSome automakers have already run into complications.\n\nTesla, for example, and its chief executive, Elon Musk, were so eager to resume production last week at the company's factory in Fremont, Calif., that they defied local officials and sued the county.\n\nMercedes-Benz restarted an S.U.V. plant in Alabama on April 27, but stopped production on Friday after running short of parts. Volkswagen was scheduled to start making cars at a plant in Chattanooga, Tenn., on Sunday -- two weeks after it had originally hoped to bring workers back, because many of its suppliers needed more time to get up and running.\n\nThe automakers announced in mid-March that they would shut down their plants as the coronavirus spread and cases started surging in the Northeast, Louisiana and the Detroit area, where the three biggest U.S. automakers are based. The risk of infection is considered high for assembly-line workers because they often spend long hours working alongside one another.\n\nWhile many of the automakers' white-collar employees have been able to work from home, the shutdowns idled nearly 400,000 automotive production workers in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The industry accounts for about 4 percent of the nation's economy.\n\nThere is little precedent for such an across-the-board shutdown, said Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan. Of course, strikes have forced individual car companies to shut down periodically; one last fall idled G.M. plants for 40 days. But Mr. Gordon, who has long tracked the industry, couldn't think of a time when the three big companies, their suppliers and many dealers had to shut down at the same time.\n\nDuring World War II, the industry stopped making cars, but its plants were retooled to make armaments and kept millions of people employed, Mr. Gordon noted. \"There's really nothing we can compare this to because it's the entire industry, and its supply chain, that has closed down completely,\" he said.\n\nLatest Updates: Economy Stocks end volatile day with a gain as oil prices jump.

See more updates Updated 60h ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nNow, the industry faces another daunting task that it has never faced: restarting production during a pandemic.\n\nAutomakers have made numerous changes to reduce the risk of infection, including slowing down the rate at which they churn out cars. Most manufacturers plan to shorten shifts, with more down time in between for cleaning. Employees will also be required to stagger their arrival and departure to reduce contact with others during shift changes.\n\nFord, G.M. and Fiat Chrysler will ask workers to fill out questionnaires and have their temperatures taken before reporting for work. The goal is to identify anybody who may have symptoms or has been in contact with somebody who is or has been ill. Workers will be required to wear masks, gloves and eye protection while on the job.\n\nFiat Chrysler has installed thermal-imaging cameras in some hallways and entryways to check workers for fevers. On its assembly lines, the company has set up transparent curtains to prevent transmission between people who work next to each other. At some stations where two workers install under-the-hood components at the same time, the company has developed screens that can be placed on engines.\n\nFord has placed portable sinks and hand-sanitizer dispensers throughout its plants and installed no-touch faucets and soap dispensers in restrooms.\n\nUnder guidelines worked out with the United Automobile Workers union, employees will have to get tested for the virus if they show symptoms. G.M., Ford and Fiat Chrysler, however, are not planning to test workers daily or weekly even though the U.A.W. has pushed for it. On Saturday, Ford said it had secured contracts with health care providers in southeastern Michigan; Louisville, Ky.; Kansas City, Mo.; and Chicago to test symptomatic employees and provide results within 24 hours.\n\n\"We continue to advocate for as much testing as possible at the current time and eventually full testing when available,\" the union's president, Rory Gamble, said in a statement.\n\nIn Louisville, the home of two Ford plants that make trucks and large S.U.V.s, many workers are looking forward to getting steady paychecks again but also a little worried, said Todd Dunn, president of U.A.W. Local 862.\n\n\"Everybody is burning cash,\" he said. \"And the company needs to produce, or we won't have a company to go back to.\"\n\nStill, the risk of sickness and the complexities of a new safety policies are weighing on workers.\n\n\"A lot of members have parents or in-laws at home,\" Mr. Dunn said. \"So you wonder, 'Should I take off my clothes in the garage and take a shower?' A lot of members have issues with child care.\"\n\nIt will probably take many months before the industry is producing as many cars as it was before plants shut down. The delicate restart of production will probably unfold slowly over at least a week or more as dozens of auto plants and hundreds of others owned by parts suppliers resume manufacturing and shipping operations dependent on the loosening of stay-at-home orders in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nG.M., which had been running two or three shifts in its North American plants, will start most plants on a single shift per day, something automakers try to avoid. The company said it was not yet sure if it would be able to restart its three plants in Mexico on Monday.\n\nToyota's North American plants restarted last week, operating on one or two shifts a day. Honda reopened its plants but isn't seeking to increase production quickly, to give crews time to become accustomed to new safety procedures and working conditions.\n\nFor now, there is no great urgency for automakers to ramp up manufacturing, because auto sales are not expected to recover fully anytime soon.\n\nAutoNation, the country's largest dealership chain, reported last week that sales of new and used cars at the end of April were down about 20 percent from a year earlier, after falling 50 percent in the first 10 days of the month. Some people were buying cars because they were avoiding public transit and shared transportation services, the company's chief executive, Mike Jackson, said.\n\n\"I think this will be a very difficult restart and they need to get on with it,\" Mr. Jackson said about the automakers. \"But I can see where if plants don't restart, in a month or two there's going to be some inventory issues.\"",

        "body": "It was late March, with the coronavirus starting to peak in New York and hospitals already running short on supplies, when Bethenny Frankel, the entrepreneur and reality television star, received an email from a publicist offering her access to 500 million medical masks, or about enough to fill 25 Madison Square Gardens.\n\nMs. Frankel was intrigued. While spending eight seasons on the \"Real Housewives of New York City,\" she began flying to places like Guatemala and the Bahamas to aid in disaster relief. Now, with the disaster down the road, she wanted to help. She called the New York governor's office, and her home state drafted her to find masks.\n\n\"There is no mask store,\" she said. \"I was ready to get them from a guy in Washington Square Park.\"\n\nThe publicist connected her with the source, an Idaho man named Jake Uhlenkott, who describes himself on LinkedIn as a \"Farmerpreneur // Management Consultant // Recording Artist.\" Working in her pajamas at her Hamptons home, Ms. Frankel reached out.\n\n\"The 500m is real,\" he wrote in a text message to her on March 24. \"Not for long. But it is definitely real. 100% confidential. Can you secure funding?\"\n\nSo began Ms. Frankel's journey into the market for masks, a sort of high-stakes house of mirrors, where lives and millions of dollars were on the line and things were rarely what they seemed.\n\nThe coronavirus arrived in America early this year, and demand for hand sanitizer, face masks and other supplies skyrocketed. With suppliers unable to keep up, and federal officials slow to respond, local governments, hospitals and individuals scrambled to compete for the dwindling supply, causing prices to soar and luring both do-gooders and opportunists.\n\nThe result was chaos. As I reported on that disarray, Ms. Frankel's story stood out. Her path through the mess, the characters she encountered and the fact that states relied upon a Real Housewife to find lifesaving medical gear all reflected the feeble preparations of government and industry and the opportunism that often follows disaster. So I retraced Ms. Frankel's steps and tried to decipher what really happened.\n\nThat offer for 500 million masks was enticing but flawed: The supplies were abroad and would take at least a week to arrive. Ms. Frankel's government contacts needed gear immediately and she was wary of faraway masks, so she asked Mr. Uhlenkott if he knew of any caches already on the continent.\n\nA day later, he told her he had found five million masks made by the manufacturer 3M, the gold standard, in Canada. Ms. Frankel confirmed with New York State officials that they were interested. And like that, a deal was on.\n\n'Everybody knew a guy who knew a guy'\n\nMs. Frankel, 49, is a fast-talking, sharp-witted businesswoman who became famous by playing that part over 15 years of reality television. On the side, she started her Skinnygirl line of cocktails, jeans and deli meat, which now has more than $50 million in sales a year.\n\nIn 2017, she flew to Houston after Hurricane Harvey to give about 1,000 families each $1,000 in aid. Since then, her charity BStrong has expanded its disaster-relief missions to earthquakes in Puerto Rico, hurricanes in Mexico and wildfires in California and Australia. As a result, she knew how to get supplies and had a fat Rolodex of contacts.\n\nSo when the coronavirus began to appear in American headlines, celebrities including Billy Joel, Ellen DeGeneres and Charlize Theron began funneling their money to her charity to turn it into masks for hospitals. When word spread that she was buying masks, sellers flooded her with offers.\n\n\"Everybody knew a guy who knew a guy,\" she said. \"You feel like you're in a Moroccan bazaar, and wherever you're turning, left and right, everybody is holding shiny objects.\"\n\nMany of the offers carried price tags more appropriate for governments than her charity, so within days, she was working with New York State, New York City, Michigan, Arizona, Louisiana and Chicago.\n\n\"She did a tweet that basically said, 'Hey, Michigan, I can help you,'\" said Tricia Foster, Michigan's chief operating officer.\n\nMs. Frankel promised to secure some of the stockpiles. With her inbox full of strangers, Mr. Uhlenkott, who was introduced by someone she knew, seemed like a decent bet.\n\nMr. Uhlenkott had started selling masks that week. A pianist and former field director for Rick Santorum's 2012 presidential campaign, he canceled plans to record his first album in Los Angeles and decamped to his family's home in the Idaho wilderness when the virus arrived. There, like thousands of other suddenly idle people, he saw a business opportunity in masks.\n\nWith so much money on the line, Ms. Frankel's team asked for credentials. He sent a document introducing his company, Nexus PPE -- a nod to the acronym for \"personal protective equipment\" -- and the four men behind it, including a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran and a Harvard graduate. For good measure, Mr. Uhlenkott added: \"I'm personal friends with Princess Alexandra of Luxembourg if you need another reference.\"\n\nThe document said Nexus PPE was established in 2008. Idaho records show that the Harvard graduate's father did incorporate the company that year -- as Nexus Wealth Management, a small financial planner in Boise. On March 25, the day after Mr. Uhlenkott contacted Ms. Frankel, records show he became a company director and changed its name to Nexus PPE. He said later that it was easier than starting a new firm.\n\nWhile Mr. Uhlenkott tried to secure the five million masks in Canada, his suppliers told him they had found 10 million 3M masks, this time in New York. Officials in Albany wanted those, too, so Ms. Frankel's team sent him an $82.5 million purchase order for the now 15 million masks, contingent on inspection. It was more than five times the normal price.\n\nFor days, New York officials asked to see the goods, and Ms. Frankel offered to send her driver, but Mr. Uhlenkott couldn't provide an address. There were various excuses related to customs, logistics and an unnamed billionaire in California who supposedly controlled the stockpile.\n\n\"What I'm being told is that the owners are nervous about seizures and trying to protect their assets...and asses,\" he said in a text message to Ms. Frankel on March 27.\n\n\"My patience is running low,\" she replied. \"I went to bat for you with this whole group. Stakes are high so kick this into gear. I don't care how.\"\n\nTwo days later, Mr. Uhlenkott sent blurry photos and a video of boxes in a warehouse that didn't look like the masks they had agreed upon. Ms. Frankel was suspicious. \"You better be able to prove what you have been selling,\" she said in a text message.\n\nLatest Updates: Economy U.S. unemployment claims are expected to approach 40 million, and counting.

Andrew M. Cuomo. \"We got pretty far along with these guys, but no money changed hands.\"\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Uhlenkott said his original source for the 500 million masks was real and reliable, but to find supply already in North America, he went with a new seller who turned out to be slippery. \"It seemed like everything was a shell, offshore, this kind of stuff,\" he said of the source. \"But at the same time it was like, well, maybe those are the people that actually have the masks.\"\n\nMr. Uhlenkott dropped out. But first, he introduced Ms. Frankel directly to his source. \"That was when I got excited,\" Ms. Frankel said. \"That was when I thought, OK. Now, this is real. Because now we're actually not talking to some middleman. We're talking to the actual people.\"\n\n'It felt legitimate'\n\nThe first time they spoke, Ralph Frengel put Ms. Frankel at ease. He was a smooth-talking salesman for a company called Astoria Enterprises. He had plenty of masks available and he seemed like a dealmaker. \"It felt legitimate,\" she said.\n\nOn April 3, Mr. Frengel sent a menu of sorts, including eight separate stockpiles that together totaled 275 million 3M masks. \"Let me know what you think you can do from this inventory,\" he said in an email.\n\nMs. Frankel alerted her contacts in government. This time, New York City was on board, as BuzzFeed News reported. They agreed to buy 10 million 3M masks for $66.5 million -- a high price -- once they were inspected.\n\nBut Mr. Frengel and two Astoria colleagues first demanded a purchase order directly from the city, according to emails reviewed by The Times. They also said the money should be put in an escrow account their lawyer controlled, the emails show.\n\nMs. Frankel and city officials balked. They wanted to see the masks. In an email, the lawyer representing Ms. Frankel's team told Mr. Frengel that without immediate inspection \"we will be forced to conclude, as the City of New York already believes, that the representations made about the existence and number of 3M N95 masks are untrue.\"\n\nMr. Frengel replied that inspections were cumbersome and that he and his Astoria colleagues didn't appreciate the accusation.\n\nEach time a pallet of masks is inspected, \"it then must be re-shrink-wrapped, taken across the warehouse, weighed and the manifest tag must be dated, and updated over and over again,\" he said. \"The suggestions made yesterday afternoon did not sit well with some of Astoria's principal investor/owners.\"\n\nThree weeks after she was first pitched 500 million masks, Ms. Frankel exited the deal empty-handed. \"We all were completely gutted,\" she said.\n\n'It's not as bad as it sounds'\n\nThere appear to be three main men behind Astoria Enterprises, and two of them are ex-convicts.\n\nMr. Frengel, the salesman, was convicted in 1992 for stealing a $100,000 pearl necklace from a jewelry store. \"It's not as bad as it sounds,\" he said. The store owed him money and he was strung out on drugs. \"Freebasing cocaine,\" he said. \"Highly addictive.\" His records since show repeated run-ins with the law, including a restraining order against him and at least two federal tax liens.\n\nMichael Carnicle, the Astoria official in control of the mask supply, served three years in prison in the 1980s after getting caught with $1 million in counterfeit bills. A federal court later found that he had helped fake certificates of deposits from a Russian bank to prop up a company that wanted to turn the 1990s TV hit \"American Gladiators\" into a Las Vegas show. Most recently, he went to prison for not filing his tax returns. He was released in January.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nAstoria's chief executive, Lucian Alter, used to own a business duplicating pornography tapes until it burned down in Los Angeles, according to The Los Angeles Daily News in 1990. Mr. Alter disputed that in an interview, saying he supplied the magnetic tape for cassettes.\n\nAccording to its website, Astoria Enterprises offers \"high-quality, cost-effective information technology business solutions and professional consulting services,\" language that appears verbatim on several other businesses' websites. On Twitter, the company describes itself as a \"a good listener and just a nice person to hang out with.\" A closer inspection suggests they help with gambling on the internet and speculating on foreign currencies.\n\nMr. Frengel was near Palm Springs, Calif. Mr. Carnicle was in Las Vegas. Mr. Alter was in Tel Aviv. Astoria, however, was registered in Cyprus, the Mediterranean island that has been a haven for money laundering.\n\nWhen I first reached Mr. Frengel and asked if he sold masks, he replied, \"I don't think so. I'd have to look back through my records.\" When I said I had spoken with Ms. Frankel, he admitted he was a mask middleman but denied advertising millions of masks, despite numerous emails showing he did. \"I just probably forwarded an email,\" he said.\n\nIn reality, he was pitching Astoria's stockpiles around the country. Paul Echevarria, a Florida businessman who manufactures cannabidiol, or CBD, said he went down a weeklong rabbit hole with Mr. Frengel and Astoria for millions of 3M masks supposedly stored in a Miami warehouse. Mr. Echevarria planned to resell the masks to the Florida government and had state officials ready to inspect them, but Mr. Frengel wouldn't provide an address.\n\nThe men behind Astoria gave me purchase orders from the state of Florida that they said came from Mr. Echevarria. Mr. Echevarria said he had never seen the documents. When I sent the files to Florida officials, they replied that the documents were forged and were now in possession of the state attorney general. It was unclear who was behind the forgery.\n\nUltimately, the Astoria trio gave the same answer on why they would never let prospective buyers inspect what they were selling: They never received formal purchase orders from the governments involved, which they said they needed to protect themselves from scams.\n\nYet none of the men could say for sure whether the masks they were selling even existed.\n\n\"I never saw them. I live in California,\" Mr. Frengel said. \"I had no reason not to believe.\"\n\nMr. Alter, Astoria's C.E.O., told me, \"Sir, this is something that is really confidential, but yes, we have access to millions of masks.\" When I asked him Astoria's source, he laughed. \"Where am I getting my product?\" he said. \"I think it's funny.\"\n\nMr. Carnicle was more forthcoming, though his story evolved over two hourlong phone calls.\n\nAt first he said that Astoria's suppliers were construction companies in New York and New Jersey that had stockpiled the gear. Which companies? \"They don't want to be on the front page of The New York Times,\" he said. \"The government is already looking at them.\"\n\nWhen pressed further, he admitted that wasn't exactly true.\n\nHe forwarded documents suggesting Astoria had plans to buy masks from two other companies. One firm was offering 310 million 3M masks, which is more than what 3M produces in three months. The other company was days old and run by an Indiana man who had once faced federal fraud charges.\n\nNo, Mr. Carnicle said. He hadn't seen the masks.\n\n'You could be impeding an investigation'\n\nThousands of people have entered the mask market over the past two months, and a large chunk of them have been offered millions of 3M masks. Courtney Enloe, 3M's head of litigation, said probably all of those cases are frauds.\n\n\"The typical scheme is somebody will reach out and say we need $X million up front for Y stash of respirators, and they just never had them,\" Ms. Enloe said. \"I have been solicited. The head of 3M's litigation has been solicited.\" Over the past several weeks, 3M has filed 10 lawsuits against people claiming falsely to have access to its masks.\n\nFederal authorities have also charged several people in recent weeks, including a Georgia man who demanded upfront payments from the Department of Veterans Affairs for $750 million of 3M masks and other gear that he knew didn't exist.\n\nAmid all this fraud, there is some good news. Ms. Frankel's BStrong charity and its partner organization, Global Empowerment Mission, have donated more than two million masks and isolation gowns to hospitals and other groups in all 50 states. They cobbled together supplies from smaller purchases and also closed several larger deals, including one million hazmat suits for New York State and 200,000 surgical masks for New York City.\n\nOver three years of relief work, Ms. Frankel said, she has learned that crises breed corruption. Money is flowing and people are desperate. \"It's so disheartening,\" she said. \"At the racetrack, you think you might get screwed. But when you're dealing with the biggest health crisis in 100 years, you have to be a really sick, sick, bad person to exploit that.\"\n\nYet, to Mr. Carnicle, it was Ms. Frankel who was trying to cheat Astoria. He said he reported her team to federal authorities for attempted fraud. \"You could be impeding an investigation,\" he told me, \"or else I would tell you more.\"\n\nSusan Beachy contributed research.",

        "body": "LONDON -- Boris Johnson and his fianc\u00e9e Carrie Symonds have named their newborn son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas, partly as a tribute to two of the intensive care doctors who they said had saved the British leader's life as he battled COVID-19 complications.\n\nSymonds announced the name on Saturday on Instagram beside a picture of her and the boy, who already has thick hair resembling the blond thatch of his father.\n\nSymonds, 32, said Wilfred, who was born on Wednesday, was named after Johnson's grandfather, while Lawrie came from her grandfather.\n\nThe choice of Nicholas, Symonds said, was a nod to Nick Price and Nick Hart - two doctors who the couple have praised for saving Johnson's life at St Thomas' hospital last month.\n\n\"I couldn't be happier,\" Symonds said, adding her thanks to the maternity staff of University College London Hospital. \"My heart is full.\"\n\nJohnson, 55, returned to work on Monday after recuperating from COVID-19, which had left him gravely ill in intensive care at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. He thanked the doctors at St Thomas' hospital whom, he said, had \"saved my life, no question\".\n\n\"We are honoured and humbled to have been recognised in this way,\" said Price, director of infection at Guy's and St Thomas' hospital, and Hart, director of respiratory and critical care. \"We wish the new family every health and happiness.\"\n\nSymonds, a former public relations executive, also had symptoms of the virus but recovered more swiftly. She had said in February that the baby was due in early summer.\n\nJohnson, who was present at the birth, will take a short period of paternity leave later in the year.\n\nBABY IN DOWNING STREET\n\nSymonds and Johnson have been living together in Downing Street since he became prime minister in July. They announced in February they were expecting their first child and that they were engaged to be married.\n\nOnce dubbed \"Bonking Boris\" by Britain's tabloid media, Johnson has had a complicated private life.\n\nHe was once sacked from the Conservative Party's policy team while in opposition for lying about an extra-marital affair. He has been divorced twice and refuses to say how many children he has fathered.\n\nIn 2013, when Johnson was mayor of London, appeal court judges ruled that the public had the right to know he had an extra-marital affair with a woman who gave birth to his daughter.\n\nJohnson's previous marriage was to Marina Wheeler, a lawyer. They had four children together but announced in September 2018 that they had separated. They divorced earlier this year.\n\nFew British leaders have had babies while in office.\n\nDavid Cameron's wife Samantha gave birth to their daughter, Florence, in 2010, and Tony Blair's wife Cherie gave birth to their son, Leo, in 2006.\n\nBefore that, Frances, the wife of John Russell, a 19th-Century Whig and Liberal politician, gave birth to two children in 1848 and 1849 while he was in office.\n\n(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge; Editing by Nick Macfie and David Holmes)",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nLONDON -- A pale but vigorous-sounding Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to work on Monday, declaring that the coronavirus that nearly killed him was like an \"unexpected and invisible mugger\" the British people had begun to wrestle to the floor but had not yet fully disabled.\n\nFor all his determined brio, Mr. Johnson's message to his lockdown-weary nation was somber, underscoring the hard choices that Britain faces as the economy languishes and the death toll from the virus soars above 21,000.\n\nMr. Johnson, who was discharged from the hospital only two weeks ago, signaled that the government would keep some social-distancing measures in place for the foreseeable future. To lift them too soon, he warned, would mean \"not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster.\"\n\n\"This is the moment of opportunity,\" Mr. Johnson said at Downing Street, before a full day of meetings. \"This is the moment when we can press home our advantage. It is also the moment of maximum risk.\"\n\nThe government has said it will reassess the lockdown on May 7, and it is likely to relax some restrictions. But it is lagging badly in testing and contact tracing, which experts view as a precondition for reverting to a more normal status, like in South Korea, which pioneered an ambitious national testing program.\n\nMr. Johnson's return will inject energy into a government response that had seemed to drift in recent weeks, analysts said. But it does not alter the fact that Britain has fared especially badly during the pandemic, with a death toll approaching that of Spain and Italy. And the figures understate the true toll by at least a third, since they do not include people who perish in nursing homes or their own houses.\n\n\"His return is a fillip for the government,\" said Craig Oliver, a former director of politics and communications at Downing Street. \"The problem is the expectation that he can wave a magic wand, and everything will be OK.\"\n\nOther than Mr. Johnson's reference to the mugger, there was little evidence on Monday of the glib, happy-go-lucky prime minister who resisted imposing strict social distancing measures and boasted about shaking hands with coronavirus patients during the early days of the outbreak. Now, he seems resigned to a prolonged period of disruption and worried about the risk of a renewed outbreak.\n\nWith the daily death toll in hospitals falling, there is evidence that Britain has passed the peak of infections. Mr. Johnson emphasized the National Health Service's success in scaling up capacity, which insured that hospitals have not been overwhelmed in Britain as they were in northern Italy.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak The known global death toll has topped 200,000. Countries are plotting their reopening. 'Afraid to be a nurse': Health care workers face attacks. Boris Johnson gives few clues about plans to ease lockdown measures. See more updates Updated 17m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nBut the government once hoped to hold the number of fatalities to 20,000, a goal it could now miss by 10,000 or more.\n\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London who is an influential adviser to the government, warned on Sunday that easing the restrictions too abruptly could result in more than 100,000 additional deaths from a second wave of infections.\n\nA study published last month by Dr. Ferguson and his Imperial colleagues, which projected that an unchecked spread of the virus could kill as many as 510,000 people in Britain, prompted the government to pivot from its laissez-faire response to the lockdown that Mr. Johnson imposed on March 23.\n\nThe path out of the crisis, Dr. Ferguson and other experts agreed, lies in an aggressive program of testing those with virus symptoms, and tracking their contacts, similar to what South Korea and Germany have done.\n\nBritain, however, has struggled to reach its target of conducting 100,000 tests a day by the end of April.\n\nThough it has the capacity to conduct more than 50,000 tests, it carried out only 37,000 on Sunday, the last day for which data were available. Officials now argue that, because of a lag in reporting the tests, it will not be clear by the deadline of Thursday whether it has met its target.\n\n\"We're moving in the right direction in terms of a commitment to increase testing, start contact tracing again and brainstorm quarantine arrangements,\" said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University.\n\n\"But we need to be moving much faster as each day in lockdown is costly,\" she said, \"and lockdown can only be lifted when there is a good handle on the virus.\"\n\nBritain has also fallen short in providing doctors and nurses with masks and gloves. And it had faced criticism for its secrecy over the membership and deliberations of a scientific panel that advises the government on key decisions.\n\nOn Monday, Downing Street announced a minor concession by saying it would name the members of the panel -- the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, known as SAGE -- but only if they agreed to be publicly identified.\n\nThe debate among scientists will affect critical decisions about when and how to relax the lockdown, which in turn could temper the dire economic impact of the pandemic. Tensions within the cabinet over the economic fallout have spilled into a wider debate in Mr. Johnson's Conservative Party.\n\n\"There is a recognition that we need to do much more to get the economy moving,\" Graham Brady, chairman of the influential 1922 Committee of Conservative backbench lawmakers, told the BBC. \"There is a limit to how long people will tolerate those things.\"\n\nThe authorities have been surprised, even at times unsettled, by the public's compliance with the lockdown, which is not policed as aggressively as in countries like France. But parks and streets in London and other cities filled up with pedestrians and cars over a sunny weekend, suggesting that patience was running thin.\n\nMr. Johnson has displayed his own impatience. He contracted the virus in late March but continued to take part in meetings and read official papers while isolated in his apartment next door to 10 Downing Street, which some colleagues say may have aggravated his illness.\n\nOn April 5, after Mr. Johnson could not shake a cough and temperature, he was hospitalized and later moved into the intensive care unit, where he was treated with oxygen. After his release on April 12, he described a harrowing ordeal in which he was kept alive by a team of night nurses.\n\nMr. Johnson's decision to go back to work so soon raised eyebrows, even among allies who sought to make a virtue of it. Nadine Dorries, a government health minister, said on Twitter that most people who have been as sick as Mr. Johnson was need \"at least three months to recover their strength and repair their immune system.\"\n\n\"Good luck boss,\" she added.",

        "body": "Thronged banks. Packed subway cars. Buses full of President Jair Bolsonaro's fervent supporters, heading to rallies that call on Brazilians to brush aside stay-at-home orders from mayors and governors and instead follow the president's directive to get back to work.\n\nScenes like these are a reflection of Brazil's contradictory and chaotic response to the coronavirus pandemic, which was on glaring display on Friday when the health minister resigned -- just weeks after his predecessor was abruptly fired following clashes with Mr. Bolsonaro.\n\nThe national confusion has helped fuel the spread of the disease and contributed to making Brazil an emerging center of the pandemic, with a daily death rate second only to that of the United States.\n\nPublic health experts say the disorderly approach has further saturated intensive care units and morgues and contributed to the deaths of scores of medical professionals as Latin America's largest economy plunges into what may be its steepest recession in history.\n\nThe crisis facing the country stands in stark contrast to Brazil's track record for innovative and nimble responses to health care challenges that made it a model in the developing world in decades past.\n\n\"Brazil's could have been one of the best responses to this pandemic,\" said Marcia Castro, a professor at Harvard University who is from Brazil and specializes in global health. \"But right now everything is completely disorganized and no one is working toward joint solutions. This has a cost, and the cost is human lives.\"\n\nBrazil had months to study the errors and successes of the first countries struck by the virus. Its robust public health care system could have been deployed to conduct mass testing and trace the movements of newly infected patients.\n\nIts failure to act early and aggressively is at odds with the country's ingenious approaches to past medical crises, health experts said.\n\nAfter a surge in H.I.V. infections in the 1990s, Brazil offered free and universal treatment and pushed the pharmaceutical industry to lower costs. It threatened to disregard a Swiss drugmaker's patent for an H.I.V. drug in 2001, and did so in 2007, manufacturing its own generic version and greatly reducing the prevalence of H.I.V.\n\nIn 2013, Brazil vastly expanded access to preventive health care in poor areas by hiring thousands of foreign doctors, most of them Cuban. And to combat the Zika outbreak in 2014, Brazil created genetically modified mosquitoes that helped decrease the insect's population, a tactic that will soon be deployed in Florida and Texas.\n\nBrazil's prior success resulted from investment in science and empowerment of scientists, said Tania Lago, a professor of medicine at Santa Casa University in S\u00e3o Paulo, who worked in the ministry of health in the 1990s.\n\n\"Now there's been a rupture in the nation with its scientific community,\" she said. \"What saddens me is that we are and will continue to lose lives that could be saved.\"\n\nAs countries started taking drastic measures to curb the spread of the virus in February and March, Mr. Bolsonaro played down the risks and encouraged public gatherings. Now, he is urging Brazilians to return to work even as the number of new cases and deaths are spiking.\n\nThis past week, the president issued an executive order classifying gyms and beauty salons as essential businesses that should reopen.\n\n\"Health is life,\" he said. As with some of his other decisions related to the pandemic, it went against state and local measures, and caught the health minister by surprise.\n\nAs of Friday, Brazil had 218,223 diagnosed cases of coronavirus and 14,817 deaths. But the actual death toll is likely to be much higher, according to death records compiled by Fiocruz, a government institute that studies health care trends.\n\nBetween Jan. 1 and May 9, official government figures say 10,627 people died in Brazil of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nDuring that period, an additional 11,026 people who were not diagnosed with the coronavirus died from acute respiratory infections.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Greece braces for crowds as hundreds of beaches reopen. China appears to confirm destroying lab samples. Italy will ease travel restrictions as it emerges from one of Europe's strictest lockdowns. See more updates Updated 28m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nThat number is several thousands more than the average number of deaths from respiratory ailments in recent years, said Marcelo Gomes, a researcher at Fiocruz. He said he suspected a significant percentage of those patients died from undiagnosed coronavirus infections.\n\nExperts do not expect the epidemic to peak in Brazil for several more weeks. As of early May, it had the highest contagion rate of 54 countries studied by Imperial London College, which also found that existing containment measures in Brazil have failed to put transmission on a downward trajectory.\n\nAccording to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, the virus is on track to kill more than 88,000 people in Brazil by early August.\n\nBrazil's Federal Council of Nursing said insufficient protective equipment and punishing workloads have exposed thousands of medical professionals to the virus, leaving hospitals understaffed.\n\n\"Because salaries are low, most work in two places, some three,\" said Manoel Neri, the president of the council. \"This is a longstanding problem in Brazil.\"\n\nThe council said at least 108 nurses and medical technicians have died from confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases in recent weeks. More than 13,500 have developed symptoms, but many have been unable to get tested.\n\nJacqueline, a 37-year-old nurse in Rio de Janeiro who contracted the virus along with her husband, also a nurse, said fear is pervasive among her colleagues.\n\n\"We feel exposed,\" said Jacqueline, who asked to be identified by first name only because she fears reprisals from her employer. \"You look around and people are crying because they're fearful of taking the virus to our families.\"\n\nThe political turmoil that has whiplashed the health ministry over the past few weeks has further hurt the country's ability to prepare for the pandemic.\n\nThe health minister, Nelson Teich, resigned on Friday, just days shy of completing a month on the job.\n\nMr. Bolsonaro fired his predecessor, Luiz Henrique Mandetta, after the two clashed over the president's disdain for quarantine measures.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Mandetta said Brazil's \"erratic\" response to the pandemic left it ill-equipped to compete in a global scramble for ventilators, tests and protective equipment for medical personnel.\n\n\"Our challenge is to expand health coverage while competing with the absurd spending power of the United States and Europe,\" he said.\n\nFl\u00e1vio Dino, the governor of Maranh\u00e3o State, said the federal government has been an obstacle as state officials have shopped for ventilators and put up field hospitals. The state capital, S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, was the first in the country to impose a strict lockdown this month, requiring everyone other than essential workers to stay home.\n\n\"At the national level, there wasn't a plan to prepare for this trying month of May,\" he said. He called the firing of Mr. Mandetta a setback. \"You don't change the crew of an airplane mid-flight.\"\n\nThe impoverished State of Amazonas, in the north, has seen its hospitals overloaded and its cemeteries resorting to mass graves in order to cope with the deluge of bodies.\n\nArthur Virg\u00edlio Neto, the mayor of Manaus, the state capital, has cried during televised interviews as he pleaded for federal assistance. Mr. Bolsonaro, with his disregard for social distancing and other preventive measures, has been part of the problem, Mr. Virg\u00edlio said.\n\n\"People never stopped roaming the streets; there has been flagrant disregard for our decrees,\" he said, blaming Mr. Bolsonaro. \"He is against social distancing, and that explains part of the disobedience.\"\n\nFacing mounting criticism, the Bolsonaro administration, which declined to comment, launched a campaign this past week that highlighted the president's concern over the economy, which is projected to contract by at least 5 percent this year.\n\n\"Those lockdowns, they're not the path -- they're the path to failure,\" Mr. Bolsonaro said on Thursday, addressing supporters outside the presidential palace. He added, disparagingly, \"It will turn into a country of misery, like a country in sub-Saharan Africa.\"\n\nMs. Castro, the Harvard professor, said the government's failure to mount an effective response is likely to lead to a series of outbreaks that will do more damage to the economy in the long run.\n\n\"How can you promote economic growth if your population is sick?\" she said. \"A sick work force can't work.\"",

    "Bridge was their passion, then people started to die: the story of the Colorado Springs Bridge Center": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "DENVER -- It had already been a grim day. The governor of Colorado had just announced the state's first coronavirus death, an 83-year-old woman, when public health investigators discovered where she had spent some of her final days: a bridge club.\n\nLeon Kelly, the county coroner in Colorado Springs, felt his stomach drop. \"It was full-throttle, worst-case scenario,\" he said.\n\nFor decades, the Colorado Springs Bridge Center had been a social hub for retirees immersed in the world of trumps, tricks and cutthroat bidding strategies. The players would spend afternoons inside their clubhouse overlooking Pikes Peak, snacking on popcorn and celery sticks and showing off photos of their grandchildren while playing hand after hand.\n\nNow, the club had become a new breeding ground for a virus that has carved through family funerals, church gatherings, nursing homes and choir practices across the country, striking groups of older, vulnerable people with cruel efficiency.\n\nThat evening on March 13, Kelly hurriedly called an aunt and asked her: Tell me everything you can about bridge. How do players sit? How many cards do they touch? He could already picture the virus spreading as players moved from table to table, passing cards from hand to hand, seeding an invisible course of infection.\n\nFour of the bridge center's members are now dead, and at least 25 others have spent the past month fighting symptoms of the virus. The clubhouse is empty. And as members pass their quarantines playing online bridge and sharing updates about who is recovering and who is still in the hospital, some worry that the simple ritual of playing cards together will never feel safe again.\n\n\"Bridge is a very social game,\" said Jeff Rapp, a player who knew the first victim. \"We speak to each other. We like to have snacks when we play. There are so many things connected with duplicate bridge that are now dangerous.\"\n\nIn duplicate bridge, partners sit across from each other at a four-person table, and the cards are tucked into plastic trays that circulate from table to table. The game is infinitely complex, but the goal is simple: Make a smart bid, and play the best hand you can with the cards you are dealt.\n\nBridge was a passion for some. For others, it was a good excuse to get out of the house, keep their minds sharp and connect with friends and neighbors over a $5 game.\n\n\"What are the senior citizens going to do for activities?\" said John Dukellis, who helped coordinate games. \"It's cheaper than a movie. It's their social group. It's their lives. It hit us blindsided.\"\n\nThe club's members had barbecues and lunch at one another's homes and ran educational classes to interest young people in bridge (a tough sell). They posted celebratory photos on their Facebook page when Wayne became a bronze-level life master or when Chris and Susan \"really brought it\" one afternoon.\n\nMembers said the coronavirus still seemed like a faraway threat at the end of February, when they got together for some pairs games and a \"299er\" tournament for beginner and intermediate players over a five-day stretch.\n\nSome were worried enough about the grim news coming out of the Pacific Northwest that they decided to skip the tournament. As they sat down at the blue-topped card tables, people in a Seattle-area nursing home were being rushed to a hospital with fevers and coughs, and the nation's death count from the coronavirus, still in the single digits, was ticking up.\n\nColorado would not announce its first coronavirus cases until March 5, and like most states, it was not yet restricting businesses or social gatherings or ordering people to stay home. Rapp, 65, who ran some of the games, dug around in the clubhouse closet and set out hand sanitizer.\n\nAbout 150 people showed up to play during those five days from Feb. 27 to March 3. During one hand, a woman shielded her face with cards when an opponent sighed heavily.\n\n\"We were aware of coronavirus cases popping up,\" Rapp said. \"The people who wanted to play came to play.\"\n\nThe virus came too.\n\nPublic health officials in Colorado Springs say they believe that the 83-year-old woman was the first to bring the virus into the bridge club. She had not traveled recently, and officials said they did not know how she contracted it.\n\nClub members described her as a beginner player who had recently started attending more games because she was excited about playing in the upcoming 299er tournament. Her friends and partners said she was excited to play, but public health officials said she began feeling sick as the tournament went on.\n\n\"She was just living her life with minor symptoms like we've all done before,\" said Kelly, the coroner, who was also drafted to become deputy medical director for the El Paso County's public health agency as the outbreak erupted. \"This lady is just one more victim in the chain of events. Not the cause.\"\n\nShe died in a hospital March 13, and her coronavirus test came back positive a couple of hours later. Some of her family was already getting sick.\n\nPublic health officials raced to figure out who else might be walking around infected. The club provided a list of 100 bridge players, and the county set up a hotline for people who suspected they had been exposed.\n\nThe circle kept growing. One bridge player had gone to a choir practice: Add another 150 names to the list. The county's four-person epidemiology staff got so swamped that it drafted coroner's investigators to start calling.\n\nPete Coggeshall, 80, was one name on the list. He sat beside the 83-year-old woman March 3. Days later, he started to feel a strange cold coming on. Coca-Cola, which he loved, tasted strange. He avoided the common communion cup during Sunday services at the Rock of Ages Lutheran Church, and then felt worse after he got home. He ended up in a hospital for three days. \"It was like somebody hit me with a brick,\" he said. Coggeshall and other members have puzzled over how the infection circulated through the games -- the plastic boards holding the cards? An invisible mist in the air? The snack table stocked with supermarket cold cuts? -- but they said there was no way of knowing for sure.\n\nThe club started its own list. A group that was meticulous about tallying scores and the \"master points\" that players earned over a lifetime now had other wins and losses to chart. They tracked who was waiting on a coronavirus test. Who was on a ventilator. Who was fading.\n\nCritical but stable condition, some improvements, still in ICU.\n\nAll day in ER. Not lucid, couldn't answer her age, what day it was, etc.\n\nProfoundly weak, needs help eating. Has lost 20 pounds.\n\nThe players' death notices make no mention of the virus, obliquely citing a \"sudden illness\" and noting that memorials and funerals would be sometime in the future. Their families declined to talk, saying that their loved ones were private people or that the grief was still too raw.\n\nOther players are starting to heal. Dave Luk said his 80-year-old father, Joe, was rushed to the intensive care unit at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs after he began struggling to breathe at home, where he lives alone, often playing bridge online for hours after getting home from the club. After two weeks in the hospital, he is off the ventilator and can talk again, with difficulty, Dave Luk said.\n\nThe club has been closed since news broke of the first death, and members say nobody knows when it may reopen. Some are optimistic they will be able to reunite and grieve their friends and play together. Rapp, who helped run some games, is less certain.\n\n\"It became ground zero,\" he said. \"There's no telling how long this is going to go on.\"\n\nFor now, one task awaits. Rapp said he planned to collect the cards and burn them.",

        "body": "In the chaotic days of late March, as it became clear that New York was facing a catastrophic outbreak of the coronavirus, aides to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo quietly inserted a provision on Page 347 of New York's final, voluminous budget bill.\n\nMany lawmakers were unaware of the language when they approved the budget a few days later. But it provided unusual legal protections for an influential industry that has been devastated by the crisis: nursing home operators.\n\nThe measure, lobbied for by industry representatives, shielded nursing homes from many lawsuits over their failure to protect residents from death or sickness caused by the coronavirus.\n\nNow, weeks later, more than 5,300 residents of nursing homes in New York are believed to have died from the outbreak, and their relatives are finding that because of the provision, they may not be able to pursue legal action against the homes' operators over allegations of neglect.\n\nSeveral state lawmakers, besieged by complaints that poor staffing and shoddy conditions allowed the virus to spread out of control in the homes, said they were blindsided by the provision. At least one called for it to be repealed.\n\nMr. Cuomo's aides said nursing homes were not singled out for protection, noting that the provision also shields hospitals and other health care facilities. As New York anticipated a surge of patients, officials wanted other facilities, including nursing homes, to take in Covid-19 patients and expand bed capacity, they said. Their goal was to protect health care workers from litigation during an emergency.\n\n\"This legislation is not intended to shield any bad-acting facilities during this tragic time, but rather to ensure facilities could continue to function in the face of potential shortages and other evolving challenges the pandemic presented,\" said Dani Lever, a spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo.\n\nAs the coronavirus has ravaged nursing homes, killing more than 29,100 residents and staff members as of Wednesday, lobbyists across the country have pushed for immunity from lawsuits over how the homes have responded to the crisis.\n\nNew York is one of at least 15 states that have granted some form of legal protection to nursing homes and other health care facilities since the beginning of the pandemic. This immunity does not cover willful or criminal misconduct or gross negligence. But it would most likely cover harm that arose from a shortage in staffing or protective equipment.\n\nThe nursing home industry's push for immunity comes as businesses nationwide lobby the Trump administration and Congress to protect American companies from a range of potential lawsuits, including those from customers or employees who contract the virus and accuse the business of being the source of the infection.\n\nNursing home operators said they were not to blame for the terrible losses caused by the outbreak, emphasizing that they faced a formidable challenge that taxed them in ways they could not have foreseen. Many homes said they struggled to obtain testing kits for coronavirus and basic protective gear like gowns and N95 masks, leaving them powerless to stop the contagion.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Stores in N.J. can open for curbside pickup on Monday. Another upstate N.Y. area can start a limited reopening. 102 children in N.Y. are believed to have a rare illness tied to the virus. See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\n\"People need to know that they're not going to be sued as a result of going to work,\" said Jim Clyne, chief executive of LeadingAge New York, a group that represents nonprofit nursing homes and that lobbied for New York's law. \"Providers need to feel safe to take care of people.\"\n\nBut in recent weeks, reports of horrific scenes within nursing homes have emerged: severe staffing shortages as workers became sick, terrified residents pleading to the outside world for help, the bodies of dead residents piling up in makeshift morgues.\n\nSome homes run by for-profit companies had been previously cited by regulators for poor infectious-disease control and chronic understaffing. Families said they had difficulties prying even basic information from the facilities -- like how many residents had died or had been infected with Covid-19.\n\nFamily members of those who died said they were dismayed that they might not be able to sue the homes for neglect. Vivian Rivera-Zayas said a Long Island, N.Y., nursing home waited until her mother, who had tested positive for Covid-19, was gasping for breath with a collapsed lung before transferring her to a hospital next door. Her mother died two days later.\n\n\"They can't just shrug their shoulders and say, 'It's a pandemic,'\" said Ms. Rivera-Zayas, who plans to sue the nursing home. \"There has to be accountability.\"\n\nAdvocates for nursing home residents said there were three longstanding safeguards against bad homes: family members who frequently visit; regular inspections by government regulators; and, as a last resort, lawsuits that can hold negligent homes accountable. But families can no longer visit. Regulators have largely stopped inspecting.\n\n\"All of the systems there to protect people are gone,\" said Toby Edelman, a senior policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy. \"To me, the combination -- rules are waived, protections are waived, nobody is going in to check. And now immunity? That is a lethal combination.\"\n\nNew Jersey, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Utah and Wisconsin have also passed new measures to shield health care facilities, including nursing homes, from liability.\n\nGovernors in at least nine other states -- Arizona, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Mississippi, Rhode Island and Vermont -- issued executive orders shielding health care facilities from most lawsuits related to their response to the pandemic.\n\nNursing homes are pressing for legal protections in other states, including Florida, Pennsylvania and California.\n\nAt the epicenter of the outbreak, New York decided early to protect staff members at health care facilities, including nursing homes, from lawsuits. Mr. Cuomo issued an executive order on March 23 that shielded the workers -- but not facilities -- from most lawsuits related to their handling of coronavirus cases.\n\nAt the same time, the state required nursing homes to take Covid-19 patients from hospitals and also loosened record-keeping requirements for patient care, which would be crucial to any lawsuit.\n\nLobbyists wanted Mr. Cuomo to do more. The Greater New York Hospital Association, an influential lobbying group for hospitals (some of which also run nursing homes), drafted legislation calling for hospitals, as well as workers, to be shielded from most civil and criminal liability during the pandemic.\n\nLeadingAge New York, one of several nursing home lobbying groups in the state, also asked the Cuomo administration to include nursing homes in the immunity protections.\n\n\"If the worker has immunity, the next thing you'd do is sue the provider, so you need to extend the liability to the facility as well,\" Mr. Clyne said.\n\nThe legal provision on immunity was stuck in the middle of a seemingly unrelated piece of legislation -- concerning education, labor and family assistance -- in an omnibus bill typically referred to as \"the big ugly.\"\n\nOn April 2, the Legislature approved the budget, which included the immunity provisions shielding hospitals and nursing homes from lawsuits over Covid-19 care, as long as the facilities were acting in good faith. The immunity does not protect the homes from intentional criminal misconduct or gross negligence.\n\nSeveral lawmakers said they did not know about the immunity provisions and worried they went too far.\n\n\"It's very troubling,\" said Richard N. Gottfried, the chairman of the Assembly's health committee, who voted for the budget bill but said he did not have a chance to thoroughly review the immunity provisions. \"There's a very long history of abuse and neglect of nursing home residents. And to add to that a reduction in the ability of patients and family members to seek relief in the courts is very scary.\"\n\nRon Kim, a Democratic assemblyman from Queens, a borough that has been particularly hard-hit by nursing home deaths, said he was deeply concerned by the protections, which he learned about from The Times. He introduced a bill Monday that would strike the immunity provisions altogether.\n\n\"For us to change the liability standard without any discussion is borderline criminal,\" said Mr. Kim, who voted against the budget for other reasons. \"It's ridiculous. Why would anyone comply with rules if they felt like they couldn't be touched?\"\n\nThe spokeswoman for Mr. Cuomo's office said lawmakers had ample opportunity to weigh in on the provisions and denied that outside lobbyists influenced the immunity decision.\n\n\"This bill was not done in the dark, and elected officials cannot be blindsided by language in a bill, unless they don't read it,\" Ms. Lever said.\n\nRealizing the extent of the crisis, Mr. Cuomo announced that the state attorney general would investigate homes over their handling of coronavirus cases. And last weekend, Mr. Cuomo issued an executive order that hospital patients had to test negative for Covid before being discharged to nursing homes, rolling back an earlier directive.\n\nMs. Rivera-Zayas, whose mother contracted Covid in Our Lady of Consolation Nursing & Rehabilitative Care Center, a Long Island nursing home, said she wants answers. She said she felt the home failed to provide her mother with proper medical care until it was too late.\n\nShe spent her first Mother's Day without her mother, protesting in front of the home with other families who lost loved ones. At least 39 other residents with Covid-19 died.\n\nBeing barred from suing, she said, would be a final indignity. \"Cuomo may have tied our hands,\" she said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Catholic Health Services, which runs the Our Lady of Consolation home, said the facility \"takes great care of each and every patient.\"\n\n\"We are vigilant in monitoring staff and residents for any Covid-19 symptoms and immediately take appropriate steps, if symptoms should appear,\" said Chris Hendricks, the spokeswoman.\n\nBrett Leitner, a New York lawyer who over the years has brought hundreds of cases against nursing homes for abuse and neglect, said he had received more than 100 calls from families who have lost loved ones to Covid-19 in nursing homes.\n\nWhile he is still taking on clients for future cases, he said the immunity law would make it harder to hold negligent homes accountable.\n\n\"It will be an uphill battle,\" he said.\n\nMichael Rothfeld, John Leland, J.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAccording to a new study of homeless shelters in four major American cities, it is crucial to broadly test residents and staff for the coronavirus at the detection of the first case -- or sooner -- and to isolate those who test positive in order to prevent a wide spread of infection.\n\nEven in two shelters in Atlanta, which had no known coronavirus cases, comprehensive testing of residents and staff found that 4 percent of the residents and 2 percent of staff members tested positive, suggesting that some people were spreading the disease through the shelters before they had symptoms.\n\nAnd in 12 Seattle shelters which each had only one known previous case, 5 percent of the residents and 1 percent of staff members tested positive.\n\nBut by the time there was a cluster of cases (meaning two or more) at shelters, the extent of the spread was far greater, according to the study released on Wednesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe study's researchers took data from tests administered at shelters in Atlanta, Boston, San Francisco and Seattle from late March through early April. The program sought to test every resident and staff member at 19 shelters in those cities, but in some cases residents were not available or declined to participate.\n\nAfter a cluster was detected in a shelter in Boston, testing found that more than a third of the residents had the virus, while two-thirds tested positive at a shelter in San Francisco.\n\n\"If you wait for a cluster to develop, you are almost too late,\" said Dr. Jim O'Connell, the president of the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program, who took part in the study. \"The lesson is that from the beginning of this epidemic, we should have been testing people in nursing homes, prisons and in shelters because that is where it is spreading asymptomatically, and it can be deadly before you know it.\"\n\nDr. O'Connell noted that some shelters outside of the study have reported very high rates of positive test results with little prior indication of infection. He said that 49 residents out of 114 (43 percent) tested positive at a shelter in Worcester, Mass., and very few of them had noticeable symptoms beforehand.\n\n\"That was before they had a cluster,\" he said. \"What we really need to be doing is testing early and often in shelters.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As states face a downturn worse than the Great Recession, McConnell suggests they consider bankruptcy. Wednesday was California's \"deadliest day,\" with 115 deaths, though Pence predicts an end by Memorial Day. As another 4.4 million file for unemployment, help is slow to arrive. See more updates Updated 12m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe C.D.C. study said that approximately 1.4 million people nationally use homeless shelters each year. It added that infection-control practices at shelters are especially important, but they can be challenging because of overcrowding, the older age and underlying health conditions of many homeless people, a lack of hand sanitizers and the difficulty of keeping guests sheltering in place.\n\nDr. Georgina Peacock, a leader of the C.D.C.'s Covid-19 Response At Risk Task Force, noted that many of the study's findings also apply to the population at large: Early and regular testing, followed by isolation, is vital to controlling the spread of the disease.\n\nBut she said these issues are magnified at shelters because of the conditions found at many of them.\n\n\"This is a vulnerable population,\" she said, \"and it is difficult in homeless shelters to do some of the things that we know are important to contain spread.\"\n\nIn all, officials tested 1,192 residents and 313 staff members. Five of the 19 shelters had clusters of two or more people known to have contracted the virus before the testing was done. Those were the ones with high rates of infection.\n\nDr. O'Connell noted that the overall rate of infection in a region should be factored in to any conclusions. The more cases there are in a particular city, the more cases would be expected to be found in shelters there. The study said that Boston had the highest rate of infections among the four cities, at 14.4 cases per 100,000 residents at the time of the testing period. San Francisco had the lowest rate, at 5.7.\n\nAnother study, also released Wednesday by the C.D.C., examined how public health officials, in coordination with the C.D.C., tested 233 residents and staff members at three affiliated shelters in Seattle, where staff and residents had been moving regularly from one shelter to another. It found 18 percent of the residents at those shelters and 21 percent of the staff members tested positive for the virus.\n\nAggressive isolation measures after the testing helped to mitigate the spread, Dr. Peacock said. Residents who tested positive were transported to hospitals or brought to isolation areas away from the shelters to avoid further contamination.\n\nBoth reports recommended that service providers apply physical distancing measures where possible, including ensuring that residents' heads are at least six feet apart while sleeping, and promote the use of cloth face coverings for everyone in a facility.\n\n\"Sometimes you don't have that ability to do some of that social distancing,\" Dr. Peacock said, \"so you have to plan for how to reduce crowding.\"\n\nSharon Bogan, a spokeswoman for Public Health -- Seattle & King County, said there are currently 74 people in isolation, quarantine and recovery sites around King County.\n\nAccording to the C.D.C. report, 147 of 408 residents at a Boston shelter had tested positive for Covid-19. Dr. O'Connell said that, like the shelter in Worcester, many of them were asymptomatic. Once they tested positive, they were moved to other locations, including a temporary field hospital in a Boston convention center with 500 beds set aside for homeless people. Other homeless guests, who did not test positive, were moved to dormitories at nearby Suffolk University to ease overcrowding.\n\n\"Large cities need to make sure they incorporate the homeless shelters and homeless population into their overall plan to treat the virus,\" he said. \"Cities have not done that, so this is a good clarion call for everyone.\"",

        "body": "Instead of celebrities and sizzle reels at Carnegie Hall, the network presents its wares in videos sent to ad buyers.\n\nEvery spring CBS parades its stars and executives across the Carnegie Hall stage to try to persuade advertisers to buy commercial time during an event filled with scripted banter and sizzle reels. This year, ad buyers working from home clicked on a link that led them to a cartoon of Stephen Colbert interviewing a dog.\n\nThe cameo appearances by a character from Nickelodeon's \"Paw Patrol\" and an animated version of the star of \"The Late Show\" kicked off a toned-down presentation from ViacomCBS that took the place of the usual showcase.\n\nIn a series of videos delivered to an audience stuck at home during the coronavirus pandemic, actors like Thomas Middleditch and Tom Selleck helped CBS introduce its 2020-21 fall lineup. The slate includes 23 returning series, as well as a new sitcom called \"B Positive\" from Chuck Lorre, the co-creator of the CBS stalwart \"The Big Bang Theory,\" and a reboot of the 1980s vigilante show \"The Equalizer,\" starring Queen Latifah. \"Clarice,\" a TV sequel to the 1991 blockbuster \"The Silence of the Lambs,\" will arrive late in the season. The network will also broadcast the Super Bowl on Feb. 7.\n\nIn taped videos, Mr. Colbert joined Tony Romo, LL Cool J and others to talk up the media giant's ad-targeting technology and its access to young viewers. James Corden, the host of \"The Late Late Show,\" reminisced about taking selfies and eating frozen yogurt during the parties at the Plaza that take place after the annual Carnegie Hall event.\n\n\"I so wish we were all together right now in New York City,\" he moaned.\n\nThe pandemic has laid waste to the elaborate springtime ritual known as the upfronts, where media companies hype their fall wares in an effort to secure their slice of more than $9 billion in ad money. This year, boozy dinners and power breakfasts have given way to virtual presentations.\n\nWith television production shut down indefinitely, the companies that buy commercial time are expected to spend 33 percent less than they did last year during the current upfront season, according to a recent survey from the advertising data company Advertiser Perceptions.\n\n\"The reality is, we're trying to figure out what's happening,\" said Gibbs Haljun, who handles investments at the media agency Mindshare. \"Nobody is pushing to have upfront conversations today -- there are too many variables we don't know.\"\n\nIn its most recent quarter, ViacomCBS suffered a 19 percent slump in advertising revenue. During a virtual meeting of shareholders on Monday, the chief executive Robert M. Bakish said the company was seeing \"green shoots\" in the so-called scatter market, where ads are sold closer to airtime, rather than months in advance.\n\nNeither he nor George Cheeks, the head of CBS, appeared in the videos sent to ad buyers, but Mr. Colbert managed to squeeze in some industry humor at their expense.\n\n\"If your cheeks seem bakish, see a physician immediately,\" he said to his remote audience. \"That's one of the symptoms.\"",

Quiz\u00e1s lo que estamos sintiendo no es diferente a lo que los yanomamis han experimentado a lo largo de la historia cuando se han enfrentado a las misteriosas y letales epidemias que nuestro mundo les ha infligido.\n\nDesde sus contactos iniciales con forasteros a partir de la d\u00e9cada de 1940, los yanomamis han vivido sucesivas olas de epidemias mortales, especialmente el sarampi\u00f3n y la gripe. La expansi\u00f3n de la colonizaci\u00f3n de la frontera interna brasile\u00f1a se intensific\u00f3 en la d\u00e9cada de 1970, cuando la dictadura militar abri\u00f3 la carretera Perimetral Norte en territorio yanomami.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Businesses reopen in some states, but conflicting messages stoke confusion.

See more updates Updated 1m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nDesde finales de la d\u00e9cada de 1980, sus tierras han sufrido incursiones constantes de mineros ilegales de oro, que han desatado epidemias de malaria, gripe, tuberculosis y enfermedades de transmisi\u00f3n sexual.\n\nActualmente, m\u00e1s de 20.000 garimpeiros, o mineros ilegales, est\u00e1n devastando las tierras de los yanomamis. Estos invasores, que son casi tan numerosos como la propia comunidad (la poblaci\u00f3n actual es de 26.780), son probablemente los responsables de introducir el coronavirus en la regi\u00f3n. Incluso en medio de la pandemia, las operaciones mineras ilegales han seguido expandi\u00e9ndose. En t\u00e9rminos m\u00e1s generales, la destrucci\u00f3n de la selva tropical en toda la Amazon\u00eda brasile\u00f1a se ha acelerado, y las alertas de deforestaci\u00f3n durante los primeros tres meses de 2020 aumentaron un 51 por ciento durante el mismo periodo del a\u00f1o pasado.\n\nEn este contexto de creciente anarqu\u00eda e invasi\u00f3n, los pueblos ind\u00edgenas de todo Brasil enfrentan un riesgo intensificado de infecci\u00f3n. Hasta ahora, se ha encontrado que m\u00e1s de 40 ind\u00edgenas en Brasil tienen la COVID-19, y siete han muerto: Xirixana, otros tres miembros de diferentes grupos \u00e9tnicos del interior del Amazonas y tres residentes de la ciudad de Manaos, incluido un trabajador de la salud ind\u00edgena. Sin embargo, debido al precario estado de la atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica que se ofrece a los ind\u00edgenas, es muy probable que haya muchos m\u00e1s casos.\n\nLa enfermedad parece propagarse r\u00e1pidamente en los barrios pobres en las afueras de las grandes ciudades amaz\u00f3nicas como Manaos y Bel\u00e9m, que ya estaban sobrecargados por la llegada de refugiados ind\u00edgenas venezolanos. El impacto de la pandemia del coronavirus en esos pueblos ind\u00edgenas urbanos se ha pasado por alto en la saturaci\u00f3n general de datos.\n\nLos aproximadamente 900.000 ind\u00edgenas est\u00e1n entre las personas m\u00e1s vulnerables a esta epidemia en Brasil. Abandonadas por instituciones nacionales d\u00e9biles y con fondos insuficientes, algunas comunidades ind\u00edgenas se han encargado de cerrar sus aldeas o aislarse lo mejor que pueden, suspendiendo las actividades sociales y pol\u00edticas y distribuyendo materiales de prevenci\u00f3n en sus idiomas nativos.\n\nLos yanomamis, una de las comunidades ind\u00edgenas m\u00e1s grandes y conocidas de la Amazon\u00eda, contin\u00faan sufriendo de una atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica inadecuada y un clima persistente de indiferencia, negligencia e ilegalidad respecto a la invasi\u00f3n de sus tierras por parte de los mineros.\n\nLa prensa, la comunidad cient\u00edfica global y los propios pueblos ind\u00edgenas deben seguir poniendo en evidencia tales descuidos y denunciar las violaciones de los derechos constitucionalmente garantizados. Y, sin embargo, dada la respuesta ca\u00f3tica del gobierno del presidente de Brasil, Jair Bolsonaro, a la pandemia a nivel nacional -- adem\u00e1s de su abierta hostilidad hacia la ciencia, los pueblos ind\u00edgenas y el medioambiente -- parece haber poca esperanza de un cambio significativo en las pol\u00edticas a corto plazo.\n\nPero hay algo fundamental que s\u00ed ha cambiado: todos estamos unidos por una tragedia que se est\u00e1 desatando en el mundo entero.\n\nTodav\u00eda sabemos poco de esta enfermedad. Sobre sus or\u00edgenes, sabemos que el surgimiento del nuevo coronavirus est\u00e1 probablemente asociado a la destrucci\u00f3n del h\u00e1bitat y la mercantilizaci\u00f3n de animales salvajes. Pero a\u00fan no tenemos inmunidad, medicamentos ni vacunas para detenerla. No tenemos m\u00e1s remedio que confinarnos en nuestras casas con la esperanza de evadir la infecci\u00f3n. De alguna manera, la situaci\u00f3n me recuerda las historias que los ancianos yanomamis me contaron sobre los momentos en que huyeron al bosque en peque\u00f1os grupos para esconderse de Xawarari, el canibalesco \"esp\u00edritu epid\u00e9mico\".\n\nSin embargo, esta vez, nos convertimos en nuestra propia v\u00edctima, desatando sobre nosotros las consecuencias epidemiol\u00f3gicas de la arrogancia depredadora del mundo industrial, tal como l\u00edderes ind\u00edgenas como Davi Kopenawa, cham\u00e1n y fil\u00f3sofo yanomami, han venido denunciando durante d\u00e9cadas. Pero ahora, como todos estamos expuestos a un nuevo enemigo invisible para el que no tenemos defensas, tal vez esta experiencia desgarradora de vulnerabilidad compartida lleve a la sociedad global a repensar su curso actual.\n\nBruce Albert, antrop\u00f3logo, ha trabajado entre los yanomamis en Brasil desde 1975.

        "body": "Identifying and tracing air passengers from high-risks countries is useful when begun early, a C.D.C. study found, but California's effort came too late.\n\nIn the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, the United States, like many countries, had a very brief chance to limit the spread of the disease at its borders. Identifying travelers from high-risk countries and tracing their contacts with others would have been critical measures, if put in place early enough.\n\nIn California, the largest state and a point of entry for thousands of travelers from Asia, a program was established to do just that. But its tracing system was quickly overwhelmed by a flood of passengers, many with inaccurate contact information, and was understaffed in some cases, rendering the program ineffective, according to a study released on Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which looked exclusively at California.\n\n\"Despite intensive effort, the traveler screening system did not effectively prevent introduction of Covid-19 into California,\" the report said.\n\nIn early February, over 11,000 travelers from China -- and later Iran -- who landed in California were identified for contact tracing. The hope was to keep track of people traveling from high-risk countries, enabling public health officials to identify possible cases of the coronavirus, quarantine them and contact people who were exposed to them to limit the spread of the contagion.\n\nBut when the program was begun on Feb. 5, several weeks had already passed since the disease was first identified in Wuhan, China. On March 17, the program was abandoned so that health care officials could shift their focus to mitigating the spread of the disease within the state. By mid-March, the coronavirus had already established a foothold in California; preventing further introduction from overseas was seen as less important than fighting it on the ground.\n\n\"This report is a good example of the challenge of trying to use travel screening to contain and prevent pandemic transmission,\" said Dr. Timothy Brewer, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.\n\nThe report was prepared by the California Department of Public Health for the C.D.C., which also provided similar passenger information to other states.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The White House plans to ask officials -- but not Trump -- to wear face masks. As states rush to reopen, scientists fear the virus will come back. Elon Musk announces that Tesla will restart production despite a county order. See more updates Updated 1m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nA spokesman for California's health department said the report spoke for itself. When asked if traveler monitoring is a useful tool in fighting a pandemic, the spokesman referred to a passage in the report noting that it can be effective if begun early enough, but that it is particularly difficult with a respiratory disease like the coronavirus, with which transmission can occur before symptoms arise.\n\nThe report also said that traveler monitoring is most effective when there is accurate information about passengers and when the number of passengers does not overwhelm the system. None of those conditions existed in this case.\n\nStrict measures in smaller countries like New Zealand and Taiwan are believed to have helped contain outbreaks there, Dr. Brewer said. New Zealand instructed everyone coming into the country after the outbreak to spend two weeks in quarantine, and Taiwan instituted similar measures.\n\nBut those are island nations with much smaller populations, and Dr. Brewer noted that Taiwan began installing its restrictions \"within one or two days after becoming aware that Covid-19 existed.\"\n\nThe California program began two days after President Trump ordered restrictions on travel from China. But nearly 40,000 travelers from China, of various nationalities, were still permitted to enter the country two months after the ban was imposed. Many were returning home, and many of them went through Los Angeles and San Francisco.\n\nWhen passengers arrived in California on flights from China during the study period, their information was recorded by customs and border patrol officers and then forwarded to the C.D.C., which in turn sent the contact information to California health officials. Those names were then given to health departments in local jurisdictions throughout the state for contact tracing and follow-ups.\n\nTravelers from Iran were included in the program, called Return Traveler Monitoring, beginning on March 5. The study found that three of the passengers, including two from Iran, were later reported to California's health department as Covid-19 patients.\n\nIn theory, after their arrival, the travelers would be contacted to see if they developed symptoms and find out whom they had seen in person. If any of the passengers developed symptoms or tested positive for the coronavirus, they could be isolated to prevent further transmission, and anyone they came into contact with could be isolated as well.\n\nThe C.D.C. report said that, in California, incomplete information made it hard to fully institute the plan. Sometimes names, addresses or phone numbers were inaccurate, and passengers could not be found for follow-ups.\n\nAlso, the number of people to keep track of was overwhelming. During the seven weeks of the program, a median of 1,431 people from Asia entered California per week, the study said. By comparison, passenger identification during the Ebola outbreak of 2014-15 was effective in California, in part, because only 21 people per week came from affected countries in Africa.\n\nThe study also cited the issue of asymptomatic patients, who can spread the disease before showing signs of illness.\n\nStill, the C.D.C. report endorsed traveler-monitoring programs, although they are \"likely more effective during the initial containment phase\" of the outbreak.\n\nOnce California's current outbreak is under control, the study said, public health officials should still try to put in place the tracing program, if another wave of disease emerges. But it recommended that it be done in a more efficient and comprehensive way, particularly in collecting accurate information about the passengers.\n\nThe C.D.C. called on airlines to provide flight passenger lists to federal officials and for health departments to use text messaging to communicate with passengers after they leave the airport. It said all of that might be useful to \"maintain low disease incidence.\"\n\n\"The critical words there are 'low disease incidence,'\" Dr. Brewer said. \"What they are saying is, this could work if you got on top of it early before your system gets overwhelmed. That's what Taiwan did.\"\n\nHe added, \"In order to do it correctly, you will have to have significantly more resources than are typically available in public health departments.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAs the novel coronavirus swept through communities around the world, preying disproportionately on the poor and the vulnerable, one disadvantaged group has demonstrated a remarkable resistance. Women, whether from China, Italy or the U.S., have been less likely to become acutely ill -- and far more likely to survive.\n\nWhich has made doctors wonder: Could hormones produced in greater quantities by women be at work?\n\nNow scientists on two coasts, acting quickly on their hunches in an effort to save men's lives, are testing the hypothesis. The two clinical trials will each dose men with the sex hormones for limited durations.\n\nLast week, doctors on Long Island in New York started treating Covid-19 patients with estrogen in an effort to increase their immune systems, and next week, physicians in Los Angeles will start treating male patients with another hormone that is predominantly found in women, progesterone, which has anti-inflammatory properties and can potentially prevent harmful overreactions of the immune system.\n\n\"There's a striking difference between the number of men and women in the intensive care unit, and men are clearly doing worse,\" said Dr. Sara Ghandehari, a pulmonologist and intensive care physician at Cedars-Sinai in Los Angeles who is the principal investigator for the progesterone study. She said 75 percent of the hospital's intensive care patients and those on ventilators are men.\n\nAnd pregnant women, who are usually immunocompromised but have high levels of estrogen and progesterone, tend to have mild courses of the disease. \"So something about being a woman is protective, and something about pregnancy is protective, and that makes us think about hormones,\" Dr. Ghandehari said.\n\nSome experts who study sex differences in immunity, however, warned that hormones may fail to be the magic bullet that some are hoping for; even elderly women with Covid-19 are outliving their male peers, and there is a drastic reduction in levels of hormones for women after menopause.\n\nThe genesis of the estrogen trial at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University on Long Island stemmed from a similar observation, said Dr. Sharon Nachman, the trial's principal investigator, who credited a Stony Brook surgeon, Dr. Antonios Gasparis, with the idea.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The C.D.C. expands the list of symptoms, and the W.H.O. warns of a long road ahead. President Trump unveils a plan to help states expand testing. Experts say it is not enough. States have different strategies for restarting the economy. Trump suggests opening some schools. See more updates Updated 1m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe trial enrolled its first patient this past week, and preliminary results could be available in a few months, she said.\n\n\"It's totally out of the box, which is how good ideas often start,\" said Dr. Nachman, associate dean for research at the Renaissance School, which is part of the State University of New York.\n\nThe gender gap in coronavirus survival became apparent early in the pandemic. Reports from China indicated men were dying at higher rates, but the disparity was attributed to higher smoking rates. But the outcomes were consistent in other countries, with men in Italy dying at higher rates than women, and men in New York City dying at nearly double the rate of women.\n\nScientists who study sex differences say that both biological differences in immunity, as well as behavioral factors are at play. Men smoke more almost everywhere, they say; men also wash their hands less. While women appear to have more robust immune systems, these experts say, the causes are complex and multifactorial, and hormones are only part of the picture.\n\nIf such sex hormones were the primary protective factor for women, then elderly women with Covid-19 would fare as poorly as elderly men, because women's reproductive hormones plummet after menopause, said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nBut that's not the case, she said.\n\n\"We see this bias across the life course,\" Dr. Klein said. \"Older men are still disproportionately affected, and that suggests to me it's got to be something genetic, or something else, that's not just hormonal.\"\n\n\"Estrogen has immune modulatory properties -- don't get me wrong,\" she continued. \"You could get a beneficial effect in both men and women. But if women are better at recovery at 93 years old, I doubt it's hormones.\"\n\nResearch has shown estrogen may have an effect on a protein known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), for example. The coronavirus uses ACE2 receptors on the surfaces of cells as an entry route, and ACE2 is regulated differently in men and women, said Kathryn Sandberg, director of the Center for the Study of Sex Differences in Health, Aging and Disease at Georgetown University.\n\nIn studies with rats, Dr. Sandberg and her colleagues have shown that estrogen can reduce ACE2 protein expression in their kidneys, so it is possible the hormone may reduce ACE2 expression in men as well.\n\nDr. Nachman said, \"We may not understand exactly how estrogen works, but maybe we can see how the patient does,\" adding that estrogen plays a complex role, both in the early immune response that can help clear a viral infection, as well as in a secondary clean up or repair response, which can evolve into a cytokine storm.\n\n\"While we see women do get infected, their responses are different,\" Dr. Nachman said. \"We see fewer of them having the second, disregulated immune response.\"\n\nThe Stony Brook estrogen trial is recruiting 110 patients who come to the hospital's emergency room with symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath or pneumonia, and who have either tested positive for Covid-19 or are presumed to have the illness, as long as they do not require intubation.\n\nThe trial is open to adult men as well as to women aged 55 and older, since they have low levels of estrogen. Half of the participants will be given an estradiol patch for one week, while the other half will serve as a control group, and researchers will follow them to see whether estrogen reduces the severity of their disease.\n\nThe Cedars-Sinai study is smaller, with only 40 subjects, all men, half of whom will be a control group. Only hospital inpatients with mild to moderate disease who have tested positive for Covid-19 can participate. (Patients with certain conditions, like a history of blood clots, are excluded for safety reasons.)\n\nThe patients will get two shots of progesterone a day for five days.\n\nThey will be monitored to see if their status is improving, how their needs for oxygen change and whether they go on to require intensive care or mechanical ventilation; their progress will be compared to patients in the control group.\n\nThe researchers in Los Angeles are pinning their hopes on progesterone rather than estrogen because research has shown that the hormone reduces pro-inflammatory immune cells, and supports those that fight inflammation, Dr. Ghandehari said. The hypothesis is that progesterone will prevent or dampen a harmful overreaction of the immune system, called a cytokine storm, and will reduce the likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nBoth hormones are believed to be safe, especially when used for short durations. Participants will be warned of possible side effects that may be a first for many men, like tenderness in the breast and hot flashes.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

And there are no reports of humans contracting the virus from cats.\n\nCats can infect each other with the novel coronavirus, but they may not have any symptoms, researchers reported on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nThe report follows earlier laboratory research and cases of domestic cats, as well as tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo, that tested positive for the coronavirus. In several cases, those cats showed mild symptoms, but the six cats in the new experiment didn't get sick at all and cleared the virus from their bodies on their own.\n\nYoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine and Peter Halfmann of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, along with other researchers from both the United States and Japan, conducted the study, in which three domestic cats were inoculated with the virus and three additional uninfected cats were put in cages, one with each of the inoculated cats.\n\nFirst the cats that had been given the virus tested positive. Then their cage mates also caught the virus. None were sick, and all were virus free after, at most, six days.\n\nCats have also contracted the virus from humans, but there are no reports of a person becoming infected with the virus from a cat, although the authors suggest that the possibility deserves more research.\n\nThe cats, once infected, shed virus particles in the same way that humans do. And it is the same coronavirus that infects people. That makes it theoretically possible for cats to give the virus to humans, said Dr. Karen Terio, chief of the Zoological Pathology Program at the University of Illinois College of Veterinary Medicine. Still, Dr. Terio, who was not involved in the study, wrote in an email that \"given the limited social circle of most domestic cats, cats are most likely to become infected after contact with a human member of their household.\"\n\nThe researchers urged people not to forgo the comforts of feline companionship; humans are the clear dangers in terms of disease transmission, not pets.\n\nIf someone with a cat has the virus, Dr. Halfmann, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said to use common sense. \"No cat kisses,\" he said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as well as other organizations suggest keeping pets away from humans who have tested positive.\n\nIf you are healthy, Dr. Halfmann said, life can go on as usual, \"My cat sleeps on a pillow right next to me.\" Asked if the results of the experiment had changed that habit, he said, \"he was there last night.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSelling Iran's oil in defiance of an American embargo was already a risky and complicated venture for Iranian brokers. Then came the precipitous plunge in prices because of the global coronavirus clampdown, which has shriveled demand.\n\nAt first, Iranian brokers and many others in the country watched with amusement as U.S. oil prices briefly plunged below zero on Monday -- meaning sellers had to pay buyers to take the oil away. Then on Tuesday the price of Brent crude oil, a benchmark blend that more directly affects Iran's price, dropped to $20 a barrel, the lowest level in nearly two decades.\n\nBy Wednesday, Iranian oil brokers, who already sell at a discount to evade American sanctions, were nervously calibrating how far prices could drop before they would lose money.\n\nThe oil market's collapse this week was another unanticipated blow for Iran, where the authorities have struggled to contain the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East while keeping afloat an economy that has long relied on oil exports but has been hampered by American sanctions.\n\nWhile Iranian leaders have significantly lessened their dependence on foreign purchases of Iran's oil, it remains a basic industry for a country with the third-largest reserves among the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\nThe price collapse has further complicated efforts by Iranian leaders to reopen the economy after a series of halting and sometimes contradictory moves to shutter businesses and ban travel in hopes of slowing the coronavirus contagion. On Saturday, the authorities began lifting those restraints, reopening shopping malls and Tehran's famed bazaar, among other things.\n\nBut Iranian health officials are worried, already seeing a surge in the number of people seeking hospital treatment for coronavirus symptoms. The head of Iran's coronavirus relief committee, Alireza Zali, said hospital visits in Tehran alone rose 6 percent by midweek.\n\nBy official count, as of Thursday, more than 87,000 Iranians had been infected with the virus and 5,481 had died from Covid-19, the respiratory disease it causes. Those figures are widely believed to be undercounts.\n\nPresident Hassan Rouhani, who had argued that fighting the contagion and salvaging the economy go hand in hand, acknowledged on Wednesday that Iran would suffer from falling oil prices but played down the severity.\n\nFalling oil prices \"has created problems for all of us, even for us,\" Mr. Rouhani said at a televised cabinet meeting. \"Because our dependency on oil was reduced -- by choice or not, willingly or enforced by the enemy -- definitely our losses will be less. \"\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Ecuador's increased deaths during the outbreak are 15 times the official coronavirus toll. Merkel: 'Let us not squander what we have achieved.' The pandemic is shaking beliefs about American exceptionalism. See more updates Updated 8m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nThe oil ministry, through a handful of trusted brokers, sells its oil at about $10 below the Brent market price to create an incentive for buyers like China to risk evading sanctions. It costs Iran about $5.50 a barrel to produce crude oil.\n\nOil revenue makes up about 10 percent of Iran's budget. However, the budget for this fiscal year was set based on selling a million barrels of oil a day at about $50 per barrel.\n\nThe combination of sanctions, shrinking demand for oil and falling prices has upended Iran's budget planning.\n\n\"It will cause a lot of rearranging of government financing, but it isn't a final blow for the Iranian economy because it has been forced to adjust so severely over the past two years,\" said Henry Rome, Iran analyst for the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy.\n\nIn March, during the height of the coronavirus crisis, one oil trader said, Iran's oil sales had dropped from 300,000 barrels a day to 80,000.\n\nWhile Iranian leaders may be fretting about their own oil problems, they have taken pleasure in seeing what the price collapse has done to their main nemesis, the United States.\n\nPlaying on the Trump administration's vow to eliminate Iran from the market as part of its \"maximum pressure\" policy, the front page of the conservative Kayhan newspaper on Wednesday read, \"They wanted to reduce Iran's oil sales to zero, but U.S. oil prices reduced to below zero.\"\n\nOther politicians minimized the threat to Iran's economy. On the contrary, they said, it showed Iran's resilience.\n\n\"The world is shocked because of the crashing oil prices due to the coronavirus,\" said Iran's deputy government spokesman, Mohammad Reza Noroozpour, in a tweet on Monday. \"Let's not forget that our government has managed the country without relying on oil revenues for two years.\"\n\nIran is somewhat of an anomaly among oil rich countries such as Saudi Arabia and Algeria, whose economies are heavily dependent on oil. U.S. sanctions targeting Iran's oil sales have forced it to find other sources of revenue, including higher taxes and privatization of government holdings.\n\nSince Washington imposed sanctions on Iran after President Trump renounced the nuclear accord negotiated by the Obama administration, Iran's oil sales have dropped from 2.5 million barrels to about 300,000 barrels per day.\n\nChina also serves as a key partner for helping Iran keep its refineries and oil fields operational. Iran rents tanker farms offshore in China and stores the excess barrels of oil that it cannot sell, according to oil brokers in Iran.\n\nMr. Rouhani has said that his government will face a budget deficit of one-third. Economists and analysts predict Iran's economy will be further strained this year because of sanctions and the effects of the coronavirus.\n\nA telephone poll conducted this month by the Iranian Students Polling Agency showed the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic on Iranians. Some 50.7 percent said their purchasing powers had shrunk, 41.7 percent said their businesses or source of income had shut down, and 13.5 percent said they had lost their jobs.\n\nIran has said U.S. sanctions have denied the country about $200 billion in revenue and have impeded its efforts to fight the virus. Iranian officials have lobbied to convince Washington to lift sanctions for humanitarian reasons, but so far Mr. Trump has not budged.\n\nAt the same time, Iran has remained defiant in resisting direct talks with Washington and continuing strategies deemed by the United States to be provocative.\n\nOn Wednesday the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps launched a military satellite into orbit and said it was capable of both defense and collecting surveillance and imaging. A few days earlier, the Guards naval force approached a U.S. Navy ship in the Persian Gulf.\n\nMr. Trump reacted to the news of the satellite launch by tweeting that he had authorized the Navy to \"shoot down\" Iranian boats if they harass U.S. ships.\n\nThe Revolutionary Guards commander-in-chief, Gen. Hossein Salami, said on Thursday that Iran had ordered its naval forces to strike back at American ships if their vessels threaten the security of Iranian vessels. \"Any action will result in a firm, swift and strong reaction from us,\" General Salami said.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nA chicken processing company based in Delaware killed nearly 2 million chickens this month after many of its workers were sidelined by illness or quarantine orders related to the coronavirus, industry officials said.\n\nThe action by Allen Harim Foods was the latest example of how food processors are being affected by the coronavirus, which is keeping workers away because of illness or quarantine. Meat processors, dairy farmers and vegetable growers have shuttered plants or dumped products at a time when many Americans are lining up at food banks or facing scarcity at supermarkets.\n\nDelmarva Poultry Industry Inc., which represents plants on the Delmarva Peninsula, a 170-mile-long strip of land shared by Delaware, Maryland and Virginia, announced the plans in a memo to its members on April 9, saying the plant was one of many facing difficulties in meeting production targets.\n\n\"Because of reduced attendance, meat processing companies may need to make the difficult choice to humanely depopulate animals on farms instead of transporting them to plants with reduced processing capacity,\" Holly Porter, the executive director of the organization, said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\n\"One chicken company on Delmarva took this step earlier this month,\" she said.\n\nMs. Porter said the company euthanized nearly 2 million chickens on farms in Delaware and Maryland using methods approved for cases of infectious avian disease.\n\nThere are 1,325 growers and five chicken processing companies on the Delmarva Peninsula that operate a total of 10 processing plants.\n\nMichele Minton, the director of live operations for Allen Harim Foods, told growers in a letter on April 8 that it would be forced to start depopulating chickens on April 10.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As the Lakers and others return small business aid, Mnuchin says big companies could face \"criminal liability.\" Companies want protections against lawsuits by people who claim a business is the source of an infection Under pressure from rank-and-file, House Democratic leaders scrap plans to return to session next week. See more updates Updated 13m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nWorker attendance was at 50 percent, meaning the company was no longer able to harvest the amount of birds needed to meet targets, Ms. Minton said in the letter, which was published by The News Journal of Wilmington, Del., and other local news organizations. She and other company officials could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe news of the Delmarva chicken killings, which The Baltimore Sun reported last week, has highlighted the strains on the food supply chain in the United States as the virus undermines staffing, either through illness or isolation orders.\n\nAs workers get sick, plants and producers are casting around for solutions. Beef and pork processors have closed their plants. Farmers are dumping excess dairy products and plowing unharvested vegetables back into fields or compost.\n\n\"This is just total waste to me,\" Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said at a news briefing on Monday, announcing that the state would purchase dairy products from farmers who had lost important customers as schools, restaurants and hotels have been shuttered.\n\nJohn Tyson, the chairman of Tyson Foods, one of the nation's largest meat processing companies, said illnesses and shutdowns were posing new challenges, and depopulating was one of the symptoms. .\n\n\"Farmers across the nation simply will not have anywhere to sell their livestock to be processed, when they could have fed the nation,\" Mr. Tyson said in a statement that was published in national newspapers, including The New York Times, over the weekend.\n\n\"Millions of animals -- chickens, pigs and cattle -- will be depopulated because of the closure of our processing facilities,\" he said. \"The food supply chain is breaking.\"\n\nIn March, the National Chicken Council said it was not seeing any disruptions in production and that there were ample amounts of surplus chicken in cold storage.\n\nBut nationwide, individual companies are grasping for solutions. Sanderson Farms, a Mississippi-based chicken processor, has explored putting its reduced staff to work packing chicken, but skipping the labor-intensive process of dividing the birds.\n\nDelaware's agriculture secretary, Michael T. Scuse, said in a news release last month that the state's poultry processing industry had a \"vital part\" in upholding the food supply chain in the United States. He said it must remain functioning at full capacity, and he encouraged workers \"to give extraordinary effort in these challenging times.\"\n\nIn her email on Tuesday, Ms. Porter, the executive director of the trade organization, said all of Delmarva's chicken processing plants were open and producing chicken, although many were not operating at full capacity.\n\nAllen Harim has also pivoted to other methods to move products. For weeks, it has been organizing drive-by chicken sales at fire stations and at the Delaware International Speedway, according to fliers posted on the company's Facebook pages and the Delmarva Poultry Farmers Network Facebook group.\n\nCharles Cathell, the president of the US 13 Dragway, which includes part of the speedway, watched as tractor-trailers pulled up on Saturday with cases of chicken parts. Cars had lined up before 6 a.m., he said on Monday. Allen Harim workers, wearing masks, took orders through cracked car windows. The cases were loaded into vehicle trunks at the end of the drag strip.\n\nMr. Cathell said Allen Harim had contacted the speedway, wanting to sell at sites other than fire stations. \"They did it the last couple of weeks with the help not able to show up,\" he said. \"We just thought if we could do a small part, it could help.\"",

        "body": "Parents have hesitated to take children to doctors' offices, but students will have to meet immunization requirements to attend school in the fall.\n\nReopening schools, pre-K and day care centers safely this fall was always going to be a crucial part of resuming normal life in New York City, and a herculean challenge for the nation's largest school system.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mayor Bill de Blasio raised alarms about an unexpected new hurdle: plummeting rates of childhood vaccinations as anxious parents have kept their children home -- and away from doctors' offices.\n\nDuring the height of the pandemic, from March 23 to May 9, the number of vaccine doses administered to children dropped 63 percent compared with the same time last year, and by 91 percent for children older than 2, according to the city health department.\n\nThe city is tentatively planning to reopen its 1,800 public schools in September, along with hundreds of day care sites. But children will not be able to start school and relieve their parents of home schooling and child care duties without shots to protect them against illnesses like measles and chickenpox.\n\nIn a typical year, about 98 percent of the city's public school students are fully vaccinated.\n\n\"The pieces unfortunately start to fit together in a way that should cause parents real concern,\" Mr. de Blasio said in his daily news briefing. Unvaccinated children, he said, could be \"at greater threat of contracting a disease that could then put them at a greater threat of contracting Covid.\"\n\nThat is especially urgent now, since New York is seeing a rare but alarming trend of children falling ill with what is being called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which appears to be related to the coronavirus and can cause serious illness.\n\nBut pediatricians said they were much more concerned about spikes in preventable diseases that can be much more dangerous for children than the coronavirus.\n\n\"We really don't want to have collateral damage of outbreaks of deadly diseases because we are afraid of Covid-19,\" said Dr. Sean T. O'Leary, a pediatric infectious disease specialist in Colorado.\n\nThe city saw last year just how dangerous low vaccination rates can be, when a spike in measles cases concentrated in Hasidic Jewish neighborhoods prompted a public health scramble to tamp down the extremely infectious yet preventable disease.\n\n\"The worst thing that could happen would be to have a measles epidemic after this,\" said Dr. Michel Cohen, who oversees dozens of Tribeca Pediatrics offices in New York City. Once measles starts to spread, Dr. Cohen said, \"it's very hard to curtail.\" Tribeca Pediatrics saw a 40 percent decrease in vaccines administered between late March and mid-May compared with the same period last year.\n\nOther pediatricians said vaccinations are particularly crucial for young children who have not yet had their first round of immunizations.\n\n\"If you don't stay vigilant, you are looking at whooping cough coming back, more cases of preventable infections,\" said Dr. Jason Perlman, a pediatrician and infectious disease specialist who practices in Park Slope and Crown Heights, Brooklyn.\n\nA recent change in state law unrelated to the coronavirus now requires public school families to prove that they are up-to-date with immunizations within 14 days of the first day of school. The city is preparing to implement that practice this fall.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Reopening begins in Connecticut. Religious services with up to 10 people can resume in N.Y. Beware of fake contact tracers, N.J. officials warn. See more updates Updated 3h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nBecause children require different vaccinations and boosters at different ages, students in kindergarten through high school have separate requirements from toddlers enrolling in licensed day care centers. But the city requires proof of at least some immunizations for children of all ages in all of the centers and schools it oversees.\n\nVaccination rates have fallen dramatically across the country because of the closures of many practices, as well as fears of taking healthy children to doctors' offices during the pandemic, though the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that parents continue \"well visits\" that include vaccinations.\n\nIn a survey in April, PCC, a pediatric electronic health records company, found that vaccine doses had fallen between 40 and 73 percent for a range of preventable illnesses.\n\nDr. O'Leary said that doctors across the country are just beginning to see families come back to their offices for well visits and shots -- and not a moment too soon.\n\n\"Most states are still planning on enforcing vaccination requirements for schools,\" he said. \"It would be better to get them now than to wait for August. If school does start up in August and September, you may have trouble getting into your pediatrician's office.\"\n\nDr. Perlman, who has kept his practice open for both well and sick visits, said he ensured that his office is as safe as possible for his staff and families.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\n\"We don't want people being scared of us, we are here for them,\" he said.\n\nBut with many doctors' offices closed, some New York parents say they have been struggling to schedule vaccinations for months.\n\nLindsey Reynolds had a standing appointment for her 16-month-old daughter to receive vaccinations in early April and was planning to bring her child in despite the pandemic.\n\nThen she got an email notifying her that her appointment had been canceled, and Ms. Reynolds spent the next few weeks trying to reschedule the visit before finally getting her daughter vaccinated.\n\n\"I think everyone is just confused right now,\" Ms. Reynolds said.\n\nOver the last few weeks, Nechama Levy has tried and failed to make appointments for a well visit and vaccinations with two pediatricians in her Brooklyn neighborhood for her 6-month-old son.\n\n\"I am getting nervous because I don't know how long this will go on,\" she said. Ms. Levy is an essential worker and sends her son to day care each day, but is worried that he might catch a preventable contagious disease there.\n\nPediatricians agreed that delays are most dangerous for infants and young children who are supposed to be getting their first series of vaccinations. Delays in vaccinations and boosters for school-aged children could be less worrying as long as they are rescheduled soon and not put off indefinitely.\n\nAs New York City emerges from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, doctors are imploring families to leave their homes and come back to their offices.\n\nMichael Rothschild, a pediatric ear, nose and throat doctor in Manhattan, said visits to his practice have dropped by 90 percent. Though he does not administer vaccines himself, he has been asking parents via telemedicine whether they have kept up with their child's vaccine schedule.\n\n\"You'd think with this pandemic showing you exactly how awful it is not to have a vaccine, people would get vaccines,\" he said.",

The bulletin said the health authorities in the city knew of 15 such cases, involving patients age 2 to 15, who have been in intensive care units since April 17.\n\nThe symptoms, which have been noted in a small but growing number of children infected with Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus, appear to target the heart and coronary arteries of children infected with the disease. Doctors say the symptom has sent children into a kind of toxic shock as their blood pressure plummets, and their heart fails to send enough blood to their vital organs.\n\nThe bizarre symptoms bear some resemblance to Kawasaki syndrome, a separate disease that can cause sudden inflammation of the heart and cause coronary blockages in children.\n\nDoctors say the inflammatory condition does not seem to be driven by Covid-19's attack of the lungs, a hallmark of the coronavirus infection in adults. Instead, in children who present with the inflammatory syndrome, the virus appears to be attacking their heart.\n\nThe number of children in the United States showing signs of this new syndrome, first was detected in Europe last month, is still small, although no solid data yet exists on the exact number of cases.",

        "body": "No children are known to have died so far, but several have ended up in intensive care with mysterious symptoms that include enlarged coronary arteries.\n\nOne child, 8 years old, arrived at a Long Island hospital near death last week. His brother, a boy scout, had begun performing chest compressions before the ambulance crew arrived.\n\nIn the past two days alone, the hospital, Cohen Children's Medical Center, has admitted five critically ill patients -- ages 4 to 12 -- with an unusual sickness that appears to be somehow linked to Covid-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. In total, about 25 similarly ill children have been admitted there in recent weeks with symptoms ranging from reddened tongues to enlarged coronary arteries.\n\nSince the coronavirus pandemic began, most infected children have not developed serious respiratory failure of the kind that has afflicted adults. But in recent weeks, a mysterious new syndrome has cropped up among children in Long Island, New York City and other hot spots around the country, in an indication that the risk to children may be greater than anticipated.\n\nThe number of children in the United States showing signs of this new syndrome -- which first was detected in Europe last month -- is still small, and none is known to have died.\n\n\"This is really only a disease that has been clear for two weeks now, so there is so much we're trying to learn about this,\" the chief of pediatric critical care at Cohen Children's, Dr. James Schneider, said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nNo solid data yet exists about how many children in the United States have fallen ill with what doctors are calling \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\"\n\nIn some patients the syndrome seems to match a rare childhood illness called Kawasaki disease, which can lead to inflammation of the blood vessels, especially the coronary arteries.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York More than 1,600 previously undisclosed deaths were reported at nursing homes in N.Y. An Amazon worker on Staten Island has died of coronavirus complications. 15 children are hospitalized with a mysterious illness that may be linked to the virus. See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nThe symptoms of Kawasaki disease often start with a fever and a rash, but when undiagnosed and untreated, the illness can lead to serious heart conditions, such as coronary aneurysms. The disease, which generally afflicts patients 6 months to about 6 years old, is considered rare in the United States.\n\nWhile some patients in recent weeks have presented as if they had classic Kawasaki disease, others have been far more seriously ill, with falling blood pressure, heart inflammation and symptoms consistent with toxic shock, said Dr. Nadine Choueiter of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx.\n\nDr. Steven Kernie, chief of pediatric critical care medicine at Columbia University and NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, which has treated between 10 and 20 children with the condition, said it was important to distinguish between this coronavirus-related condition and Kawasaki disease.\n\nWhile some of the symptoms are similar, Dr. Kernie said, including fever, abdominal pain and sometimes a raised rash, there appear to be differences in how the coronavirus-related condition affects the heart.\n\nWhile shock is a rare complication of Kawasaki disease, in the recent wave of coronavirus-related cases, he said, many of the children are in shock with very low blood pressure and an inability of the blood to effectively circulate oxygen and nutrients to the body's organs.\n\nOn Monday night, the New York City Health Department issued a bulletin, asking doctors to report any cases of the syndrome. The bulletin said the health authorities in the city knew of 15 such cases, involving patients age 2 to 15, who had been in intensive care units since April 17.\n\nBut based on interviews with doctors, the number of cases in the city appears to be higher than 15.\n\n\"I would say so far we have seen 13 patients,\" Dr. Choueiter said of the number of children treated for the syndrome at just her hospital.\n\nStill, doctors were reluctant to speculate how widespread it might be across the city. \"That is the question we are constantly thinking about, and I don't think we know the answer,\" Dr. Choueiter said.\n\nIn Richmond Hill, Queens, Jayden Hardowar, 8, initially had only a mild fever, starting on April 23, his father, Roup Hardowar, said.\n\nBut several days later, Jayden started to grow very weak and listless. On April 29, he was lying in bed watching a Pokemon TV episode. \"Mommy,\" he cried out, before he stopped breathing. His face started turning purple. His 15-year-old brother, a boy scout, began performing chest compressions, stopping only when the ambulance arrived, his father said.\n\nAt Cohen's Hospital, in New Hyde Park, Jayden was put on a mechanical ventilator for three days before he began to improve. Although Jayden tested negative for the coronavirus, he tested positive for antibodies, suggesting he might have been infected with the virus in recent weeks or months, his father said.\n\nIn recent days, Jayden has begun to open his eyes and smile or cry at his parents during video chats arranged by a nurse. \"Last night he said, 'I love you, Mommy,' his father recounted on Tuesday.\n\nJayden is one of 11 children in the intensive care unit at Cohen Children's deemed to have the syndrome, doctors there said.\n\nSimilar cases are appearing elsewhere in the country, too.\n\nJuliet Daly, a healthy 12-year-old from Covington, La., woke up on April 3 with such sharp pains in her stomach that she had trouble moving. \"I spent one hour in bed trying, attempting to get up, and I spent half an hour going down the stairs,\" Juliet said in an interview on Tuesday.\n\nOver the weekend, she had a fever, and, she said, \"I couldn't eat and I couldn't drink because I vomited everything up.\" By Monday, \"my arms were cold and my lips were blue,\" she said.\n\nShe was so lethargic that \"she kind of fell asleep in the bath,\" said her father, Sean Daly.\n\nThe family took Juliet to a nearby hospital, where they were told that she was experiencing an acute form of heart inflammation called fulminant myocarditis. Her heart rate was very low, and her heart was failing to pump blood.\n\nThe hospital decided to put Juliet on a ventilator and airlifted her to a medical center in New Orleans, about 40 miles south. During the intubation procedure, her heart stopped, and \"she went into arrest for a little under two minutes,\" Mr. Daly said. Later, on the helicopter, her heart stopped again and she needed to be revived by C.P.R., he said.\n\nAfter nine days in the hospital, she returned home to her parents and two brothers. \"I was able to walk around, but I was still wobbly,\" she said. Now, Juliet, who likes to bike and do artwork, is feeling healthy.\n\nDoctors in New York have noted that cases of the new syndrome began to appear a month or so after a surge of Covid-19 in the region. That timing suggests \"it's a post-infectious immune response to this,\" said Dr. Leonard Krilov, chairman of pediatrics at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.\n\nEarly research suggests that children are significantly less likely to become seriously ill with Covid-19 than adults. In New York City there have been 13,724 deaths of laboratory-confirmed Covid patients. Six have been 17 years old or younger, and all had underlying health conditions, according to city data.\n\nDoctors say that even though there is growing evidence that some healthy children are falling gravely ill with this new syndrome, they are still at far less risk from Covid-19 than adults.\n\n\"It's just a different disease in adults,\" said Dr. Jennifer Lighter, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at NYU Langone, who treated one pediatric patient with the syndrome last week. Of the new syndrome, she said, \"It is very, very rare, and the children have been doing OK for the most part.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nMichael Nuzum had spent weeks fighting coronavirus-like symptoms -- a wracking cough, terrible chills, an exhausting fever -- before collapsing at his home in rural West Virginia.\n\nMr. Nuzum, a 54-year-old animal control worker, was already in cardiac arrest when the emergency workers arrived on April 3. That left them with a difficult decision: Should they transport their patient to the nearest hospital, 30 minutes away?\n\n\"There's only so much one paramedic can do in the back of an ambulance,\" said Michael Angelucci, who leads the Marion County rescue squad that cared for Mr. Nuzum. The two-person team that responded decided it couldn't risk the long ride and instead tried to revive the patient at the scene. But the workers couldn't save him.\n\nTwo weeks earlier, the options would have been different. Fairmont Regional Medical Center, just five minutes from Mr. Nuzum's home, would still have been open. Mr. Angelucci, who is also a state representative, can't help wondering if the hospital and its emergency room could have given the man a fighting chance.\n\n\"It's incredibly frustrating that this entire community is stranded without a hospital,\" he said.\n\nFairmont was one of three hospitals that have shut down in this corner of rural West Virginia and Ohio since September. They delivered hundreds of babies each year, treated car crash and gunshot victims, repaired hearts and knees and offered addiction treatment and psychiatric care.\n\nThey had been acquired by a for-profit company, Alecto Healthcare Services, beginning in 2014. Employees expected the new ownership to put the institutions on solid footing after years of financial struggle. Instead, decisions made by Alecto wound up undercutting patient care and undermining the hospitals' finances, according to more than two dozen interviews with doctors, nurses, other staff members, government officials and patients, as well as a review of court records.\n\nDoctors were fired to save on salaries; many patients followed them elsewhere. Medical supplies ran short. Vendors went unpaid. Finally, one after another, the three hospitals ceased operating. At the request of the governor, the West Virginia attorney general's office is investigating the company's decision to close them.\n\nThe shutdowns -- besides Fairmont, Alecto owned Ohio Valley Medical Center in Wheeling, W.Va., and East Ohio Regional Hospital in neighboring Martins Ferry, Ohio -- have forced the region to fight a coronavirus outbreak with 530 fewer licensed hospital beds than it had a year ago.\n\nThe counties they serve have already recorded 171 coronavirus cases and nine deaths. Hundreds of people whose lungs were scarred by decades in coal mines are vulnerable to a devastating respiratory syndrome caused by the virus, doctors said.\n\n\"We've now got a hospital that existed for over 100 years that, in the middle of a pandemic, sits empty,\" said Jonathan Board, chairman of the Marion County Chamber of Commerce's board of directors, referring to Fairmont.\n\nDr. John Wolen, the former trauma chief at Ohio Valley, now works at Wheeling Hospital and is bracing for an influx of patients. \"The extra capacity that we will absolutely need is not going to be there,\" he said.\n\nAcross the United States, hospitals serving rural areas have spent decades trying to provide medical care and produce enough revenue to stay open. They have closed in increasing numbers in recent years as local populations have declined. About 170 rural hospitals have shut down since 2005.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump says daily briefings are not worth the effort, as the White House considers firing the health secretary. Some states are moving to reopen. But the path ahead is far from simple. The U.S. conducted 1.2 million tests in a week, but experts say that is not enough. See more updates Updated 6h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nSome nonprofit or community-owned hospitals, like the three Alecto had bought in West Virginia and Ohio, turn to for-profit hospital chains as a lifeline, hoping that a focus on generating revenue could help them survive.\n\nBut for-profit hospitals are more likely to close than the others, one recent federal study showed. It found that for-profit facilities accounted for 11 percent of rural hospitals but 36 percent of closures among the group. Within the past year, rural hospitals have closed in Pennsylvania and Tennessee after selling to for-profit chains.\n\n\"There is something very concerning to me about having more for-profit companies in rural health care,\" said Jill Horwitz, vice dean at the University of California, Los Angeles, law school. \"The more rural a hospital, the more people depend on it for lifesaving care.\"\n\nMs. Horwitz's research found that for-profit rural hospitals were less likely to offer needed but unprofitable medical services, such as hospice and inpatient psychiatric care.\n\n\"The goal of the for-profit is to make money,\" Ms. Horwitz said. \"That doesn't mean they'll do anything to make a buck, but they have a different goal from nonprofits.\"\n\nMichael Sarrao, Alecto's general counsel, said the company had done everything it could to turn the three hospitals around but ultimately found the financial challenges insurmountable. Slow reimbursements by health insurers and cuts to Medicare reimbursement rates were factors, he said.\n\nHe contended that the institutions would have closed years ago had Alecto not purchased them, and that the company lost tens of millions of dollars investing in the facilities.\n\n\"Alecto has and continues to be focused on saving distressed community hospitals so that they can continue to provide care to the patients who need their care the most and has done its best to achieve this goal,\" Mr. Sarrao said in a statement.\n\nAlecto's chief executive, Lex Reddy, worked for more than a decade at a larger hospital chain, Prime Healthcare. He stepped down as Prime's chief executive in 2012, during a federal investigation that would result in a $65 million fine by the Justice Department to settle allegations that the company had falsely submitted Medicare claims. The settlement did not make a determination of wrongdoing.\n\nMr. Reddy, who was not implicated in the scandal and declined through a spokesman to be interviewed for this article, helped found Alecto the same year he left Prime.\n\nAlecto purchased Fairmont Regional Medical Center while it was in bankruptcy in 2014, and bought the larger Ohio Valley Medical Center and East Ohio Regional Hospital in 2017. The acquisitions expanded Alecto's reach across the country, from the four hospitals it already owned or managed in California and Texas.\n\nAlecto's hospitals generally serve low-income communities, with most patients covered by Medicare or Medicaid. In Marion County, for example, the population once served by Fairmont has higher-than-average smoking and obesity rates. The state also had the country's highest rate of drug overdose deaths in 2018.\n\nStaff members recalled initially feeling optimistic about the new owners.\n\n\"We were in very bad straits,\" said Martha Connors, who was a mental health technician at Ohio Valley for 13 years. \"We fought to have Alecto buy us because no one else wanted to.\"\n\nThat hope quickly evaporated as the quality of care at the hospitals began to decline, employees recalled. At Fairmont, with 207 licensed beds, and Ohio Valley hospital, with 200, employees said Alecto let staff physicians go, a decision they described as shortsighted. While Alecto may have saved on salaries, the hospitals lost many elective surgeries -- a critical revenue generator.\n\n\"We went from having about 40 doctors on staff at the hospital to about a dozen in the course of six months,\" said Dr. Waid McMillion, who ran Fairmont's emergency department until it closed. The hospital replaced only a portion of them with contract physicians, who did not bring in nearly as many patients or surgeries.\n\nTwo surgeons at Ohio Valley recalled arriving each morning in 2018 to find the surgical scheduling board almost blank. Dr. Joseph Petersen, a surgeon there, said patients had to be moved to other hospitals farther from their homes because there weren't enough staff members to care for them. \"It was very disruptive for patient care and for their families,\" he said.\n\nDr. Wolen, of Ohio Valley, said the hospital lost its status as a level-two trauma center -- requiring it to transfer some seriously injured patients to other hospitals -- in part because it no longer had a full-time plastic surgeon and a full-time neurosurgeon.\n\nWith fewer patients bringing in less revenue, staff members noticed regular supply shortages that affected care. Two employees at East Ohio recalled three days in 2018 when the intensive care unit had to bring some ventilator patients out of medically induced comas because it was running short of sedatives like fentanyl and hydromorphone.\n\nWhen such patients wake up, they often try to pull out their breathing tubes, said Joyce Younkins, who worked as an I.C.U. nurse there. During that stretch, staff members had to put restraints on the distressed patients. \"It's not something you ever want to have to see,\" she said.\n\nIn her six years at the hospital before Alecto took over, Ms. Younkins and others said, nothing similar ever happened. \"There was never a lack of supplies, never a lack of anything we needed,\" she said. \"Under Alecto, you had to worry about having enough IV bags, needles, syringes, salines, drugs, even toilet paper.\"\n\nOne health care technician recalled buying toothpaste and feminine hygiene supplies for patients when the hospital ran out. Another said he purchased a roll of ultrasound film off eBay for $63.\n\n\"Everybody wants a picture of their baby when they come for an ultrasound,\" said Paul Porter, the ultrasound technician. \"I hated having to tell them I can't give you a picture today.\"\n\nAlecto also at times fell behind on payments for employees' health insurance, so their coverage lapsed, according to multiple former staff members.\n\nAnd Jeremy Wendel, who worked as a registrar in the Ohio Valley and East Ohio emergency rooms, said that Alecto was deducting his $550 child support payment from his paycheck but not passing the money on to the state. It took two months to resolve the situation, he said. \"It felt like they were stealing from me,\" he recalled. \"I was paying this money, but they weren't sending it to my ex, so where was it going?\"\n\nMr. Sarrao of Alecto conceded that while there \"may have been some administrative issues at O.V.M.C. that caused some delays in payment, these issues have been resolved and payments reached their correct destination.\"\n\nLawsuits against Alecto seeking unpaid bills piled up. Xerox filed a case in August 2019, claiming the company owed more than $500,000. The lawsuit is pending. PatientMatters, a medical debt collection firm, sued weeks later, similarly claiming a large debt. That case was later resolved.\n\nHospital workers traded whispers, wondering if their employers would soon close shop and worrying what would happen to their patients.\n\nLast September, Alecto closed the Ohio Valley hospital. It happened so suddenly that one longtime employee learned he no longer had a job while checking Facebook. Three weeks later, East Ohio closed.\n\nAt Fairmont, many feared they would be next. Alecto shut the doors on March 19, despite local leaders' pleas that the hospital should stay open to weather the pandemic.\n\nThe closures have left 1,800 people seeking work in a struggling economy and local governments fighting to recoup Alecto's unpaid taxes.\n\nWheeling is currently trying to collect $821,000 its mayor says Alecto owes the city, including $425,000 in parking fees and $140,000 in water and sewer fees. Martins Ferry is trying to recoup more than $200,000 in local income taxes, according to the city auditor. S.E.I.U. District 1199, the union representing Fairmont workers, is still pursuing retirement fund contributions that were never paid.\n\nWith the hospitals closed, some former patients have struggled to find new providers.\n\nJoyce Faber, 60, who is confined to a wheelchair, hasn't been able to see a gynecologist since last year. A survivor of breast cancer, she takes drugs that put her at a higher risk of ovarian cancer. She used to have regular gynecology appointments at Ohio Valley, which had a special table that allowed Ms. Faber, who is paralyzed, to be examined. She has been unable to find a nearby hospital with similar equipment.\n\nHeidi Porter recently had to bring her elderly mother, who has bipolar disorder and experiences hallucinations, into Wheeling Hospital. With no psychiatric beds available there -- Ohio Valley had operated the county's only unit -- she was transferred to a facility two hours away in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWest Virginia University's health system, about 12 miles from Fairmont, plans to reopen part of the Fairmont hospital but will not be able to do so until late May.\n\nFor now, the three communities face a stretch of months where hospital beds could be scarce in the midst of a global pandemic. Jennifer Henderson Hayes, who was the chief pharmacist at East Ohio, now works at the remaining hospital in Wheeling.\n\nShe has already seen greater strain on the emergency room there. \"You see people, potentially sick with Covid-19, waiting for eight or 12 hours just to be seen.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nTwo new studies using antibody tests to assess how many people have been infected with the coronavirus have turned up numbers higher than some experts had expected.\n\nBoth studies were performed in California: one among residents of Santa Clara County, south of San Francisco, and the other among residents of Los Angeles County. In both cases, the estimates of the number of people infected in those counties were far higher than the number of confirmed cases.\n\nThe studies, conducted by public health officials and scientists at Stanford University and the University of Southern California, have earned the ire of critics who questioned both the recruitment methods and the analyses.\n\nIn the Santa Clara County study, researchers tested 3,330 volunteers for antibodies indicating exposure to the virus. Roughly 1.5 percent were positive.\n\nAfter adjustments intended to account for differences between the sample and the population of the county as a whole, the researchers estimated that the prevalence of antibodies was between 2.5 percent and a bit more than 4 percent. The county's population is 1.9 million.\n\nThat means that 48,000 to 81,000 people were infected with the coronavirus in Santa Clara County by early April, the investigators concluded.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, researchers conducted tests at drive-through sites and at participants' homes and estimated that 2.8 percent to 5.6 percent of the county's adult population carried antibodies to the coronavirus. There are 10.4 million people in Los Angeles County.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Congress reaches a deal with the White House on a relief package.

By comparison, only 8,000 cases had been confirmed in the county by early April, when the testing was done.\n\nWhile finding volunteers was not difficult, it's not clear how representative they were of the populations at large.\n\nTo find participants in the Los Angeles County study, researchers used a random sample of email addresses and telephone numbers of residents to invite people to participate in what they said would be a Covid-19 survey.\n\nThe scientists set limits on participation, based on factors like ethnicity and age, in an effort to ensure the sample represented the county's population. About 1,100 people signed up to be tested.\n\nThe study in Santa Clara County found participants by advertising on Facebook. Most of the first volunteers were in wealthy ZIP codes, so the investigators also recruited from poorer areas. As in the Los Angeles County study, the goal was to get a representative sample of the population.\n\n\"It's not perfect, but it's the best science can do,\" said Dr. John Ioannidis, a professor of medicine at Stanford University and an author of the Santa Clara County report.\n\nAntibody studies in other countries have produced similar figures, he noted.\n\nIf the numbers prove accurate, the coronavirus may be much less deadly than originally expected, with a fatality rate more closely resembling that of a seasonal flu strain than a pandemic of profound lethality.\n\nBut there are questions about who was tested. Among them: Were people who had reason to think they had been infected overrepresented among the volunteers?\n\n\"We tried to look into the possibility of bias influencing the results,\" Dr. Ioannidis said. \"We asked for symptoms recently and in the last few months, and were very careful with our adjustments. We did a very lengthy set of analyses.\"\n\nThat data will be published in a forthcoming appendix, he said. In any event, bias also can work to lower the numbers if the healthiest people were the ones inclined to be tested, a real possibility.\n\n\"Nobody knows the truth -- let's be honest,\" Dr. Ioannidis said of the prevalence figures. \"But if I had to guess, I would say it is probably higher than our estimate.\"\n\nMany widely available antibody tests have been found to be inaccurate. The investigators say they validated the accuracy of the tests they used beforehand, and argue that the tests could not be so much in error as to invalidate the conclusions.\n\nFor vulnerable people, like those in nursing homes, the virus obviously is a terrible threat. But the new data suggest most adults will experience milder to asymptomatic infections.\n\n\"This is very consistent with the fact that the virus is very common but not killing at the rate we thought,\" Dr. Ioannidis said.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nLittle is known about the transmissibility of the virus by asymptomatic adults, however. That may complicate scientific understanding of the virus's spread.\n\nWith better estimates of the virus's prevalence and lethality, it may be easier to reopen society in a manner supported by data, said Neeraj Sood, vice dean of research at the University of Southern California Price School of Public Policy and an author of the Los Angeles County report.\n\n\"We can model the scenarios,\" he said. \"We should not make decisions just based on I.C.U. mortality.\"",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Temperatures in Phoenix are expected to hit 105 this week. Sacramento has already broken heat records recently, as have Galveston, Tex., Salt Lake City and Fort Myers, Fla.\n\nBut the usual strategy that cities rely upon to protect the most vulnerable from the heat -- encouraging people to gather and cool down in public buildings like libraries or recreation centers -- doesn't work in an era of the coronavirus and social distancing. So cities across the country are rushing to test other ideas.\n\nIn Phoenix, officials plan to start renting hotel rooms to help homeless people stay out of the heat. New York City is looking to help residents pay their electricity bills, in order to make air-conditioning more affordable.\n\nOthers are considering handing out free air-conditioners to people whose homes lack them. And in Austin, Tex., officials may soon be dispatching fleets of air-conditioned city buses to serve as cooling centers in neighborhoods where the need for relief is greatest.\n\n\"They could sit on there throughout the day,\" said Chris Crookham, the city's public health emergency preparedness manager. Of course, given the requirements of social distancing, \"we would definitely not be able to fill up the bus.\"\n\nNot only has the Covid-19 crisis made gathering dangerous, public health and emergency management officials point out, but on top of that the very people most vulnerable to heat-related illnesses -- the elderly or chronically ill -- also tend to be most vulnerable to the virus. Last year was the second hottest on record, and climate change is intensifying heat waves around the world.\n\nThere are two basic ways to help people stay cool when temperatures soar, said Vivek Shandas, a professor of urban studies and planning at Portland State University. The first is making it safer for people to stay in their homes; the second is giving them somewhere to go if they can't.\n\nTo keep people safe at home, New York City is looking at expanding its \"Be a Buddy\" program, which encourages people to call or text with friends and neighbors -- but refrain from showing up in person -- to see if they're suffering from the heat, said Carolyn Olson, assistant commissioner at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. That's in addition to the city's idea to help more people pay for electricity this summer so that they can use air-conditioning and not fear a crushing bill.\n\nOther cities are considering doing the same. And for people who still struggle to pay, some places have temporarily blocked power companies from cutting off electricity.\n\nBut those ideas only work for people who have air-conditioners in the first place. Richmond, Va., is looking at requesting revisions to a state-run program that provides air-conditioners to people in need, according to Alicia Zatcoff, the city's sustainability manager.\n\nBut experts warned that steps like these won't go far enough because the problem is so big. In New York City, for example, 10 percent of households lack air-conditioning, and that number rises to as much as 30 percent in poorer communities, Ms. Olson said. Even in cities in the South, where air-conditioning is more common, homes in coastal areas often lack it, as do many public housing units.\n\nAs a result, many people will still need other places to cool off, officials said. In response, many cities are being forced to rethink what cooling centers can look like.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Aram Sahakian, director of the city's emergency management department, is trying to make cooling centers as virus-proof as possible.\n\nWhen temperatures hit the low 90s at the end of April, Mr. Sahakian's office opened five cooling centers, but under strict conditions: Anyone trying to get in had their temperature taken. People were then given masks, which they had to wear at all times, as well as gloves and sanitizer. And security staff made sure people stayed at least six feet apart.\n\n\"We wanted to test the system,\" Mr. Sahakian said. \"The Department of Public Health feels comfortable that we should be OK.\"\n\nIn Jackson, Miss., officials will gauge the risks of opening cooling centers based in part on how aggressively the virus is spreading at the time, according to Robert Blaine, the city's chief administrative officer.\n\nTo measure that spread, the city has invited residents to go to a website and log their symptoms. It's even working with a company to train an artificial intelligence program to identify, just from the sound of somebody coughing into the phone, the odds that the person has Covid-19. It creates a map showing where people with symptoms may be clustered in the city, Dr. Blaine said. \"We're trying to be very careful about how we look at the data.\"\n\nIn Harris County, which includes Houston, officials are thinking bigger.\n\nThe county is looking at using some of the large sports venues and convention centers that are now sitting vacant, said Francisco Sanchez, the county's deputy emergency management coordinator. That could include NRG Park, he said, the sports complex that's home to the building formerly known as the Astrodome.\n\nIn Richmond, Va., officials are asking whether cooling requires a building at all.\n\nThe city has worked to map which neighborhoods have the greatest exposure to heat waves, according to Ms. Zatcoff, the sustainability manager. Now it's comparing those maps with areas with the highest proportions of people most vulnerable to the virus, such as the elderly or poor, or minority communities.\n\nThe places with the greatest overlap tend to have few parks or other open spaces, according to Jeremy Hoffman, chief scientist at the Science Museum of Virginia, who is working with Richmond on its heat strategy. So the city is looking at a turning some streets into impromptu social spaces, particularly for use in the evenings when temperatures outdoors can be lower than inside homes without air-conditioning.It wouldn't be a cooling center, strictly speaking: There wouldn't be tents with air conditioning. But blocking off streets from traffic gives people room to get outside while still maintaining social distancing, Dr. Hoffman said.\n\n\"Instead of closing down the small amount of space that we have for recreation, let's expand that space where we don't have a lot of car traffic,\" Dr. Hoffman said.\n\nIn Phoenix, which has both a large number of homeless people and a rising number of heat-related deaths each year, officials are using federal money to rent out hotel rooms for months or longer, according to Tamra Ingersoll, a city spokeswoman. The goal is to use those hotel rooms to protect people from both the virus and heat waves.\n\nThe city was still finalizing the details, Ms. Ingersoll said, and didn't yet know how many rooms would be available. She said the city planned to obtain \"as many as we can with the money we have.\"\n\nLisa Glow, chief executive at Central Arizona Shelter Services, which has had to cut the number of people it can house to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus, praised the city's response. She said officials told her they were planning to book 95 hotel rooms. For those lucky enough to get one, she said, \"we will be able to keep them safe now and all summer.\"\n\nThe problem, she added, is what happens to everyone else.\n\nThe latest count of homelessness in Phoenix, taken in January, showed almost 4,000 people were sleeping without shelter. And she said she expected the economic crash to push more people into the streets.\n\n\"It won't solve the problem entirely,\" Ms. Glow said of the city's plan. \"Is it enough, is really the question.\"",

        "body": "One sick singer attended choir practice, infecting 53 others, two of whom died. A study released by the C.D.C. shows that self-isolation and tracing efforts helped contain the outbreak.\n\nIt was a chilly evening in Mount Vernon, Wash., on March 10, when a group of singers met for choir practice at their church, just as they did most Tuesday nights.\n\nThe full choir consists of 122 singers, but only 61 made it that night, including one who had been fighting cold-like symptoms for a few days.\n\nThat person later tested positive for the coronavirus, and within two days of the practice, six more members of the choir had developed a fever. Ultimately, 53 members of the choir became ill with Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, and two of them died.\n\nThe event, which was first reported by The Los Angeles Times in March, demonstrated how contagious and dangerous the coronavirus is, especially among older populations. The median age for those attending the practice that night was 69.\n\nA study since then has showed that swift action by the members of the choir, including voluntary isolation, along with contact tracing by the Skagit County health department, helped contain the spread and prevent what could have been a much larger outbreak in that community, about an hour's drive north of Seattle.\n\nAlthough the virus spread quickly and thoroughly within the choir, it did not result in a significant increase in the infection rate of the community at large.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Top health experts testify that the U.S. is not 'out of the woods' and warn against reopening too fast. The California State University system will not hold classes on campuses this fall. Testing becomes a flash point in the Senate hearing. See more updates Updated 14m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"If they hadn't initiated their own isolation and quarantine before we got involved, you can conceive of a situation where every one of those people would have infected another three people each,\" said Dr. Howard Leibrand, the Skagit County health officer. \"You would have had a huge change in our viral curve based on this one episode.\"\n\nAs communities around the world begin to look at ways to ease restrictions on movement and gathering, as well as reopen their businesses and houses of worship, reports like this one raise clear warnings about the dangers posed when a large number of people gather indoors during an outbreak. That is especially the case for activities like singing that can spur transmission.\n\nDr. Leibrand and Dr. Lea Hamner, a communicable disease and epidemiology supervisor in Skagit County, conducted the investigation into the choir outbreak and were the authors of the report, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released on Tuesday.\n\nThey labeled the choir practice a point-source exposure and said very few such events had been so clearly isolated as this one, making it a helpful study of how the virus spreads.\n\n\"It's rare to have a group with a single common exposure,\" Dr. Hamner said. \"Here, we have a defined group, and they all had a similar exposure for a similar amount of time, so we are able to really understand transmission a little bit better with that kind of event.\"\n\nWhat made the choir practice so fertile for transmission was most likely the very act of singing, in which people projecting their voices at loud volume are prone to emit tiny droplets known as aerosols that can carry the virus. It is a phenomenon familiar to anyone who has sat close to the stage during a play or a musical performance.\n\n\"When you project your voice, you can project more virus,\" Dr. Leibrand said. \"So it seems like this would be a pretty good indicator we shouldn't be going back to large groups singing in an enclosed space, i.e., church, because that would be the same sort of situation as this.\"\n\nSome people in the Skagit County choir may even have been what the report calls super-emitters -- people who release more particles than others during speech.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the total number of cases in Skagit County was 406, according to the Washington Department of Public Health.\n\nPia MacDonald, an infectious disease epidemiologist for RTI International, who was not part of the study, said it was remarkable that the outbreak in the choir did not lead to more infections in the community at large, especially considering the cases were not confirmed until six days after the practice.\n\n\"You still have a number of days there where people could have been walking around in close contact with other people,\" she said.\n\nThe practice took place from 6:30 to 9 p.m., and for much of it the choir members sat in a large room in assigned seats, correlating to how they would sit during a performance. The seats were packed together, six to 10 inches apart, far closer than the minimum six-foot recommendation by the C.D.C. during the pandemic.\n\nBecause only about half the members of the choir were present, many sat next to empty seats. But later they broke off into separate groups, and cookies and oranges were served during a break in the back of the room.\n\nWhen the practice was over, several members helped to put the chairs away, and this contact with surfaces may also have contributed to transmission.\n\nWeeks earlier, Washington reported its first coronavirus case, connected to a traveler from Wuhan, China, where the disease outbreak began, but awareness of the coronavirus in many parts of Washington and the United States was still in its early stages on March 10.\n\nDr. Hamner and Dr. Leibrand said that on March 15, the choir director sent an email to everyone in the choir reporting that six people had become ill. They said that from that point forward, the members of the choir were diligent about remaining isolated.\n\nThree days later, they began working with the Skagit County health department, which initiated its investigation and began doing contact tracing. The doctors said the choir members were forthcoming and extremely helpful, not only with maintaining self-quarantine, but also with providing useful information that aided the investigation.\n\n\"They were the ideal group to do disease investigation with,\" Dr. Hamner said. \"I've done disease investigations for five years now, and that was a really nice relationship.\"",

It was a possibility even veteran industry experts did not foresee.\n\nCoronavirus Map: Tracking the Global Outbreak\n\nThe virus has infected more than 2,661,000 people in at least 177 countries.\n\n\"No one imagined a crisis of this scope,\" said Daniel Yergin, an expert on global energy and vice chairman of IHS Markit, a research firm. \"This was in no scenario.\"\n\nIn the United States, where one benchmark oil price fell below zero this week for the first time on record -- meaning sellers had to pay customers to take oil off their hands -- the glut is threatening severe economic pain in what had been a thriving domestic industry. The oversupply also has forced the Trump administration to negotiate with Russia and Saudi Arabia to curtail production.\n\n\"The idea that we are energy dominant or independent is a fallacy,\" said Jason Bordoff, a professor at Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs and founding director of its Center on Global Energy Policy. The global market's effect on the United States, he said, has \"revealed that when oil prices rise, we feel the pain, and when oil prices collapse, we need to call Moscow and Riyadh to do something about it.\"\n\nThe E.U. gave Poland and Hungary billions in aid as they undermined democracy.\n\nThe increasingly autocratic governments of Poland and Hungary are using the pandemic to consolidate power and punish opponents, while the European Union, though critical, has not intervened.\n\nIn fact, the bloc is helping them with emergency aid intended to fight the coronavirus, funneling the money to member countries with little oversight, and without tying the money to the rule of law or democratic values. The funds were distributed under a formula that sent far more to Hungary and Poland than to virus-ravaged Spain or Italy.\n\nHungary's Parliament has granted Prime Minister Viktor Orban emergency powers to deal with the crisis -- powers he is using to divert tax receipts from opposition mayors and direct them to his allies.\n\nPoland's government says it will proceed with a presidential election on May 10, despite a lockdown that prevents opposition candidates from campaigning effectively. It plans to have all ballots cast by mail, which the postal union says is unworkable.\n\nWhile the virus diverts attention, the governing Law and Justice Party is also trying once again to alter Poland's court system, giving the government control of the judiciary, despite repeated rebukes from the European Union.\n\nOn Friday, the European Parliament passed a resolution criticizing the Polish and Hungarian actions as \"totally incompatible with European values.\" But Brussels has not penalized them, nor is it expected to.\n\nLast month, the European Union hastily earmarked 37 billion euros, about $40 billion, for virus aid, repurposing funds designed primarily to help newer and poorer member countries.\n\nAccording to the European Stability Initiative, a research institute, Hungary and Poland, with a combined population of 48 million and fewer than 700 confirmed Covid-19 deaths, received 13 billion euros. Italy and Spain, with 107 million people and more than 46,000 deaths, received half as much.\n\nThe pandemic offers Taiwan a chance to push back against China.\n\nOfficials in Taiwan are attempting to turn their success in battling the coronavirus at home into a geopolitical win, sending millions of masks emblazoned with the words \"made in Taiwan\" to countries hit hard by the crisis and launching a diplomatic and public relations campaign.\n\nTaiwan is competing with China on pandemic aid diplomacy in defiance of Beijing's efforts to isolate the self-ruled democratic island that it claims as its own. The island is promoting itself as a model of democracy to try to undercut China's own campaign to use the crisis to tout the strength of its authoritarian system.\n\nAnd the world is responding. American and European officials have praised Taiwan's donations of more than 10 million masks. Politicians, business leaders and celebrities, including Bill Gates and Barbra Streisand, have hailed the island as exemplary in its fight against the coronavirus.\n\n\"We can see that this is a good opportunity for us to let people know that Taiwan is a good global citizen,\" Taiwan's vice president, Chen Chien-jen, said this week in an interview in Taipei. \"We have to fight for our participation.\"\n\nBut the moves are drawing fire from Beijing, which has dismissed the effort as an attempt to \"seek independence under the pretext of the pandemic.\"\n\nTaiwan, with a population of 23 million, has reported 426 cases of coronavirus and six deaths as of Wednesday, far fewer than many countries.\n\n\"Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us.\"\n\nIn Kenya, a recent giveaway of flour and cooking oil set off a fatal stampede. In India, thousands of workers have lined up twice a day for bread and fried vegetables. Across Colombia, families are hanging red clothing from windows to signal that they are in need of food.\n\nThe national lockdowns and social distancing measures caused by the pandemic are drying up work and incomes. And around the world, poor people are facing the prospect of starving.\n\nAlready, 135 million people had been facing acute food shortages, but now with the pandemic, 130 million more could go hungry in 2020, said Arif Husain, chief economist at the World Food Program, a United Nations agency. Altogether, an estimated 265 million people could be pushed to the brink of starvation by year's end.\n\nAlready, from Honduras to South Africa to India, protests and looting have broken out amid frustrations from lockdowns and worries about hunger.\n\n\"Instead of coronavirus, the hunger will kill us,\" said Nihal Singh, a migrant worker in India. Mr. Singh said he was ashamed to beg for food but had no other option.\n\nThere is no shortage of food globally, and no mass starvation from the pandemic -- yet. But logistical problems in planting, harvesting and transporting food will leave poor countries exposed in the coming months, said Johan Swinnen, director general of the International Food Policy Research Institute in Washington.\n\nEven if there is no major surge in food prices, the food security situation for poor people is likely to deteriorate significantly worldwide. This is especially true for economies like Sudan and Zimbabwe that were struggling before the outbreak, or those like Iran that have increasingly used oil revenues to finance critical goods like food and medicine.\n\nAnd refugees and people living in conflict zones are expected to be hit the hardest.\n\nA city in the Amazon is 'beyond a state of emergency.'\n\nWith 2,270 diagnosed cases and at least 193 deaths, the state of Amazonas has been among the hardest-hit states in Brazil. And this week, overwhelmed officials in Manaus, the largest city in Brazil's Amazon rainforest, have begun burying coronavirus victims in a mass grave dug on the edge of a cemetery.\n\nIn recent days, the number of burials in Manaus has more than tripled from the normal average of 30 per day to more than 100, the mayor's office said in a statement.\n\nLocal officials are pleading for federal help.\n\n\"We're beyond a state of emergency,\" the mayor of Manaus, Arthur Virg\u00edlio Neto, said Tuesday in a statement. \"The health care system no longer has the capacity to provide care to the patients that need it and people are starting to die at home.\"\n\nMr. Neto has broken down in tears in recent days as he begs for a more muscular response from the government of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has downplayed the severity of the crisis for months.\n\nThe official coronavirus death count appears to grossly understate the toll the virus has taken in Amazonas. Since the beginning of the year, at least 398 people in Amazonas have died from respiratory ailments. That was more than twice the number that have died from such ailments during the same period in 2019.\n\nState officials said earlier this week that 91 percent of critical care hospital beds were occupied and expressed concern that the system would be unable to cope with the increase in patients.\n\nAmazonas is among the poorest states in Brazil and its health system has been crippled in recent years by multimillion dollar corruption schemes that led to the prosecution of businessmen and local politicians.\n\nAfter coronavirus protests in prisons, Iran may be executing inmates at a faster pace.\n\nIran may be accelerating the execution of prisoners, in particular putting to death those who took part in protests over fears that the coronavirus was spreading through crowded and unsanitary prisons, the United Nations human rights chief said on Wednesday.\n\nIn just the past four days, two inmates were executed for crimes they committed when they were under 18, in violation of international law, said Michelle Bachelet, the high commissioner for human rights.\n\nShe called the executions of the minors \"reprehensible,\" and said they raised \"grave concerns about the possibility of expedited executions of other death-row prisoners who were involved in those protests.\"\n\nIn late March, protests and riots broke out in prisons across Iran, a country with one of the world's largest coronavirus outbreaks, and the authorities responded with a brutal crackdown that left an unknown number of prisoners dead.\n\nHuman rights activists say the expedited executions may be meant to warn prisoners against further protests.\n\nShayan Saeedpour, sentenced to death for a fatal stabbing when he was 17, was among 80 prisoners who broke out of Saqez prison in western Iran last month. The authorities recaptured him days later and hanged him on Tuesday, despite United Nations appeals for clemency.\n\nMajid Esmailzadeh was executed on Saturday for a killing that took place when he was 17.\n\nA third under-18 offender on death row, Danial Zeinolabedini, was beaten to death by staff members at Miandoab prison in West Azerbaijan Province in early April, according to the United Nations human rights office. It said he had been transferred there after joining a protest against conditions and the authorities' refusal to grant inmates temporary release.\n\nIran did temporarily release around 1,000 foreign prisoners after the onset of the pandemic.\n\nGermany set to begin its first clinical vaccine trials.\n\nA German biotechnology company said on Wednesday that a coronavirus vaccine candidate it had developed with the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer had been approved for clinical testing in Germany, raising hopes that a working coronavirus vaccine could become available soon.\n\nIt would be what is believed to be the fourth trial to get underway internationally in the race for a vaccine to help stem the pandemic. The German institute responsible for such approval, the Paul Ehrlich Institute, confirmed the news in a post on Twitter: \"Testing a vaccine in humans is an important milestone on the way to safe & effective vaccines against #COVID19.\"\n\n\"We are pleased to have completed preclinical studies in Germany and will soon initiate this first-in-human trial ahead of our expectations,\" Ugur Sahin, an immunologist and the chief executive and co-founder of BioNTech, the German company that developed the potential vaccine, said in a statement.\n\nThe initial clinical trial will be carried out on 200 healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, the company said.\n\nIn the hour after the company's announcement was made public on Wednesday, its stock rose 40 percent. Another vaccine maker in Germany made news last month, when it came to light that the Trump administration may have been trying to lure the company to the United States to develop a vaccine, apparently for exclusive use there.\n\nBritish Parliament brings raucous tradition online.\n\nBreaking with seven centuries of tradition, British lawmakers met partly in cyberspace on Wednesday with a regular -- and normally boisterous -- question-and-answer session in the House of Commons conducted largely by video link.\n\nSpeaking from their homes around the country, lawmakers put questions to Foreign Minister Dominic Raab, who is leading the government as Prime Minister Boris Johnson recovers from the coronavirus.\n\nMr. Raab spoke inside the parliamentary chamber, as did the new leader of the opposition Labour Party, Keir Starmer. But to comply with social distancing rules, just a few dozen lawmakers sat on the green leather benches that are normally crowded at this time of the week.\n\nWithout the normal cheering, shouting and other background noise, the session was more sober than usual, as lawmakers quizzed Mr. Raab over the government's management of the coronavirus crisis and called for more support for workers and businesses. There were no unscheduled interruptions and few technical glitches.\n\nMr. Starmer, attending the question session for the first time as opposition leader, said that Britain had been \"slow into lockdown, slow on testing, slow on protective equipment,\" referring to supplies like masks and gowns used by health care workers. Mr. Raab defended the government's record and argued that it had followed scientific advice.\n\nBritain's supplies of protective gear are critically low, and front-line health workers have been advised by the government to reuse the equipment worn while treating coronavirus patients. Health workers say that advice puts them at risk.\n\nA British Royal Air Force plane carrying a delayed consignment of medical supplies from Turkey for the National Health Service landed early Wednesday, the Ministry of Defense said. It was expected to deliver 84 tons of personal protective equipment, including 400,000 surgical gowns, from a commercial supplier in Turkey on Sunday, but the equipment was delayed because the Turkish company was short on stock, Turkish officials said.\n\nThe government has also been criticized for not taking part in a European Union program to buy bulk medical equipment, including ventilators, protective equipment and testing kits.\n\nBritain on Wednesday reported 759 more coronavirus-related deaths, taking the country's overall death toll to 18,100.\n\nEight children at a Tokyo care facility test positive for the coronavirus.\n\nEight infants and toddlers at a care center in Tokyo have tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said on Wednesday, raising concerns about a wider outbreak at care facilities in the country for neglected or abused children.\n\nThere have been numerous deaths among residents of overwhelmed nursing homes in the United States and Spain, and cluster cases have emerged at day care centers in several cities in Japan. But the Tokyo cases may be the first known cluster in a home for neglected or abused children in the country.\n\nSome people infected with the virus show no symptoms, and there have been cases of patients initially testing positive for the virus and later testing negative.\n\nAll 29 children at the Tokyo facility were tested after an employee tested positive on April 16, according to a statement from the Saiseikai Central Hospital, which runs the residential home for infants and toddlers. The infected children have been hospitalized, but do not have symptoms, and the children who tested negative were also being monitored.\n\nJapan relies on institutional care for the majority of abused and neglected children who cannot live with their parents. There are 140 such homes for infants and toddlers, housing 2,706 children throughout Japan. About 600 facilities operate as orphanages, housing about 25,282 children.\n\nJapanese health officials have reported 11,496 infections and 277 deaths from the coronavirus.\n\nLebanon confirms its first Covid-19 case in a Palestinian refugee camp.\n\nThe first case of coronavirus has been confirmed in a Palestinian refugee camp in Lebanon, the United Nations agency that oversees Palestinian refugee affairs said on Wednesday, intensifying fears that the virus will tear through one of the Middle East's most vulnerable populations.\n\nThe patient, a Palestinian-Syrian woman, tested positive on Tuesday, according to Tamara Alrifai, a spokeswoman for the agency, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East. The woman is being hospitalized at Rafik Hariri Hospital in Beirut, the government's main coronavirus treatment center, while her immediate family is tested for the virus.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees -- people who were forced out or fled in the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948 and their descendants -- live as perpetual outsiders in Lebanon, where they face systematic discrimination. They are barred from Lebanese citizenship and most professions and are forbidden from building permanent housing. They live in cramped, semi-permanent structures in a network of 12 camps and 26 informal settlements around the country, making social distancing difficult, if not impossible.\n\nAs many as 3,000 people live in the patient's camp, which is in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, Ms. Alrifai said. Lebanon also hosts more than one million Syrian refugees who sought refuge from the nine-year civil war next door. They, too, live in squalid, crowded conditions in informal camps around the country.\n\nAid groups fear that a coronavirus outbreak in the refugee camps could inflame the hostility and tension between Palestinian and Syrian communities and their Lebanese neighbors. Seeking to forestall accusations that Palestinians are draining already-stretched Lebanese government resources, the United Nations group has pledged to cover the cost of hospitalization for Palestinian refugees, Ms. Alrifai said.\n\nIt is also close to opening an isolation center with Doctors Without Borders dedicated to Palestinian refugees.\n\nEnvironmental silver lining of the pandemic is temporary, the U.N. says.\n\nAs the 50th anniversary of International Earth Day was observed on Wednesday with drastic measures in force around the globe to fight the coronavirus pandemic, there were signs that those same measures can be beneficial for the environment.\n\nNow that so much of the world is under lockdown, air quality has improved, greenhouse gas emissions have dropped and wild animals have come out to play in streets left empty by humans sheltering in place.\n\nA herd of Great Orme Kashmiri goats has roamed through a seaside town in Wales; coyotes have been sighted in San Francisco; and monkeys in Thailand and sika deer in Japan have wandered around looking for food they would usually get from tourists.\n\nBut the environmental silver lining of the pandemic is temporary, the United Nations warned in a statement on Wednesday, because it comes \"on the back of tragic economic slowdown and human distress.\"\n\nThe U.N. added that Earth was \"urging a call to action\" and said the pandemic was linked to our ecosystem's health.\n\n\"Climate change, man-made changes to nature as well as crimes that disrupt biodiversity, such as deforestation, land-use change, intensified agriculture and livestock production or the growing illegal wildlife trade, can increase contact and the transmission of infectious diseases from animals to humans,\" like Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, the organization said.\n\nSpain moves slowly on reopening, keeping most of its strict limits on children.\n\nAs the number of new coronavirus cases in Spain has slowed in recent weeks, the government has been trying to figure out how and when to ease its lockdown.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez told Parliament on Wednesday that the lockdown would be only partly eased in the second half of May, saying a \"slow and gradual\" approach was necessary \"precisely because it needs to be safe.\"\n\nBut with the largest outbreak in Europe, Spain still has hundreds of deaths a day. The country reported an uptick in its daily death toll on Wednesday, with 435 people dying overnight, bringing the total to 21,717.\n\nHealth officials say the death toll remains troubling, even as the infection rate and the number of hospital recoveries have improved this month. About 33,000 health care workers in Spain have tested positive for the virus, one of the highest numbers in the world.\n\nMr. S\u00e1nchez, who heads a minority coalition government, is asking lawmakers to approve an extension of the nationwide state of emergency until May 9.\n\nThis week, he also ran into unexpected trouble over what to do about the country's children, the only ones in Europe to have been kept strictly indoors since the lockdown started in mid-March.\n\nMr. S\u00e1nchez raised expectations over the weekend by promising that Spanish children would soon be allowed to leave the house. But on Tuesday, the government's spokeswoman disappointed many by saying that children would be limited to accompanying an adult on an essential trip, such as going to the supermarket or the pharmacy.\n\n\"Nobody is measuring with a stopwatch how long it takes a person to buy bread,\" the government spokeswoman, Mar\u00eda Jes\u00fas Montero, said in response to many questions from journalists about why children would need to get their fresh air in a supermarket.\n\nAfter an avalanche of criticism from politicians on all sides, health specialists and citizens who took to their balconies in Madrid to bang pots in protest, the government reversed its decision.\n\nIn another news conference, Salvador Illa, the health minister, said that, starting Sunday, children under 14 would be allowed to go for a short stroll, keeping a safe distance from others.\n\nCzech plan to reopen includes cautiously lifting limits and testing widely.\n\nThe Czech Republic began a five-step plan this week to ease restrictive measures introduced to halt the spread of the coronavirus, returning much of the country to some semblance of normalcy. Farmers markets, car dealerships, tailors, shoemakers and some other small businesses have reopened.\n\nBut safety measures are still in place, and maintaining social distancing and wearing masks in public is mandatory. If there is not a significant growth in new cases in the coming days, all shops no larger than 2,000 square feet will be allowed to open on Monday.\n\n\"We cannot allow for the virus, that we have managed relatively well so far in comparison with other countries, to spread uncontrollably,\" said Karel Havlicek, the minister for industry and trade. \"On the other hand, shops and services cannot be closed forever.\"\n\nThe country has so far avoided the major outbreaks seen elsewhere, with 7,041 confirmed cases and 204 dead. Prime Minister Andrej Babis said he would like to end the state of emergency on April 30.\n\nWeddings of up to 10 people are already allowed to go ahead as of this week, and some professional sports are allowed to hold practices.\n\nThe steps taken so far have been carefully calculated, and some shops and restaurants are scheduled to stay closed until June 8. The Czech Republic on Wednesday also began a broad antibody testing survey of 27,000 people from four regions in an attempt to get a clearer picture of how many Czechs have been infected.\n\n\"We believe it will allow us to better understand the situation and draft an accurate prediction of further development,\" said Adam Vojtech, the minister of health.\n\nAn Indonesian village was locked down, but 15,000 students had already left.\n\nAn Indonesian village that is home to a large Islamic boarding school has been placed under quarantine after 43 Malaysian students who returned to their home country were found to have the coronavirus, officials said.\n\nBut the move could be too little too late. About 30,000 students and villagers live in the quarantine zone in East Java, but health officials said at least 15,000 had already left for their hometowns before the area was locked down on Monday.\n\nThe quarantine covers Temboro Village and the Al-Fatah Islamic Boarding School, which has eight campuses in town. The school is part of the Islamist movement Tablighi Jamaat, which has been linked to other outbreaks in the region.\n\nTablighi Jamaat, which calls on followers to live in the style of the Prophet Muhammad, held a gathering in Malaysia in late February in which 16,000 attendees helped spread the virus to five other Southeast Asian countries. Another mass gathering in Indonesia in March helped spread the virus to several provinces and Thailand.\n\nThe head of the administration that governs the village said he had ordered students sent home early for Ramadan, the Muslim fasting month. His order came just as Indonesia's president, Joko Widodo, banned such travel for government workers. The president extended the ban nationwide on Tuesday.\n\nOne case of coronavirus was discovered in Temboro about two weeks ago. Health officials checked the temperatures of 10,500 students as they departed but were unaware that any were ill until Malaysian officials notified them on Sunday.\n\nTrump's bid to block immigration imperils the flow of high-tech workers from India.\n\nPresident Trump's moves to block the legal flow of people into the United States have sown confusion and fear among foreign workers already in the country and those hoping to make the move, and people from India are among the most affected.\n\nAfter saying he would \"suspend immigration,\" to protect Americans from job losses caused by the coronavirus and lockdowns, Mr. Trump on Tuesday issued an order halting for 60 days the issuance of green cards, or permanent residency, and said he might extend the time frame \"based on economic conditions.\"\n\nUnder pressure from businesses, Mr. Trump backed away from halting temporary work visas, but he said he might impose more restrictions as the crisis drags on.\n\nVisa programs have been vital to technology companies looking for engineers and programmers, many of whom come from India, and people who move to the United States on work visas often apply later for permanent residency.\n\nRestricting that flow would have particular consequences for India and the Indian diaspora in the United States, which numbers about four million people. Indian-Americans are some of the country's most successful and wealthiest immigrants, with a particular stronghold in Silicon Valley's start-up scene.\n\nMore recent immigrants fear not only the loss of jobs as the economy contracts, but also a wave of xenophobia.\n\nWhen Mr. Trump announced his plans, Priyanka Nagar, a software developer who has lived in the United States for more than a decade, happened to be in India, awaiting a visa extension, and feared being cut off from her husband and 5-year-old daughter. She and her husband have applied for green cards.\n\n\"I beg the government not to think of us as enemies,\" said Ms. Nagar, 39. \"I want the U.S. to prosper. It has given us so much.\"\n\nChinese officials work to control new outbreak.\n\nChinese officials are scrambling to control a coronavirus outbreak centered around the northern city of Harbin, even as life in much of the country has gone back to normal.\n\nThe outbreak started with a woman flying from the United States into the region in mid-March, state media reported. It has now spread to nearby Liaoning and Inner Mongolia and prompted the closure of a hospital in Harbin. A new outbreak could be particularly dangerous in China, where life has mostly gone back to normal, with people crowding on to subways and filling restaurants.\n\nThus far the outbreak has caused 78 infections, including a cluster in a hospital in Harbin, where hospital authorities did not take strict measures to separate patients with fevers. One official said the virus spread between patients, nurses and medical aides, who gathered together in hallways to chat.\n\nThe city has now ordered a lockdown on residential compounds, and guards have been deployed to bar outsiders from entry and to check that residents are wearing masks and not showing signs of fevers. The city has also banned all public events as well as weddings and funerals.\n\nHarbin officials said 2,000 people connected to the hospital, including medical staff, inpatients and those that had left within the past two weeks, had been tested. A broader second round of testing is also underway. One article from a news report in nearby Qiqihar showed that 4,106 people who had been to the two hospitals in Harbin were slated to be tested.\n\nCall for cease-fire in Myanmar after W.H.O. employee is killed transporting virus test samples.\n\nSixteen humanitarian groups, including Oxfam and Save the Children, called for a cease-fire throughout Myanmar after a driver for the World Health Organization was shot and killed while transporting coronavirus test samples in troubled Rakhine State.\n\nThe driver, Pyae Sone Win Maung, and a Myanmar health ministry official were taking the samples to Yangon in a marked United Nations vehicle Monday evening when they were attacked in an area where the Myanmar military has been battling the Arakan Army, a rebel group that is seeking autonomy.\n\nThe unidentified health ministry official was wounded, the authorities said.\n\nBoth the national military and rebels denied responsibility for the shooting.\n\nMyanmar, a country of 54 million that shares a 1,300-mile-long border with China, has reported just 121 cases of coronavirus and five deaths. But it has conducted only 5,198 tests and taken few steps to halt the spread of the virus.\n\nHealth experts fear that the disease is already widespread and that the country's inadequate health care system could easily be overwhelmed. The health ministry director, Dr. Than Naing Soe, said the country has only 250 ventilators.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Monday's attack and called for a complete and transparent investigation. The humanitarian groups said the attack \"demonstrates the urgent need for armed actors in Myanmar to lay down their weapons.\"\n\nHowever, the country's civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, issued a statement after the attack praising the military for protecting civilians by fighting the rebels. The military has rejected calls for a halt in fighting so that the country can address the pandemic.\n\nA closed border can't stop this older couple's romance.\n\nShe drives from the Danish side, in her Toyota Yaris.\n\nHe cycles from the German side, on his electric bike.\n\nShe brings the coffee and the table, he the chairs and the schnapps.\n\nThen they sit down on either side of the border, a yard or two apart.\n\nAnd that is how two octogenarian lovers have kept their romance alive despite the closure of the border that falls between his home in the very north of Germany and hers in the very south of Denmark.\n\nEvery day since the police shut the border to contain the virus, Karsten T\u00fcchsen Hansen, an 89-year-old retired farmer, and Inga Rasmussen, an 85-year-old former caterer, have met at the Mollehusvej border crossing to chat, joke and drink, while maintaining a modicum of social distance.\n\n\"We're here because of love,\" said Mr. T\u00fcchsen Hansen. \"Love is the best thing in the world.\"\n\nThen he poured another glass of schnapps.\n\nChina's propaganda machine highlights other countries' mistakes.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic unfolded very differently in China from the way it has in the rest of the world -- at least, if one believes state-run Chinese media. Chinese news outlets used words like \"purgatory\" and \"apocalypse\" to describe the tragic hospital scenes in Italy and Spain. They have run photos of British and American medical workers wearing garbage bags as protective gear.\n\nA lot of the same miseries happened in China, but those reports were called \"rumors\" and censored.\n\nFor the Communist Party, keeping up a positive image for the Chinese public has long been an important part of maintaining its legitimacy. That facade was broken during the outbreak in late January and February, as dying patients flooded hospitals and medical workers begged for protective gear on social media. Some people started asking why the government suppressed information early on and who should be held accountable.\n\nThe death of Li Wenliang, the whistle-blowing doctor in Wuhan, on Feb. 6 galvanized many Chinese people into demanding freedom of speech. Online sentiment became much more skeptical, and many young people openly challenged the party's message.\n\nThen the United States and other countries bungled their own responses, and China's propaganda machine saw an opportunity.\n\nUsing the West's transparency and free flow of information, state media outlets chronicled how badly others have managed the crisis. Their message: Those countries should copy China's model. For good measure, the propaganda machine revved up its attacks on anybody who dared to question the government's handling of the pandemic.\n\nReporting was contributed by Nick Cumming-Bruce, Ernesto Londo\u00f1o, Kai Schultz, Sameer Yasir, Abdi Latif Dahir, Steven Erlanger, Javier C.

        "body": "(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's musings about whether disinfectants and ultraviolet light can be inserted into patients' bodies to treat COVID-19 have alarmed doctors and drawn warnings from the makers of Lysol, Dettol and Clorox.\n\nHere are some other claims that have circulated about how to treat COVID-19 or stop the transmission of the new coronavirus, and the facts according to doctors and health experts:\n\nTREATMENT\n\nFiction: Disinfectant injected into people infected with the new coronavirus could help clear COVID-19, the disease it causes.\n\nFact: Drinking or injecting bleach or other disinfectants is extremely dangerous and could result in death.\n\nFiction: Ultraviolet light inserted into the body could help kill the virus and speed recovery.\n\nFact: While UV light is known to kill viruses contained in droplets in the air, doctors say there is no way it could be introduced into the human body to target cells infected with COVID-19.\n\nFiction: Antibiotics can prevent and treat the new coronavirus.\n\nFact: Antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. They will not prevent or treat infection with the new coronavirus.\n\nThere are currently no specific proven medicines for COVID-19 infection, but those infected can relieve and treat mild symptoms with over-the-counter fever-reducing medicines such as acetaminophen, also known as paracetamol, and aspirin.\n\nTRANSMISSION\n\nFiction: The new coronavirus can be spread by mosquito bites and in Chinese food.\n\nFact: No. The new coronavirus is a respiratory virus that spreads primarily via droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes or breathes out, or through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose.\n\nPROTECTION\n\nFiction: Regularly rinsing your nose with saline can prevent infection with COVID-19.\n\nFact: There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with saline has protected people. There is some weak evidence that the practice can help some people recover more quickly from the common cold, but it does not prevent respiratory infections.\n\nFiction: Some social media posts suggest that spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body can protect against COVID-19 infection, or that gargling bleach or drinking excessive amounts of water can somehow \"flush it out.\"\n\nFact: There is no evidence to back these claims.\n\nGood hygiene practices including frequent hand washing and avoiding close social contact can help reduce the risk of infection.\n\nFiction: Hand dryers are effective in killing the new coronavirus.\n\nFact: No. Hand dryers are not effective against COVID-19, but frequently cleaning your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub, or washing them with soap and water, is. Clean hands should be dried thoroughly with a clean towel or air dryer.\n\nFiction: Cold weather, hot weather, snow, eating garlic or taking a hot bath have also been suggested as ways people can prevent themselves from becoming infected.\n\nFact: There is no evidence behind these claims and no evidence as yet to suggest that COVID-19 will be affected by weather or the seasons.\n\nThe best way to protect yourself is by washing your hands frequently and avoiding contact with anyone who might be infected. This way, you can eliminate viruses that may be on your hands and avoid infection that might occur by touching your eyes, mouth and nose.\n\n(Reporting by Kate Kelland in London and Julie Steenhuysen in Chicago; Editing by Howard Goller)",

        "body": "DAKAR, Senegal -- In the northern Nigerian city of Kano, some people say they now get four or five death notices on their phones each day: A colleague has died. A friend's aunt. A former classmate.\n\nThe gravediggers of the city, one of the biggest in West Africa, say they are working overtime. And so many doctors and nurses have been infected with the coronavirus that few hospitals are now accepting patients.\n\nOfficially, Kano has reported 753 cases and 33 deaths attributed to the virus. But in reality, the metropolis is experiencing a major, unchecked outbreak, according to doctors and public health experts. It could be one of the continent's worst.\n\nThe coronavirus has been slower to take hold in Africa than on other continents, according to the numbers released daily by the World Health Organization.\n\nBut blazing hot spots are beginning to emerge. Kano is only one of several places in Africa where a relatively low official case count bears no resemblance to what health workers and residents say they are seeing on the ground.\n\nIn Somalia's capital, Mogadishu, officials say that burials have tripled. In Tanzania, after cases suddenly rose and the United States Embassy issued a health alert, the Tanzanian government abruptly stopped releasing its data.\n\nKano's state government, until recently, claimed a spate of unusual deaths was caused not by the coronavirus, but by hypertension, diabetes, meningitis or acute malaria. There is little social distancing, and few people are being tested.\n\n\"The leadership is in denial,\" said Usman Yusuf, a hematology-oncology professor and the former head of Nigeria's national health insurance agency. \"It's almost like saying there is no Covid in New York.\"\n\nHe said he thought a significant portion of the population was probably infected in Kano, a city with an estimated five million people (though there has been no census since 2006).\n\nThough they have now acknowledged they have a problem with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, the authorities in Kano spent precious weeks denying it, despite the surge in what Abdullahi Umar Ganduje, the state governor, called \"mysterious deaths.\"\n\n\"So far, there's been nothing to suggest that they are linked with Covid-19,\" Mr. Ganduje posted on Twitter on April 27, when, according to doctors in Kano's hospitals, the city was already firmly in the grip of a serious coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThere was nothing mysterious about what doctors said they were seeing at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, the city's main public hospital. Starting well before Kano's first case was reported on April 11, the hospital saw a steady stream of older patients with fevers, coughs, difficulty breathing and low oxygen saturation levels, many of them with underlying health conditions.\n\nDoctors at the hospital called the government's response team. Sometimes it took 24 hours to get a call back. Sometimes, the team refused to test or isolate patients, saying they did not qualify because they had not traveled recently.\n\nAbout 60 to 70 percent of the elderly patients who went to the hospital and later died had arrived with full symptoms of Covid-19, said a doctor in the medical department, who, along with another doctor, spoke on condition of anonymity because they feared retribution.\n\nOne doctor said the department's death registers for April showed far more patients had died than normal. Most patients were sent home, he said, and the hospital's staff members often would hear later that they had died.\n\nWith no personal protective equipment except surgical masks, the doctors said they knew the risks they were running in treating these patients. They said that they begged the hospital management for N-95 masks, face shields, gloves and aprons, but that none came. They asked for an isolation center at the hospital, scared that patients with other ailments would be infected. They wanted the facilities fumigated. Nothing happened.\n\nAnd then it was too late. The doctors began to get sick.\n\n\"All of us were exposed,\" said the other doctor. \"Ultimately, what we feared has happened.\"\n\nTwenty of the 91 doctors in the hospital's medical department tested positive, the doctors said. Overall in Kano, 42 doctors and 28 nurses have tested positive, and one doctor has died, according to Dr. Sanusi Bala, chairman of the Kano branch of the Nigerian Medical Association. Laboratory technicians in what was then Kano's only testing laboratory got sick too, and it closed for several days. The city's health system, already extremely limited, was crippled.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Chinese officials have quarantined 8,000 people in the country's northeast.

But it has been conducting far fewer tests, typically 1,000 to 1,200 daily. Test results in Kano can take two weeks. Doctors awaiting their test results cannot go to work. People in quarantine cannot leave.\n\n\"If I say thousands of people are dying from Covid, I don't think I exaggerated the figure,\" said the doctor who begged for P.P.E. \"So many people are dying without being tested, without even going to the hospital.\"\n\nWhile the government loosened lockdowns on May 4 in the capital, Abuja, and biggest city, Lagos, it extended the one in Kano. But few people observe it. The many funerals are well attended, residents said.\n\nMany in the city think the coronavirus is a hoax, perhaps because public messaging about it is mostly in English, which most Kano residents do not speak, health experts said.\n\nOthers believe that a Covid-19 diagnosis is a death sentence, the experts said, and do not want their neighbors to think they are infected. So they avoid being tested, and try to behave as if all is normal.\n\nThey go to burials, and shake fellow mourners' hands because it would be socially unacceptable not to. They shop, barefaced, in crowded markets. They hold soccer tournaments -- a recent one was called the \"Coronavirus Cup.\"\n\nWhile the situation in Kano is grim, the picture varies greatly from one country in Africa to another.\n\nFrom the numbers gathered by the World Health Organization and other groups, Djibouti, in East Africa, looks as if it has the highest infection rate per capita on the continent, at 1 in 746 people. But public health officials interviewed there attribute that to aggressive testing and contact tracing. Anyone who tests positive is hospitalized, even if no symptoms are apparent.\n\nTanzania has reported 509 cases, but it stopped releasing data two weeks ago, and the United States Embassy there said on Wednesday that the risk of contracting Covid-19 was \"extremely high.\" A government spokesman told the BBC that testing had been suspended while the authorities investigated the many testing kits, but denied that Tanzania was doing too little to stop the virus's spread.\n\nIn Somalia, more than 1,200 people have tested positive and, officially, 53 have died. But doctors, officials and humanitarian workers think these numbers are way off. Thousands of people with the virus are staying home and not getting tested, they say.\n\nThe office of the Somali prime minister, which is overseeing the response to the outbreak, has dismissed the notion of a hidden toll, saying Mogadishu has already reached its peak.\n\nDr. Mohamed Abdi Hassan, who is leading the medical response to Covid-19 at the prime minister's office, said that \"there might be cases here and there that abruptly died and then were buried,\" but that the number of instances in which people had died of the coronavirus without being tested had been exaggerated. \"We have as much as possible captured the real picture.\"\n\nIn Nigeria, some say that with the outbreak in Kano so widespread, the city may already be home to a giant, unintentional experiment in herd immunity.\n\n\"The disease is taking its natural course,\" said Dr. Faruk Sarkinfada, a medical microbiologist who works in Kano.\n\nEighty percent of tests conducted in the city are coming back positive, a presidential task force sent to Kano in late April told the BBC's Hausa-language service.\n\nBut since no one trusts the official reports, Kano's citizens have come up with their own ways of gauging the toll of the virus.\n\nNazir Adam Salih, a writer and engineer, conducted an impromptu survey of more than 100 acquaintances. Almost all said they had fever, cough and loss of smell. Almost none had gotten tested or treated.\n\nDoctors phone relatives of the dead to conduct \"verbal autopsies.\"\n\nBy late April, the Kano state government finally admitted there was a Covid-19 problem and asked the federal government for help. Dr. Sarkinfada, the medical microbiologist, said that the federal government focused its efforts on increasing Kano's testing capacity, and that test results were now coming in sooner.\n\n\"The Kano situation has seen us through deception, denial, defiance, denunciation, disagreement and finally acceptance and action to control the disaster,\" said Oyewale Tomori, a virologist who leads a Nigerian government committee on Covid-19.\n\nKano's location, population and connectivity to the rest of the region mean the consequences of an uncontrolled outbreak could be severe.\n\nAlready there are reports of hundreds more people dying \"mysterious deaths\" in Nigeria's northern states of Jigawa, Yobe, Sokoto and Katsina, including three emirs, or traditional Muslim rulers, and a former health minister.\n\n\"If Kano falls, the whole of northern Nigeria falls. The whole of Nigeria falls,\" Dr. Yusuf said. \"It spreads into the whole of West Africa and the whole of Africa.\"\n\nAbdi Latif Dahir contributed reporting from Nairobi, Kenya, and Simon Marks from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe man stood in line, shaking with fever, one of countless others trying to cross the border and return to Haiti.\n\nA doctor screening them for coronavirus infection pulled him aside. Like thousands of Haitians, he had been laid off in the Dominican Republic, which has been hit hard by Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nNow he and the other Haitians were returning home, threatening to bring the virus with them.\n\nThe coronavirus has been slow to come to Haiti, partly because protests and political violence virtually shut down tourism and drove away the foreigners who could have brought the disease to the country.\n\nA month after the first case was announced, there have been only 58 confirmed cases and four deaths. Prime Minister Joseph Jouthe last week congratulated the country and announced that factories would reopen at reduced capacity, a rare bit of encouragement for a nation that has been lashed by tragedy -- with a deadly hurricane, a cholera outbreak and a horrific earthquake in just the past decade.\n\nBut with the influx of workers returning from the Dominican Republic, where there have been 5,044 cases and 245 deaths from Covid-19, the odds are stacked against Haiti and its weak health system, warned a presidential panel run by Dr. Jean William \"Bill\" Pape, a widely respected doctor who is racing to set up centers to treat Covid-19 patients.\n\n\"This monster is coming our way,\" said Dr. Pape, who runs Gheskio, a large AIDS and TB clinic in Port-au-Prince, the capital. \"If a place like New York can be so overwhelmed, how is Haiti going to deal with this?\"\n\nMost Haitians lack access to clean water, let alone soap, and many live in tightly packed slums where self-isolation is physically impossible. Protests over government corruption shut down the country last fall, barricading roads and crippling the already fragile economy, leaving even fewer people with enough resources to quarantine.\n\nThe nation's health care system is so threadbare that Haitians regularly die of easily treatable ailments like diarrhea, and public hospitals often have to charge patients for basics like syringes and gloves.\n\nThe sick man pulled aside at the border crossing had to be quarantined at a vacant building, since an adequate area had not been set up yet.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak The coronavirus and an oil glut yield chaos worldwide. The E.U. gave Poland and Hungary billions in aid as they undermined democracy. The pandemic offers Taiwan a chance to push back against China. See more updates Updated 5m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nDr. Daniel Fitzgerald, who works with Gheskio and is the director for the Center for Global Health at Weill Cornell Medicine, said he expected tens of thousands of people to become sick in Haiti.\n\n\"It's just a question of time,\" he said.\n\nDr. Pape's team has been feverishly drafting a treatment protocol that is both effective and realistic for a country like Haiti. Learning from the experience of the United States, where the majority of patients on ventilators have died, Dr. Pape is focusing on treating hospitalized patients with oxygen.\n\nDr. Pape estimates that the country will need 6,000 beds dedicated to Covid-19 patients. \"Now, I have not even 100,\" he said.\n\nBut the plan, which requires trained staff, personal protective equipment, as well as oxygen, is costly. Dr. Pape estimates the first month alone will cost about $30 million -- about half of what the Haitian government spends on health care a year. Dr. Pape and panel co-chairman Dr. Laur\u00e9 Adrien, who is the director of the Ministry of Public Health and Population, are sorting out details and funding.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund announced $111 million in financing to help Haiti with \"health-related expenditures and income support\" to ease the impact of Covid-19. The State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development committed $13.2 million.\n\nLocal businesses have donated, and some foreign nonprofit organizations are raising money that, given the recent U.S. ban on exporting medical supplies, and the increase in costs that followed, needs to stretch further.\n\n\"It's more expensive but it was the only way we could do it,\" said Geoffrey Boutros, a Miami-based broker who arranged for masks and gloves to be shipped to Gheskio directly from China.\n\nA big challenge is convincing Haitians the epidemic poses a real threat.\n\nA month after Haiti's president announced an emergency, banning gatherings of more than 10 and closing schools, tap taps -- the converted pickup trucks that run as private buses -- are still jammed with people.\n\nAnd while the upscale supermarkets that cater to Haiti's elite now offer customers hand-cleaning stations and demand they wear masks, the open markets that serve the country's poor remain a cacophony of jostling humanity.\n\n\"People don't believe it because it's coming from the government,\" said Karl Jean-Louis, a Haitian entrepreneur who interviewed workers and vendors along Port-au-Prince's crowded streets. Some claimed the epidemic was a ruse for the government to make money from aid agencies. Others said staying home was impossible, as they had to work to feed their families.\n\nMore than half of the population lives hand-to-mouth, earning less than $2.41 per day, according to the World Bank.\n\nWhile recovering from Covid-19, a couple in Haiti's rural south became so stigmatized that Dr. Inobert Pierre, director of St. Boniface Hospital, sent a car with loudspeakers blaring: Covid-19 is not a crime; it can strike anybody; prevention is the best cure.\n\nTo his own scared staff, Dr. Pierre explained \"this is like a war\" and \"we are the soldiers.\"\n\nDr. Pape has trained more than 1,000 people to go door-to-door, seeking out anyone with symptoms and urging them to go to the hospital. Crews are delivering tubs of water and hand soap in the slums, where people normally buy water by the bucket. And through loudspeakers, they're asking: Wash your hands, or lave men in Creole.\n\nExperts say Haiti's current low number of infections partly reflects the country's dysfunction. Protests and gang warfare drove away would-be visitors, and with them the potential of importing the virus. Kidnappings have become so chronic that the United States issued a \"do not travel\" warning in early March.\n\nBut those conditions are changing. Over recent weeks, thousands of Haitians have flooded back home each day from the Dominican Republic, said Giuseppe Loprete, the chief of mission for the International Organization for Migration in Haiti. Doctors have been screening at four official border checkpoints, but not at dozens of illegal crossings.\n\nAs Dr. Pape and his team furiously prepare a countrywide response, hospitals have been left to their own devices.\n\nIn Port-au-Prince, a century-old French hospital that had been caught in the crossfire of gang warfare for two years shut down altogether after the first suspected case hit the emergency room.\n\n\"The situation created a panic,\" said Dr. Jean Ven\u00e8se Joseph, the medical director at the hospital. \"Coronavirus came and worsened a situation that was already bad.\"\n\nNot far away, the founder of St. Luke Hospital, Father Richard Frechette, converted an old hospital building -- last used to treat cholera patients -- into a 40-bed Covid-19 ward. Instead of face shields, he outfitted staff with the snorkels and welders' masks he found at a local market. He has commissioned tailors to fashion 15,000 masks out of bathrobes for use in the hospital's non-Covid areas.\n\n\"Rich countries are hoarding all the stuff,\" said Father Frechette, who is also a doctor and built the country's only children's hospital.\n\nUntil recently, he hoped the country would be spared by the unpredictable virus, which seemed to strike rich northern countries, and was said to not flourish in the heat and humidity of countries like Haiti.\n\nBut watching it erupt in the Dominican Republic next door, he worries it could become comparable to the cholera epidemic that, starting in 2010, ripped through Haiti's slums and burgeoning tent camps, infecting more than 820,000. That came months after an earthquake that left between 220,000 and 316,000 people dead.\n\nAlthough billions of dollars and aid workers poured into Haiti, vowing to \"build back better,\" the dreams of planned communities, public health care and free schools remain dreams 10 years later, leaving many Haitians bitter and skeptical.\n\nThis time, as countries around the world fight their own battle against the virus, Haitians do not expect aid.\n\n\"We do not have hundreds of NGOs here and there, doing things. It's not the same,\" said Franck G\u00e9n\u00e9us, president of the association of private hospitals that provides about 40 percent of Haiti's health care. The group has offered 300 beds to coronavirus patients, at a cost of $200 a day.\n\n\"Basically we are alone,\" he said. \"For once, we need to solve this ourselves.\"\n\nHarold Isaac contributed reporting.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\n\"Ten for two\" is an unofficial rallying cry for many lovers of sleepaway summer camps. In three words it reveals an unspoken bargain agreed upon for generations by many American children.\n\nThey slog through the adult-imposed rules, hypocrisies and indignities foisted on them during the 10 months each year when they're home with parents and in school with teachers in order to reap the sweet reward: two independent, friendship-filled, technology-free, teenager-supervised, not completely hygienic, wholesome-ish months spent at camp.\n\nPerhaps more than mothers and fathers tell their camper children, \"ten for two\" is a motivating mantra for parents as well.\n\nBut at a time when many parents would already be preparing to sew name tags into shorts and order new flip-flops for growing feet, the coronavirus pandemic has so far left the fate of the summer camp season of 2020 as murky as the waters of an algae-filled lake.\n\nAfter long weeks of families being locked down at home and with most normal educational, athletic and social activities for children replaced by their zoning out in front of screens for hours, the release provided by camp seems more urgent than ever.\n\n\"We are praying for two things right now,\" said Marnie Prisand, an actress and mother in Los Angeles whose two daughters, ages 16 and 12, have enthusiastically attended Canyon Creek Summer Camp in Lake Hughes, Calif. for several summers. \"We are praying for health and we are praying for camp.\"\n\nMax Lasky, 18, is a high school senior (and Ms. Prisand's nephew) who is missing out on graduation and all the rites associated with leaving one chapter of life behind. He's hoping -- really, really hoping -- that he won't have to give up on his summer plans too. He is supposed to go to Iroquois Springs camp, in Rock Hill, N.Y., where he's been hired to work as a counselor after having spent seven summers as a camper.\n\n\"For me, camp has always been a safe haven to be who you want to be and put all worries aside,\" Mr. Lasky said. \"With everything that is going on in the world, camp would be a really nice break.\"\n\n'A Human-Centered Experience'\n\nCamp serves many purposes. It's child care for parents. It's relied-on seasonal employment for educators and young adults. It's an annual economic boost for many rural and mountain communities. There are thousands of camps in the United States, many of them family-owned and operated, that derive nearly their entire annual revenue from the fleeting weeks of hot days and campfire nights.\n\n\"Camp is one of the few places in life where a young person can have a human-centered experience,\" said Tom Rosenberg, the president and chief executive of the American Camp Association, which was founded in 1910 and counts more than 2,500 camps as accredited members. \"As parents, we hold our kids back because we bubble-wrap them. At camp, we encourage them to try new things, to really try hard at new things and to learn how to make mistakes. Where do we teach kids to fail forward? That's camp.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Georgia moves ahead with some reopenings despite plenty of misgivings. Reopenings in several states on Friday offer the first wider test for the nation. The F.D.A. issued a warning against using anti-malaria drugs that Trump has touted. See more updates Updated 7m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThis year, the metaphorical bubble wrap has been tightened to the point of suffocation, albeit for reasons of public health: playgrounds shut, sports teams and other beloved extracurricular activities paused, schoolwork mediated through the glare of a computer, social life flattened to social media -- which was already being blamed, fairly or not, for increased levels of depression and anxiety in children and teenagers (evidence has shown exercise can help).\n\n\"We have growing concerns about the ongoing mental health issues, that are increasing steadily, affecting young people today,\" said Paul McEntire, chief operating officer of YMCA of the USA, which includes 325 independent camps, attended by more than one million children, about 30 percent of whom attend with the assistance of financial aid. \"We're big believers that being outside always matters. But given quarantine, getting kids outdoors is hypercritical this summer.\"\n\nThis can be particularly important for children with special medical needs, some of whose families are already facing disappointment.\n\nFor the last 25 summers, Camp Barnabas in Purdy, Mo., run by a Christian ministry, has hosted at weeklong sessions children who are in wheelchairs, have Down syndrome, are blind, deaf or have cancer and other chronic illnesses. Last summer, 1,600 campers, 2,400 missionaries and a staff of 150 people sang songs under the stars and spent hot afternoons in the swimming pool.\n\n\"The parents we serve never get a break,\" said John Tillack, the chief executive of the Barnabas Foundation. \"Sending their kids to camp, it's a necessity. It is the only break they get all year.\"\n\nIn early April, Mr. Tillack and his staff made the hard call to cancel the upcoming summer's program. Though most campers live in or nearby the surrounding Barry County, which has reported a total of just five confirmed cases of the coronavirus, the missionaries who work closely with the campers come from 33 states around the country.\n\nBarnabas executives were not sure they could both provide the necessary care for their campers while being responsible members of the broader American community. \"Could we get physicians and nurses to come for the summer as they have in the past?\" Mr. Tillack said. \"Is it fair for us to be pulling medical supplies from communities that are having more cases of Covid than we are in the Midwest?\"\n\nCamp Barnabas parents pay tuition of $1,300 per week; the operating cost is $1,500 per child per week, said Krystal Simon, the camp's chief operations officer. (Last summer, nearly every camper's family received some financial support to offset costs.)\n\nThis summer, parents who request a refund will get one, minus a $55 registration fee. Otherwise, the tuition will be credited toward the 2021 camping season, she said.\n\nEarlier this week, the nonprofit Aloha Foundation, based in Fairlee, Vt., announced it was canceling on-site programming for the 2020 summer at its five camps and would refund paid tuition.\n\nElsewhere, plans remain in flux. \"Most of our directors are still optimistic-slash-hopeful that they will get in at least part, if not all of their summer,\" said Mr. McEntire of YMCA. \"The lead time gives us a lot of time to worry but also a lot of time to plan.\"\n\nAn Essential Business?\n\nJay Jacobs owns three sleepaway camps in New York and Pennsylvania and he is confident -- based on epidemiological trends, the fact that working parents need child care and his Winston Churchill-like optimism -- that his campers will get their summer.\n\nIn an email to parents he sent this week, Mr. Jacobs wrote, \"Camp will be opening on time this summer. Most people are now seeing the likelihood of that outcome.\" He said that summer camp is child care and that \"child care has been deemed an essential business.\" (He added a quote from Churchill: \"Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning.\" )\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Jacobs conceded there are some hurdles still to overcome. \"Once the government says that camps can open, then we have to make sure camp will be safe for our campers and our staff, which I believe I will be able to do.\"\n\nThe process will start on the federal level, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is expected in the next few weeks to release guidance to help camps understand, as fully as possible, the issues that they need to contend with while considering the possibilities for opening.\n\n\"As part of the White House Coronavirus Task Force's recently announced 'Guidelines for Opening Up America Again,' C.D.C. is developing guidance specific to where people live, work, learn, pray and play in order to help communities 'reopen' as safely as possible during this unprecedented Covid-19 pandemic,\" a spokeswoman from the health agency said in an emailed statement, adding that the organization, while working with state and local governments, plans shortly \"to publish guidance and decision tools related to several sectors and settings, including summer camps.\"\n\nThey expect some of the guidance to be similar to what the C.D.C. provided in 2009, when H1N1, otherwise known as swine flu, threatened the camp season. Then, the agency told camps to \"work with state and local public health officials\" and to \"develop plans for addressing potential disease outbreaks in camp settings.\" (Covid-19 symptoms tend to be relatively mild, if present at all, in children.)\n\nHoping for a \"proceed with extreme caution\" signal from the C.D.C., the YMCA and the American Camp Association are preparing to help provide resources to camps and parents on how to make decisions.\n\nThe two groups have retained Environmental Health & Engineering, a consulting firm in Newton, Mass., to impanel experts, including those in the fields of pediatric medicine, infectious disease management and industrial hygiene, to create educational resources that camp directors can use to help guide their operations and train their staff.\n\nTightening the Lanyard\n\nCamp in its particularly American incarnation is a sort of burnt-marshmallow-scented, rugged but safe space for children to develop emotionally: to create deep friendships, to dabble in new hobbies, to build self-reliance and independence.\n\nThis year, camp directors are suggesting that they would also create a physical safe zone: where campers remain on the grounds of camp all summer (likely meaning no off-site day or overnight trips) and counselors potentially would spend days off on the camp's site as well.\n\nCabins would likely have fewer campers, allowing for spacing of beds. Meal times might be staggered to avoid overcrowding of dining halls. Supplies, like pottery wheels and archery arrows, would be wiped down between campers; personal hygiene would be enforced far more than usual.\n\nMany directors are also expecting that if they can open their camps, they will do so later than usual, possibly in July, in the hope that new cases of Covid-19 continue to diminish in identified hot spots like New York and New Jersey. (This timing could be challenging for camps in the south and southeast, which often open right after Memorial Day and wrap up in early August.) \"There are scenarios where an overnight camp is about as safe as any place your child can spend the summer,\" Mr. McEntire said.\n\nAlmost any plan to open this summer, camp officials say, is contingent on testing each camper and staff member before they arrive, and possibly again before they return home. Operators of private and nonprofit camps say they are in conversations with coronavirus test manufacturers about acquiring the necessary materials.\n\n\"We still have eight or nine weeks and we're confident we can get the tests,\" said Mr. Jacobs, whose Timber Lake Camp in Shandaken, N.Y., normally accommodates 460 campers and 250 employees each summer.\n\nAt Timber Lake, a normal camp season runs from late June to mid-August and costs $13,950, putting it at the high end of the market. Mr. Jacobs said he plans to buy the equipment necessary to rapidly process coronavirus tests. \"That's just the cost of doing business and running a safe camp,\" he said.\n\n(Even with all this planning, there remain many unanswered questions, including how campers will get to camp and what happens if a camper arrives at camp and tests positive for the coronavirus.)\n\nThe next hurdle will be convincing parents that it's safe to send their kids away. \"The beauty of our business is that we have very close relationships with our families,\" said Nick Coffing, a director of Canyon Creek Summer Camp, which Ms. Prisand's daughters attend.\n\nPhoebe Yager and Steve Schrodel of Lexington, Mass., have been planning to send their older son, Graham, 13, to Camp Sangamon in Pittsford, Vt., for his fourth consecutive summer. Mr. Schrodel, the chief operating officer of a health care start-up, and Dr. Yager, a pediatric intensivist (or, critical care doctor), said that they will be guided by the safety determinations of state and local health officials.\n\n\"One thing we know is that this is a disease that is overwhelmingly affecting adults and is largely sparing children,\" Dr. Yager said, \"though we must balance this with the understanding that children may serve as vectors, placing adult family members and the broader community at risk when campers return home.\" (Dr. Yager works in an I.C.U. that is now treating adult Covid-19 patients.)\n\nFor so many reasons, they hope that come summertime, scientists and regulators believe it's safe for camp to open. \"I think we are going to go crazy with kids at home without camp if we have continued quarantine and we would mourn the special opportunity for our kids to reinvent themselves and explore and take chances that I think are harder to take at home,\" she said.\n\nThey're keeping in touch with Jed Byrom, who with his family owns Camp Sangamon and its sister property, Camp Betsey Cox. (The camps offer sessions lasting between two and eight weeks and tuition costs $1,200 to $1,500 a week, depending how long a camper stays.)\n\n\"There is a lot of trust,\" said Mr. Byrom. \"We are in the business of taking care of people's kids. People know we will make good decisions\" -- though he's hoping for firm guidance from the C.D.C. and public health officials in Vermont.\n\nOne thing he is not worried about is whether he will be able to find counselors to work. Most summers, Mr. Byrom hires a staff of about 50 people, with 20 of them coming from Asia and Europe, which he knows this year will be impossible. But he is hearing from former campers and former counselors who no longer have full time jobs or whose plans for the summer have fallen though because of the virus. He said: \"They're calling me and saying, 'Can I come back to camp?'\"",

        "body": "NEW DELHI -- Khanat Begum was cooking when a blast of wind uprooted her neighbor's tree, crashing it through the roof of her house in southern Bangladesh.\n\nHer 13-year-old daughter was also inside the house. They both died.\n\nLike many homes in Chandpur village, Ms. Begam's house has been obliterated. The roads leading to the village were blocked on Thursday, a day after Cyclone Amphan tore through eastern India and Bangladesh, uprooting trees, crumbling mud houses and killing at least 22 people.\n\n\"Our village has been reduced to rubble,\" said Israar Kamal, a resident of Chandpur. \"But they are the only ones who died.\"\n\nAs Cyclone Amphan, one of the strongest storms to batter the Indian subcontinent in years, barreled through eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday, it left a trail of devastation and grief.\n\nBut a combination of an impressive evacuation effort and the storm weakening as it swirled onto land seems to have spared many lives. As the storm approached, emergency crews plied beach roads, urging people through megaphones to leave their homes and go to the evacuation shelters. Around three million people heeded the calls and moved to safety.\n\nThe cyclone weakened further as it moved into northeastern India on Thursday, with a wind speed of 37 miles per hour. The skies over many of the cyclone damaged areas were clear.\n\nMany villagers who had fled to cyclone shelters were still inside them; others were beginning to trickle back to their villages, only to find their homes smashed to the ground, a scatter of sticks and clumps of mud.\n\nAuthorities said it was too early to assess the full damage. Many areas were still inaccessible because of downed trees and blocked roads.\n\nAmong the reported deaths, the authorities said that 10 people had died in Bangladesh and 12 in India. Several people died from trees falling on them, and at least two drowned.\n\nIn terms of property destruction, one of the hardest-hit places was the metropolis of Kolkata, one of India's oldest cities, with around 15 million people in the greater urban area. On Thursday, its streets were littered with trees and parked cars bumped into one another as workers struggled to clear the roads.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak The number of daily new cases is higher than ever, but the rate of new deaths is decreasing. China imposes a Wuhan-style quarantine in its northeast, as a political summit nears. In Istanbul under lockdown, baklava makers are essential workers. See more updates Updated 6m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nThe eye of Cyclone Amphan had passed nearby, bringing with it 100-mile-per hour winds and nearly nine inches of rain.\n\nMamata Banerjee, the chief minister of West Bengal State, which includes Kolkata, said the region was in a \"warlike\" situation and that the loss of lives could surpass the toll of Covid-19 there so far.\n\nVideos on social media showed inundated airports, uprooted trees blocking roads and water cascading down the stairs of residential buildings.\n\n\"I was very scared when water started coming into my flat,\" said Anushree Hamirwasia, 22, a student in Kolkata.\n\nIn Bangladesh, where more than two million people were safely evacuated, many ventured out on Thursday to assess the devastation caused by the storm.\n\nMohammed Salah Uddin, 42, said that he and 10 others returned to his village after crisscrossing uprooted trees and electricity wires on the streets. He said that the cyclone shelter he was in had been overcrowded and that people did not maintain any social distance despite the threat of spreading the coronavirus. Photographs from other shelters in Bangladesh showed huge crowds of people, few of them wearing masks.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\n\"It looked scary,\" said Mr. Uddin, who is from Charfassion village in southern Bangladesh. \"It is better to live in a destroyed home than catch the diseases.\"\n\nBelinda Wright, the executive director of the Wildlife Protection Society of India, said there had been serious damage to the ecosystem of the Sundarbans, the world's largest mangrove forest and a wildlife refuge, home to endangered species including Bengal tigers. The cyclone made landfall very close to the Sundarbans, which stretches across the border of India and Bangladesh along the Bay of Bengal.\n\nVillagers in that area, Ms. Wright said, told her that there wasn't \"a tree standing.\"\n\nBut the villagers also relayed that no one had been injured in the storm.\n\n\"They don't like leaving their homes,\" Ms. Wright said, adding that because they know how \"terribly dangerous\" cyclones can be, most villagers in that area had followed the instructions to evacuate.\n\nRescue operations intensified on Thursday across the whole area. Jawhar Sircar, a retired government administrator who lives in Kolkata, said that in his part of the city the situation was peaceful. Electricity was back on, though essential supplies like vegetables and fruits were still not available because street vendors were unable to move on the roads.\n\n\"The mood in Kolkata is like it is all over now,\" he said.\n\nHari Kumar and Jeffrey Gettleman contributed reporting from New Delhi.",

Es decir, dise\u00f1ar\u00eda una c\u00e1rcel t\u00edpica latinoamericana o caribe\u00f1a.\n\nEl distanciamiento social es imposible en las c\u00e1rceles de Hait\u00ed, Guatemala, Bolivia, El Salvador y Honduras, donde el n\u00famero de detenidos es entre el doble y el cu\u00e1druple de la capacidad m\u00e1xima.\n\nAs\u00ed como el virus se apodera de nuestras c\u00e9lulas para reproducirse, puede transformar las celdas atestadas e insalubres de las c\u00e1rceles en incubadoras. Eso ser\u00eda nefasto, no solo para los internos, sino tambi\u00e9n para el personal penitenciario y la poblaci\u00f3n en general.\n\nReducir la sobrepoblaci\u00f3n penitenciaria de inmediato es crucial para evitar un contagio generalizado en la poblaci\u00f3n carcelaria y el resto de la sociedad.\n\nCuando se confirmaron los primeros casos de la COVID-19 en Am\u00e9rica Latina y el Caribe, la mayor\u00eda de los pa\u00edses ni siquiera intent\u00f3 establecer medidas de distanciamiento efectivas para proteger a las 1,7 millones de personas que est\u00e1n encarceladas en la regi\u00f3n. En vez de eso, muchos prefirieron actuar como si fuera posible sellar completamente las c\u00e1rceles para aislarlas del mundo exterior, cancelando las visitas y los permisos de salida por tiempo indefinido. Pero obviamente los funcionarios y los contratistas entran y salen de las prisiones, y cada d\u00eda llegan nuevos detenidos. Sin programas amplios para realizar pruebas de detecci\u00f3n, era cuesti\u00f3n de tiempo para que el virus se colara tras los barrotes.\n\nY as\u00ed ha ocurrido. Chile ya tiene al menos 685 casos confirmados entre reclusos y personal penitenciario; Brasil, m\u00e1s de 900; Colombia, m\u00e1s de mil, y Per\u00fa alrededor de 1500. La COVID-19 es la causa confirmada de la muerte de por lo menos 160 -- entre detenidos y personal penitenciario -- en la regi\u00f3n, la mayor\u00eda de ellos en Per\u00fa.\n\nPero en muchos pa\u00edses se desconoce el nivel de la enfermedad en las c\u00e1rceles por la falta de pruebas. En Brasil, donde hay casi 746.000 reclusos, la tercera mayor poblaci\u00f3n carcelaria del mundo, apenas se han hecho pruebas al 0,4 por ciento de los reclusos.\n\nAnte esta situaci\u00f3n, no sorprende que haya habido protestas en c\u00e1rceles en toda la regi\u00f3n. Desde marzo, han muerto al menos 54 reclusos y cientos han resultado heridos en motines en Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina y Per\u00fa. Los internos afirman no tener jab\u00f3n ni atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica adecuada, y afirman que sus familiares ya no pueden llevarles comida ni productos de higiene desde que se cancelaron las visitas.\n\nAlgunos pa\u00edses han dado pasos preliminares importantes para descomprimir la situaci\u00f3n en las c\u00e1rceles. Chile ha concedido la detenci\u00f3n domiciliaria a cerca de 1600 condenados por delitos de baja gravedad y los jueces excarcelaron a un 10 por ciento de aproximadamente de 13.000 personas en prisi\u00f3n preventiva, seg\u00fan la Defensor\u00eda Penal P\u00fablica.\n\nEn Brasil, seg\u00fan nos afirmaron, los jueces han liberado a cerca de 30.000 personas siguiendo una recomendaci\u00f3n del Consejo Nacional de Justicia, \u00f3rgano encargado de formular pol\u00edticas en materia judicial. Sin embargo, el gobierno de Jair Bolsonaro se opone a las excarcelaciones e insisti\u00f3, sin \u00e9xito, en usar contenedores para aislar a reclusos. El uso de esos espacios met\u00e1licos improvisados se prohibi\u00f3 despu\u00e9s de que en 2010 salieran a la luz las condiciones inhumanas que ah\u00ed sufr\u00edan los reclusos.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. 2.4 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week.

En Argentina y Honduras, la justicia ha excarcelado a cerca del uno por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n penitenciaria. En M\u00e9xico, a pedido de algunos gobernadores, los jueces han liberado al menos a 2000 personas, una cifra que equivale aproximadamente al 1 por ciento de la poblaci\u00f3n carcelaria. Es el mismo porcentaje de Per\u00fa, que ha liberado a 1067 presos. Tambi\u00e9n Colombia a liberado a solo 566 de un total estimado de 122.000 presos y Bolivia, seg\u00fan una fuente judicial, solo a dos detenidos de m\u00e1s de 16.000.\n\nEn El Salvador, la justicia est\u00e1 evaluando la liberaci\u00f3n de 557 personas mayores encarceladas, de m\u00e1s de 39.000 detenidos. En Guatemala, el Organismo Judicial prometi\u00f3 excarcelaciones, pero no ha publicado datos al respecto.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWho would have thought we'd all be living in fear of making a grocery run, picking up a package or accidentally getting closer than six feet to another human?\n\nThe fear, of course, is that an encounter with the coronavirus will set you on a path that could lead to dying. It's a path a lot of us spend our whole lives trying to avoid, but it's one I have already been on for a long time.\n\nMy father became mysteriously sick in his 40s. His doctors, as well as a number of doctors across the country and around the world, watched his body's slow decline without answers. By age 49, he was dead.\n\nA few years later, when I was 24, a leading genetics research team at the Seidman Lab at Harvard told me that I had inherited the same orphan mutation that had not only killed my father but five other members of my family.\n\nThat risk became even more potent when, at age 35, an M.R.I. revealed that I had a blockage in the portal vein, the main pathway to the liver, an organ also known as the washing machine of the body. When it becomes blocked, the blood flow finds a new route, often a dangerously fragile one.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump says he will issue an executive order suspending immigration. Several states in the South are moving to reopen businesses. Trump defends nation's testing capacity, even as some states scramble for supplies. See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nTen years later, I still have these weakened pathways, snaking ominously throughout my digestive tract. Doctors have referred to me as a ticking time bomb. But it's not a death sentence so much as a possible outcome, largely because so little is known about our family's rare gene and its complications.\n\nI might have a major bleed-out and die, or I might live a long and healthy life without ever enduring a bleed. Similarly, with the coronavirus, like anyone, I might get a runny nose, or I might feel as if a freight train has settled onto my chest and made me feel like I'm breathing broken glass.\n\nMy father's symptoms began in earnest just as I was starting college. Partway through, I took a semester off to help him die. At the start of college I wore lipstick in a shade of frosty pink; by the end, I had a tattoo and a nose piercing. In the beginning I auditioned for an a cappella group, and by the end, I was in an all-girl rock band.\n\nLooking back, it's easy to wonder if my father's illness -- what later became my illness -- made me lazy or rebellious. But I'd argue that it made me louder and better at questioning expectations. When I was growing up in Columbus, Ohio, the daughter of a teacher and a doctor, I understood that post-high school there was college. Post college there was doctor/teacher/lawyer/architect. Midcareer there would be family -- a husband who brought me flowers on Valentine's Day, children who brought home good report cards.\n\nBut in the constant heated glow of my own mortality, a new understanding came over me. It is better to learn than to get straight As. It is better to love your life than to be wealthy. It is better to be in a rock band and get your nose pierced than to not do those things because you are embarrassed or afraid.\n\nMy friend Josie Rubio died in November. She spent her last months of life dating and falling in love. Josie used to lament every time she'd hear about someone on some kind of deprivation diet or observing \"Sober January.\" I understood what she meant. I had come to live my life in exactly this spirit. If I didn't drink, it was because it felt good not to drink. If I didn't eat sugar, it was in search of something better. Josie wasn't calling out in favor of cravings, addictions or the compulsive filling of voids. Josie's point was that deprivation isn't the opposite of unhealthy -- it's the opposite of living. Someday we each will die. That's deprivation.\n\nSoon after I learned about the gastric varices poised to burst and end my life, my husband and I went on a road trip. At one point, my heart started pounding in my chest. Clammy, sweaty, unfocused, \"I feel dizzy,\" I thought. \"I'm having a stroke. My life as I know it is ending right now.\"\n\nAt some point, after hours of tests at a nearby emergency room, an endorphin-filled calm washed over me. It had been a panic attack. I was going to live. I would be OK. In that moment I took very real inventory of my life. My imagined brush with death led me to a new basic truth: My bucket list -- if I had one -- had to become my to-do list.\n\nAs I fall asleep tonight asking myself if that little tickle in my throat is a harbinger of doom, or just a little dust, there is only one certainty: I am happy today, right now in my life. I hope the inevitable death each of us will go through is painless and filled with love. But meanwhile, I hope its shadow reminds us all to be as alive as possible, even as we sit -- as a world -- alone on our couches.\n\nJoselin Linder is the author of \"The Family Gene: A Mission to Turn My Deadly Inheritance into a Hopeful Future.\"",

        "body": "Good morning. Our next DealBook Debrief call is today, when we'll discuss the coming wave of bankruptcies and take your questions about restructuring, consolidation, antitrust and more. R.S.V.P. here to join the call, which starts at 11 a.m. Eastern. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)\n\nThe water cooler's existential moment\n\nA long stretch of remote working has understandably led companies to think again about their office space -- particularly about whether they need so much.\n\nBuildings were already half-empty. This provocative finding, in a new report by Heather Jordan Gerety at Heda Jordan Consulting, is based on access card data, Wi-Fi use and in-room sensors. In recent years, more flexible schedules have resulted in record \"hidden vacancies,\" with up to 50 percent of headquarters space and 65 percent in other offices going unused.\n\n* Polls suggest that people won't rush to return, the report notes -- virus-shadowed commutes will be stressful.\n\n* There's also this: \"Excitement to see colleagues may only last for a couple of days.\"\n\nCutting costs could mean losing space. The cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase said yesterday it would shift permanently to \"remote-first\" working, similar to what Twitter announced earlier this month.\n\n* Big banks plan to spread employees out when they first reopen, staggering shifts and leasing satellite space in the suburbs, Bloomberg reports. And traders have mostly adapted to working from home, according to The Financial Times, reducing the need for packed trading floors.\n\n* This doesn't necessarily spell the end of crowded city centers, according to Eric Kober of the Manhattan Institute:\n\nIf some big companies lease less space, there will be (for a time) more vacant space, and asking rents will fall to the point where it makes sense for other businesses to expand or new businesses to start up. More people, not fewer, will be working in Manhattan offices in the future, at least some of the time.\n\nGoing back to the office won't be pleasant, at least at first. \"Many workers will find a mess of masking tape, plastic sheets, police tape, floor decals, and a host of half-baked design solutions\" for social distancing, Anne Quito writes for Quartz. And water left stagnant in the plumbing of empty buildings could breed Legionnaires' disease, The Times notes. Be careful out there.\n\n____________________________\n\nToday's DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Connecticut and Michael J. de la Merced and Jason Karaian in London.\n\n____________________________\n\nThe World Bank taps a crisis specialist\n\nCarmen Reinhart of Harvard is the new chief economist at the World Bank, starting next month.\n\nShe made her name studying financial crises, most notably with her colleague Ken Rogoff. Their 2009 book, \"This Time Is Different,\" analyzed 800 years of panics, defaults and other catastrophes.\n\n* Their follow-up research generated controversy when the two claimed that growth cratered after debt hit 90 percent of G.D.P. Some policymakers used the finding to justify austerity measures after the 2008 financial crisis, but other researchers found errors in the calculations.\n\nMs. Reinhart isn't worried about too much debt -- for now. \"You worry about winning the war and then you worry about how you're going to pay down the debt,\" she said in an interview yesterday with the Harvard Gazette. She also wrote in a recent opinion piece that \"this is a 'whatever-it-takes' moment for large-scale, outside-the-box fiscal and monetary policies.\"\n\nShe says the pandemic is \"the nail in the coffin of globalization.\" That might sound \"melodramatic,\" she told the Gazette, but she expects \"more inward-oriented strategy\" after the crisis subsides, which is bad news for many trade-dependent developing countries that rely on World Bank support.\n\n* Global cooperation on debt restructuring and relief for poorer countries is crucial, she said. And China will have a special role, she added, given how much it has lent to developing countries recently.\n\nAmericans are braced for a depression\n\nOnly a fifth of people think that overall business conditions will be \"very\" or even \"somewhat\" good over the coming year, according to a poll for The Times by SurveyMonkey. Most expect years of hardship.\n\nSixty percent of respondents expect \"periods of widespread unemployment or depression\" over the next five years, The Times's Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley write. That may reflect a decline in the national mood, also seen in other data.\n\nLatest Updates: Economy U.S. unemployment claims are expected to approach 40 million, and counting. Business data points upward, but global markets cool. Bank of China billed crude oil as a safe bet. Investors are deep in the red. See more updates Updated 56m ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\n* A survey by the Census Bureau found that nearly a third of Americans reported feeling anxious or nervous more than half the days last week.\n\nFewer people now believe in a V-shaped recovery, as we've noted. And as Ben and Jim point out, pessimists may be less likely to spend even if their own finances are fine, so this shift could itself prolong the economic misery.\n\nMore rescue and reopening news:\n\n* The \"experience economy\" -- travel, sports, museums, concerts and more -- isn't sure how it can recover, and some $1.6 trillion in G.D.P. is on the line.\n\n* Ford halted production at two plants that had reopened this week after workers tested positive.\n\n* Lawmakers criticized Delta and JetBlue for cutting hours, weeks after receiving over $5 billion in federal aid.\n\nWhite Collar Watch: Pandemic insider trading investigations\n\nPeter J. Henning is a professor at the Wayne State University law school, and previously served in the enforcement division of the S.E.C. and the fraud section of the U.S. Department of Justice. Here, he considers the prospects for charges against senators over coronavirus-related trades.\n\nThe Justice Department is looking into stock trades by several lawmakers after they received closed-door briefings and other information during the early stages of the outbreak. The 2012 STOCK Act prohibits lawmakers from trading on material nonpublic information received as part of their duties.\n\nSenator Richard Burr, Republican of North Carolina, recently had his phone seized by the F.B.I., and has temporarily stepped down as chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. He denies wrongdoing. Other senators -- Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California; James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma; and Kelly Loeffler, Republican of Georgia -- have also come under scrutiny. All deny wrongdoing. Unlike Mr. Burr, they also said that they did not direct the trades in question.\n\nWill indictments follow? Insider trading is notoriously hard to prosecute, and the STOCK Act is yet to feature prominently in any case. But a verdict in a case last year, which involved a former staffer at a Medicare agency tipping off hedge funds, established that tippers could be prosecuted even if there wasn't a quid pro quo. This is a boon for prosecutors.\n\nCould the Securities and Exchange Commission also get involved? Lawmakers are protected by the \"speech or debate clause\" of the Constitution, which limits liability for actions taken as part of the legislative process. Trading stocks would not necessarily qualify, so that shouldn't hold back the S.E.C. In March, the agency said it was on heightened alert for insider trading around coronavirus information.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nStill, I suspect that the Justice Department will take the lead here. This is a high-profile investigation, to say the least, and the S.E.C. could file a parallel civil enforcement action.\n\nHow to shore up the dollar\n\nThe U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency could be tested by the pandemic and China's efforts to boost the renminbi, Hank Paulson, the former Treasury secretary and Goldman Sachs C.E.O., writes in Foreign Affairs.\n\nDeveloping a digital currency is important, Mr. Paulson writes. China is well ahead in making the renminbi digital-friendly, which could speed its international adoption. American policymakers should team up with Silicon Valley to counter that, while keeping in mind concerns about privacy, he adds.\n\n* Vikram Pandit, the former Citigroup C.E.O., made a similar point in this space last week, arguing that central bank-issued digital currencies \"could pave the way for an infrastructure that serves everyone.\"\n\nOtherwise, Mr. Paulson writes, the U.S. risks losing ground in digital finance, among \"those who prefer digital finance over conventional banking\" and with billions of people \"in developing countries with weaker financial markets and volatile currencies.\"\n\nThe speed read\n\nDeals\n\n* Apollo has invested $1.75 billion in the supermarket chain Albertsons, which is owned by a rival, Cerberus, and planning to go public.

    "DealBook: Warren Buffett Isn't Buying Anything": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Good morning. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)\n\nWarren Buffett is more worried than usual\n\nThe \"Oracle of Omaha\" initially exhibited his usual optimism during Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting on Saturday. But, Andrew writes in his latest column, Mr. Buffett appears fairly gloomy if you dig deeper:\n\nIt was unsettling on Saturday to hear him repeatedly say \"I don't know.\" He was careful to say the markets would improve in the long term -- though his time frame for certainty was decades, not months or not even necessarily years from now. About the current climate, he said, \"You can bet on America, but you kind of have to be careful about how you bet.\"\n\nThe clearest sign of hesitation was his closed wallet, Andrew notes. Mr. Buffett didn't buy up stocks during the recent market plunge, unlike his spending spree amid the carnage of the 2008 financial crisis. Back then, he wrote an op-ed in The New York Times a month after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy: \"In the near term, unemployment will rise, business activity will falter and headlines will continue to be scary. So ... I've been buying American stocks.\"\n\n* Mr. Buffett missed his chance to strike the type of high-priced rescue deals like the one he offered to G.E. in 2008, Bloomberg notes, because the Fed quickly stepped in with a slew of bailout programs. Berkshire is now sitting on $137 billion in cash.\n\nMr. Buffett sold his holdings in the four biggest U.S. airlines, saying that the airline business \"changed in a very major way.\"\n\n* All told, Berkshire sold $6.5 billion worth of stocks last month, putting most of the money into Treasury bills.\n\nThe online meeting came after Berkshire reported a $50 billion loss in the first quarter. Mr. Buffett has long argued that swings in value of Berkshire's investments aren't a good indicator of the company's health, but the conglomerate also recorded hits to wholly owned operations like its Burlington Northern railroad and retail businesses.\n\nMr. Buffett left investors with a sliver of hope: \"The American miracle, the American magic has always prevailed and it will do so again,\" he said.\n\n____________________________\n\nToday's DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Connecticut and Michael J. de la Merced and Jason Karaian in London.\n\n____________________________\n\nJ. Crew is the first big retailer to fall in the pandemic\n\nThe clothing brand filed for bankruptcy protection this morning, after the coronavirus pandemic pushed the chain over the edge. It's unlikely to suffer alone.\n\nLatest Updates: Economy Global markets fall sharply on recovery jitters. J. Crew files for bankruptcy, the first major retailer to fall during the pandemic. Hong Kong takes its worst economic hit in decades. See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nThe retailer plans to hand over control to creditors, led by the hedge fund Anchorage Capital, by exchanging $1.65 billion in debt. The company will keep Madewell, the denim brand it had once considered spinning off. E-commerce operations will continue to run, and stores will reopen once lockdowns lift.\n\n* J. Crew was already in bad shape, struggling with a heavy debt load and strategic missteps like failing to focus on e-commerce and fashion trends.\n\nIt's the latest sign of trouble for the retail industry. Sales of clothing and accessories in the U.S. fell by more than half in March, and April is expected to be even worse.\n\nWho's next? Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney are still in talks with creditors about financial rehab plans, with Chapter 11 considered in both cases. Other retailers like Brooks Brothers have hired advisers to consider their options.\n\nBusiness bailout roundup\n\nSmall businesses are afraid to spend rescue loans. Complicated rules about loan forgiveness and how to avoid potential fraud charges have left companies sitting on the funds.\n\nThe biggest recipient of small-business loans is returning the money. Hotel businesses linked to the publicly traded Ashford Inc. will return at least $70 million in loans, citing new government guidelines and the media uproar. Group subsidiaries had applied for $126 million.\n\nMore money on the way? Larry Kudlow, the White House economic adviser, said that a third infusion of funds may be needed, since the first $350 billion tranche was quickly used and more than half of the second $310 billion infusion is accounted for. Broadly speaking, discussions for additional stimulus measures are in \"kind of a pause period,\" he said.\n\nLobbyists are on the offensive. Anticipating the end of stimulus, lobbyists are arguing for tailored support, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nBailout fatigue is setting in. The former Obama economic adviser Austan Goolsbee writes in The Times's Opinion section that a lack of transparency risks eroding public support for fiscal stimulus measures. In The Wall Street Journal, the former Fed vice chairman Alan Blinder is worried that \"some people in the government and financial markets turn too much to the Fed for solutions.\"\n\nTake Note: Fitness for duty\n\nMichelle Leder, the founder of the S.E.C. filing site footnoted*, spotted something unusual in the latest batch of company disclosures about the coronavirus crisis, which she writes about below. You can follow her on Twitter at @footnoted.\n\nAs the economic disruption from the coronavirus pushes into a new month, more publicly traded companies are disclosing what it means for their businesses.\n\nAfter the markets closed on Friday, the industrial giant Ingersoll Rand provided an unusually detailed description of the issues facing the company in an unscheduled regulatory filing. Among other things, it said it planned to delay filing its quarterly earnings report, as allowed under a new S.E.C. rule written in response to the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nTypically, large companies like Ingersoll Rand are required to file detailed quarterly reports with the S.E.C. 40 days after the close of the quarter, which this year would have been May 11. On Friday, it said it would file \"no later than\" May 19.\n\nA delayed earnings report wasn't the only reason for the filing. The company also disclosed a new risk factor that ran over 1,000 words, detailing all sorts of issues it is facing as a result of the pandemic. For example, it noted the potential for \"decreased worker productivity as a result of remote working arrangements, increased medical, emergency or other leave.\" It described daily \"fitness for duty\" checks of all employees, which include \"temperature and symptoms checks and providing personal protective equipment.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Ingersoll Rand wasn't available to comment over the weekend.\n\nIt isn't the only company to talk about the need to monitor employees' health for signs of fever, one of the common symptoms associated with Covid-19. But only one other company -- Vivint Inc. of Provo, Utah -- chose to describe this as a \"fitness for duty.\" More may follow as the crisis continues.\n\nThe week ahead\n\n\ud83e\udd1d U.S.-Britain trade talks are to begin tomorrow. Post-Brexit Britain is eager to set a free-trade agreement with the U.S. (the destination for 19 percent of British exports), not least to put pressure on stalled talks with the E.U. (which accounts for 45 percent of exports).\n\n\ud83d\ude97 Carmakers have been hit hard by coronavirus shutdowns: Dealerships are closed, factories are idle and consumers' wallets are shut. Expect to see more on the damage from Fiat Chrysler tomorrow and General Motors on Wednesday.\n\n\ud83d\udcfa Streaming is up, but advertising is down: Disney (tomorrow) and ViacomCBS (Thursday) should explain the effects on their latest earnings.\n\n\ud83c\udfae Stay-at-home orders give people more time for video games, as reports from Activision Blizzard and Electronic Arts tomorrow and Zynga on Wednesday are expected to show.\n\n\ud83d\udcb0 KKR reports quarterly earnings on Wednesday, revealing how hard the private equity group's investments have been hit, and whether the crisis presents opportunities for discounted deals.\n\n\ud83d\udcc9 Jobs numbers end the week on a grim note.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nGood morning. Our next DealBook Debrief call is about the fallout for the retail industry, which has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. We'll be joined by Vanessa Friedman, The Times's fashion director and chief fashion critic, to discuss how the fashion and luxury industries are coping, and the possible lasting effects. We hope you'll join us on Thursday, April 23, at 11 a.m. Eastern -- R.S.V.P. here. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)\n\nThe oil market's subzero moment\n\n\"Crude costs money again\" is a strange headline for strange times. The price of a barrel of oil for delivery in May dropped below zero yesterday: West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, closed at around -$38. It bounced back above zero, briefly, in early trading today, before falling back into negative territory. Market watchers are trying to make sense of it all.\n\nTechnical factors explain some of the decline. The soon-to-expire May contract went negative on thin volumes, while the more heavily traded June contract has remained above zero. In essence, traders don't want to be stuck taking delivery of any oil now -- storage is nearly full and demand is nonexistent -- but they think that production cuts and a gradual reopening of the economy will make oil worth something in the future.\n\nThe ugly economics of the industry are also to blame. The production cuts that major oil powers agreed on this month aren't enough to offset the steep drop in demand with much of the global economy in lockdown -- so much so that Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members may start cutting a few weeks ahead of schedule, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\n* The battered U.S. energy industry is now worth around $700 billion in total market capitalization, roughly half the market value of Microsoft, according to the Bespoke Investment Group.\n\nCould it happen again? Analysts at ING think so: \"It is likely that storage this time next month will be even more of an issue, given the surplus environment, and so in the absence of a meaningful demand recovery, negative prices could return for June.\"\n\n____________________________\n\nToday's DealBook Briefing was written by Andrew Ross Sorkin in Connecticut and Michael J. de la Merced and Jason Karaian in London.\n\n____________________________\n\nSmall businesses play loan roulette\n\nThe federal government's small-business rescue fund, the Payroll Protection Program, is out of money. When it was up and running, getting a loan from a designated first-come-first-served program was a matter of luck and connections.\n\nLatest Updates: Markets and Business A down day as global markets, await financial fallout from the virus. Oil's bizarre collapse is continuing. For nursing homes, it can be expensive just to keep the doors open. See more updates Updated Just now More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nA customer's bank mattered a great deal. Some lenders took days to set up their systems to gain access to the fund. Banks often gave priority to existing customers and, data shows, to bigger ones, including over 80 publicly traded companies.\n\n* That has led businesses to sue banks like JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, accusing them of favoring bigger customers.\n\nMuch of the outrage is directed at big restaurant and hotel chains, which were allowed to request funds, depriving true mom-and-pop businesses of loan money. And it doesn't help that a majority of successful applicants haven't received their money, according to a new survey.\n\nCongress is poised to replenish the fund with $300 billion, and could have a bill to vote on as soon as this afternoon. But the banking industry says this won't be enough: Lenders expect the reopened program to burn through $50 billion per day.\n\nU.S. states prepare to reopen their economies\n\nThe first batch of states have laid out their plans to lift lockdowns, and all eyes are on them to see if they're moving too early.\n\nSouth Carolina will let some retailers open today, Georgia will permit gyms and hair salons to do so on Friday, and Tennessee won't renew a lockdown order set to expire on April 30. All three states said they believed that infections had leveled off enough to let them reopen their economies.\n\nThey're doing so despite the debate over coronavirus testing. Other states are arguing that they can't reopen because there isn't enough screening for the virus. An official with the W.H.O. warned this morning that the lifting of lockdowns must be gradual to avoid a second wave of infections.\n\n* Denmark, which has opened some schools and businesses, has pledged to test everyone with symptoms.\n\nThe Deal Professor: The big get bigger\n\nSteven Davidoff Solomon, a.k.a. \"The Deal Professor,\" is the faculty director at the Berkeley Center for Law, Business and the Economy\n\nIf past crises are any guide, the big technology companies are about to sidestep antitrust laws and get even bigger.\n\nConsider last week's decision by British regulators to allow Amazon's investment in the London-based food delivery start-up Deliveroo. Amazon said last May that it was joining a $575 million fund-raising round, valuing Deliveroo at perhaps as much as $4 billion. Britain's Competition and Markets Authority halted the deal because it thought it might be bad for competition.\n\nThat was before the pandemic.\n\nDeliveroo argued that, without Amazon's money, it would have to shut down. The British antitrust authority backed down, saying that if Deliveroo went bust, it \"could mean that some customers are cut off from online food delivery altogether, with others facing higher prices or a reduction in service quality.\"\n\nExpect this to be repeated elsewhere. In the U.S., big companies will take advantage of the so-called failing firm exemption to antitrust law. This doctrine, which dates from a 1930 Supreme Court case, allows otherwise anticompetitive deals to succeed when the target would probably fail without the deal and there is no other viable investment. American Airlines used it when buying TWA.\n\nConsolidation is natural during troubled times. Recall how the biggest U.S. banks gobbled up failing competitors during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThis time around, it's deal teams at tech companies who are hatching M.&A. plans as the economic downturn takes its toll. They'll be aided by outdated antitrust laws that assess whether an acquisition \"lessens competition\" in deciding whether it should be blocked. That test fails to measure bigness as a rule, allowing Facebook to acquire Instagram or Amazon to buy Whole Foods because antitrust regulators ignore the network effects.\n\nAnd with Washington consumed with saving the economy, don't expect the pre-pandemic debates about breaking up tech companies or updating antitrust laws to get very far.\n\nRichard Branson says he's not as rich as he appears\n\nIn pleading for help for his Virgin Atlantic airline, Mr. Branson argued that his wealth wasn't as huge as people think -- a reminder that billionaires may have wealth, but not necessarily cash.\n\nMr. Branson offered to borrow against his private island in the British Virgin Islands to help raise cash for Virgin Atlantic, he wrote in a blog post yesterday pleading for financial support from the British government.\n\n* Another Virgin Group holding, Virgin Australia, filed for administration this morning after being denied a bailout.\n\nHe also argued that he couldn't tap his personal fortune -- estimated earlier this year at about $4.4 billion -- because his net worth was largely tied up in holdings of the Virgin Group, rather than sitting in a bank account. It's a reminder that the riches of many billionaires are tied to stock and investments.\n\n* Take a look at the movements in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which is updated each day. The net worth of moguls whose wealth is tied up in sectors that have been hit hard by the coronavirus -- like Bernard Arnault in luxury goods and Sheldon Adelson in entertainment -- has dropped sharply this year, while that of Amazon's Jeff Bezos and Walmart's Walton clan have surged.\n\nThe speed read\n\nDeals\n\n* No deal worth more than $1 billion was announced last week, for the first time in 15 years.

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- A federal prosecutor has opened a preliminary inquiry into whether an obscure New York doctor who won White House attention by claiming he could treat the coronavirus broke the law by falsely claiming that a hospital study of drugs he had promoted had won federal approval.\n\nThe doctor, Vladimir Zelenko, wrongly claimed that the Food and Drug Administration had backed a study of a drug cocktail that he asserts is effective in treating Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Through a misdirected email, that claim came to the attention of Aaron Zelinsky, a federal prosecutor in Baltimore working on fraud cases arising out of the pandemic.\n\nDr. Zelenko, known as Zev, had claimed the study had the F.D.A.'s approval to Jerome Corsi, a conservative commentator who figured in the special counsel's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Mr. Corsi then repeated that claim in an email he mistakenly directed to Mr. Zelinsky instead of to the physician, he said in a podcast this week.\n\nMr. Zelinsky, a former member of the special counsel's team that investigated Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, had dealt with Mr. Corsi while working on a criminal case that led to the conviction of Roger J. Stone Jr., President Trump's longtime friend.\n\nMr. Corsi said that Mr. Zelinsky promptly checked and discovered that the study was not F.D.A.-approved, then requested all Mr. Corsi's communications with the doctor. Mr. Corsi's lawyer, David Gray, said Mr. Corsi voluntarily turned over the information. The inquiry was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nIn an interview on Friday, Dr. Zelenko said that he was guilty of nothing more than sloppy wording.\n\n\"I'm a clinician, not a researcher,\" he said. \"I don't understand fully the language of clinical research.\"\n\nHe said the misunderstanding stemmed from a lecture he gave last month to a group of physicians over the videoconferencing app Zoom, which Mr. Corsi attended. During the lecture, Dr. Zelenko claimed that the clinical trial he was helping organize, sponsored by St. Francis Hospital in New York, had been approved by the F.D.A. In fact, only the hospital's internal review board had approved it.\n\nDr. Zelenko said he had the impression that his study had the government's seal of approval because he had spoken with Stephen M. Hahn, the F.D.A.'s commissioner, who discussed his treatment with him and helped him locate medicine for the trial, he said.\n\n\"In my mind, that led me to think it was F.D.A.-approved,\" Dr. Zelenko said. \"In reality, it was a mistake.\"\n\nDr. Zelenko said that he had not been contacted by the Justice Department, and that he learned of the inquiry from Mr. Corsi's public statements.\n\nMr. Corsi said he believed that the doctor never intended to deceive anyone. \"He can't speak precisely about something he doesn't understand,\" he said.\n\nA self-described \"simple country doctor,\" Dr. Zelenko proposed a three-drug cocktail of an antimalarial medication called hydroxychloroquine, the antibiotic azithromycin and zinc as a treatment for Covid-19 after seeing numerous patients with symptoms of the disease. He is not the first, nor the only, doctor to propose antimalarial drugs as a treatment.\n\nBut his claims that he could cure the disease by treating it aggressively in the early stages, which he played up in a YouTube video that he addressed to Mr. Trump, caught the attention of the president's inner circle. After the video went viral, Mark Meadows, the White House chief of staff, contacted him. Rudolph W. Giuliani, Mr. Trump's personal lawyer, also publicly praised the doctor. The video has now been taken down.\n\nFor weeks, Mr. Trump himself promoted hydroxychloroquine as \"very effective\" and possibly \"the biggest game changer in the history of medicine.\" The right-wing news media also seized on the potential of antimalarial drugs as a treatment.\n\nSince then, more evidence has emerged that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin may not be effective at treating the coronavirus, and may in fact be harmful because of the risk of severe side effects. The F.D.A. warned in April that hydroxychloroquine, either on its own or in combination with azithromycin, should not be administered to treat Covid-19 outside the hospital setting or in a clinical trial, saying it could cause heart rhythm problems.\n\nBut Dr. Zelenko has remained firm in his conviction, sending regular updates about new studies and patient testimonials to a contact list that includes reporters and government officials in several countries. \"I am more emboldened,\" he said in a voice memo on April 22.\n\nHydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are now being used in several clinical trials to determine their efficacy against the virus, including a trial conducted by the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and another by the pharmaceutical company Novartis, which is studying the effect of hydroxychloroquine alone.\n\nSharon LaFraniere reported from Washington, and Kevin Roose from San Francisco.",

        "body": "As visits plummet because of the coronavirus, small physician practices are struggling to survive.\n\nAutumn Road in Little Rock, Ark., is the type of doctor's practice that has been around long enough to be treating the grandchildren of its eldest patients.\n\nFor 50 years, the group has been seeing families like Kelli Rutledge's. A technician for a nearby ophthalmology practice, she has been going to Autumn Road for two decades.\n\nThe group's four doctors and two nurse practitioners quickly adapted to the coronavirus pandemic, sharply cutting back clinic hours and switching to virtual visits to keep patients and staff safe.\n\nWhen Kelli, 54, and her husband, Travis, 56, developed symptoms of Covid-19, the couple drove to the group's office and spoke to the nurse practitioner over the phone. \"She documented all of our symptoms,\" Ms. Rutledge said. They were swabbed from their car.\n\nWhile the practice was never a big moneymaker, its revenues have plummeted. The number of patients seen daily by providers has dropped to half its average of 120. The practice's payments from March and April are down about $150,000, or roughly 40 percent.\n\n\"That won't pay the light bulb or the rent,\" said Tabitha Childers, the administrator of the practice, which recently laid off 12 people.\n\nWhile there are no hard numbers, there are signs that many small groups are barely hanging on. Across the country, only half of primary care doctor practices say they have enough cash to stay open for the next four weeks, according to one study, and many are already laying off or furloughing workers.\n\n\"The situation facing front-line physicians is dire,\" three physician associations representing more than 260,000 doctors, wrote to the secretary of health and human services, Alex M. Azar II, at the end of April. \"Obstetrician-gynecologists, pediatricians, and family physicians are facing dramatic financial challenges leading to substantial layoffs and even practice closures.\"\n\nBy another estimate, as many as 60,000 physicians in family medicine may no longer be working in their practices by June because of the pandemic.\n\nThe faltering doctors' groups reflect part of a broader decline in health care alongside the nation's economic downturn. As people put off medical appointments and everything from hip replacements to routine mammograms, health spending dropped an annualized rate of 18 percent in the first three months of the year, according to recent federal data.\n\nWhile Congress has rushed to send tens of billions of dollars to the hospitals reporting large losses and passed legislation to send even more, small physician practices in medicine's least profitable fields like primary care and pediatrics are struggling to stay afloat. \"They don't have any wiggle room,\" said Dr. Lisa Bielamowicz, a co-founder of Gist Healthcare, a consulting firm.\n\nNone of the money allocated by lawmakers has been specifically targeted to the nation's doctors, although the latest bill set aside funds for community health centers. Some funds were also set aside for small businesses, which would include many doctors' practices, but many have faced the same frustration as other owners in finding themselves shut out of much of the funding available.\n\nFederal officials have taken some steps to help small practices, including advancing Medicare payments and reimbursing doctors for virtual visits. But most of the relief has gone to the big hospital and physician groups. \"We have to pay special attention to these independent primary care practices, and we're not paying special attention to them,\" said Dr. Farzad Mostashari, a former health official in the Obama administration, whose company, Aledade, works with practices like Autumn Road.\n\n\"The hospitals are getting massive bailouts,\" said Dr. Christopher Crow, the president of Catalyst Health Network in Texas. \"They've really left out primary care, really all the independent physicians,\" he said.\n\n\"Here's the scary thing -- as these practices start to break down and go bankrupt, we could have more consolidation among the health care systems,\" Dr. Crow said. That concerns health economists, who say the steady rise in costs is linked to the clout these big hospital networks wield with private insurers to charge high prices.\n\nWhile the pandemic has wreaked widespread havoc across the economy, shuttering restaurants and department stores and throwing tens of millions of Americans out of work, doctors play an essential role in the health of the public. In addition to treating coronavirus patients who would otherwise show up at the hospital, they are caring for people with chronic diseases like diabetes and asthma.\n\nKeeping these practices open is not about protecting the doctors' livelihoods, said Michael Chernew, a health policy professor at Harvard Medical School. \"I worry about how well these practices will be able to shoulder the financial burden to be able to meet the health care needs people have,\" he said.\n\n\"If practices close down, you lose access to a point of care,\" said Dr. Chernew, who was one of the authors of a new analysis published by the Commonwealth Fund that found doctor's visits dropped by about 60 percent from mid-March to mid-April. The researchers used visit data from clients of a technology firm, Phreesia.\n\nNearly 30 percent of the visits were virtual as doctors rushed to offer telemedicine as the safest alternative for their staff and patients. \"It's remarkable how quickly it was embraced,\" said Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, a hospitalist and associate professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School, who was also involved in the study. But even with virtual visits, patient interaction was significantly lower.\n\nAlmost half of primary care practices have laid off or furloughed employees, said Rebecca Etz, an associate professor of family medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University and co-director of the Larry A. Green Center, which is surveying doctors with the Primary Care Collaborative, a nonprofit group. Many practices said they did not know if they had enough cash to stay open for the next month.\n\nPediatricians, which are among the lowest paid of the medical specialties, could be among the hardest hit. Federal officials used last year's payments under the Medicare program to determine which groups should get the initial $30 billion in funds. Because pediatricians don't generally treat Medicare patients, they were not compensated for the decline in visits as parents chose not to take their children to the doctor and skipped their regular checkups.\n\n\"This virus has the potential to essentially put pediatricians out of business across the country,\" said Dr. Susan Sirota, a pediatrician in Chicago who leads a network of a dozen pediatric practices in the area. \"Our waiting rooms are like ghost towns,\" she said.\n\nPediatricians have also ordered tens of thousands of dollars on vaccines for their patients at a time when vaccine rates have plunged because of the pandemic, and they are now working with the manufacturers to delay payments for at least a time. \"We don't have the cash flow to pay them,\" said Dr. Susan Kressly, a pediatrician in Warrington, Pa.\n\nEven those practices that quickly ramped up their use of telemedicine are troubled. In Albany, Ga., a community that was an unexpected hot spot for the virus, Dr. Charles Gebhardt, a doctor who is treating some infected patients, rapidly converted his practice to doing nearly everything virtually. Dr. Gebhardt also works with Aledade to care for Medicare patients.\n\nBut the telemedicine visits are about twice as long as a typical office visit, Dr. Gebhardt said. Instead of seeing 25 patients a day, he may see eight. \"We will quickly go broke at this rate,\" he said.\n\nAlthough he said the small-business loans and advance Medicare payments are \"a Godsend, and they will help us survive the next few months,\" he also said practices like his need to go back to seeing patients in person if they are to remain viable. Medicare will no longer be advancing payments to providers, and many of the small-business funding represents a short-term fix.\n\nWhile Medicare and some private insurers are covering virtual visits, which would include telephone calls, doctors say the payments do not make up for the lost revenue from tests and procedures that help them stay in business. \"Telehealth is not the panacea and does not make up for all the financial losses,\" said Dr. Patrice Harris, the president of the American Medical Association.\n\nTo keep the practices open, Dr. Mostashari and others propose doctors who treat Medicare and Medicaid patients receive a flat fee per person.\n\nEven more worrisome, doctors' groups may not be delivering care to those who need it, said Dr. Mehrotra, the Harvard researcher, because the practices are relying on patients to get in touch rather than reaching out.\n\nSome doctors are already voicing concerns about patients who do not have access to a cellphone or computer or may not be adept at working with telemed apps. \"Not every family has access to the technology to connect with us the right way,\" said Dr. Kressly, who said the transition to virtual care \"is making disparities worse.\"\n\nSome patients may also still prefer traditional office visits. While the Rutledges appreciated the need for virtual visits, Kelli said there was less time to \"talk about other things.\"\n\n\"Telehealth is more inclined to be about strictly what you are there for,\" she said.\n\nPrivate equity firms and large hospital systems are already eying many of these practices in hopes of buying them, said Paul D. Vanchiere, a consultant who advises pediatric practices.\n\n\"The vultures are circling here,\" he said. \"They know these practices are going to have financial hardship.\"",

        "body": "LONDON -- Not for the first time in the coronavirus era, the British government is going its own way.\n\nThis time, the National Health Service is moving forward with an app to track the spread of the virus despite questions about the technology's effectiveness, privacy safeguards and compatibility with key iPhone and Android features.\n\nOfficials are counting on the technology, which is designed to alert anyone who may have come into contact with an infected person, to help ease lockdown orders that have been in place since March. But a dispute over privacy -- and over how much data the authorities can collect -- has hampered the rollout and pitted the government against Apple and Google, which are pushing a competing design for exposure tracing.\n\nIn this instance, the British government may be overmatched by the Silicon Valley titans, which control the software that runs on nearly every smartphone on the planet. Unless Britain changes course, the companies are refusing to provide access to a Bluetooth signal on iPhones and Android phones that is needed to measure proximity.\n\nThat has left Britain with a stark choice: either alter the design or risk releasing an app with major technical flaws.\n\nAt its heart, the debate is about balancing public health and individual privacy. In Britain, which has a history of robust government surveillance to fight terrorism, officials say that more can be learned about the virus by collecting lots of information in a centralized database. They argue this will provide more research capabilities to spot emerging hot spots and patterns of how the virus spreads.\n\nBy contrast, Apple and Google are promoting a decentralized approach that would protect against invasions of privacy. But the government says that privacy considerations are only part of a complex calculus it is trying to navigate.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Europe is desperate to salvage summer tourism. But can it? Poland postpones election after push to hold it this week. Britain's central bank forecasts a 30 percent drop in economic activity. See more updates Updated 3m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\n\"If privacy was the only thing that we were optimizing for then it may be that a decentralized approach should be the default choice,\" Matthew Gould, the head of NHSx, the division of the National Health Service that is building the app, said in a House of Commons hearing this week. \"But actually we're balancing a number of things.\"\n\nThe British authorities said that the data would not include personally identifiable information, and that access would be limited to those working on the pandemic response. A committee in Parliament has called for legislation creating privacy protections around the app.\n\nIn opposing Britain's effort, Apple and Google are supported by academics, security researchers and privacy groups that want to restrict government data collection, saying that, whatever the safeguards, a centralized database creates too much potential for abuse. Britain's top privacy regulator, Elizabeth Denham, said last month that a decentralized model should be a \"starting point\" for contact tracing.\n\n\"It is vital that, when we come out of the current crisis, we have not created a tool that enables data collection on the population, or on targeted sections of society, for surveillance,\" a group of more than 170 scientists wrote in an April 29 statement opposing the British app's design.\n\nTo enforce their view, the companies will provide important access to a phone's Bluetooth signal only to tracing apps that store health information on a person's smartphone. This prohibits data from being uploaded and stored on government servers.\n\nMany have raised additional concerns that the British app allows self-reporting, a feature that could easily be abused.\n\nThere are signs that Britain may be bending to the criticism. Mr. Gould told Parliament this week that the government was continuing to speak with Apple and Google, and that the country could change its approach.\n\nThe health service awarded a contract to a Swiss company, Zuhlke Engineering, to \"investigate\" building a tracing app using the Apple and Google specifications, according to documents obtained by the research firm Tussell and first reported by The Financial Times.\n\nIt would not be first time Britain had taken an alternative path in responding to the coronavirus, before changing course. In March, as many countries began to shut down, Britain kept schools and businesses open, before increasing deaths and infection rates eventually led to a lockdown. Britain now has one of the highest death tolls in Europe.\n\nWidespread testing and contact tracing are universally cited as critical steps to restarting economies without reigniting the epidemic.\n\nApps are designed to significantly speed up contact tracing by quickly identifying people who are most at risk of infection. The technology works by using a smartphone's Bluetooth signal to measure proximity to nearby devices.\n\nAfter an infected person shares the information on the app, anyone they have had close interactions with will receive an alert with instructions to self-isolate. A log is kept of the phones of people who have come within a certain distance of each other, like those sitting next to each other on a bus or subway.\n\nBritain began testing its app this week on the Isle of Wight, an island off the southern coast with about 140,000 people. As the country struggles to perform enough virus tests and provide protective gear for health workers, leaders are trumpeting the app as progress.\n\nIan Levy, of the National Cyber Security Center, likened the technology to John Snow, the scientist who in 1854 traced a cholera outbreak in London to a contaminated water pump. The British health minister, Matt Hancock, said citizens who downloaded the app would be doing their \"duty.\"\n\nAfter people report symptoms through the app, their information will be sent to the N.H.S. It will then perform an automated risk assessment to identify other app users who may have come into contact with the infected person.\n\nBut critics say the British app will not work effectively unless it uses code provided by Apple and Google. In Australia, an app with a similar design has been criticized for technical problems. Germany recently reversed to support the Apple-Google specifications. Austria, Italy and Switzerland are using it as well.\n\nBritain is moving forward with its app despite a lack of evidence that any tracing technology will help fight the virus without widespread testing, an area where the country has lagged behind others in Europe. An added challenge is that useful technology needs a huge portion of the population to participate. A recent study by epidemiologists at Oxford University estimated that, to be effective, 60 percent of the population must use the app, a figure on par with omnipresent apps like WhatsApp. (Mr. Gould differed with that estimate, saying that even 20 percent would be useful.)\n\nCarly Kind, director of the Ada Lovelace Institute, a policy research group focused on technology, said prematurely releasing an ineffective app would undermine public trust. \"A bad app is definitely worse than no app,\" she said.\n\nLuciano Floridi, director of the Digital Ethics Lab at Oxford University, warned against \"looking at technology as the savior,\" when a pandemic requires broader public health and medical solutions. He said more testing and thousands of human contact-tracers were needed to track the disease.\n\n\"This will be a small component in a much larger approach,\" said Mr. Floridi, who is on a government advisory board related to the app. \"Hopefully, it will not do any harm.\"",

    "Ecuador's Death Toll During Outbreak Is Among the Worst in the World": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nQUITO, Ecuador -- With bodies abandoned on sidewalks, slumped in wheelchairs, packed into cardboard coffins and stacked by the hundreds in morgues, it is clear that Ecuador has been devastated by the coronavirus.\n\nBut the epidemic is even worse than many people in the country realize.\n\nThe death toll in Ecuador during the outbreak was 15 times higher than the official number of Covid-19 deaths reported by the government, according to an analysis of mortality data by The New York Times.\n\nThe numbers suggest that the South American country is suffering one of the worst outbreaks in the world.\n\nThe figures provide a dire indication of the damage the virus can do to developing countries, where it can quickly overwhelm health care systems and even the government's ability to keep count of how many people are falling to the disease.\n\n36,000 Missing Deaths: Tracking the True Toll of the Coronavirus Crisis\n\nFar more people have died over the past month than have been officially reported, a review of mortality data in 12 countries shows.\n\n\"There were people dying at the doors of our clinics and we had no way of helping them,\" said Marcelo Castillo, head of an intensive care unit in a private hospital. \"Mothers, husbands, asking in tears for a bed, because, 'You are a doctor, and you have to help us.'\"\n\nA staggering number of people -- about 7,600 more this year -- died in Ecuador from March 1 to April 15 than the average in recent years, according to an analysis of official death registration data by The Times.\n\nThat spike stands in stark contrast to the number of deaths that the government has officially attributed to the coronavirus: 503 people by April 15.\n\nMortality data in the middle of a pandemic is inexact, and it could change. The additional deaths include those from Covid-19, as well as from other causes, including people who could not be treated at hospitals inundated with coronavirus patients.\n\nBut the data points to an enormous, and sudden, increase in deaths. Three times the number of people died in Ecuador than usual during the first two weeks of April, when the number of people falling ill reached a peak -- an extraordinary rise that exceeds increases seen in similar data from Spain and the United Kingdom.\n\nEcuador's beleaguered government, which is also dealing with its worst economic crisis in decades, acknowledged early in the outbreak that its official mortality figures fell far short of reality.\n\n\"We know that both the number of infections and the number of deaths are falling short,\" Ecuador's president, Len\u00edn Moreno, said in a public address on April 2. \"The reality always overtakes the number of tests and the speed of attention\" of medical services, he said.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Ecuador could have 15 times as many coronavirus deaths as the official figure, an analysis shows. Merkel: 'Let us not squander what we have achieved.' The pandemic is shaking beliefs about American exceptionalism. See more updates Updated 1m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nThere has been a surge of infections in the province that includes Ecuador's business capital, Guayaquil, where residents are thought to have brought the virus home after visiting Spain.\n\nIn Guayaquil, fatalities during the first two weeks of April were eight times higher than usual, the data indicates -- a far greater rise than that of New York City, where fatalities were four times higher in recent weeks.\n\nWithin weeks of the first case being identified in Guayaquil, hospitals were overflowing and burial systems collapsed under overwhelming demand, leaving dead bodies to pile in the streets and pushing families to bury loved ones in coffins made of cardboard.\n\nWhile the images shocked Latin America and the world, the true scale of the crisis has largely been obscured by the government's limited ability to determine who has the virus, a situation exacerbated by global shortages of tests and other materials, said Cynthia Viteri, Guayaquil's mayor.\n\n\"We will never know what the real number is, because there are no tests,\" Ms. Viteri said.\n\nIn early April, the government created a task force to deal with the precipitous climb in the number of dead bodies that needed attention in Guayaquil. At the peak of the crisis, the team collected and authorized the burial of five times as many bodies than would normally be buried in the city on any given day.\n\nThe wave of deaths is all the more disturbing for being impossible to explain. There is no obvious reason for Ecuador to be devastated far more than other countries. Its population is relatively young, and most people live in rural areas, both factors that should reduce the risk, said Jenny Garcia, a demographer who studies Latin America at the Institut National d'\u00c9tudes D\u00e9mographiques in France.\n\nThat mystery is reflected in the pandemic's uneven consequences around the world, raising questions no one has been able to answer. Are some places just lucky? Do unknown local factors lead to dramatic differences?\n\nMedical workers in Guayaquil and local residents who have lost their loved ones described the despair that washed over the city during the peak of the epidemic in early April. The virus spread through the usually bustling port city of three million with bewildering speed, hitting the plush suburban gated community of Samborond\u00f3n and the working-class district of Febres Cordero particularly hard.\n\n\"I fall asleep with anxiety, not because I fear infection -- I actually don't think about it -- but because of the overload,\" said Dr. Castillo, who works in an intensive care unit in Samborond\u00f3n.\n\nIn another city hospital, the Teodoro Maldonado Carbo, a doctor who did not want to give his name because he has been asked not to speak to the media, described what he said were scenes out of a horror film.\n\nThere were corpses in wheelchairs, in stretchers and on the floor in the emergency area, he said. The smell was such that the staff refused to enter.\n\nSeveral of his colleagues fell sick and waited in wheelchairs for patients to die, hoping it would give them a chance to use a ventilator.\n\nThe spike in deaths caused chaos and anger outside hospitals and morgues, as grieving families struggled to recover the bodies of family members or to collect their death certificates. In the city's poorer neighborhoods, some residents said they had to wait for up to six days in the 90-degree heat for emergency services to collect the bodies of deceased relatives and neighbors.\n\nDar\u00edo Figueroa, a handyman, said he dressed in a homemade protective suit made of garbage bags and spent nearly 12 hours searching for his mother's body in the overflowing morgue of Guayaquil's Guasmo Sur hospital in late March.\n\nThere were hundreds of decomposing bodies stacked in piles, he said, as if they were sacks of potatoes or rice.\n\n\"The reek was insufferable,\" he said. \"The morgue was packed, as were the corridors -- they were very long, and filled with corpses. The waiting room was filled with corpses.\"\n\nMr. Figueroa said he finally buried his mother five days after her death from respiratory symptoms. She died on arrival to the hospital without being tested for the virus.\n\nA national lockdown ordered by the government in mid-March appears to be bearing fruit, as official infections rates have stabilized. Deaths also fell sharply in Guayaquil last week. Official figures show 128 died on April 15 in Guayas, the province that includes Guayaquil. That's down from 614 on April 1.\n\nDespite the respite, Mr. Moreno, the president, said the country is facing one of its toughest moments in its 200-year history, as the economic cost of the pandemic has been compounded by the collapse of export revenues, ruptures in the country's main oil pipelines and massive foreign debt payments.\n\nHe is now facing a tough choice between keeping a paralyzed economy shuttered longer, or risking a resurgence of the virus.\n\nUnder pressure from business groups, Mr. Moreno said this week he's considering relaxing the lockdown and allowing some industries to go back to work. The news was greeted with anxiety in Guayaquil, where many residents are torn between a desire to return to work and fear of reliving the chaos of the past weeks.\n\n\"The pandemic is not over,\" said Gina Mendoza, a Guayaquil nurse who has recently recovered from coronavirus. \"We are scared of what could happen.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWith tens of thousands of schools in dozens of states now shuttered through the remainder of the school year because of the coronavirus pandemic, an estimated 55 million students will be home from school for double the length of their normal summer vacations, if not longer.\n\nNow some experts are warning that one of the likely health consequences for many housebound children will be an increase in the unhealthy levels of weight gain typically seen during summer breaks.\n\n\"The stay-at-home orders and the social distancing are the right thing to do\" to slow spread of the virus, said Andrew G. Rundle, the lead author of a new report in the journal Obesity on school closings and childhood weight gain. \"But this six month period or longer is doubling out-of-school time, and it's magnifying or exacerbating all of the risk factors that we think about for summer weight gain.\"\n\nWhile focusing on the immediate effects of the pandemic is a priority, Dr. Rundle and his co-authors point out that when it subsides one of its lingering effects could be a worsening of the obesity crisis among children. Childhood obesity rates have been on the rise in America for the past four decades, with more than a third of all youth under the age of 19 classified as overweight or obese. Studies show that overweight children are much more likely to become overweight adults, and that puts them at a higher risk of developing heart disease, cancer and Type 2 diabetes.\n\nBut in recent years researchers have begun to recognize that summer recess plays a major role in unhealthy weight gain. At least a half dozen studies have found that children gain weight at a faster rate during the summer months than during the school year. The effect is especially pronounced for children in minority groups or those who are already overweight.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. President Trump unveils a plan to help states expand testing. Experts say it is not enough. The C.D.C. expands the list of symptoms, and the W.H.O. warns of a long road ahead. States have different strategies for restarting the economy. Trump suggests opening some schools. See more updates Updated 5m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nOne large study that tracked thousands of schoolchildren for five years starting in kindergarten found that school had a protective effect on their body compositions: On average, children saw their body mass index fall by 1.5 percentile points during the school year and then jump about 5 percentile points during their summer vacations.\n\n\"What is very apparent from the data is that kids experience unhealthy weight gain during the summer, that it's more so for African-American and Hispanic kids, and that the weight gain that occurs during the summer does not get worked off during the school year,\" said Dr. Rundle, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"It's a stepwise pattern where the summer is the step up and the school year is the flat part of the step.\"\n\nUltimately, some experts believe that the structured nature of the school day, with its scheduled exercise periods and limited chances to snack, is what helps protect children from excess weight gain. When children are at home for the summer, their days may be less regimented and less supervised, allowing them to indulge in more snacks and sedentary behaviors -- similar to the factors that lead adults to eat more on weekends and pack on extra pounds during the holidays.\n\nData are limited, but there are early signs that the coronavirus shutdowns have prompted a rise in unhealthy behaviors that drive weight gain. Americans have stocked up on shelf-stable foods of all kinds, but sales of ultra-processed comfort foods like Oreo cookies, potato chips and macaroni and cheese have soared. Television and online video game usage have surged. Many playgrounds, especially in large urban areas, are now closed.\n\nThough no two schools are the same, there are many reasons school environments can prevent excessive weight gain. Most schools offer students some level of exercise through physical education, team sports, and daily lunch and recess periods. Many children get about half their daily calories at school, which are required to provide meals that meet nutrition standards for components like sodium, whole grains, lean protein and fruits and vegetables. While junk foods can still be found in school cafeterias, many schools have worked to eliminate sugary beverages, candy and chips from their lunch lines and vending machines.\n\nDuring the summer vacation, it's the reverse. Studies find that children spend more time sitting in front of screens watching television and playing video games. They tend to consume more snacks and sugary beverages and eat fewer fruits and vegetables. That may especially be the case for children from low-income households that depend on schools to provide healthy meals. About 30 million children across the country receive free or subsidized school meals.\n\nDr. Rundle and his colleagues suggested in their new paper that schools, parents and policymakers could mitigate the long-term impact of the pandemic on children's health by promoting exercise and healthy eating -- where possible -- during the lockdowns. Some schools, for example, have developed home lesson plans for exercise to go along with their lesson plans for math and English. Schools that are able to stream classes online might consider having their P.E. teachers stream exercise classes too, Dr. Rundle said.\n\nFood is the trickier part of the equation. For some families right now, venturing outside to find healthy options at depleted grocery stores may not be possible. And with many parents stressed about their jobs, finances and other challenges, the prospect of fighting with their kids about food can be a hard sell -- especially if they are worried about being able to put any food on their tables at all.\n\nBut with children facing limited options for physical activity, now more than ever is the time to try to limit unnecessary calories from sugar-sweetened beverages and excessive snacking, said Dr. Rundle. One good resource for stressed families is the American Heart Association, which provides quick, heart-healthy recipes on its website -- like tuna stir fry, chicken salad, hummus and vegetarian three-bean chili -- that can be made with canned foods and other inexpensive pantry items.\n\nFor families that rely on school meals to feed their children, many school districts across the country have been providing grab-and-go meals. Some are offering five meals at a time and allowing parents to pick up food without their children being present. In some districts, schools are packing up meals and having bus drivers deliver them to families along their normal routes.\n\nParents can find out where to get free meals through their school districts. They can also find meal service sites in their neighborhood using the federal government's Summer Food Service Program website. For many children, these services could mean the difference between having a nutritious lunch and breakfast or not having any food at all, said Eliza Kinsey, a co-author of the new paper and a research scientist in the department of epidemiology at the Mailman School of Public Health.\n\nThat could set the stage for many consequences: Studies show that children who grow up in food-stressed households face a higher risk of obesity, behavioral issues and other chronic health problems.\n\n\"If kids are missing meals and not able to get replacements, then we're looking at a very large increase in food insecurity,\" she said. \"There are a lot of serious long-term health implications for low-income families if those meals are missed and not being replaced.\"",

        "body": "The Food and Drug Administration is permitting a Rutgers lab to start selling spit-collection kits to detect the coronavirus.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said on Friday that it had granted emergency authorization for the first at-home saliva collection kit to test for the coronavirus.\n\nThe test kit was developed by a Rutgers University laboratory, called RUCDR Infinite Biologics, in partnership with Spectrum Solutions and Accurate Diagnostic Labs. Rutgers received F.D.A. permission last month to collect saliva samples from patients at test sites but can now sell the collection kits for individuals to use at home. They will cost about $100 each, Rutgers said, and must be ordered by a physician.\n\n\"A patient can open the kit, spit into the tube, put the cap back on and ship it back to our lab,\" said Dr. Andrew Brooks, chief operating officer and director of technology development at RUCDR.\n\nDr. Brooks said the tests should be used only by people who have Covid-19 symptoms. His lab can process 20,000 tests each day, with a 48-hour turnaround, but he expects other labs to adopt it for their own use.\n\nThe spit tests are part of a rapid emergency response effort by the F.D.A. to help developers of novel tests for the coronavirus quickly get to market. Last month, the agency authorized the first type of at-home kit for the virus in the United States, a kit sold by LabCorp that enables people to swab their own noses and send the samples to be tested at the company's labs around the country.\n\nNow, at a time when some states say they are still facing a shortage of tests, the at-home spit-collection kits have the potential to widen the audience for virus screening. By keeping people with symptoms at home, instead of asking them to come into medical centers to be tested, the spit kits could reduce the risk of spreading the infection to health care workers. They may also appeal to people who would feel more comfortable spitting into a cup than having swabs inserted into their nose.\n\n\"This combines the ease of saliva collection with at-home collection,\" said Dr. Stephen Hahn, the F.D.A. commissioner, in an interview on Friday.\n\nSome public health experts, however, have cautioned that at-home sampling kits can also come with downsides. One is that it can take longer for people to get test results when they use at-home kits that need to be sent to labs. Because the infection can take several days to develop, they said, the time lag could result in some people receiving false negative test results for coronavirus. Physicians, they said, should make patients aware of the limitations.",

        "body": "SEATTLE -- An innovative coronavirus testing program in the Seattle area -- promoted by the billionaire Bill Gates and local public health officials as a way of conducting wider surveillance on the invisible spread of the virus -- has been ordered by the federal government to stop its work pending additional reviews.\n\nThe program involved sending home test kits to both healthy and sick people in the hope of conducting the kind of widespread monitoring that could help communities safely reopen from lockdowns. Researchers and public health authorities already had tested thousands of samples, finding dozens of previously undetected cases.\n\nBut the program, a partnership between research groups and the Seattle and King County public health department that had been operating under authorization from the state, was notified this week that it now needs approval directly from the federal government. Officials with the Food and Drug Administration told the partnership to cease its testing and reporting until the agency grants further approval.\n\n\"Please discontinue patient testing and return of diagnostic results to patients until proper authorization is obtained,\" the F.D.A. wrote in a memo.\n\nThe delay is the latest evidence of how a splintered national effort to develop, distribute and ramp up testing has left federal regulators struggling to keep up. Amid concerns about the reliability of a burgeoning number of coronavirus antibody tests -- which check whether someone may have previously had the virus -- the F.D.A. responded last week by ordering companies to submit data proving their accuracy.\n\nBut the Seattle program does not test for antibodies and has wide backing, from public health leaders to the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center to Mr. Gates, whose foundation has been deeply involved in fighting the pandemic. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also provided an in-person technical adviser to the project.\n\nDr. Eric Topol, the director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, who is not involved in the Seattle group, said it had \"emerged as leading lights in this whole Covid-19 crisis.\" He said it was \"bizarre\" that the F.D.A. would halt such a project.\n\nThe Seattle partnership that is conducting the testing, the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network, said in a statement that it had been in conversation with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about its program for about 10 weeks and submitted data a month ago.\n\n\"We are actively working to address their questions,\" the group said.\n\nThe program has roots in the Seattle Flu Study, which over the fall and winter had collected thousands of samples from people in Washington State who had symptoms of illness. As previously detailed in The New York Times, researchers there had struggled to get government approval to test those old samples for coronavirus and report the results.\n\nBy the end of February, those researchers ended up doing some testing anyway, discovered the first case of community transmission in the region and provided key evidence that the virus had likely been circulating for weeks.\n\nMr. Gates, the Microsoft co-founder who has committed much of his wealth to global public health issues, has backed the Seattle study. He said in a blog post Tuesday that the program can detect cases and help guide public health responses.\n\n\"Not only will it help improve our understanding of the outbreak in Seattle, it will also provide valuable information about the virus for other communities around the world,\" Mr. Gates wrote.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Fears grow over new outbreaks as more states lift restrictions on bars, beauty shops and other businesses. The latest retail sales report depicts the largest two-month decline on record. Who's enforcing mask-wearing rules? Often it's retail workers. See more updates Updated 4m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAn F.D.A. spokesperson said home collection kits raised additional concerns about safety and accuracy that required the agency's review. The issue in the Seattle case appears to be that the test results are being used not only by researchers for surveillance of the virus in the community but the results are also being returned to patients to inform them.\n\nThe two kinds of testing -- surveillance and diagnostic -- fall under different F.D.A. standards. In a pure surveillance study, the researchers may keep the results just for themselves. But coronavirus testing has largely revolved around getting results returned to doctors who can share the results with patients.\n\n\"We had previously understood that SCAN was being conducted as a surveillance study,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nPrivate companies have also rushed to promote at-home test kits, and the F.D.A. approved the first one available for purchase in April.\n\nDr. Topol said it would not make sense to have people swab their noses and then not give them their test results.\n\n\"To withhold that information from people is downright absurd,\" Dr. Topol said.\n\nAt-home testing kits have been touted as a valuable alternative to in-office or drive-through testing because they do not require a clinician to risk exposure when swabbing a patient's nose. They have also emerged at a time when public health leaders are looking for ways to rapidly expand testing to look for hot spots and trends.\n\nA Harvard Global Health Institute report last week estimated that the United States needed to be conducting at least 900,000 tests daily, but tracking reports indicate the country is doing about one-third that amount.\n\nDr. Topol said the country probably needed to ramp up to do millions of tests daily. The infrastructure needed for expansive drive-through testing would be difficult to achieve, he said, and could miss people who do not want to leave their home to drive to a site.\n\n\"Home testing is really the only way we can get massive testing in the United States,\" he said.\n\nThe Seattle testing group said it has been in conversation with the F.D.A. since the beginning of March and initiated the process to obtain federal approval on March 23. That process included submitting data from testing so far on April 13.\n\nThe group said F.D.A. officials have requested data regarding the program's use of nasal swabs. Researchers submitted data validating both the safety and reliability of the swabs in home-based collection, they said. They provided studies demonstrating that any coronavirus samples would remain stable for more than a week at the full range of temperatures typical in the Seattle area. They also provided information about internal controls that allow the organization to determine whether a sufficient specimen was collected to guarantee accurate test results.\n\nThe testing group said the F.D.A. has also asked for more information about the program's effort to test people who do not have symptoms.",

        "body": "The risks of reopening the country too soon will be a focus of government hearings on Tuesday. The White House's new mask requirement won't apply to President Trump.\n\nThis briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHere's what you need to know:Fauci will issue a stark warning on the risks of reopening too soon.The White House plans to ask officials -- but not Trump -- to wear face masks.The baseball season could open in July, with empty stands (to start).Elon Musk announces that Tesla will restart production despite a county order.To reopen, Washington State restaurants must record information about customers.Los Angeles County sheriff says inmates tried to infect themselves by sharing cups.Trump uses misleading numbers to praise his administration's virus response.Fauci will issue a stark warning on the risks of reopening too soon.\n\nDr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and a central figure in the government's response to the coronavirus, intends to warn the Senate on Tuesday that Americans would experience \"needless suffering and death\" if the country opens up too quickly.\n\nDr. Fauci, who has emerged as perhaps the nation's most respected voice during the coronavirus crisis, is one of four top government doctors scheduled to testify remotely at a high-profile hearing on Tuesday before the Senate Health Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.\n\nIt will be his first appearance before Congress since President Trump declared a national emergency in March, and a chance for him to address lawmakers and the public without President Trump by his side. He has been largely out of public view since last week, when Mr. Trump abandoned his daily briefings with his coronavirus task force.\n\nIn an email to the New York Times reporter Sheryl Gay Stolberg late Monday night, Dr. Fauci laid out what he intended to tell senators.\n\n\"The major message that I wish to convey to the Senate HLP committee tomorrow is the danger of trying to open the country prematurely,\" he wrote. \"If we skip over the checkpoints in the guidelines to: 'Open America Again,' then we risk the danger of multiple outbreaks throughout the country. This will not only result in needless suffering and death, but would actually set us back on our quest to return to normal.\"\n\nDr. Fauci was referring to a three-phase White House plan, Opening Up America Again, that lays out guidelines for state officials considering reopening their economies. Among its recommendations: States should have a \"downward trajectory of positive tests\" or a \"downward trajectory of documented cases\" of coronavirus over two weeks, while conducting robust contact tracing and \"sentinel surveillance\" testing of asymptomatic people in vulnerable populations, such as nursing homes.\n\nBut many states are reopening without meeting those guidelines, seeking to ease the economic pain as millions of working people and small-business owners are facing ruin while sheltering at home.\n\n\"We're not reopening based on science,\" said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"We're reopening based on politics, ideology and public pressure. And I think it's going to end badly.\"\n\nThe much-feared second wave of infection may not wait until fall, many scientists say. Instead, it may become a series of wavelets occurring unpredictably across the country.\n\nDr. Fauci himself is now in \"modified quarantine,\" he has said, after what he described as a \"low risk\" exposure to someone infected with the virus.\n\nCoronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count\n\nA detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.\n\nThe White House plans to ask officials -- but not Trump -- to wear face masks.\n\nNew guidance released to Trump administration employees will require them to wear masks when inside the West Wing, according to an internal memo released on Monday and obtained by The New York Times.\n\n\"As an additional layer of protection, we are requiring everyone who enters the West Wing to wear a mask or face covering,\" read the memo, which was distributed to staff members through the White House management office.\n\nThe new guidance is an abrupt establishment of a policy after two aides working near the president -- a military valet and Katie Miller, the vice president's spokeswoman -- tested positive for the coronavirus last week.\n\nThe new rules are not expected to apply to President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence, who for weeks have downplayed the need to wear masks, an attitude that had trickled down to staff members. The policy was first reported by The Washington Post.\n\nBut hours after the White House instituted the new rule, Mr. Trump denied that any system designed to keep aides safe had broken down. He said he had required that everyone wear masks, insisting that the disease was \"very well-contained\" at the White House.\n\n\"It can happen,\" Mr. Trump said. \"It's the hidden enemy. Remember that.\"\n\nThe White House also made some smaller changes on Monday, including displaying signage encouraging social distancing at entryways and asking aides if they were displaying symptoms during routine temperature checks, according to officials.\n\nThe spread of the virus into the White House comes amid a potential collision between Washington residents and the area's largest employer, the federal government. The region is not yet open for business, and cases of the virus are climbing in Washington, Maryland and Virginia.\n\nDr. Anand Parekh, the chief medical adviser for the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the several hundred thousand federal employees in the region should not return to work until several criteria have been met, including the presence of personal protective equipment.\n\n\"Their gradual return,\" he said, \"should be predicated upon the region having adequate testing capacity, a decline in confirmed cases for two to three weeks, a health care system that is under capacity with adequate P.P.E. and critical medical material, and a public health infrastructure that has enough contract tracers.\"\n\nIn Washington, where few of those benchmarks have been met, the percentage of positive tests is roughly double the upper limit that experts consider sufficient to consider reopening, with confirmed cases still on the upswing. As of Monday morning, there have been 6,389 total cases in the District of Columbia and 328 deaths, a higher rate of death than in most states. The city reported 19 deaths on Friday, the most in Washington in a single day.\n\nWhen the city reopens, it will beckon thousands of staff members serving senior officials and flocks of lobbyists, service personnel and tourists. City officials have limited autonomy to challenge any federal decisions, given the government's control over a large percentage of the work force and vast swaths of buildings and land.\n\nThe baseball season could open in July, with empty stands (to start).\n\nMajor League Baseball has formalized its plan to return to the field, with teams agreeing Monday on a proposal to send to the players' union. It calls for an 82-game season -- rather than the usual 162 -- that would start without fans in early July and would include an expanded playoff field.\n\nThe plan must clear major obstacles. Even if the union accepts it, the sides would also have to agree on a salary structure for players. The league would also need to have enough tests for players and employees without depleting the public supply, and agree with the union on working conditions, including protocols in case of positive tests.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Health experts testify about dangers of reopening the country too soon. The California State University system will not hold classes on campuses this fall. Testing becomes a flash point in the Senate hearing. See more updates Updated 32m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nTo minimize travel, teams would play only against divisional rivals as well as teams in the corresponding geographic division of the opposite league.\n\nTeams would also carry expanded rosters, perhaps up to 50 players, with at least 30 available for each game; rosters usually number 26 active players.\n\nOwners want the players to share in the industry's financial burdens. The league has proposed paying players based on how much money is earned during the shortened season, with teams splitting revenues 50-50 with athletes.\n\nAt least one player, the Washington Nationals closer Sean Doolittle, urged caution.\n\n\"Bear with me,\" he said on Twitter, \"but it feels like we've zoomed past the most important aspect of any M.L.B. restart plan: health protections for players, families, staff, stadium workers and the workforce it would require to resume a season.\"\n\nElon Musk announces that Tesla will restart production despite a county order.\n\nElon Musk, the chief executive of Tesla, said on Monday that the electric-car company was resuming production at its assembly plant in Fremont, Calif., even though it had not yet been cleared to do so by local health authorities.\n\n\"Tesla is restarting production today against Alameda County rules,\" he announced on Twitter. \"I will be on the line with everyone else. If anyone is arrested, I ask that it only be me.\"\n\nThe county's health officer has said he hopes to work out an agreement with Tesla to open the plant on May 18. The plant is Tesla's main source of revenue and has been closed since early April. County officials have not authorized the resumption of indoor manufacturing over fears that the coronavirus could spread among large groups working in proximity.\n\nIn an email that was sent on Monday and that was reviewed by The New York Times, Tesla's head of human resources in North America, Valerie Workman, told employees they would be contacted within 24 hours about when to report for work.\n\nThe state has authorized a resumption of manufacturing, Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Monday, but that \"we recognize localism\" and that \"if a county doesn't want to go as far,\" local orders would prevail.\n\nTo reopen, Washington State restaurants must record information about customers.\n\nRestaurants in Washington State that want to open their doors for dine-in service will have to keep a log of customers and their contact information, according to requirements made public on Monday night.\n\nThe new rules allow restaurants in eight small counties that have gained approval from the state to begin serving customers in their establishments. Other requirements include hand sanitizer at entrances, no bar seating, no more than 50 percent occupancy, cloth face coverings for all workers and single-use menus.\n\nThe tracking rule requires restaurants offering table service to record a daily log of customers that will be kept for 30 days. The log should include the person's contact information and the time the person visited.\n\nState officials said the requirement would help with contact tracing if a case linked to a given restaurant emerges.\n\nWhile Washington has started opening small counties that have not reported a new coronavirus case in at least three weeks, the rules also set the stage for other parts of the state that could have restaurant reopenings in the coming weeks.\n\nIn Colorado, public health officials on Monday suspended the license of a restaurant that opened on Mother's Day in defiance of a ban on dine-in services, the latest escalation in mounting tensions between state authorities and residents who oppose restrictions.\n\nThe restaurant, C&C Coffee and Kitchen, in Castle Rock, attracted widespread criticism, as well as support, after videos posted online on Sunday showed customers -- most of whom were not wearing masks -- filling tables and not bothering to maintain social distance.\n\n\"I'm so happy so many people came out to support the Constitution and stand up for what is right,\" April Arellano, the owner, told The Castle Rock News-Press on Sunday. \"We did our time. We did our two weeks. We did more than two weeks ... and we were failing. We had to do something.\"\n\nBut public health officials on Monday ordered the restaurant to close until it complied with a state order prohibiting dine-in eating. Gov. Jared Polis called the restaurant an \"immediate health hazard\" during a news conference and urged residents to abide by public health protocols.\n\n\"We all have laws that we agree with and laws we disagree with,\" Mr. Polis said. \"But it's our responsibility as Coloradans, and as Americans, to follow the law.\"\n\nLos Angeles County sheriff says inmates tried to infect themselves by sharing cups.\n\nInmates in Los Angeles County jails have attempted to infect themselves with Covid-19 in an effort to be released during the pandemic, the county sheriff, Alex Villanueva, said on Monday.\n\nSurveillance footage from one correctional facility appeared to showed inmates sipping water from a shared bottle and a plastic foam cup, in what Sheriff Villanueva said was an effort to spread the infection.\n\n\"As a direct result of the behavior seen in the video, 21 men tested positive for Covid-19 within a week,\" officials said in a news release.\n\nInmates also tried to create false symptoms by drinking hot water in an effort to raise their oral temperatures immediately before being checked by a nurse, the sheriff said. Another video captured a separate group of inmates \"huffing\" on a face mask that they passed around, officials said.\n\n\"Their end game was to try to force their release by having a widespread propagation of the virus within our custody environment,\" Sheriff Villanueva said in an interview.\n\nSince late February, Los Angeles County has released more than 5,300 inmates from county jails, the sheriff said. Nearly 5,000 inmates have been quarantined, and 357 have tested positive for the virus; 117 have fully recovered.\n\nOfficials said they discovered the inmates' efforts to infect themselves while investigating increases in positive cases at jail facilities in April.\n\nTrump uses misleading numbers to praise his administration's virus response.\n\nPresident Trump made a series of misleading statements on Monday at a Rose Garden news conference praising his administration's response, declaring that \"we have met the moment, and we have prevailed,\" on testing.\n\nUsing a misleading benchmark, Mr. Trump, flanked by large posters that proclaimed \"America leads the world in testing,\" announced that more tests had been completed in the United States per capita than in South Korea.\n\n\"No matter how you look at it, America is leading the world in testing,\" Mr. Trump declared, leaving out the fact that South Korea had carried out rigorous testing early and flattened its curve. South Korea has reported 256 deaths, while the United States has reported over 80,000.\n\nMr. Trump also misrepresented the status of cases in the United States.\n\n\"The numbers around our country are dropping very substantiality,\" he said, although data compiled by The New York Times shows that cases in the United States are declining slightly, not substantially, and are growing in some areas. More than 20,000 new cases have been announced almost every day in recent weeks, not the sharp descent scientists had hoped for.\n\nThe president was most enthusiastic about what he said was his administration's track record on testing.\n\n\"We are testing more people per capita than South Korea, the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, Finland and many other countries,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThis was accurate, but omitted at least 25 countries where testing on a per capita basis was higher than the United States, including Germany, Russia, Spain, Canada, Switzerland, according to statistics compiled by Our World in Data.\n\nLouisiana joins the ranks of states that are reopening some businesses.\n\nIn Louisiana, which had one of the earliest outbreaks in the United States after Mardi Gras, Gov. John Bel Edwards said on Monday that he would lift the state's stay-at-home order on Friday and allow churches, hair and nail salons, gyms and casinos to open with some restrictions.\n\nIn South Carolina, where dine-in restaurant service resumed Monday, Gov. Henry McMaster said that on May 18, restrictions would be lifted on gyms, spas and pools, along with barbershops, hair and nail salons and tattoo parlors.\n\nAs states around the country weigh reopening, many are looking to the experience of Georgia, one of the first states to allow a broad array of businesses to reopen. Two weeks after Georgia eased its restrictions, the number of new cases there has remained relatively steady -- though experts cautioned it was still too soon to assess the public health effects.\n\n\"It's kind of a wait and see,\" said Andreas Handel, an associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Georgia, who estimated that people who caught the virus in the first week after reopening may only now be showing symptoms and getting tested. It can take several more days after diagnosis for new cases to show up in data.\n\n\"Personally, I don't feel like I can say yet what the impact is,\" he said. \"By the end of May, I feel like I would know better.\"\n\nUnder the first phase of Louisiana's reopening plan, which is expected to remain in place until June 6, nonessential businesses cannot exceed 25 percent of their occupancy. In addition, employees must wear face masks and customers must follow social distancing.\n\n\"Without your hard work and compliance to the stay-at-home order, we wouldn't have been able to accomplish what we have accomplished,\" Mr. Edwards said.\n\nBut he added: \"This isn't 'mission accomplished.' We're not declaring victory.\"\n\nIn Illinois, which is still under a stay-at-home order, a staff member for Gov. J.B. Pritzker has tested positive, prompting the governor to order all employees in the office to temporarily work from home. Mr. Pritzker will work from home as well.\n\nGov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts said on Monday that the state planned to follow a four-stage strategy for reopening businesses, but he cautioned that it would only go ahead if there was a \"sustained downward trend\" in virus-related cases and deaths.\n\nPressed by two female reporters, Trump abruptly ends his news conference.\n\nPresident Trump abruptly ended his Rose Garden news conference shortly after a Chinese-American reporter pressed him on why he suggested she \"ask China\" in response to her question on virus death rates.\n\nWeijia Jiang, a White House correspondent for CBS News, asked Mr. Trump why he had created a \"global competition\" by claiming that the United States had done far better than any other country on testing its citizens for the virus.\n\n\"Why does that matter,\" Ms. Jiang asked, \"if every day Americans are still losing their lives and we're still seeing more cases every day?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Mr. Trump responded, \"they're losing their lives everywhere in the world, and maybe that's a question you should ask China.\"\n\nMs. Jiang, who had been leaning into a contact-free microphone to ask her question, lowered her face mask and paused for a couple seconds before asking, \"Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically?\"\n\nKaitlan Collins of CNN tried to ask Mr. Trump a question after briefly ceding her turn at the microphone to let Ms. Jiang follow up, but Mr. Trump tried to move on. After Ms. Collins remained at the microphone and twice tried to ask her question, Mr. Trump abruptly ended his news conference and left the Rose Garden.\n\nMr. Trump has frequently accused female journalists -- often reporters of color -- of asking \"nasty\" questions and not showing enough deference to the rosy pictures he has tried to paint about his pandemic response efforts.\n\nA divide between red and blue states is driving a congressional dispute over aid.\n\nWhen Senator Mitt Romney of Utah strode into a luncheon with fellow Republicans last week, he was carrying an oversized poster that bore a blunt message: \"Blue states aren't the only ones who are screwed.\"\n\nTwo days later, Senator Rick Scott, Republican of Florida, made the opposite pitch, arriving at another party gathering with his own placard that showed how rosy his state's financial picture was compared to those of three Democratic states: California, Illinois and New York. Why should Congress send help to struggling states and cities, he argued, when the bulk of the aid would go to Democratic strongholds with histories of fiscal mismanagement?\n\nThe two senators -- both former governors -- were taking sides in what is emerging as a contentious debate among Republicans shaping the next sweeping package of federal coronavirus relief. With many states and cities experiencing devastating fiscal crises during the pandemic, Democrats have joined bipartisan groups of governors and mayors in pressing for as much as $700 billion for troubled states, cities and towns.\n\nBut Republicans are divided over how much aid to provide and what conditions to place on the money. Much of the dispute is being driven by the political bent of the states that stand to benefit or lose.\n\nThe disagreement is another reminder that as Mr. Trump and a divided Congress make decisions about federal relief, politics is never far from their calculations. Now Democrats are urging action on the next phase of assistance even as Mr. Trump and Republicans argue that the government should wait to see how the economy is faring before enacting another sweeping stimulus law.\n\nStates run by Democrats and Republicans alike are projecting steep drops in tax collections and weighing spending cuts.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Monday that five Western states had sent a letter to congressional leaders requesting an additional $1 trillion in assistance to states across the nation. \"This is the requirement of this moment,\" Mr. Newsom said.\n\nA new study offers details of American children seriously sickened by the virus.\n\nAs concern grows over the potential for children to become seriously ill from the virus, a new study paints the most detailed picture yet of American children who were treated in intensive care units throughout the United States as the pandemic was taking hold in the country.\n\nNone of the children in the study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, were stricken by the mysterious new inflammatory syndrome linked to the virus that can cause life-threatening cardiac issues in children. They experienced the virus's primary line of attack: the severe respiratory problems that have afflicted tens of thousands of American adults.\n\nThe study looked at 48 cases from 14 hospitals of infants during late March and early April. Two of the children died. Eighteen were placed on ventilators, and two of them remained on breathing machines more than a month later, said Dr. Lara S. Shekerdemian, the chief of critical care at Texas Children's Hospital and an author of the study.\n\nA vast majority of the patients -- 40 children, including the two who died -- had pre-existing medical conditions. Nearly half of those patients had complex developmental disorders.\n\n\"You can read this either like a half-empty glass or a half-full glass,\" said Dr. Daniele De Luca, the president-elect of the European Society for Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care, who was not involved in the study. \"At the end of the day, we have to realize that this disease can actually be serious in children.\"\n\nNew York will begin a limited reopening upstate.\n\nIn the most concrete step toward restarting his battered state, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced on Monday that three upstate regions might partially reopen this weekend, with limited construction, manufacturing and curbside retail.\n\nThe move would come 10 weeks after the state's first confirmed case of the virus, which has killed more than 26,000 people in New York and sickened hundreds of thousands more. But that toll has been largely borne by New York City and its suburbs, with far fewer cases and fatalities thus far in the state's more rural regions.\n\nBoth city and state data have suggested that New York City has made progress in containing the outbreak and reducing transmission. But a ban on large gatherings and the widespread closures of nonessential businesses probably would not end before June, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Monday before the governor's announcement.\n\nOn Monday, the governor cautioned that the reopening would be gradual, and that it was predicated on the infection rate in those regions remaining low. Officials would \"be able to pull the plug or slow down the increase in activity\" if the virus spread more quickly.\n\nThe state's nonessential businesses have been closed and large gatherings have been banned since March 22, under a stay-at-home order set to expire this week. The state would allow certain low-risk business and activities to resume operating on Friday, including landscaping and gardening work, outdoor recreation such as tennis and drive-in movie theaters.\n\nThe number of new virus hospitalizations was at its lowest number since March 19, before the state's shutdown began, Mr. Cuomo said. An additional 161 people had died of the virus -- the lowest daily death toll since March 27, the last time that reported deaths were under 200.\n\nPennsylvania's governor comes under attack from Trump.\n\nPresident Trump on Monday lashed out at Pennsylvania's governor, a Democrat, accusing him of seeking to delay reopening the state in an effort to damage the president's re-election campaign.\n\n\"Don't play politics,\" Mr. Trump said on Twitter. \"The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails,\" Mr. Trump wrote, adding \"be safe, move quickly!\"\n\nResponding to Mr. Trump, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf said, \"I don't know how you stay safe and move quickly.\"\n\nThe president's attack comes as states across the country are grappling with keeping residents safe and lifting restrictions on businesses. In Pennsylvania at least a half dozen counties announced in recent days that they would defy Mr. Wolf's stay-at-home order and that local district attorneys would decline to prosecute any violations of the order.\n\nMr. Wolf has said the easing of orders is based on where counties are in terms of cases. To county-level politicians defying his order, he said they were \"engaging in behavior that is both selfish and unsafe.\"\n\nSpeaking during a news conference on Monday, Mr. Wolf warned that businesses operating in defiance were opening themselves up to an array of penalties, from the loss of liquor licenses and health department certification to the cancellation of insurance. He also threatened to withhold funding for counties that violate the order.\n\n\"The commonwealth closed down the state in a measured, staged manner and we're reopening in the same measured, staged manner,\" he said. \"The irresponsible thing to do, as I said earlier, is to just willy nilly go back and pretend we can wave a magic wand and go back into business and suspend the reality of this virus that surrounding us.\"\n\nThe governor, whose response to the virus has gotten broad approval in the state in recent polls, has separated all of the state's counties into different phases for easing restrictions based on certain conditions. By the end of the week, a little more than half of the state's counties are expected to be partially opened.\n\nA watchdog is investigating whether a Trump administration official steered aid to Alaska tribes.\n\nA federal watchdog is investigating whether a top Interior Department official violated ethics rules when she helped decide how a critical tranche of funds for Native American tribes in the $2.2 trillion stimulus law should be distributed.\n\nSeveral tribal governments are suing the federal government over its decision to allow Alaska Native Corporations, for-profit businesses that support Alaska natives, to receive a portion of the $8 billion set aside for tribes.\n\nLawmakers and some tribal leaders have raised concerns about the involvement of Tara Sweeney, the assistant secretary of Indian Affairs, in that decision. Ms. Sweeney is a shareholder in the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation, the wealthiest of the Alaska Native corporations, having previously served as its executive vice president of external affairs.\n\nThe Interior Department's inspector general informed lawmakers on Friday that he would review Ms. Sweeney's role and that of other department officials in the matter \"to determine whether there was adherence to ethics rules and regulations and compliance with the ethics pledge\" related to the funding.\n\nThe inspector general, Mark Lee Greenblatt, also told Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, that in late April the department had started investigating allegations that the Interior Department had inappropriately leaked sensitive tribal data submitted as part of the application for the relief, according to a letter obtained by The New York Times.\n\nThe data breach intensified frustration among tribal governments, who are among the most vulnerable and hardest hit by the pandemic, about how the federal government was handling the distribution of the critical aid. The funding was frozen until last week amid the legal dispute about how it should be parceled out.\n\nMr. Udall, the top Democrat on the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, had requested a review of both episodes and asked that the department give his panel \"departmental ethics guidance and/or waivers granted to Ms. Sweeney related to her potential financial conflicts of interest, direct or imputed to her.\"\n\nThe Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nConsumers are pessimistic about home prices and keeping their jobs.\n\nMany consumers expect to lose their jobs and see home prices stall -- or even decline -- over the coming year, according to a Federal Reserve survey. Given that peoples' homes are often their largest investment, that could spell even more trouble for the economy.\n\nFor the first time since the Federal Reserve Bank of New York started its survey of consumers in 2013, the median consumer did not expect home prices to increase over the next year. More than 44 percent of April respondents actually expected home prices to decline, and that pessimism was broad-based across demographic groups and regions.\n\nAs recently as February, consumers expected 3 percent home price appreciation. The swift deterioration in their outlook underlines how much the coronavirus lockdown, which has left millions out of work and has made loans harder to come by, could threaten the housing industry.\n\nMortgage credit availability has tumbled to its lowest level since late 2014, a Mortgage Bankers Association index showed last week, as lenders shy away from borrowers with low credit scores and those looking for large mortgages. That could blunt the economic benefit of the Fed's recent rate cuts, as consumers struggle to benefit directly from lower borrowing costs.\n\nConsumers were glum along other dimensions, too. They increasingly expected to lose their jobs, putting the chances over the coming year at 20.9 percent in April, a new series high.\n\nof staff, David Cleary, said in a statement that the Republican senator tested negative on May 7 and had not shown any symptoms.\n\nMr. Alexander decided not to return to Washington and will self-quarantine in Tennessee \"out of an abundance of caution,\" Mr. Cleary said.\n\nBiden attacks Trump's leadership in responding to the pandemic.\n\nFormer Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, criticized Mr. Trump's response to the virus in an op-ed and called his strategy of deflecting blame \"childish\" and divisive.\n\nCiting the Americans who continue to fall ill and die from the disease, the devastated economy and false promises about how much the federal government would help the states, Mr. Biden made the case that Mr. Trump is not equipped to lead the country at such a critical time.\n\n\"It is an extraordinary moment -- the kind that begs for urgent, steady, empathetic, unifying leadership,\" Mr. Biden wrote in the opinion piece, which was published by The Washington Post.\n\nMr. Biden's comments come as states are grappling with striking the appropriate balance between physical and economic health. Many states are struggling without sufficient federal support, he said, something the president has the power to provide.\n\n\"That responsibility falls on Trump's shoulders -- but he isn't up to the task.\"\n\nMr. Biden also criticized Mr. Trump for not following through on a promise to get testing equipment to states -- a key tool for governors who are considering easing restrictions.\n\n\"It was a baldfaced lie when he said it, and it still isn't remotely true,\" Mr. Biden wrote.\n\nFollow updates from our international correspondents.\n\nMany countries have falling rates of infection, hospitalizations and deaths. But with no vaccine, they are moving cautiously toward reopening, wary of a surge in new cases.\n\nReporting was contributed by Wilson Andrews, Mike Baker, Pam Belluck, Julie Bosman, Audra D.S.

        "body": "NEW YORK -- With less than three weeks to go until her baby was due, Aziza Hasanova packed her bags and prepared for what she expected to be a relatively smooth delivery at a Brooklyn outpost of one of New York City's leading hospitals.\n\nBut as the coronavirus pandemic swept across the city, all her planning was suddenly thrown into disarray.\n\nWhen she was 38 weeks pregnant, the hospital, NYU Langone in Brooklyn, canceled her last checkup, and Hasanova said a clerk at the hospital discouraged her from coming in because of the risks of being exposed to the surging number of patients infected with the coronavirus.\n\nHasanova, who lives in Midwood, Brooklyn, grew anxious.\n\n\"I was really scared just to go to the hospital because for pregnant women it's very risky getting the virus,\" Hasanova said.\n\nThe solution she landed on seemed the only option so late in her pregnancy: giving birth at home. Luckily, she found an available midwife.\n\nAs the pandemic has battered hospitals across New York and other parts of the country, there has been a sharp increase in demand for midwives who can deliver babies at home or in facilities that are not part of the traditional health care system.\n\n\"People are reconsidering their birth plans and doing whatever they need to avoid hospitals,' said Sarita Bennett, president of the Midwives Alliance of North America.\n\nJeanette Breen, a midwife for over three decades who delivered Hasanova's baby, described her business as \"a whirlwind of activity. We're getting late transfers.'\n\n\"They don't want to be involved with COVID and they would feel much safer at home,' she added.\n\nBreen, who is based on Long Island, said she helped eight women deliver in the first three months of this year. But in April, she has had more than 25 inquiries, she said, nearly all of them women who had initially planned hospital deliveries with doctors.\n\nOn Monday, the administration of Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced the creation of a panel to find ways to quickly authorize free-standing birthing centers as alternatives to hospitals.\n\n\"Birth centers can serve as a safe alternative for low-risk pregnancies -- relieving the strain on hospitals and providing a supportive environment for mothers during an already stressful time,' said Melissa DeRosa, the top aide to Cuomo.\n\nNYU Langone, in a statement about Hasanova's assertions, said it had adopted practices to keep pregnant women safe and has \"continued to provide uninterrupted services to mothers scheduled to deliver at the hospital.'\n\n\"It is unfortunate, as it seems, that in the case of this family, this was not the message they received,\" the hospital said.\n\nSome hospitals have been so overwhelmed that gynecologists and obstetricians have been diverted to treat coronavirus patients, said Dr. Michael Nimaroff, an obstetrician-gynecologist and senior vice president at Northwell Health, New York's largest health care provider.\n\nWomen fear being infected in hospitals, though the greater risk appears to be that they might have asymptomatic COVID-19 and infect hospital staff.\n\nSome expectant mothers have tested positive after delivering in hospitals, and some midwives, many of whom work in hospitals, have fallen sick too.\n\nAccording to a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, 88% of expectant women who tested positive for the virus at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center between March 22 and April 4 were asymptomatic when they arrived at the facilities.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)Meghan Perez, 35, a hairstylist on Long Island, is 26 weeks pregnant and decided on a home birth after originally planning to deliver at Stony Brook University Hospital.\n\n\"One night when things were getting more serious and overwhelmed at our hospital, my husband said to me, 'Let's do a home birth,'\" she said.\n\nThe couple reached out to a private midwifery practice and were among 15 couples interviewed on the same day. The practice, Gaia Midwives, has been inundated with calls and is now booked until September.\n\n\"When we were notified that they would take us on under their care, I felt like I was accepted to the college of my choice,\" Perez said.\n\nBefore the health crisis Perez said she had briefly entertained the idea of a home birth but never thought of it seriously.\n\nNow, the pandemic \"has changed labor and delivery as we once knew it.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)Some hospitals are making changes in response to the concerns of pregnant women and to protect their own staff.\n\nNorthwell Health, with obstetric units at 10 hospitals, said it was testing expectant mothers for the virus before they are admitted.\n\nA mother who is infected but asymptomatic would be kept 6 feet away from her newborn except for breastfeeding. A mother showing symptoms would almost immediately be isolated from her child, Nimaroff said. \"Unfortunately, the mom can't bond with the baby,\" he said.\n\n\"There are a number of pregnant patients who have certainly developed the infection and many patients do test positive,\" he added. \"Some obviously are very sick from corona.\"\n\nBut, Nimaroff said, the hospital \"is still a safe space to have a baby.\"\n\nIn New York state, there are roughly 1,150 certified nurse-midwives, according to state figures. Most work in hospitals. A smaller number specialize in home births.\n\nIn about half the states, home deliveries are illegal because they are considered too dangerous. Other states, like New York, place restrictive rules on home births, including a requirement that midwives have a written practice agreement with a doctor or hospital.\n\nPedro Frisneda, deputy press secretary at the New York City Department of Health, cautioned against making changes to birth plans late in pregnancy. \"The hospital birthing experience may not be what was expected, but the care provided will be safe and of the utmost quality,\" he said.\n\nAnd in some cases women planning to deliver at home have ended up needing to go a hospital anyway because births were not progressing properly, a process that could be more fraught now given slower ambulance response times.(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)But the risks have not dissuaded nervous expectant mothers from upending their original plans.\n\nTrinisha Williams, director of midwifery at the Brooklyn Birthing Center, one of three free-standing birthing centers in New York, said the facility had received about 15 inquiries per week before the pandemic. Last week, it received 200 calls.\n\n\"We are overflooded,\" she said, adding that the center is planing to soon open a second site in Manhattan.\n\nMidwives deliver babies as naturally as possible, without the aid of doctors or drugs unless there is an emergency. Women considered low risk are the most appropriate candidates.\n\n\"I'm having women call saying, 'I want a C-section here,'\" Williams said. \"But we don't do that.\"\n\nAnother factor driving some women toward home births are new rules barring partners from being with mothers after they give birth, meaning women face recovery time alone.\n\nThat is why Jacqueline Aiello, 33, whose due date is in July, decided to switch from a hospital delivery at Mount Sinai South Nassau to the Brooklyn Birthing Center.\n\nShe wanted to be close to her family. \"I'm hopeful of bringing a baby in a safe environment and not worry about germs and the harms that COVID is bringing to the hospital,\" she said.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)There are no guarantees that birthing centers or home births offer full protection from infection. The Brooklyn Birthing Center said it was testing clients, but midwives who perform home births do not necessarily get tested or require that their patients do so.\n\n\"Of course I wash my hands, but I don't wear a mask,\" Breen said. \"That is not part of my belief system.'\n\nOn April 5, Breen rushed to Hasanova's home where she helped Hasanova place light blue waterproof pads on her bed and two shower curtains under the bedding set. Hasanova dimmed the lights, breathed and started reciting a prayer.\n\nAt around 11 p.m., she gave birth to Abdurrahim, a healthy boy weighing 9.04 pounds.",

        "body": "For two months, I shot New Yorkers responding to the pandemic. I'm still processing what I saw.\n\nTimes Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\n\nFor two months this spring, the New York-based photographer Philip Montgomery was on assignment for The New York Times Magazine, documenting the unfolding coronavirus crisis. Often shooting multiple stories a day, he spent one week photographing health care workers inside New York hospitals. Overall, he captured images for four magazine articles, including two cover stories. One of those, a look at one funeral home in the Bronx, is in the magazine this weekend.\n\nBy Philip Montgomery\n\nAs told to Pia Peterson\n\nBefore the crisis hit, I was working on a lot of studio-based portraiture work. All of those assignments had to be put on hold when the pandemic closed down the country. That was a really jarring reality, but I've since come to see it as an opportunity to dive back into my background in reporting.\n\nA lot of my early assignments were to capture the mood of the city. It felt haunting. People were still processing what was happening, and there was a lot of uncertainty and shock and fear. I had no desire to leave. There was no world in which I would abandon the city that's given me so much, and I think that part of being a New Yorker is sharing in the collective experience of the city, in good times and in bad. On a personal front, and a journalistic one, it was the story of our time.\n\nWhen Kathy Ryan, the magazine's director of photography, reached out to me about this assignment, she impressed upon me the importance of this historical moment. We felt a huge responsibility to show the unvarnished truth of the unfolding pandemic in our backyard. New York was about to be horribly overwhelmed.\n\nFrom the beginning, our objective was to capture the experiences of front line health care workers. I was photographing how the city was mobilizing forces in testing facilities and in makeshift hospitals like the one in the Javits Center. I was trying to approach it like a beat reporter would cover the city. I took thousands upon thousands of photos -- if I was in the middle of a shoot and something became more relevant, I would immediately pivot to that new scene because it all added up to the greater story of the virus escalating in New York.\n\nGoing into the hospitals for the first time was a mixed bag. The whole experience was traumatizing, and it was terrifying to see the sheer volume of patients suffering there. We saw a system that had been transformed, and we saw health care workers working tirelessly to treat all New Yorkers.\n\nThe immediate read was fear and trauma, but on the other side of the coin there was hope and calm because the doctors and nurses conveyed a capability, that in their hands we would be OK. It was a roller coaster of emotions. We would be hit by the reality of what was happening, and then be in the presence of these doctors who were so focused and clear and unwavering, and it was beautiful.\n\nI felt the immense responsibility of being an eye witness for the reader. You can see it in the photographs -- there was a scene inside Queens Hospital Center where two paramedics, had brought in a Covid patient who was flatlining. We watched as they worked on saving this man and, against anyone's expectations, brought him back to life.\n\nGiven the number sheer volume of patients, they had to work on him in the middle of the E.R. on a rolling stretcher. There was no other room to bring him to. They did not slow in their fight to save this man's life, and when they brought him back they moved him directly into the sea of hospital beds and were immediately on to the next thing. The moment was a testament to the strength of the workers, and also a look at the wave of Covid patients at that time and how unending it was.\n\nAfter photographing inside emergency departments and I.C.U.s across the city, my assistant, Tre Cassetta, and I had gotten into a safety routine that we felt comfortable with. Most of my preparation for the assignment inside funeral homes was more psychological in nature. Would families understand our motives for wanting to be with them during this impossibly difficult time? Were we being too invasive? How could we effectively tell the story of 20,000 lives lost in New York? These were the questions I worked through in my preparations.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A whistle-blower tells a House panel to expect the 'darkest winter in modern history' if changes are not made.

So I had a baseline understanding for how these businesses function and what it's like to be inside of one. I expected it to feel calm, systematic and frankly a bit eccentric. Over all, I thought funeral homes were an indispensable part of the mourning process and that they gave a semblance of closure to grieving families.\n\nWith this weekend's story at the Farenga Brothers Funeral Home in the Bronx, there was a full-circle feeling. I was really affected by the amount of our fellow New Yorkers who had lost their lives. We really saw the funeral home as a vessel in which we could illustrate that. What it all came down to was a similar feeling as the hospitals -- it was devastating to see what I saw there.\n\nBut at the same time, you were struck by this incredible resilience that was displayed by the funeral directors, who were working around the clock to make sure that they were serving New Yorkers in the final process. There was a feeling of deep-rooted sorrow, but I was in awe of their work.\n\nWe spent countless hours with Sal and Nick Farenga -- fifth-generation funeral home directors at one of the oldest funeral homes in the city -- as they took calls, picked up bodies and created space to store the bodies, given the influx of coronavirus deaths. Sal and Nick were the embodiment of professionalism in a time of absolute chaos. With the families, I wanted to understand who they had lost. What had the person meant to their community? What was the legacy they would leave behind?\n\nThe picture on the cover was taken at the funeral service for Paramjit Singh Purewal. His wife, Gurmit Kaur, was in the hospital with Covid-19 symptoms, and she was placed on a ventilator. When she was able to make it through, she found out her husband had died.\n\nIn the photograph, she places her gloved hand on his head as he's in the coffin and she says goodbye. In many ways, this is a scene of mourning that you could see at any funeral across America, but what places this image at this place in time is the glove.\n\nIt's such a small detail, but it signifies how the virus has really shaped our daily lives. It has shaped death and the process of mourning. Because of insurance and health concerns, funerals and gatherings have become sparse. The mere act of embracing a loved one has become a great risk. Families are desperate for closure, and that closure has often been delayed.\n\nOver the course of these shoots, I learned about the reality behind the numbers. It's one thing to follow the news and the statistics, but it's another to witness the underlying tragedy up close. I learned how important it is for loved ones to say goodbye and mark the passing with a ceremony.\n\nI really hope this work promotes empathy for fellow Americans. We all have a role to play in this, and I hope these pictures show that we are all trying our best. I also hope it serves as a record in our collective history.\n\nHow has it affected me? I'm not really sure. I'm still processing it. I have no idea because I'm still moving through it.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn the first weeks of March, the in-demand hip-hop dance makers Keone and Mari Madrid were as busy as they wanted to be. Along with performing Off Broadway in their breakout dance drama, \"Beyond Babel,\" they were rehearsing daily as choreographers of the Broadway-bound musical based on Britney Spears hits, \"Once Upon a One More Time.\"\n\nOn March 13, all that stopped. The performances were put on hold, as were the rehearsals, and the Madrids, a married couple who had planned on months of shuttling between New York and Chicago for a now-canceled tryout run of \"One More Time,\" decided to move home to San Diego.\n\nIt was around then that Keone noticed his first symptoms.\n\nHe felt sore, but that's not unusual for a dancer. He felt achy, but that's not uncommon after a cross-country flight. Then came fevers and chills, which made it all seem like the flu, except that he had already had the flu a few months earlier.\n\nWhy couldn't he taste and smell anything? In a text exchange with colleagues who shared that symptom, he learned that it might be a sign of Covid-19, which is of course what he had feared. He called the San Diego health hotline, and since he had no respiratory problems, was told to stay home and quarantine himself.\n\n\"Luckily, we have a spare bedroom,\" he recently recalled over a Zoom call, sitting next to his wife and 9-month-old daughter, Numah, in their kitchen. \"But it was still tough having to stay away from Mari and Numah.\" By the end of two weeks, he had recovered. Then Numah's voice went raspy and her temperature spiked.\n\nThey were allowed to bring her in for a drive-up diagnosis: backing their car into a tent so medical workers in full protective gear could examine their baby. \"It was a like an apocalyptic movie,\" Mari recalled.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As the Lakers and others return small business aid, Mnuchin says big companies could face \"criminal liability.\" Trump unveils a plan to help states expand testing.

See more updates Updated 18m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nFortunately, Numah's lungs sounded healthy. The doctor, expressing frustration with not having better options, offered them an uncomfortable throat swab test, which would likely cause them to cough all over the doctor. Since they didn't seem to be in immediate danger, and tests were in short supply, the Madrids decided to forgo them. Because of their symptoms and history of exposure, the doctor said she had \"clinically diagnosed\" them with Covid-19. They went back into quarantine for another two weeks.\n\nNumah soon recovered, and Mari's only symptoms were headaches. Amid all this, naturally, the Madrids' creative life had been shelved. But as shelter-in-place orders were extended, they started to imagine getting back to work. \"Let's try to make the most of this,\" Keone recalled thinking.\n\nThe idea of working at home wasn't far-fetched. After all, the Madrids had achieved their first fame by making a housebound dance of domestic discomfort for the wildly popular Justin Bieber video \"Love Yourself.\" (Before leaving New York, they filmed a new Bieber video, \"Confirmation,\" traipsing romantically through Central Park.)\n\nSo they started creating and posting short Instagram dance videos, characteristically cute, clever, warm and sincere. One finds silly new uses for idle luggage. Another is a danced prayer, hopeful and heartfelt. Now, after a request from The New York Times, they've made one for our readers to try.\n\nIt begins as many of their dances do: with meaningful motions for the hands. But this time, that start is an end in itself, a simple series of hand gestures that the Madrids say are meant to help people shed negative energy. They call it the \"Good Vibes Dance,\" and as they explain in their video tutorial, it can be done on the couch, at the dinner table or while washing your hands.\n\nFirst, you capture negativity by clapping your hands together. Then you open them, and alternating fingers, brush down each palm, then each top side. Lace your fingers together, pull them apart, and push those bad vibes away.\n\nIt's easy enough for everyone, children as well as adults. (That's Numah in a highchair cameo at the end.)\n\nBut more advanced dancers might try playing with repetition, picking up the pace, or getting the rest of the body involved, say with footwork. (In the video example, Keone stands on one leg.) Or Madrid-style, you could elaborate the motions into a story.\n\nWhile they are feeling fortunate, the Madrids have their share of stress to dance away. \"As artists,\" Mari said, \"we're used to having our lives in constant flux, going from being intensely in something and then having it suddenly stop. So that's not a shock to us, but the weird thing is not knowing when things are going back to normal.\"\n\nTheir industry is in disarray. Even when shows are rescheduled, they worry, will audiences show up? Colleagues have told them stories of filing for unemployment, some with ease, others encountering websites that keep crashing. Many dance studios have shut down, many have gone online. The Madrids were about to open their own, in San Diego. Now they're not sure how to proceed.\n\n\"This is all going to transform dance teaching in a huge way,\" Keone said. \"There used to be a taboo against online classes. But now I think everyone is seeing how it's never going to be better than taking classes in person but it's a great alternative to connect with people in a vast way.\"\n\n\"It's opening up a lot of doors,\" Mari added. \"People who would've learned stuff from someone's YouTube video, now they're able to have a more personal connection with a teacher and learn from the source.\"\n\nKeone has taken a few Instagram classes himself, enjoying the signs of global participation. \"It's cool to see how the whole world is going through this together,\" he said.\n\nFinding time for such activities can be tricky with an infant around and no access to babysitters.\n\n\"Grandma and Grandpa are literally two minutes away,\" Mari said, breastfeeding her daughter out of camera range. \"But they can only look at Numah from a distance.\"\n\nMostly, the Madrids take turns and switch off as parent. \"Then, from five o'clock onward,\" Keone said, \"we try to just be a family, which has also been nice. We're such workaholics, and it's been great to have to hunker down.\"\n\nSince they've been home, Numah has learned to crawl, and she's spoken her first words. If the Madrids had still been in rehearsal, these milestones might have passed while she was in the care of a babysitter. Instead, her parents were right beside her, alone together.\n\nIf you film yourself doing the dance, post a link to your video in the comments (Twitter or Instagram work best), or email a link to thearts@nytimes.com.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSince March, fertility clinics across the country have halted treatments for tens of thousands of people because of Covid-19, forcing patients to suspend their family planning. In recent days, some clinics have reopened, resuming services and procedures despite ongoing coronavirus concerns.\n\nBut shifting guidelines and minimal oversight have left clinics to decide for themselves when and how to resume in vitro fertilization, or I.V.F. At clinics where I.V.F. is ramping back up, or never slowed at all, some staff members are concerned about a lack of adequate protective equipment and safety policies.\n\nOn April 24, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine issued recommendations for restarting operations, leaving it up to individual clinics to determine how to proceed. The professional society had previously advised fertility clinics to avoid starting new treatments, postpone nonemergency surgeries and shift to telemedicine.\n\nThe shutdown generated a flurry of media attention and pushback from fertility doctors and patients. Most clinics paused starting new I.V.F. cycles, which are highly time-sensitive. But a few remained open, even operating at full capacity, causing the industry to debate when to resume care and what counts as medically urgent.\n\n\"Fertility treatment is by no means elective,\" said Leyla Bilali, a nurse at a fertility clinic in New York City, referring to the consensus that infertility is a disease. \"It's just, right now, it's not a matter of life or death.\"\n\nClinics that stayed open scrambled to implement protocols compliant with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, such as temperature checks, masks and physical distancing. Still, people have gotten sick. At Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, seven staff members have tested positive for Covid-19. At Vios Fertility Institute in Chicago, clinicians have reported flulike symptoms but have not been tested because of limited test availability. And several employees at Extend Fertility, an egg-freezing clinic in Midtown Manhattan, fell ill with possible cases of Covid-19.\n\n\"We really didn't feel it was appropriate to go out on a limb, outside major A.S.R.M. guidelines, and keep things open,\" said Dr. Bat-Sheva Maslow, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at Extend Fertility who tested positive and recovered from the virus in March. \"Covid-19 is almost impossible to control at this point. That weighed very heavily with us.\" Extend Fertility has since closed its offices to virtually all patients.\n\nAmid the pandemic, clinics face a dizzying array of vague and, at times, conflicting instructions from states, cities and health agencies like the C.D.C. Doctors must interpret guidelines as they see fit -- often the case in fertility services, which are largely paid out-of-pocket and where patient care and profit can be at odds.\n\nBecause of unclear guidance, in most states it is difficult to tell whether remaining open during the pandemic is legal or if fertility procedures are considered an essential service. New York is an exception: On April 7, the state's health department issued an advisory deeming infertility treatment an essential service, thus exempt from closure. New Jersey's governor, in an executive order responding to the coronavirus crisis, made a similar but less specific exemption, referring to general family planning services but not directly to infertility.\n\nBusiness -- but not as usual\n\nThe majority of fertility clinics nationwide halted treatments -- particularly those related to immediately getting pregnant, like I.V.F. and embryo transfers. But Reproductive Medicine Associates Network, part of the world's largest network of fertility practices, announced in April that its clinics would remain fully operational through the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Some governors face growing resistance as many businesses open their doors around the country. The F.D.A. issues the expected authorization for emergency use of a new virus treatment. The virus is now killing more people in New Jersey than in New York. See more updates Updated 12m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"We were appalled and shocked we were staying open,\" said Frances Boamah, 29, a full-time nurse at a network clinic in New Jersey.\n\nAs a post-anesthesia care unit nurse, Boamah and her colleagues interact closely with patients, providing up-close, face-to-face care.\n\n\"There's no way for nurses to properly clean our hands,\" said Erika Colindres, another nurse at Reproductive Medicine Associates in New Jersey. \"We're rationing hand sanitizers. I can't even wipe down surfaces properly. My manager says she's trying to get us more supplies but that her hands are tied.\"\n\nThe New York Times spoke to numerous employees about operations at Reproductive Medicine Associates Network, which has 19 clinics nationwide. Many spoke on condition of anonymity because they were concerned about retaliation from management.\n\nOne senior staff member, who brings her own cleaning supplies from home to disinfect her work space, said it's difficult to keep working when you don't feel supported by your organization and almost all of your competitors are closed.\n\nEmployees spoke of feeling unsafe at work because of a lack of sufficient protective gear, physical distancing and other safety measures. Several expressed frustration about being short-staffed and lacking clear communication from corporate leaders about when their colleagues and patients have tested positive for Covid-19.\n\n\"Staff morale is so low,\" Boamah said. \"But I don't want to let my co-workers down, or the patients that are still coming in. I'd feel like I was abandoning them.\"\n\nClinicians told The Times they were devoted to their patients but also wanted to support health care workers on the front lines of the pandemic by being available to work at hospitals and conserving critically needed medical supplies. They also worried about how Covid-19 might impact their patients' pregnancies.\n\n\"We don't know how the virus affects a fetus,\" said Colindres, who has worked for Reproductive Medicine Associates since 2014. \"So I don't really feel comfortable helping with embryo transfers and getting women pregnant during this time.\"\n\nHer company rebutted these characterizations. In an internal letter to staff, the network's New Jersey physicians and management team emphasized the company's mission to help patients build families, as well as its conviction that completely shutting down its practice would not benefit the public good or patients. The letter also cited limited but reassuring data indicating that coronavirus is not transmitted by a mother to the fetus.\n\n\"We're complying with all regulatory guidelines,\" said Dr. Richard Scott, M.D., founding partner of the network and chief executive officer of its parent company, IVI-RMA Global. \"We take everyone's temperature every day. We maintain strict social distancing. Everyone wears masks and gloves and we disinfect everything virtually constantly.\"\n\nCompany employees contacted for this story said temperature checks have been inconsistent and that masks and gloves are in short supply.\n\nDr. Scott said that in mid-March, as fertility clinics began to shutter, his network conducted a survey asking staff members how they felt about keeping their clinics open. Additionally, he said that managers talked to every single employee. \"We would've paid them to stay home,\" he said, noting that employees had the option of staying home through July 1 with full pay.\n\nDr. Scott has mentioned the survey to other media outlets but none of the staff members contacted for this story had heard of it or the option to stay at home with full pay. Reproductive Medicine Associates declined to offer evidence of their claims.\n\nDr. Scott said he felt the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommendations were misguided. He added that employees who chose not to come to work during the pandemic would not lose vacation days or be required to use paid time off. In at least one case, however, an employee was forced to resign while sheltering-in-place and not given a reason.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" the staff member said, who received an email from Reproductive Medicine Associates stating that staying home counted as sick days. \"It was so sudden. Obviously, I wasn't trying to leave. But I didn't want to argue with them. I didn't want to burn bridges.\" A company representative declined to comment whether any staff were terminated during the pandemic.\n\nThe economics of fertility\n\nIn recent years, investment firms have acquired a sweeping number of fertility practices, prompting concerns that clinics face increased pressure to generate revenue. Demand is high and competition between clinics is fierce. One cycle of I.V.F. can cost 10 times as much as giving birth in a hospital.\n\n\"It's a lack of regulation that's driving this and making it the Wild West,\" said Emilia Simeonova, Ph.D., a health economist and associate professor at Johns Hopkins Carey Business School. \"The more competition, the more likely people will engage in risk-taking behavior.\"\n\n\"I don't know at what point it became less about the patients and less about fertility, and so much more about money,\" Boamah said.\n\nMany clinicians, like Dr. Scott, say the original guidelines from the American Society for Reproductive Medicine advising postponing infertility treatment went too far, but it's not clear what alternative would balance the needs of patients and staff. Europe and Canada created similar guidelines, though the U.S. recommendations made exceptions for patients who were mid-treatment when the guidelines were announced, as well as for people with cancer who wanted to freeze eggs or sperm before starting chemotherapy.\n\nMany fertility patients do not have time to wait. On March 19, Olivia Smith dressed carefully for the day. Makeup, hair, a determined smile; pink sneakers and her favorite pink purse. Then the 25-year-old drove to get her biopsy results.\n\n\"I thought, 'I'm not going to get a cancer diagnosis looking classy like this,'\" Smith said, speaking from her family's home in Hillsborough, N.C.\n\nShe was diagnosed with breast cancer later that day. Her specific cancer treatment requires medication that puts her in menopause for five to 10 years. Her doctors urged her to freeze her eggs.\n\n\"It was do or die,\" said Smith, a freelance music teacher who works part-time at Starbucks for health insurance. \"We needed to get my ovaries turned off five days before I started chemo.\"\n\nSmith ultimately couldn't freeze her eggs, but was able to freeze two embryos fertilized with her boyfriend's sperm.\n\nFor cancer patients like Smith, time is especially critical. Still, the fertility community remains deeply divided about when and how to resume regular operations. Several clinicians told The Times they worry they might create new Covid-19 cases and overwhelm the health care system. Patients, too, are wary; many have canceled their appointments until the crisis has passed. Most clinics hope to fully reopen sometime this month, with risk mitigation strategies in place.\n\n\"It's definitely not business as usual,\" said Dr. Anate Brauer, M.D., director of I.V.F. at Shady Grove Fertility New York. \"We're going to have to live with this pandemic.\"\n\nTo restart care safely in an environment where Covid-19 exists, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommends fertility clinics strictly follow policies to decrease coronavirus transmission, test for immunity and maintain adequate protective equipment.\n\n\"If you can't employ those measures, then don't open, because you're going to be putting people at risk,\" Dr. Brauer said. \"And we're going to be right back where we started.\"\n\nNatalie Lampert is a journalist based in Boulder, Colo., who is currently working on a book about the future of fertility.",

        "body": "We listened as University of Kentucky administrators discussed bringing students back to campus, providing a glimpse into what other schools might do in the fall.\n\nFever checkpoints at the entrances to academic buildings. One-way paths across the grassy quad. Face masks required in classrooms and dining halls. And a dormitory-turned-quarantine facility for any students exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nThat was one vision for the fall semester at the University of Kentucky conjured up by a special committee last week -- and not the most dystopian scenario.\n\nIn a series of planning meetings on Zoom, dozens of key leaders at the university, from deans to police officers to a sorority and fraternity liaison, debated whether and how to reopen its campus in Lexington, Ky., amid an active outbreak.\n\nSimilar discussions have taken place at almost every American college and university over the last few weeks, as administrators fiercely debate whether they can safely reopen their campuses, even as most provide students with encouraging messages about the prospects of returning in the fall.\n\nOn Monday, Notre Dame became one of the first major universities in the country to announce detailed plans for bringing back students, saying it would implement a regimen of testing and contact tracing, put quarantine and isolation protocols in place, and require students to maintain social distancing and wear masks in public.\n\nNotre Dame's decision is in contrast to an announcement last week by the California State University system, which will keep its 23 campuses largely shut and teach nearly half a million students remotely. Most other universities have said they are planning to reopen in the fall, but have yet to announce specific plans.\n\nColleges were closed in a rushed and chaotic fashion two months ago, disrupting students' lives and costing tens of billions of dollars in lost revenue, according to a survey by the American Council on Education, a trade group. But opening up, though vital to the survival of some institutions, is proving much more intricate than shutting down.\n\nThe University of Kentucky allowed a reporter from The New York Times to listen in on its discussions, in part to show how deliberately administrators were working through the possibilities in such fraught times for the country.\n\n\"This is a moonshot, to do something this quickly,\" said Eli Capilouto, the university's president, who spent many years as a professor of public health policy and has led Kentucky's flagship institution since 2011.\n\nThe online discussions revealed the complicated balancing act facing the university as it considers the risks for 30,000 students and 18,000 faculty and staff members and searches for answers with limited knowledge of what the future will bring.\n\n\"Can you hear me?\" Dr. Robert DiPaola, the medical college dean, asked during one of the meetings, in what has become an oft-repeated line in the days of virtual conferencing.\n\nSitting alone at a gleaming oval conference table in his office, Dr. DiPaola injected some of the grimmest reality into the discussions, with concerns about sanitation and testing. The university might have to distribute thermometers to everyone, he said, and require students to report symptoms on a cellphone app every day to be cleared for classes.\n\nThe administrators studied complex models, considering if Kentucky could hold in-person classes before Thanksgiving and then online classes for the rest of the fall semester; if it could reduce classroom crowding through a longer day; or if it should allow only certain groups of students on campus, like freshmen, who administrators said would benefit the most from the experience.\n\nDr. Capilouto is expected to announce a decision in June. His public health background, he said, made some of the risks and challenges facing the university more clear to him. While visiting Zambia during the AIDS epidemic, for instance, he observed that treatment alone was not enough to stem a health crisis.\n\n\"You also had to change behavior,\" he said -- something that his advisers agreed would be especially difficult on a college campus. Whatever course they choose will require enforcing profound changes to the traditions of college life.\n\n\"There's no way you can have a quote-unquote old-fashioned, like fall 2019, semester again,\" Sue Roberts, an associate provost, said during one virtual meeting in her crisp English accent. \"That's not going to happen.\"\n\nTaking a team approach\n\nTo think through scenarios, the university split its administrators and advisers into three groups, named after the school's colors and mascot. There was Team Blue, Team White and Team Wildcat.\n\nAlthough the school is known for its basketball championships, athletics did not factor into the discussions, nor did a scandal that resulted Monday in the firing of the cheerleading squad's entire coaching staff.\n\nThe job of each team, plus a separate group of medical experts, was to develop scenarios that could be distilled into a final plan for the fall semester and beyond.\n\nThe list of questions they tried to answer started with the most basic: Would anyone even want to come back?\n\nStudents are tired of being at home and eager to return, offered Anna Bosch, associate dean of the college of arts and sciences. \"I know this from personal experience,\" she added, flashing a warm smile, \"because I have two colleges students living back at home with me right now.\"\n\nBut there was a divide between undergraduates and those who teach them on the question of reopening, Dr. Bosch said into her computer, a painting of clouds and water on the wall behind her.\n\nAt a recent faculty senate meeting, she had been surprised to hear from many professors who were reluctant to return. They were worried, she said, because they or someone close to them had underlying health conditions, or because they were fearful of bringing the virus home to their spouses and children.\n\nThe wary faculty might have a point, replied Capt. Rob Turner of the campus police department. The university did not operate in a vacuum, he argued.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The president says the W.H.O. must change or he will permanently end funding.

Like Indiana, where Notre Dame is, Kentucky is not currently a hot spot for known coronavirus cases. Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, is permitting businesses to gradually open up, which could put pressure on the university, a state institution.\n\nBut what, Captain Turner asked, if Fayette County public schools did not open in the fall?\n\n\"That's a really serious one,\" Dr. Bosch said. \"It'll be very difficult for us to bring everybody back on campus, including faculty and staff, if the public schools aren't open.\"\n\nIncentives for a full return\n\nThe scenario many committee members were drawn to involved bringing everyone back to campus as usual, even though it was clear that things couldn't be truly normal.\n\n\"We know there's going to be no such thing,\" said Dr. Roberts, who headed up Team Blue.\n\nBut a full return for the fall would also be the riskiest.\n\n\"We're worried,\" Dr. Roberts added. \"What would happen if there was another outbreak of Covid-19, and worse, what would happen if we, in some ways, were complicit?\"\n\nAt the same time, Dr. Roberts acknowledged that students and faculty alike were suffering \"burnout from virtual teaching and learning,\" and that continuing to hold classes online could deter students from enrolling or returning, costing millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nAlready, the university was projecting that the freshman class would shrink by about 1,000 students this fall, to 4,500, because of health and economic concerns. An online-only semester would likely push those numbers even lower.\n\nAnd Dr. Roberts said an empty campus in the fall \"might dull the enthusiasm of our donors and alums,\" further draining the school's finances. The university is projecting losses of up to $275 million this year for its campus and medical center from the virus, and $70 million next year on the academic side, and has announced plans to furlough some staff members.\n\nPart of the problem, said Kathryn Cardarelli, a senior assistant provost, was the widespread perception that remote education is inferior, motivating students to demand a tuition reduction for online courses.\n\nFrom her office with industrial yellow walls, Dr. Cardarelli, an epidemiologist, made a strong case that the pandemic offered a chance to improve and expand online education, positioning the university to capture more of that market.\n\n\"We think the university should get out ahead and control the narrative,\" she said.\n\nStudent distancing options\n\nIn case bringing everyone back proved too risky, committee members considered options to reduce the campus population, and thus reduce the likelihood of transmission.\n\nIdeas were tossed out rapidly: Maybe only freshmen and seniors should attend classes in person, which Team Blue called the \"bookend\" model.\n\nOr maybe athletes, artists or researchers would benefit most from the use of practice fields, studios and labs.\n\nTeam Blue argued for bringing back freshmen and sophomores, giving new students the chance to get their footing socially and academically and trying to alleviate the dreaded \"sophomore slump,\" while leaving more seasoned juniors and seniors to take classes mostly online.\n\n\"Freshmen have already had a terrible end to their senior year of high school, and are hungry for an on-campus experience,\" Dr. Roberts said, making Team Blue's case. \"This would set them up for success.\"\n\nAnd from a financial standpoint, she noted, it wouldn't hurt that freshmen and sophomores are the biggest users of the residence and dining halls, a valuable source of revenue for the university.\n\nThanksgiving: A danger zone\n\nJust as important as the question of whom to bring back was the matter of when, and for how long.\n\nNotre Dame said on Monday that it would start the fall semester on Aug. 10, two weeks early, and end it before Thanksgiving, forgoing fall break. South Carolina made a similar announcement, saying it would also skip fall break and switch to remote instruction after Thanksgiving.\n\nIn Kentucky, the teams debated similar ideas, talking about reconfiguring the traditional 16-week semester in a number of ways: Split it into two eight-week half-semesters, or go for 12 weeks plus four weeks, or even five, five and five.\n\nSuch changes would allow for maximum flexibility, proponents of the various scenarios said, in case another outbreak forced administrators to send students home again for virtual instruction, as they did in March.\n\nDr. Bosch wryly pointed out that there was no guarantee that the virus would return on schedule, at precisely eight weeks or five weeks. \"That didn't seem like something that we could really count on,\" she said.\n\nAnother idea, delaying the start of classes until September or October, would give the university more time for planning. But it would also push the semester later into the fall, when public health experts expect a possible second wave of cases.\n\nThanksgiving quickly emerged as a danger zone. What if students left for the holiday, then brought the virus back to campus with them?\n\n\"It's critical,\" said Donna Arnett, dean of the college of public health, to \"eliminate fall break and try to get students out of here at Thanksgiving.\"\n\nShorten the semester to 12 weeks, her side urged, and keep students away from Thanksgiving through January. To make up for lost credits, an online class could be added in December.\n\nAnd the university would have to test everyone when they returned.\n\nStudents as 'pod' people\n\nTesting, in fact, would need to be a major undertaking for in-person classes to resume, said Dr. DiPaola, the medical school dean, sitting alone at his office conference table in a suit and tie. But it might not be feasible right away.\n\nThe university currently has the ability to test about 800 people a day. But to screen everyone as they arrived on campus, he said, would require help from a private lab or the state.\n\nTo reduce the need for widespread tests during the semester, he envisioned using a cellphone app to keep sick students away from classes: If they answered \"no\" to every symptom -- cough, fever, potentially loss of smell and taste -- they would receive a \"day pass\" to flash at building entrance checkpoints.\n\nSuch an app is already being used by the university's medical staff, he said.\n\nThe nonmedical experts offered their own ideas for sanitation and social distancing: Hands-free faucets and doors that open with foot pedals. Large lecture classes broken into smaller sections. Seats blocked off in classrooms to keep students six feet apart.\n\nTeam Wildcat suggested turning residence halls into protective cocoons for living and learning.\n\n\"We have students functioning in pods, almost like family units,\" Dr. Cardarelli told her colleagues, describing the idea. \"They're spending most of their time in residence halls together with the same students.\"\n\nProfessors would come to the dorms to teach, she said, or do it via videoconference. This would reduce circulation and transmission of the virus, and make it easier to do contact tracing, her group theorized.\n\nThe student pods would take turns going to the dining halls. And, Dr. Cardarelli added, \"no more buffet.\"\n\nThe more they talked, the less it sounded like a dream experience.\n\nFor many students, part of the joy of college is playing Frisbee in the grass, studying over shared boxes of pizza, going to fraternity parties and drinking at town bars.\n\nNow the reinvention teams were talking about young adults wearing masks all day and staying six feet apart at all times. Even if administrators could enforce the rules on campus, said Andrew Smith, the assistant provost for health and wellness, what about after hours?\n\n\"How we can make that into a campus culture -- really, we didn't come up with an idea for that,\" he said.\n\nSusan Beachy contributed research.",

        "body": "Is it OK to admit that I'm grateful for the isolation of the past few months?\n\nIs it OK to admit that I'm grateful for the isolation of the past few months? Because I am. I'm relishing this liminal space, this Great Global Pause.\n\nI've been in mourning since last August when my adored doorman, Dave Burton, who always helped me zip up my dresses, died of prostate cancer. Nearly two months later, my friend Andy suffered a fatal stroke. Not long after that, another close friend, Diane, succumbed to ovarian cancer. Then, on March 1, my 53-year-old sister, Hillary, died suddenly, leaving behind a daughter, a husband and a Silicon Valley career.\n\nMy parents, brother and I were lucky enough to be able to fly to San Francisco for the funeral. But because of social distancing and the risk of infection, we canceled the shiva. It was devastating -- you want to surround yourself with people during a time like that, you want to embrace friends and family in person. But we couldn't.\n\nAnd yet, so many others are in similar, or worse, positions. Many of them can't even hold a funeral. The world is bereft. We're united in loss.\n\nEveryone knows someone who's ailing or who has died from coronavirus. Or else they're hearing about them on the news, like the story of my lovely friend Dr. Lorna Breen, who played cello with me in the New York Late-Starters String Orchestra. Lorna was on the front lines in the emergency room but ended up taking her own life. Everyone is grieving something: A person. A business. A graduation. The ability to inhale without a face covering.\n\nWe're all in the same boat. Or at least, we're all in boats. Some are bigger, some are smaller, a few will capsize, and others are parked in the Mediterranean. Wherever we're anchored, we're all in foreign waters together. It's like Hands Across America, but with masks, gloves and a six-foot berth.\n\nYet since the pandemic hit, I've never felt less alone, even though I live by myself. I came down with symptoms of the virus in early April and didn't leave my apartment for 25 days. It was terrifying. In addition to the headaches, dizziness, nausea and sore throat, it felt like Dom DeLuise was doing the hora on my chest. I felt obligated to survive; my parents couldn't lose another child. But I live in a building with a super and doormen and nearby friends who took great care of me. They brought me orange juice. They left my packages at my door. They checked in after the E.M.T.'s came and talked me through my angst. I wasn't alone.\n\nThere have been other benefits, too. As someone afflicted with a mild case of FOMO, or fear of missing out, I've long been convinced that the world was at a giant party to which I haven't been invited. It's not that I necessarily wanted to attend; I just wanted to be asked.\n\nSanctioned sequestration has pretty much quashed those feelings. There's no FOMO when there's no MO. I no longer feel like everyone's hanging out without me, because they're not. Except maybe on Zoom, but that thrill wore off after I learned how to change my backdrop.\n\nSince we began sheltering in place, I feel less pressure to do it all. I'm insulated from my own ambition, from minor social anxieties, from the demands of routine urban existence. Now that I feel better physically, I'm practicing my cello. I'm watching \"After Life\" and finally reading \"Hamilton.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The White House threatens to veto a $3 trillion relief package being debated in Congress. A test used by the White House to detect infection may produce false negatives, according to the F.D.A. Reopenings are clouded by a potentially dangerous blend of partisan politics and confused health guidance. See more updates Updated 28m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe city is quiet, and the imposed seclusion has given me room to grieve without distraction. Let's face it: One of the big hurdles right now is that we're forced to confront ourselves head on. There's no theater. No dining out. No shopping for items you think will make you happy but won't (think: scented candles). It's just us, and our pain.\n\nLockdown is conducive to sorrow. We're having real conversations about loss and heartache and death and despair. We're discovering the difference between solitude and loneliness. As someone who's always been hyper attuned to mortality -- perhaps to a fault -- I find it refreshing. The universe is finally on my page.\n\nMy mother recently told me that after her mother, my grandmother, died, she wanted to scream from the rooftops, from her car, from the produce aisle at Publix, \"MY MOTHER IS DEAD!\" Her friends were sympathetic, of course, they said and did the right things. But the trauma wasn't the same for them. How could it be? It wasn't their relative. Unfathomable though it was, the world didn't stop.\n\nUntil it did.\n\nI keep wondering what W.H. Auden would make of these last few months, whose oft-quoted poem \"Funeral Blues\" includes the lines:\n\nStop all the clocks, cut off the telephone,\n\nPrevent the dog from barking with a juicy bone,\n\nSilence the pianos and with muffled drum\n\nBring out the coffin, let the mourners come.\n\nLet aeroplanes circle moaning overhead\n\nScribbling on the sky the message 'He is Dead'.\n\nPut crepe bows round the white necks of the public doves,\n\nLet the traffic policemen wear black cotton gloves.\n\nIn a sense, Auden got his wish: The clocks have basically stopped; no one knows what day it is. The traffic policemen may not be wearing black cotton gloves, but they are wearing rubber ones. Airplanes \"circle moaning overhead,\" filled not with cheery folks on glamorous vacations, but with military personnel saluting front-line workers.\n\nTo paraphrase Auden, it really does feel like we've put out every star, packed up the moon, and dismantled the sun.\n\nI'd like to think that whenever our \"new normal\" comes, whatever it looks like, I'll be more grounded, less critical of myself, less worried about missing out. But who knows? The body forgets so quickly.\n\nMeanwhile, I take comfort in unity, in the sense of solidarity. And every night at 7, I lean out of my window and join in the whoops and whistles, the claps and clangs. I listen to the honking horns, the shouts of gratitude, and for a good five minutes I cry. For my sister. For my friends. For all of us.\n\nAbby Ellin is the author of \"Duped: Double Lives, False Identities and the Con Man I Almost Married.\"",

    "Five Ways to Follow the Coronavirus Outbreak for Any Metro Area in the U.S.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "To help provide a detailed picture of the past, present and future of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States, here are five ways of thinking about it in hundreds of metro areas across the country, using data compiled by The New York Times. This page will be updated regularly.\n\nThe simplest way to track the progress of an outbreak is by seeing how many new cases and deaths are reported in a given area each day. For the United States as a whole, these counts appear to have peaked or are starting to flatten:\n\nThe metro areas with the most recent cases and deaths, relative to their population, in the last two weeks:\n\nHere, we've limited the window of cases to those within the last two weeks. Scaling those cases by the population of the area can help give a sense of the prevalence of the illness there and how strained a community's health care system may be. Places with curves that are \"flattening\" or \"flat\" are likely to move down this list over time; those where new cases and deaths continue to increase are on track to move up. (Of course, case counts are subject to variable rates of testing -- cases could fall in places simply because fewer tests are being done -- so moderate changes in rankings on these tables may not always be meaningful.)\n\nThe virus has begun cropping up in new places as it spreads across the country. To identify places that could flare up next, it's helpful to look not just at the number of cases but how fast they are rising.\n\nGrowth rates are useful measures in epidemics because they tell us whether things are getting better or worse. In places where the growth rate is high but the number of cases is relatively low, a community may still have time to flatten its curve before an outbreak becomes widespread.\n\nCommunities with a lot of cases and a high growth rate are on track to have a serious problem. A high growth rate on top of a large number of cases means that a still larger number of people are on track to become ill or die.\n\nHere, the metro areas where new cases and deaths have decreased the most, on a population-adjusted basis, in the last week:\n\nThe places on this list are not necessarily those where the outbreak is no longer severe. But sustained decreases in new cases and deaths are signs that a place is going in the right direction.\n\nBelow, the metro areas that have had the highest cumulative case and death rates since the start of the outbreak:\n\nAs the pandemic progresses, the number of cases and deaths per capita can provide a good measure of the prevalence of coronavirus in a community, even if the deadliest period of the outbreak has passed, as it may have in places like Seattle, New York and New Orleans.\n\nThere are other measurements that would be helpful in understanding the progress of the epidemic in different places, such as the number of new hospitalizations, the number of tests administered or the number of people showing any symptoms of respiratory illness. But confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths, however incomplete, are the most useful daily statistics currently available at a local level everywhere in the country.",

        "body": "Dr. Eva Galvez works as a family physician for a network of clinics in northwestern Oregon, where low-income patients have been streaming in for nasal swabs over the past several weeks to test for the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Galvez was dumbfounded by the results. Latinos, about half of those screened, were 20 times as likely as other patients to be diagnosed with the virus.\n\n\"The disparity really alarmed me,\" said Dr. Galvez, who began trying to understand what could account for the difference.\n\nIt is a question that epidemiologists around the country are examining as more and more evidence emerges that the coronavirus is striking Latinos, and some other groups, including African-Americans, with particular force.\n\nOregon is one of many states where Latinos are showing a disproportionate level of impact, and the effects are seen among both immigrants and Latinos from multigenerational American families.\n\nIn Iowa, Latinos account for more than 20 percent of coronavirus cases though they are only 6 percent of the population. Latinos in Washington State make up 13 percent of the population but 31 percent of cases. In Florida, they are just over a quarter of the population but account for two of every five virus cases where ethnicity is known.\n\nBecause most of the clients at the Virginia Garcia Memorial Health Center clinics in Oregon are relatively poor whatever their ethnic background, Dr. Galvez decided that income could not explain the disparity.\n\nPublic health experts say Latinos may be more vulnerable to the virus as a result of the same factors that have put minorities at risk across the country. Many have low-paying service jobs that require them to work through the pandemic, interacting with the public. A large number also lack access to health care, which contributes to higher rates of diabetes and other conditions that can worsen infections.\n\nOregon last month expanded testing criteria to prioritize Latinos and other minorities, citing the higher risk posed from the virus because of \"longstanding social and health inequities.\"\n\nAt the Virginia Garcia clinics, Dr. Galvez sees those inequities among her patients every day.\n\n\"We realized that it must be how Latinos live and work that's driving these disparities,\" said Dr. Galvez, who works at the clinic in Hillsboro, outside Portland.\n\nThe Hispanic patients, many of them immigrants, help produce some of the country's premier Pinot Noir, maintain Nike's sprawling headquarters and plant berries, hazelnuts and Christmas trees in the Willamette Valley. Others are seasonal workers who begin arriving by the thousands later this month for the harvest.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The C.D.C. prepared detailed guidelines for reopening. The White House rejected them, asking for revisions. Latinos in many places are contracting the virus at significantly higher rates than the population as a whole. As millions more Americans join the jobless rolls, even more economic pain is in the forecast. See more updates Updated 5m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThey live in close quarters, often multiple families to a house or with several farmworkers crowded into a barrack-style room, where social distancing and self-isolation are impossible. They perform jobs that require interaction with the general public, in food service, transportation and delivery; and some also toil in meatpacking plants that have emerged as major hot spots.\n\nIf they are undocumented, they cannot collect unemployment, which may compel them to work even when they feel unwell, facilitating the spread to their co-workers.\n\nCarlos, an undocumented Guatemalan who was one of the clinic's patients, never stopped reporting to his job cleaning large supermarkets, even after he began coughing and feeling ill, said his wife, Blanca, who did not want the family's last name to be published because of their immigration status.\n\nHer husband medicated himself on cough syrup, but his condition quickly deteriorated, and he was gasping for air when she finally rushed him to the hospital. He died on April 1 from Covid-19. Now Blanca, her brother and the couple's 13-year-old son have all tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe situation at the clinics in northwestern Oregon tells only part of the story of the nation's 60 million Latinos, who represent a wide range of backgrounds and lifestyles -- new immigrants and multigenerational families, high-earning professionals and poor migrant farmworkers -- and the impacts of the coronavirus already reflect that broad experience.\n\nThe disparities are bigger in states like Oregon, Washington and Utah that have newer and less-established Latino communities, compared with states like California, Arizona and New Mexico. In some states, including Arizona and Texas, state data show Latinos are getting sick at rates close to their share of population. In New Mexico, Latinos, who make up half the population and have a long history in the state, have about the same number of cases relative to their population as whites.\n\n\"Not all Latinos are created equal,\" said Daniel L\u00f3pez-Cevallos, professor of Latino and health equity studies at Oregon State University. More Latinos in states with established communities, he said, are likely to have middle-class jobs or the sort of wealth that could help tide them over through the pandemic without having to work outside the home.\n\nBy contrast, those in places like Oregon and Washington \"tend to be lower income, with lower educational levels, lower levels of health insurance and more employment in essential services,\" Mr. L\u00f3pez-Cevallos said. \"They have fewer support systems in place.\"\n\nAccording to a Pew Research Center survey in April, about half of the Latinos questioned said they or someone in their household had either lost a job or taken a pay cut, or both, because of the virus outbreak -- compared with a third of all adults in the United States.\n\nThe data from a number of states takes an unexpected turn: It indicates that even though they may have higher rates of infection, Latinos have been dying from the virus at lower reported rates overall than other groups.\n\nBut experts say those raw numbers understate the risks for those who become sick, because they do not take into account that the Latino population, the country's second-largest ethnic group -- is significantly younger than other groups. And there have been much fewer deaths among the young from a virus whose lethality grows sharply with its victims' age.\n\nBut among adult Latinos, fatality rates can be much higher. That was what officials in California found when they took a closer look.\n\nThere, Latinos, who are 39 percent of the population, account for almost half of all reported virus cases but only 35 percent of deaths -- placing their overall death rate slightly below that of whites who are not Hispanic.\n\nBut when California public health officials drilled down further, they found that in every age group over 17, Latinos were dying at significantly higher rates than whites -- as were African-Americans.\n\nEven in Oregon, Latinos have not appeared to suffer equally from the impacts of the virus. Dr. Galvez, who is a Mexican-American, lives in a middle-class neighborhood. \"My close friends and family have not been hit by Covid the way the community that I care for has,\" she said.\n\nBefore Oregonians were ordered to stay home on March 23, the Virginia Garcia clinic had launched a campaign to educate Spanish-speaking clients about who was at risk of contracting the virus and how to prevent it.\n\nBilingual posters went up at the clinics; fliers were distributed and Dr. Galvez recorded a public service announcement that aired on a local Spanish-radio station.\n\nBut she and other clinic staff members, who confer daily on Zoom about the pandemic, would eventually conclude that having knowledge of the virus did not mitigate its spread among people who are unable to self-isolate and cannot afford to miss a day's work.\n\nOn March 11, Virginia Garcia began screening patients with symptoms of the virus at seven sites.\n\nSo far, the clinic has tested 397 Hispanics and 281 non-Hispanics in Washington and neighboring Yamhill counties, another agricultural hub. A total of 87 Hispanics, 21.9 percent, have tested positive, compared to three non-Hispanics, or 1.1 percent.\n\nHazel Wheeler, a manager at the clinic who has analyzed the data, deemed the results \"confounding.\"\n\n\"We serve poor people, who live in the same geographical area and make about the same amount of money,\" he said.\n\nBut there were deeper distinguishing factors.\n\nMost non-Hispanics whom the clinic has tested have been working from home, or staying home because they have been furloughed or laid off, typically with unemployment benefits. They were able to keep distance from everyone but immediate family members.\n\nThe majority of Latino patients, on the other hand, have remained on front-line jobs, and many are residing in crowded or precarious dwellings.\n\nRafael Castillo, a 37-year-old mason, was diagnosed with the coronavirus recently along with two fellow Latinos on his construction crew.\n\n\"The truth is, I don't know how we got infected,\" said Mr. Castillo, a Mexican green-card holder who has lived in the United States for two decades. \"When this illness started, our boss told us to work apart. We used hand sanitizer and washed our hands,\" he said.\n\nSince he tested positive, his wife, Yanet Gonzalez, has also contracted the virus. Now Mr. Castillo, who earns about $3,500 a month and lives in a mobile home, said his main concern is keeping his two children healthy. The family shares one shower in their mobile home in Cornelius, Ore., which they try to disinfect after each use.\n\nAs they treat an ever-larger numbers of patients, Virginia Garcia medical workers are now worrying about the prospect of a second wave of infection when the annual harvest gets underway later in May.\n\nBy some estimates, the picking season for berries, pears and other crops brings 160,000 Latino seasonal farmworkers to Oregon. They toil side by side in fields and orchards during the day and bunk in crowded spaces at night, creating a fertile environment for the virus to spread.\n\nA preview of what could happen surfaced in April in central Washington State: Half of the workers at a large orchard tested positive for the coronavirus, even though none had manifested symptoms.\n\nThe findings caught the attention of Oregon's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which last week introduced a series of measures to protect migrant farmworkers after Dr. Galvez and a nonprofit law center sought changes.\n\nThe state agency ordered growers to reconfigure worker housing to eliminate bunk beds for workers not part of the same family and to require at least six feet of space or an impermeable barrier between workers while they sleep. Growers are also required to designate an officer to enforce at least six feet of separation during work, breaks and meals.\n\nThe emergency mandates drew protests from growers who said the rules could slash the amount of housing available for farmworkers and help put many growers out of business.\n\n\"Many farms will not survive the cumulative weight of these unattainable rules, which are more burdensome than any set for other sectors of Oregon's economy,\" the Oregon Farm Bureau said.\n\nState officials acknowledged that the emergency measures, in effect for six months, are unlike any other action taken by the state in recent history. But they said they were necessary to protect Latino migrants and the greater community.\n\nMichael Wood, the top administrator for Oregon's O.S.H.A., said he hopes the rules will help avert the possibility that the virus tears through the picking season that runs until fall.\n\n\"You cannot telecommute to harvest crops,\" he said.",

        "body": "PARIS -- French researchers are preparing to launch a human trial to test their hypothesis that nicotine can help the body combat the COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe trial will involve groups of healthcare workers and patients wearing nicotine patches and other groups wearing placebo patches. Then they will be tested to see if there is a difference in how their bodies respond to the virus.\n\nThe trial is a follow-up to a French study, published this month, of public health data which appeared to show that people who smoke are 80% less likely to catch COVID-19 than non-smokers of the same age and sex.\n\nThe scientists hypothesised in their study that nicotine, which is contained in cigarettes, could influence whether or not the coronavirus molecules are able to attach themselves to receptors in the body.\n\n\"You have the virus which arrives on the receptor, and the nicotine blocks that, and they separate,\" said Jean-Pierre Changeux, emeritus professor of neuroscience at France's Pasteur institute, describing the hypothetical process.\n\nHe co-authored the study with Zahir Amoura, a professor at Paris' Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital, and they are both conducting the trial.\n\nAmoura said the most significant part of the trial could be the testing on a sample group of 1,500 health professionals.\n\nThey will be assessed to see if they catch the virus, and whether those wearing the nicotine patches are more resistant than their colleagues wearing the placebo patches.\n\n\"That could give us a way to reduce the spread of the virus,\" said Amoura.\n\nSimilar testing will be carried out on 400 people who have been hospitalised with coronavirus symptoms, to understand if nicotine alters the progress of the disease.\n\nThe trial will begin in around three weeks. The researchers said they would be careful to ensure their research did not encourage people to take up smoking, given its harmful effects on human health. \"That would be catastrophic,\" said Changeux.\n\n(Reporting by Michaela Cabrera, Writing by Christian Lowe; Editing by Mark Potter)",

        "body": "SEATTLE -- As the coronavirus outbreak consumed the city of Wuhan in China, new cases of the virus began to spread out like sparks flung from a fire.\n\nSome landed thousands of miles away. By the middle of January, one had popped up in Chicago, another one near Phoenix. Two others came down in the Los Angeles area. Thanks to a little luck and a lot of containment, those flashes of the virus appear to have been snuffed out before they had a chance to take hold.\n\nBut on Jan. 15, at the international airport south of Seattle, a 35-year-old man returned from a visit to his family in the Wuhan region. He grabbed his luggage and booked a ride-share to his home north of the city.\n\nThe next day, as he went back to his tech job east of Seattle, he felt the first signs of a cough -- not a bad one, not enough to send him home. He attended a group lunch with colleagues that week at a seafood restaurant near his office. As his symptoms got worse, he went grocery shopping near his home.\n\nDays later, after the man became the first person in the United States to test positive for the coronavirus, teams from federal, state and local agencies descended to contain the case. Sixty-eight people -- the ride-share driver at the airport, the lunchmates at the seafood restaurant, the other patients at the clinic where the man was first seen -- were monitored for weeks. To everyone's relief, none ever tested positive for the virus.\n\nBut if the story ended there, the arc of the coronavirus's sweep through the United States would look much different.\n\nAs it turned out, the genetic building block of the virus detected in the man who had been to Wuhan would become a crucial clue for scientists who were trying to understand how the pathogen gained its first, crucial foothold.\n\nWorking out of laboratories along Seattle's Lake Union, researchers from the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center rushed to identify the RNA sequence of the cases from Washington State and around the country, comparing them with data coming in from around the world.\n\nUsing advanced technology that allows them to rapidly identify the tiny mutations that the virus makes in its virulent path through human hosts, the scientists working in Washington and several other states made two disconcerting discoveries.\n\nThe first was that the virus brought in by the man from Wuhan -- or perhaps, as new data has suggested, by someone else who arrived carrying a nearly identical strain -- had managed to settle into the population undetected.\n\nThen they began to realize how far it had spread. A small outbreak that had established itself somewhere north of Seattle, they realized as they added new cases to their database, was now responsible for all known cases of community transmission they examined in Washington State in the month of February.\n\nAnd it had jumped.\n\nA genetically similar version of the virus -- directly linked to that first case in Washington -- was identified across 14 other states, as far away as Connecticut and Maryland. It settled in other parts of the world, in Australia, Mexico, Iceland, Canada, the United Kingdom and Uruguay. It landed in the Pacific, on the Grand Princess cruise ship.\n\nThe unique signature of the virus that reached America's shores in Seattle now accounts for a quarter of all U.S. cases made public by genomic sequencers in the United States.\n\nWith no widespread testing available, the high-tech detective work of the researchers in Seattle and their partners elsewhere would open the first clear window into how and where the virus was spreading -- and how difficult it would be to contain.\n\nEven as the path of the Washington State version of the virus was coursing eastward, new sparks from other strains were landing in New York, in the Midwest and in the South. And then they all began to intermingle.\n\nA jigsaw puzzle\n\nThe researchers in Seattle included some of the world's most renowned experts on genomic sequencing, the process of analyzing the letters of a virus's genetic code to track its mutations. Before the outbreak, one of the labs had done more sequencing of human coronaviruses than anywhere else in the world -- 58 of them.\n\nWhen a virus takes hold in a person, it can replicate billions of times, some of those with tiny mutations, each new version competing for supremacy. Over the span of a month, scientists have learned, the version of the novel coronavirus moving through a community will mutate about twice -- each one a one-letter change in an RNA strand of 29,903 nucleotides.\n\nThe alterations provide each new form of the virus with a small but distinctive variation to its predecessor, like a recipe passed down through a family. The mutations are so small, however, that it is unlikely that one version of the virus would affect patients differently than another one.\n\nThe virus originated with one pattern in Wuhan; by the time it reached Germany, three positions in the RNA strand had changed. Early cases in Italy had two entirely different variations.\n\nFor each case, the Seattle researchers compile millions of fragments of the genome into a complete strand that can help identify it based on whatever tiny mutations it has undergone.\n\n\"What we're essentially doing is reading these small fragments of viral material and trying to jigsaw puzzle the genome together,\" said Pavitra Roychoudhury, a researcher for the two institutions working on the sequencing in Seattle.\n\nWith some viruses, the puzzles are more challenging to assemble. The virus that causes Covid-19, she said, \"was relatively well behaved.\"\n\nResearchers looked closely at the man who had flown in from Wuhan, who has not been publicly identified and did not respond to a request to speak to The New York Times.\n\nThey confirmed he had brought a strain of the virus that was already extending broad tentacles -- from the Wuhan area to Guangdong on China's Pacific coast to Yunnan in the mountainous west. Along the way, its signature varied significantly from the version of the virus that spread in Europe and elsewhere: Its mutations were at positions 8,782, 18,060 and 28,144 on the RNA strand.\n\nThat gave Dr. Roychoudhury and the scientists around the country she has been working with the unique ability to see what the contact tracers in Seattle had been unable to: the invisible footprints of the pathogen as it moved.\n\nAn alarming find\n\nOn the hunt for the virus's path through the United States, one of the first signposts came on Feb. 24, when a teenager came into a clinic with what looked like the flu. The clinic was in Snohomish County, where the man who had traveled to China lived. Doctors gave the teenager a nasal swab as part of a tracking study that was already being done on influenza in the region.\n\nOnly later did they learn that the teenager had not had the flu, but the coronavirus. After the diagnosis, researchers in Seattle ran the sample through a sequencing machine. Trevor Bedford, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute who studies the spread and evolution of viruses, said he and a colleague sipped on beers as they waited for the results to emerge on a laptop.\n\nIt confirmed what they had feared: The case was consistent with being a direct descendant of the first U.S. case, from Wuhan.\n\nThe teenager had not been in contact with the man who had traveled to Wuhan, so far as anyone knew. He had fallen ill long after that man was no longer contagious.\n\nAdditional sequencing in the days afterward helped confirm that other cases emerging were all part of the same group. This could only mean one thing: The virus had not been contained to the traveler from Wuhan and had been spreading for weeks. Either he had somehow spread it to others, or someone else had brought in a genetically identical version of the virus.\n\nThat latter possibility has become more likely in recent days, after new cases entered into the researchers' database showed an interesting pattern. A virus with a fingerprint nearly identical to the Wuhan traveler's had shown up in cases in British Columbia, just across the border from Washington State, suggesting to Dr. Bedford that it might not have been the first Wuhan traveler who had unleashed the outbreak.\n\nEither way, the number of cases emerging around the time the teenager's illness was identified indicated that the virus had been circulating for weeks.\n\n'I probably exposed a lot of people'\n\nOn its path through Washington State, one of the virus's early stops appears to have been at a square dance on Feb. 16 in the city of Lynnwood, midway between Seattle and Everett.\n\nIt was a full month since the Wuhan traveler's arrival. A couple dozen square dancers had gathered for a pie and ice cream social, capping off a series of practices and events from all over the region over the course of a three-day weekend.\n\nThree groups of square dancers swung through promenades and allemandes -- huffing and sweating to \"Free Ride\" and \"Bad Case of Loving You.\"\n\nStephen Cole, who was the dance caller that night, said he did not recall anyone showing signs of illness. But over the next few days, he and a woman who had been cuing the dance fell ill.\n\nAnother dancer, Suzanne Jones, had attended a class with Mr. Cole the day before. By the next weekend, Ms. Jones said, she started to feel symptoms she dismissed as allergies, since she had noticed the scotch broom starting to bloom.\n\nAfter resting for a couple of days, Ms. Jones felt better and drove from her home in Skagit County more than 100 miles south to visit her mother in Enumclaw, helping pack some belongings for storage. On the way back, she visited the strip malls in Renton, then a store in Everett, then a laundromat in Arlington. She stopped to apply for a job with the Census Bureau.\n\n\"I probably exposed a lot of people that day,\" she said.\n\nMs. Jones only realized it could be something more than allergies after getting a notification on March 2 that one of her square-dancing friends had died of the coronavirus as the outbreak began to emerge. She too tested positive.\n\nThere was minimal coronavirus testing in the United States during February, leaving researchers largely blind to the specific locations and mutations of the spread that month. The man who had traveled from Wuhan was not at the dance, nor was anyone else known to have traveled into the country with the coronavirus. But researchers learned that the virus by then was already spreading well beyond its point of origin -- and all the cases of community transmission that month were part of that same genetic branch.\n\nThere was another spreading event. On the Saturday after the dance, a group of friends packed the living room of a one-bedroom apartment in Seattle, sharing homemade food and tropical-themed drinks.\n\nOver the following days, several people began coming down with coronavirus symptoms. \"Among people who attended, four out of every 10 got sick,\" said Hanna Oltean, an epidemiologist with the Washington State Department of Health.\n\nSeveral people passed on the virus to others. By late March, the state health department had documented at least three generations of \"transmission occurring before anyone was symptomatic,\" Ms. Oltean said.\n\nBy then, it was becoming clear that there were probably hundreds of cases already linked to the first point of infection that had been spreading undetected. It left a lingering question: If the virus had this much of a head start, how far had it gone?\n\nSpreading beyond Seattle\n\nAs cases of the virus spread, scientists in other states were sequencing as many as they could. In a lab at the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Charles Chiu looked at a range of cases in the Bay Area, including nine passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship, which had recently returned from a pair of ill-fated sailings to Mexico and Hawaii that left dozens of passengers infected with the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Chiu was stunned by his results: Five cases in the San Francisco area whose origins were unknown were linked back to the Washington State cluster. And all nine of the Grand Princess cases had a similar genetic link, with the same trademark mutations -- plus a few new ones. The massive outbreak on the ship, Dr. Chiu believed, could probably be traced to a single person who had developed an infection linked to the Washington State cluster.\n\nBut it did not stop with the Grand Princess. David Shaffer, who had been on the first leg of the cruise with members of his family, said passengers on that leg did not discover until after they disembarked that the coronavirus had been aboard -- when they learned that a fellow passenger had died.\n\nHe and his family felt fine when they returned to their home in Sacramento, he said, and when he started feeling sick the next day, on Feb. 22, he at first assumed it was a sinus infection.\n\nDays later, he was tested and learned he had the coronavirus. His wife later tested positive, too, as did one of his sons and one of his grandsons, who had not been on the cruise.\n\nDr. Chiu remembers going over the implications in his head. \"If it's in California and it's in Washington State, it's very likely in other states.\"\n\nU.S. flare-ups abound\n\nThe same day Mr. Shaffer got sick, another person landed at Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, having just visited the Life Care Center nursing home in Kirkland, which would become a center of infection. At the time, there were growing signs of a respiratory illness at the facility, but no indication of the coronavirus.\n\nA few days later, the traveler began feeling ill, but with no sign that it might be anything serious, he went out for dinner at a restaurant in Raleigh. Just then, officials in Washington State began to report a coronavirus outbreak at Life Care Center. The person in North Carolina tested positive a few days later -- the first case in the state.\n\nBy the middle of March, a team at Yale gathered nine coronavirus samples from the Connecticut region and put them through a portable sequencing machine. Seven came back with connections to Washington State.\n\n\"I was pretty surprised,\" said Joseph Fauver, one of the researchers at the lab. At the time, he said, it suggested that the virus had been spreading more than people had initially believed.\n\nIn sequencing more recent cases, the researchers have found cases emanating from a larger cluster, with its own distinct genetic signature, originating in the New York area.\n\nA group of cases throughout the Midwest, first surfacing in early March, appears to have roots in Europe. A group of cases in the South, which emerged around the same time, on March 3, appears like a more direct descendant from China.\n\nBut of all the branches that researchers have found, the strain from Washington State remains the earliest and one of the most potent.\n\nIt has surfaced in Arizona, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming, and in six countries.\n\nAnd new cases are still surfacing.\n\nOne of the enduring mysteries has been just how the virus managed to gain its first, fatal foothold in Washington.\n\nDid the contact tracers who followed the steps of the man who had traveled from Wuhan miss something? Did he expose someone at the grocery store, or touch a door handle when he went to the restaurant near his office?\n\nIn recent days, the sequencing of new cases has revealed a surprising new possibility. A series of cases in British Columbia carried a genetic footprint very similar to the case of the Wuhan traveler. That opened up the possibility that someone could have carried that same branch of the virus from Wuhan to British Columbia or somewhere else in the region at nearly the same time. Perhaps it was that person whose illness had sparked the fateful outbreak.\n\nBut who? And how? That would probably never be known.\n\nMike Baker reported from Seattle and Sheri Fink from New York.",

To everyone's relief, none ever tested positive for the virus.\n\nBut if the story ended there, the arc of the coronavirus's sweep through the United States would look much different.\n\nAs it turned out, the genetic building block of the virus detected in the man who had been to Wuhan would become a crucial clue for scientists who were trying to understand how the pathogen gained its first, crucial foothold.\n\nWorking out of laboratories along Seattle's Lake Union, researchers from the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center rushed to identify the RNA sequence of the cases from Washington state and around the country, comparing them with data coming in from around the world.\n\nUsing advanced technology that allows them to rapidly identify the tiny mutations that the virus makes in its virulent path through human hosts, the scientists working in Washington and several other states made two disconcerting discoveries.\n\nThe first was that the virus brought in by the man from Wuhan -- or perhaps, as new data has suggested, by someone else who arrived carrying a nearly identical strain -- had managed to settle into the population undetected.\n\nThen they began to realize how far it had spread. A small outbreak that had established itself somewhere north of Seattle, they realized as they added new cases to their database, was now responsible for all known cases of community transmission they examined in Washington state in the month of February.\n\nAnd it had jumped.\n\nA genetically similar version of the virus -- directly linked to that first case in Washington -- was identified across 14 other states, as far away as Connecticut and Maryland. It settled in other parts of the world, in Australia, Mexico, Iceland, Canada, Britain and Uruguay. It landed in the Pacific, on the Grand Princess cruise ship.\n\nThe unique signature of the virus that reached U.S. shores in Seattle now accounts for a quarter of all U.S. cases made public by genomic sequencers in the United States.\n\nWith no widespread testing available, the high-tech detective work of the researchers in Seattle and their partners elsewhere would open the first clear window into how and where the virus was spreading -- and how difficult it would be to contain.\n\nEven as the path of the Washington state version of the virus was coursing eastward, new sparks from other strains were landing in New York, in the Midwest and in the South. And then they all began to intermingle.\n\nThe researchers in Seattle included some of the world's most renowned experts on genomic sequencing, the process of analyzing the letters of a virus's genetic code to track its mutations. Before the outbreak, one of the labs had done more sequencing of human coronaviruses than anywhere else in the world -- 58 of them.\n\nWhen a virus takes hold in a person, it can replicate billions of times, some of those with tiny mutations, each new version competing for supremacy. Over the span of a month, scientists have learned, the version of the novel coronavirus moving through a community will mutate about twice -- each one a one-letter change in an RNA strand of 29,903 nucleotides.\n\nThe alterations provide each new form of the virus with a small but distinctive variation to its predecessor, like a recipe passed down through a family. The mutations are so small, however, that it is unlikely that one version of the virus would affect patients differently than another one.\n\nThe virus originated with one pattern in Wuhan; by the time it reached Germany, three positions in the RNA strand had changed. Early cases in Italy had two entirely different variations.\n\nFor each case, the Seattle researchers compile millions of fragments of the genome into a complete strand that can help identify it based on whatever tiny mutations it has undergone.\n\n\"What we're essentially doing is reading these small fragments of viral material and trying to jigsaw puzzle the genome together,\" said Pavitra Roychoudhury, a researcher for the two institutions working on the sequencing in Seattle.\n\nWith some viruses, the puzzles are more challenging to assemble. The virus that causes COVID-19, she said, \"was relatively well behaved.\"\n\nResearchers looked closely at the man who had flown in from Wuhan, who has not been publicly identified and did not respond to a request to speak to The New York Times.\n\nThey confirmed he had brought a strain of the virus that was already extending broad tentacles -- from the Wuhan area to Guangdong on China's Pacific coast to Yunnan in the mountainous west. Along the way, its signature varied significantly from the version of the virus that spread in Europe and elsewhere: Its mutations were at positions 8,782, 18,060 and 28,144 on the RNA strand.\n\nThat gave Roychoudhury and the scientists around the country she has been working with the unique ability to see what the contact tracers in Seattle had been unable to: the invisible footprints of the pathogen as it moved.\n\nOn the hunt for the virus's path through the United States, one of the first signposts came on Feb. 24, when a teenager came into a clinic with what looked like the flu. The clinic was in Snohomish County, Washington, where the man who had traveled to China lived. Doctors gave the teenager a nasal swab as part of a tracking study that was already being done on influenza in the region.\n\nOnly later did they learn that the teenager had not had the flu, but the coronavirus. After the diagnosis, researchers in Seattle ran the sample through a sequencing machine. Trevor Bedford, a scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Institute who studies the spread and evolution of viruses, said he and a colleague sipped on beers as they waited for the results to emerge on a laptop.\n\nIt confirmed what they had feared: The case was consistent with being a direct descendant of the first U.S. case, from Wuhan.\n\nThe teenager had not been in contact with the man who had traveled to Wuhan, so far as anyone knew. He had fallen ill long after that man was no longer contagious.\n\nAdditional sequencing in the days afterward helped confirm that other cases emerging were all part of the same group. This could only mean one thing: The virus had not been contained to the traveler from Wuhan and had been spreading for weeks. Either he had somehow spread it to others, or someone else had brought in a genetically identical version of the virus.\n\nThat latter possibility has become more likely in recent days, after new cases entered into the researchers' database showed an interesting pattern. A virus with a fingerprint nearly identical to the Wuhan traveler's had shown up in cases in British Columbia, just across the border from Washington state, suggesting to Bedford that it might not have been the first Wuhan traveler who had unleashed the outbreak.\n\nEither way, the number of cases emerging around the time the teenager's illness was identified indicated that the virus had been circulating for weeks.\n\nOn its path through Washington state, one of the virus's early stops appears to have been at a square dance on Feb. 16 in the city of Lynnwood, midway between Seattle and Everett.\n\nIt was a full month since the Wuhan traveler's arrival. A couple dozen square dancers had gathered for a pie and ice cream social, capping off a series of practices and events from all over the region over the course of a three-day weekend.\n\nThree groups of square dancers swung through promenades and allemandes -- huffing and sweating to \"Free Ride\" and \"Bad Case of Loving You.\"\n\nStephen Cole, who was the dance caller that night, said he did not recall anyone showing signs of illness. But over the next few days, he and a woman who had been cuing the dance fell ill.\n\nAnother dancer, Suzanne Jones, had attended a class with Cole the day before. By the next weekend, Jones said, she started to feel symptoms she dismissed as allergies, since she had noticed the scotch broom starting to bloom.\n\nAfter resting for a couple of days, Jones felt better and drove from her home in Skagit County more than 100 miles south to visit her mother in Enumclaw, helping pack some belongings for storage. On the way back, she visited the strip malls in Renton, then a store in Everett, then a laundromat in Arlington. She stopped to apply for a job with the Census Bureau.\n\n\"I probably exposed a lot of people that day,\" she said.\n\nJones only realized it could be something more than allergies after getting a notification on March 2 that one of her square-dancing friends had died of the coronavirus as the outbreak began to emerge. She too tested positive.\n\nThere was minimal coronavirus testing in the United States during February, leaving researchers largely blind to the specific locations and mutations of the spread that month. The man who had traveled from Wuhan was not at the dance, nor was anyone else known to have traveled into the country with the coronavirus. But researchers learned that the virus by then was already spreading well beyond its point of origin -- and all the cases of community transmission that month were part of that same genetic branch.\n\nThere was another spreading event. On the Saturday after the dance, a group of friends packed the living room of a one-bedroom apartment in Seattle, sharing homemade food and tropical-themed drinks.\n\nOver the following days, several people began coming down with coronavirus symptoms. \"Among people who attended, 4 out of every 10 got sick,\" said Hanna Oltean, an epidemiologist with the Washington State Department of Health.\n\nSeveral people passed on the virus to others. By late March, the state health department had documented at least three generations of \"transmission occurring before anyone was symptomatic,\" Oltean said.\n\nBy then, it was becoming clear that there were probably hundreds of cases already linked to the first point of infection that had been spreading undetected. It left a lingering question: If the virus had this much of a head start, how far had it gone?\n\nAs cases of the virus spread, scientists in other states were sequencing as many as they could. In a lab at the University of California, San Francisco, Dr. Charles Chiu looked at a range of cases in the Bay Area, including nine passengers from the Grand Princess cruise ship, which had recently returned from a pair of ill-fated sailings to Mexico and Hawaii that left dozens of passengers infected with the coronavirus.\n\nChiu was stunned by his results: Five cases in the San Francisco area whose origins were unknown were linked back to the Washington state cluster. And all nine of the Grand Princess cases had a similar genetic link, with the same trademark mutations -- plus a few new ones. The massive outbreak on the ship, Chiu believed, could probably be traced to a single person who had developed an infection linked to the Washington state cluster.\n\nBut it did not stop with the Grand Princess. David Shaffer, who had been on the first leg of the cruise with members of his family, said passengers on that leg did not discover until after they disembarked that the coronavirus had been aboard -- when they learned that a fellow passenger had died.\n\nHe and his family felt fine when they returned to their home in Sacramento, California, he said, and when he started feeling sick the next day, on Feb. 22, he at first assumed it was a sinus infection.\n\nDays later, he was tested and learned he had the coronavirus. His wife later tested positive, too, as did one of his sons and one of his grandsons, who had not been on the cruise.\n\nChiu remembers going over the implications in his head. \"If it's in California and it's in Washington state, it's very likely in other states.\"\n\nThe same day Shaffer got sick, another person landed at Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, having just visited the Life Care Center nursing home in Kirkland, which would become a center of infection. At the time, there were growing signs of a respiratory illness at the facility, but no indication of the coronavirus.\n\nA few days later, the traveler began feeling ill, but with no sign that it might be anything serious, he went out for dinner at a restaurant in Raleigh. Just then, officials in Washington state began to report a coronavirus outbreak at Life Care Center. The person in North Carolina tested positive a few days later -- the first case in the state.\n\nBy the middle of March, a team at Yale gathered nine coronavirus samples from the Connecticut region and put them through a portable sequencing machine. Seven came back with connections to Washington state.\n\n\"I was pretty surprised,\" said Joseph Fauver, one of the researchers at the lab. At the time, he said, it suggested that the virus had been spreading more than people had initially believed.\n\nIn sequencing more recent cases, the researchers have found cases emanating from a larger cluster, with its own distinct genetic signature, originating in the New York area.\n\nA group of cases throughout the Midwest, first surfacing in early March, appears to have roots in Europe. A group of cases in the South, which emerged around the same time, on March 3, appears like a more direct descendant from China.\n\nBut of all the branches that researchers have found, the strain from Washington state remains the earliest and one of the most potent.\n\nIt has surfaced in Arizona, California, Connecticut, the District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Utah, Virginia, Wisconsin and Wyoming, and in six countries.\n\nAnd new cases are still surfacing.\n\nOne of the enduring mysteries has been just how the virus managed to gain its first, fatal foothold in Washington.\n\nDid the contact tracers who followed the steps of the man who had traveled from Wuhan miss something? Did he expose someone at the grocery store, or touch a door handle when he went to the restaurant near his office?\n\nIn recent days, the sequencing of new cases has revealed a surprising new possibility. A series of cases in British Columbia carried a genetic footprint very similar to the case of the Wuhan traveler. That opened up the possibility that someone could have carried that same branch of the virus from Wuhan to British Columbia or somewhere else in the region at nearly the same time. Perhaps it was that person whose illness had sparked the fateful outbreak.\n\nBut who? And how? That would probably never be known.",

        "body": "President Trump has insisted that the Republican convention is moving ahead for August despite the coronavirus. But even he has expressed openness to a scaled-down event.\n\nThe money to pay for the Republican National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., is mostly raised, and contracts with hotels and local vendors are signed. The delegates are set to easily anoint a party nominee who fought tooth and nail for the title four years ago.\n\nBut instead of preparing to celebrate President Trump, White House and Republican officials are now quietly looking at the likelihood of a pared-down convention, with the coronavirus appearing increasingly likely to still pose a serious threat in late summer.\n\nPublicly, officials have insisted they are moving full steam ahead with their plans for a traditional nominating convention in Charlotte, a major city in a swing state that Mr. Trump won in 2016. On Monday, the Republican National Committee sent its donors the official invitation to the convention, which stated that the event was proceeding apace and would be held from Aug. 24-27.\n\nBut behind the scenes, Republicans are looking at possible contingency plans, including limiting the number of people who descend on Charlotte to only delegates, and making alternate delegates stay home, according to interviews with a half-dozen Republicans close to the planning.\n\nMr. Trump, who was heavily involved in the staging of his last nominating convention, has even shown a new openness to participating in a scaled-down event. He has mused aloud to several aides about why the convention can't simply be held in a hotel ballroom in Florida, given all of the health concerns and the fact that Florida is further along in reopening portions of the state.\n\nBut with expensive contracts signed and money raised, the event is unlikely to move from Charlotte -- unless the Democratic mayor and governor there say it can't be held.\n\nOn a call with reporters on Monday, Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Convention, said that a virtual convention -- something the Democrats are discussing -- wasn't an option for the Republicans. R.N.C. officials cited party rules about an in-person convention that were set in 2016, which stated that \"Republicans cannot change the rules until after the convention convenes,\" meaning there must be an in-person convention this time.\n\nBut Ms. McDaniel appeared to leave open the possibility that the convention's format and time frame could shift despite the printed invitations. \"It's quite a ways away, and there's ample time for us to adjust, if necessary,\" she said.\n\nMs. McDaniel and other Republicans have said that they have hired a medical expert and that they are consulting with the governor of North Carolina and the mayor of Charlotte, who have been focused on controlling the spread of the coronavirus. Local politicians in North Carolina, including Republicans, have expressed skepticism that the convention will be able to go forward as planned.\n\nIn an interview with MSNBC on Sunday, Mayor Vi Lyles of Charlotte hinted that there could be changes to an agreement that the city entered two years ago to host the convention, given the current circumstances.\n\n\"We've got vulnerable populations,\" Ms. Lyles said, referring to people who are especially susceptible to the coronavirus. She followed that up with a tweet on Tuesday saying, \"My #1 priority is the health and safety of Charlotteans and any decision or adaptions must be made in their interest and based in science and facts.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Modelers find that tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Scientists express cautious optimism about developing a vaccine quickly. See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nA state official said the governor, Roy Cooper, had was too soon to make a decision, but added that officials were trying to work with national Republicans as the date draws closer.\n\nMr. Trump has made clear that he will fault Democrats if changes are made.\n\n\"I'm a traditionalist, but we'll have to see, like everything else, but I think we'll be in good shape by that time,\" Mr. Trump told an interviewer with The Washington Examiner during a visit to Pennsylvania last week. \"We have a great state, North Carolina, that's been very, very good.\"\n\nBut the president added: \"Although, it's got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful. It's got a Democrat governor, so we have to be a little bit careful with that, because they're playing politics. They're playing politics, as you know, by delaying the openings.\"\n\nThe debate over how to handle the convention reflects the schism between the Trump administration's response to the virus and how his critics -- and the majority of public health experts -- say it should be handled.\n\n\"The approach each party is taking to convention planning is becoming a microcosm of what the election is going to look like,\" said Joe Solmonese, the chief executive of the Democratic National Convention. \"While the Trump administration is ignoring the public health landscape, presuming things will miraculously improve in 13 weeks and moving forward with plans for a massive in-person convention, Democrats are acknowledging the severity of this pandemic that's already killed over 90,000 people and taking proactive steps to prevent more people from getting sick.\"\n\nMr. Trump, encouraged by conservative allies and worried about his re-election chances, has pushed for more aggressive reopenings across the country as the economic and job losses caused by the virus have reached staggering heights. Democrats have noted warnings from health experts in his own administration about relaxing restrictions too quickly.\n\nFor Mr. Trump, this year's convention was set to be a marked departure from 2016, when he captured the nomination despite attempts to wrest it away from him, including at the convention in Ohio. There, delegates including Ginni Thomas, the conservative activist and wife of Justice Clarence Thomas, tried to stop him from becoming the nominee.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nThose efforts failed. And four years later, the party is almost entirely in lock step with Mr. Trump.\n\nBut several Republicans have expressed concerns about how to pull off a large gathering as the pandemic continues, despite Mr. Trump's desire to project a show of resurgence in the face of it.\n\nSome senior Republicans recalled changes to the rules after the terrorist attacks of 2001. At the 2004 convention in New York, R.N.C. officials did not allow delegates to carry briefcases or handbags into Madison Square Garden. But they wondered how it was possible to protect against the asymptomatic spread of a virus. There was a recognition among party officials, Republicans said, that every day there was a new hurdle, and that they were hoping those health issues would simply be removed from their plates by August. But that is looking increasingly unlikely as experts warn that states' moves to reopen could mean thousands of new deaths.\n\nSome donors said that for the president to press his message that life is returning to normal before Election Day, the convention would need to be consistent with it.\n\n\"It won't do for the president to hide. His base expects to see him on that stage,\" said Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor, who repeated the Trump campaign's line that former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, is \"hiding.\"\n\n\"People are ready to get back to normal. The president gets that,\" Mr. Eberhart said. \"If it's pared down, it will show. It needs to be a big show to counter the narrative that we're headed into a recession. It's hope in the face of fear.\"",

        "body": "The warmer weather across the country calls to mind carefree summers -- picnics in the park, swimming at the beach, fireworks on the Fourth. But nothing feels carefree now.\n\nAs states move to relax restrictions intended to fight the coronavirus pandemic, even the simplest outdoor activities seem fraught with a thousand questions and calculations.\n\nIs it safe to meet friends in the park, as long as they stay six feet away, on the other side of a blanket? What about a burger and beer at an outdoor restaurant? How risky is a trip to the beach or swimming pool with the kids?\n\nThe good news: Interviews show a growing consensus among experts that, if Americans are going to leave their homes, it's safer to be outside than in the office or the mall. With fresh air and more space between people, the risk goes down.\n\nBut experts also expressed particular caution about outdoor dining, using locker rooms at pools and crowds in places like beaches. While going outside can help people cope with quarantine fatigue, there is a risk they will lower their guard or meet people who are not being safe.\n\n\"I think going outside is important for health,\" said Julia L. Marcus, an epidemiologist and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. \"We know that being outdoors is lower risk for coronavirus transmission than being indoors. On a sunny, beautiful weekend, I think going outside is indicated, but I also think there are things to do to reduce our risk.\"\n\nWhile many treasured outdoor rites of the season have been closed or canceled, including Disney's amusement parks, the Coachella festival in California and Shakespeare in the Park in New York, governors across the country have been opening golf courses, trails and beaches, hoping to restore some semblance of a normal summer for restless Americans.\n\nSome parks, including small urban ones like Ellis Island and vast ones like Joshua Tree National Park, remain closed. But Yellowstone will reopen on a limited basis on Monday, and the Grand Canyon reopened its South Rim entrance on Friday. In Los Angeles County, beaches reopened on Wednesday, but not for sunbathing. Only active pursuits like jogging, swimming and surfing are allowed.\n\nEven in the hard-hit New York region, some restrictions will be eased. Connecticut plans to allow outdoor seating at restaurants and outdoor exhibits at zoos on May 20. New Jersey, New York, Delaware and Connecticut will open state beaches on Memorial Day weekend, restricting them to 50 percent capacity. But New York City's beaches and pools will remain closed.\n\nThe different approaches have left many Americans bewildered about what is safe behavior outside. Experts have a simple answer: Practice social distancing and wear a mask when that is not possible.\n\nIdeally, people should socialize only with people who live in their homes, they say. If you decide to meet friends, you're increasing your risk, but you can take precautions. It's important to keep gatherings small. Don't share food, utensils or beverages; keep your hands clean; and keep at least six feet from people who don't live in your home.\n\n\"I think outdoors is so much better than indoors in almost all cases,\" said Linsey Marr, an engineering professor and aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech. \"There's so much dilution that happens outdoors. As long as you're staying at least six feet apart, I think the risk is very low.\"\n\nPandemic life is safer outdoors, in part, because even a light wind will quickly dilute the virus. If a person nearby is sick, the wind will scatter the virus, potentially exposing nearby people but in far smaller quantities, which are less likely to be harmful.\n\n\"The virus load is important,\" said Eugene Chudnovsky, a physicist at Lehman College and the City University of New York's Graduate Center. \"A single virus will not make anyone sick; it will be immediately destroyed by the immune system. The belief is that one needs a few hundred to a few thousand of SARS-CoV-2 viruses to overwhelm the immune response.\"\n\nWhile the risk of outdoor transmission is low, it can happen. In one study of more than 7,300 cases in China, just one was connected to outdoor transmission. In that case, a 27-year-old man had a conversation outdoors with a traveler who had just returned from Wuhan. Seven days later, he had his first symptoms of Covid-19.\n\n\"The risk is lower outdoors, but it's not zero,\" said Shan Soe-Lin, a lecturer at the Yale Jackson Institute for Global Affairs. \"And I think the risk is higher if you have two people who are stationary next to each other for a long time, like on a beach blanket, rather than people who are walking and passing each other.\"\n\nOne recent study found that just talking can launch thousands of droplets that can remain suspended in the air for eight to 14 minutes. But the risk of inhaling those droplets is lower outdoors.\n\nFor many Americans who have spent anxious months at home, wide-open parks and trails feel like the safest options these days.\n\nKate Wathall, a Los Angeles television producer and reporter, went for her first hike in weeks last Sunday, one day after local trails reopened. She drove an hour to Trail Canyon Falls in Tujunga, avoiding more popular trails in the city.\n\n\"It was like being back to normal life,\" she said. \"Obviously, it's not. But it's a day where I forgot what was going on.\"\n\nIn Memorial Park in Maplewood, N.J., on Thursday, Gabriella Gabriel, 22, was exercising with her friend Candace Brodie, also 22, on mats a few feet apart on the grass.\n\n\"People are spread out and there's no way for someone to be right on top of me,\" Ms. Gabriel said. \"But in a pool or beach, everyone is so condensed -- too close for comfort.\"\n\nExperts agreed that the risk of swimming in pools, lakes or the ocean is not from the water, but from exposure to people in and near the water.\n\nAlthough scientists don't have data on the novel coronavirus specifically, other coronaviruses are not stable in water and are very sensitive to chlorine, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\n\n\"In my opinion, pool water, fresh water in a lake or river, or seawater exposure would be extremely low transmission risk even without dilution (which would reduce risk further),\" Dr. Rasmussen said in an email. \"Probably the biggest risk for summer water recreation is crowds -- a crowded pool locker room, dock or beach, especially if coupled with limited physical distancing or prolonged proximity to others. The most concentrated sources of virus in such an environment will be the people hanging out at the pool, not the pool itself.\"\n\nExperts say that a person walking, jogging or cycling too close for a few seconds is not a big worry. But they recommend joggers wear a mask or a buff if they're going to come close to other people. If someone sets up a picnic blanket within your six-foot perimeter and plans to stay a while, that's a bigger concern. Try to avoid a confrontation. That only increases your risk of exposure. Such conflicts could spike as more people head outside.\n\n\"If someone is too close to you and not wearing a mask and you don't feel safe, instead of yelling at them, just say, 'I need some space, please,'\" Dr. Marcus said.\n\nFor families with small children, navigating the outdoors can produce a special anxiety.\n\nMs. Gabriel said her brother, who is 6, had wanted to go to the playground, but her mother wouldn't allow it. She worries about the virus lingering on slides and swings and about a mysterious inflammatory syndrome linked to the virus that has been sickening and killing some children.\n\n\"It's hard for a child to understand,\" Ms. Gabriel said. \"At least we can stay six feet apart. You can't tell a little kid that.\"\n\nOne challenge in dense cities is finding six feet to call your own on a running path or in a bicycle lane. An open-air cafe may seem safe, until people start walking by on the sidewalk without masks.\n\nSome cities, including New York, Boston, Minneapolis and Oakland, have closed streets to traffic, giving people room to spread out. Others have extended sidewalks to make more space for pedestrians and outdoor seating.\n\nEven outside, there is a risk of contracting the virus by touching a contaminated surface -- a restaurant menu, park bench or lawn chair -- and then touching your face. Studies have shown the virus can last three days on hard surfaces like steel and plastic and about 24 hours on cardboard under laboratory conditions. The virus is also more stable in heat and humidity than many other viruses are.\n\nAccording to Dr. Chudnovsky, a sunny day is better than a cloudy day, because there's more sunlight to kill the virus and more wind to dilute it. If you want to take extreme precautions, position yourself upwind from other people. \"This may be especially important at the beach, where people tend to spend a long time at one localized place,\" he said.\n\nExperts said that although outdoor restaurant patrons can't wear masks while eating, servers should. The main risk of exposure is if the guests within a few feet at the table aren't from your household. Sitting and talking for extended periods of time as well as sharing food and common serving utensils are also potential sources of exposure if one of the guests is infected and doesn't know it.\n\nAnother worry: Because it can take two weeks for symptoms to appear after a person is infected, there is no way to know if you're going to the beach or the park in the midst of an invisible local outbreak, experts said. It's yet another reason to take precautions.\n\n\"If we now go back to the old normal and don't follow the social distancing strategy anymore, it's like a ticking time bomb,\" said Peter J\u00fcni, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital. \"You never know where it blows up and when.\"",

        "body": "NEW YORK -- When Eliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n was finally able to visit her grandmother, who had spent four weeks at a Long Island hospital, a staff member met her in the lobby to ask if the 74-year-old patient had a favorite song.\n\nRend\u00f3n, after calling family members, requested several religious selections in Spanish: \"Sum\u00e9rgeme,\" or \"Immerse Me\"; \"Cristo, Yo Te Amo,\" \"Christ, I Love You\"; and \"Cuando Levanto Mis Manos,\" \"When I Raise My Hands.\"\n\nThen she and her husband, Edilson Valencia, were guided to a coronavirus intensive care unit at North Shore University Hospital that morning, April 19. \"Give us a miracle, Lord,\" Rend\u00f3n prayed as the couple waited for an elevator. \"Don't take my grandma, please.\"\n\nHer grandmother, Carmen Evelia Toro, who lived with the couple in Queens, had fallen ill in mid-March after returning from a family reunion in Colombia. Since then, her relatives there and in the United States had joined online nightly prayer sessions, each with a different theme: faith, gratitude, patience, mercy, obedience, love, fidelity. The night before Rend\u00f3n visited the hospital, the topic was miracles.\n\nIn recent weeks, many families like Rend\u00f3n's have faced excruciating decisions about loved ones whose lives the coronavirus has put in peril. With rare exceptions, those choices have been all the more wrenching because they have had to be made from afar: New York hospitals have banned most visitors for fear of contagion.\n\nTwo weeks into her hospital stay, in early April, doctors put Toro on a ventilator after her oxygen levels plummeted. By then, Northwell Health, a New York hospital system that includes North Shore, had treated nearly 5,700 patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to a recent study. More than 3,000 were still hospitalized; 553 had died.\n\nMore than 800, like Toro, remained on ventilators. Many physicians in hard-hit hospitals have grown concerned that a substantial number of critically ill patients with COVID-19 seem to reach a \"Twilight Zone\" status -- their lungs not improving.\n\n\"What are you going to do with these people? Where will they go? Will they get better?\" asked Dr. Mangala Narasimhan, a regional director for intensive care at Northwell. Given the limited understanding of the new disease, doctors disagree about how to care for patients who might survive with prolonged treatment but could be chronically critically ill or have serious lasting medical issues.\n\nThree days before Rend\u00f3n came to the hospital, several relatives joined what one physician, Dr. Eric Gottesman, head of the intensive care unit, described as a \"goals of care\" call. Toro was sedated and not in pain, Gottesman told them. But after keeping her on a breathing machine for two weeks, he said, \"we're having a hard time ventilating her -- getting the gases, kind of the exhaust of the body, out.\"\n\nThe physician listed the efforts he and his colleagues had made: several medications, an experimental treatment and repositioning Toro to help improve her oxygen levels. \"Still,\" he said, \"we haven't been able to get her lungs any better.\" They were very stiff, he continued, \"like an old sponge that won't work anymore.\"\n\nIf Toro recovered, Gottesman cautioned, \"she is going to need a lot of help and probably won't be anywhere near to what she was before.\" Then he added, \"We need to discuss what we should do from here and what she would want.\"\n\nOn the trip back to Colombia in late February, Toro stayed in a rented house with about two dozen other family members who now live in the United States. They went on mountain hikes, attended a baby shower and visited the grave of Toro's eldest son, who died two years ago, according to family members.\n\nToro, Rend\u00f3n and her 18-month-old, Matias, returned to New York on March 8. Matias soon developed a runny nose and diarrhea. The next week, Toro was unwell, losing her appetite and feeling fatigued with what she assumed was a nagging cold. Rend\u00f3n, while cleaning the apartment with bleach, remarked that she could not smell it or taste the salmon she had cooked, common symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nBeing sick was unusual for Toro, who had seven children and more than a dozen grandchildren. She took medications for high blood pressure, a fast heartbeat and hypothyroidism but was robust.\n\nShe exercised with a set of weights, traveled to Colombia several times last year and went swimming in the Florida Keys. She had so much energy, flying up the steps to the third-story Queens apartment, and was so quick to turn out food from the kitchen that Rend\u00f3n called her Abuela Cohete -- Grandma Rocket.\n\nShe had grown up poor in Colombia, cleaning houses and doing laundry to help her widowed mother raise her 12 siblings. Her fortunes changed when she married a veterinarian, and the family had a large house with plenty of food. But her husband left, and Toro opened a small produce shop to support herself and their youngest children. Later, she helped raise most of her grandchildren, including Rend\u00f3n, spoiling them with sweets from her store.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Toro followed her eldest daughter, Martha Jaramillo, to Cape Coral, Florida. She helped care for Jaramillo's mother-in-law, who has dementia, until she went to an assisted-living facility.\n\nAfter that, Toro complained to Jaramillo, \"I don't have anyone who needs my help.\" Then Rend\u00f3n's pregnancy presented the perfect opportunity. The grandmother headed north.\n\nIn Rendon's small Queens apartment, Toro's bed and belongings were tucked behind a living room curtain. She watched over Matias while Rend\u00f3n worked inspecting accessories at an Oscar de la Renta warehouse and her husband stripped lead paint in the New York subways. Toro fed the little boy, crawled on the floor with him, took him to the park and lifted him up to the window over and over again to share his delight as the J train rumbled by.\n\nThree times a week, she walked around the corner to pray at the Lluvias de Gracia church. She liked to say that everything she owned could fit in a suitcase, allowing her to move easily between family members, they recalled. Money mattered little to her. \"Put God first and everything else will follow,\" she told her relatives.\n\nWithin days of her first symptoms, Toro's condition worsened. She did not want to go to a hospital because she feared catching the virus, family members said. But Rend\u00f3n, 32, and her husband, 48, insisted she get attention, calling her doctor, whose office was closed; taking her to an urgent care center, which prescribed antibiotics; and bringing her to the Jamaica Hospital Medical Center. She was sent home because she had no fever.\n\nOn March 19, she developed one. \"I feel very weak, dear,\" she told her granddaughter.\n\nThe next evening, Rend\u00f3n and her husband drove the older woman to North Shore hospital, just over the border from Queens. Valencia's 16-year-old daughter tried to join Toro, who spoke only Spanish, to translate, but was not permitted in the emergency room. The three of them waited in the parking lot from 5 p.m. to almost 4 a.m., keeping in contact with Toro by phone.\n\nShe was admitted as an inpatient, and her family learned she tested positive for the coronavirus March 22. During a call, though, she told her granddaughter that she did not believe she was infected. \"God is not going to allow that virus to get to me,\" she said, \"but people come all covered up to see me.\"\n\nBeginning that week, North Shore was flooded with coronavirus patients. Across New York City, hospitals had a terrifying upswing in cases, and doctors were in distress as they tried to treat a disease with no cure that they did not understand.\n\nPhysicians ordered a CT scan of Toro's chest, and the results were consistent with pneumonia caused by COVID-19, the report said, including scattered hazy patches that looked like ground glass.\n\nAs far as her family knows or a review of her medical records by one of her doctors shows, Toro was not asked her wishes about what options to pursue -- or avoid -- if her condition deteriorated. The family had not discussed what decisions might lie ahead, several relatives said, because they initially believed she would recover.\n\nIn fact, Toro said she was feeling better at first. Soon, though, she sounded increasingly tired and short of breath on the phone. She told Jaramillo, the daughter in Florida, that she was hungry, but she could not communicate with staff members across the language barrier; they were bringing her food, but she was too weak to feed herself. Then she needed an oxygen mask, making it hard for her to speak by phone, and an X-ray indicated that the pneumonia was worsening.\n\nAt home, Matias peeked around the curtain in the living room, searching for his great-grandmother. \"'Uela, 'uela, 'uela,\" he called, meaning \"Grandma\" -- the way he always greeted her.\n\nOn April 2, about two weeks after she had come to the hospital, Toro's oxygen levels declined to 85% -- normal is in the 90s -- and she was working harder to breathe, according to medical records reviewed by Gottesman. The medical team placed her on her stomach, a technique known as proning that sometimes improves oxygen levels in people with COVID-19. But the levels in her blood dropped further, to 75%, and then into the 60s, so she was turned over on her back.\n\nAn anesthesiologist placed a breathing tube in her airway, and she was moved to the intensive care unit. Doctors believed that she'd developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, and that it had progressed to a severe stage, Gottesman said.\n\nRelatives had noticed that Rend\u00f3n, a Spanish speaker, was overwhelmed by calls from the doctors and upset that she could not visit. \"We feel powerless because we want to be with her at this time,\" Rend\u00f3n later said.\n\nSo her aunt, Jaramillo, had taken over the decision-making in consultation with her siblings. Her husband, Esteban, who speaks English, coordinated calls between her and the rotating medical team caring for Toro, often translating for the family.\n\nThree days after Toro went to the ICU, a resident doctor told relatives about what he called her \"poor course\" and \"worsening ventilation status.\" The call resulted in a do-not-resuscitate order being placed in her record, meaning that if Toro's heart stopped, she should not be revived. But Martha Jaramillo was not yet ready to shift to what the doctor referred to as comfort care.\n\nEsteban Jaramillo, a Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps instructor, was frustrated by what seemed like a lack of clarity in calls with doctors. What was comfort care? He learned that it meant removing the ventilator and that a family member could visit Toro's bedside to say farewell. How much time would someone usually be given on a ventilator to show improvement? About two weeks, he recalled being told.\n\nMost important, what were his mother-in-law's chances? A doctor said he was not even sure Toro would survive the night. Esteban Jaramillo quickly arranged a group video call with a pastor, the family and Toro for what he feared might be a goodbye.\n\nRend\u00f3n sat with her grandmother's well-worn Bible, peering at an image on her laptop of the older woman, medicated and asleep, breathing rhythmically with a tube in her mouth. Family members took turns praying and speaking to Toro, tearfully telling her how much they loved her.\n\nAt the end of the nearly hourlong call April 6, the family thanked the social worker who had connected them, Elisa Vicari, who was wearing a double mask, face shield and goggles. Not every social worker was comfortable going into the rooms of coronavirus patients. But Vicari, 33, was coming in on her days off to facilitate video chats and join family members for farewells -- then happening almost daily.\n\n\"It's a drop in the bucket compared to what these families need,\" Vicari later said. \"You can hear the pain and sadness in their voices.\"\n\nGottesman and his colleagues continued with treatments they thought might help Toro. They had tried the anti-malarial drug chloroquine as well as anakinra, typically prescribed for rheumatoid arthritis. Doctors placed a scope down her airway twice, to no avail, to check for blockages that might explain why it was so hard to ventilate her.\n\nThey now enlisted the palliative care team, which focused on comfort and end-of-life issues. One of its doctors spoke with the family the day of the video call to \"assist in complicated decision-making,\" a note in her chart said.\n\nToro's illness affected only her lungs -- \"every other part of her body was working,\" Gottesman later said -- but her lungs were not improving.\n\nOn April 16, 10 days later, Gottesman and Vicari met in an ICU office for the \"goals of care\" conference call with Toro's family.\n\nPreparing for the call, Gottesman told a reporter, \"I'm giving her one last hope.\" He had put Toro on a three-day course of high-dose steroids to try to help her lungs. Failing that, he and colleagues agreed, she should be taken off the ventilator. \"If she does well, that's great. If she doesn't, we'll support her that way, too.\"\n\nHe said he was not planning to propose an option that might continue Toro's life support but not restore her health, he believed, because her lungs probably had significant scarring.\n\n\"She was an active, lively woman before this,\" Vicari said. \"I don't know how in line that would be with her values.\"\n\nThe option Gottesman referred to was a tracheostomy. A surgical opening in the neck, it can be fitted with a ventilator for patients who need longer-term or indefinite use of it, allowing the uncomfortable breathing tube to be removed from a patient's mouth and throat.\n\nThat makes it easier to decrease sedation and try to wake patients up, though that can be difficult in those with the type of lung damage Toro appeared to have, Gottesman said. He added that they did best when sedated and kept still to allow the ventilator to work for them. North Shore, he said, had done relatively few of the procedures on coronavirus patients.\n\nIntensive care specialists differ in their approaches to COVID-19 patients on ventilators and have been debating what is most effective. \"All over the city, there are a lot of discrepancies about tracheostomies and what to do,\" said Narasimhan, of Northwell.\n\nAt some hospitals, doctors perform the procedures frequently, often less than two weeks after a patient is put on a ventilator, believing they may shorten ICU stays and improve chances of recovery. \"I think it's better care,\" said Dr. Roopa Kohli-Seth, director of the Institute for Critical Care Medicine at Mt. Sinai.\n\nBut others, including one national surgery organization and the team caring for Toro, favor waiting \"to see which direction people are going,\" Narasimhan said. That was in part because the procedure, and the continuing care the tracheostomy required, risked exposing staff members to the virus. It was also because a significant proportion of patients would die no matter what course was taken, she said.\n\nNarasimhan pointed out that it was difficult to find long-term care placement for patients with severe lung damage at the best of times. Inside the Northwell system, she said, there were discussions about creating its own long-term care facility, much as areas of its hospitals have been converted into intensive care units in recent weeks.\n\nThe hospital did not consider Toro a candidate for another treatment, using a heart-lung machine that allows those organs to rest. The resource-intensive therapy -- called ECMO, for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation -- was in short supply and reserved for younger patients, the hospital had decided, Gottesman said later. It was unlikely to help her lungs heal, he added.\n\nFinally, the call began, with Toro's relatives in the United States and Colombia joining in. \"We're really kind of in a bind,\" Gottesman told them. \"No matter what happens, she is not going to be an independent woman anymore.\"\n\nVicari asked whether Toro had made her wishes clear, and Toro's youngest daughter answered, sounding tearful as she spoke through a translator.\n\n\"She once told me that she wanted to go to sleep and for her heart to just turn off,\" Andrea Rend\u00f3n said, adding that her mother had told her, \"I want to die before I'm a burden to you and for you to see me ill in a bed.\"\n\nAndrea Rend\u00f3n's older sister, Jaramillo, said their mother had had a similar conversation with her, saying she had \"asked the Lord not to see herself lying on a bed suffering for a long time.\"\n\nThe doctor and social worker looked at each other and nodded. \"It sounds like both Carmen and the rest of the family is very spiritual and have a lot of faith in God,\" Gottesman said.\n\nThe doctor proposed finishing the three-day course of steroids. If they did not work, as he suspected, he said, \"I think that we should do what I think is medically correct and also sounds like the wishes of what Carmen would want and the rest of her family is, is maybe take her off the respirator but make sure that she is not in pain and that she is very comfortable and that she will most likely pass fairly quickly but very calmly and quietly.\"\n\nJaramillo's voice broke as she responded, \"There isn't anything else they can do for her?\"\n\nGottesman said, \"We've tried everything that we can.\"\n\nAnother daughter asked how dependent her mother would be if she lived.\n\n\"If she were to survive, she'd probably need oxygen,\" Gottesman said. \"She wouldn't be able to breathe very much on her own. If she could walk -- which we have to see after all the, you know, staying in bed for a long time -- she'd need a lot of rehabilitation. And if she could walk, her lungs wouldn't let her walk very far at all because she'd be too short of breath and she'd be basically a pulmonary cripple.\"\n\nThat evening at home, Gottesman kept thinking about his patient, he recalled later, wondering what else might be done. The physician, 56, had devoted his career to treating diseases of the lungs and providing critical care in part because his father, a doctor, had died young from a blood clot in the lungs after he survived being struck by a car.\n\nGottesman was aware of a new study testing whether the blood plasma of survivors, which contains virus-fighting antibodies, might help people battling the disease. The next day, he asked if the family would be interested in having Toro participate.\n\n\"We'll do anything to try to save her life,\" Esteban Jaramillo told the doctor, after consulting with his wife. \"Anything.\"\n\nThat night, the family gathered for the daily online prayer session using the Zoom app. The theme was victory. Eliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n joined from her kitchen table in New York, praying and singing quietly, wiping tears and occasionally laughing as relatives shared memories. Her husband sat beside her, his arm behind the back of her chair.\n\nFamily members read passages about David and Goliath and gave testimonies. One woman said she had seen a news story about an older man discharged from a hospital after his battle with the virus. \"All the doctors and the nurses were applauding,\" Luz Arce, a niece, said. \"There was music, and everyone was happy.\"\n\n\"Can you imagine us going to pick her up and bringing her with us?\" Eliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n whispered to her husband.\n\nShe read to her family in Spanish from the Epistle of James: \"Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.\"\n\nThe next afternoon, a Saturday, Gottesman reported to the Jaramillos that the steroids had not worked. After discussions, he and colleagues had decided against the blood serum treatment, thinking it would not make a difference.\n\n\"Nothing's working,\" Gottesman later recalled telling them. \"We should talk about when we want to take the tube out.\" The family accepted what seemed inevitable, though there was no formal decision.\n\nFinally, Eliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n would be allowed to come to her grandmother's bedside.\n\n\"You were the soldier, strong for all of us,\" one relative would say.\n\nThat Sunday, April 19, Gottesman took Eliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n and her husband into the ICU. \"It's going to be a little scary,\" he warned. \"Everybody is on a respirator there.\"\n\nEliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n and her husband were brought to the hall window of her grandmother's room. \"You are the most noble and humble person I have ever met in my life,\" she said, speaking through the glass. \"Open your eyes, my queen. Open your eyes.\"\n\nThe medical team blocked the window and removed the ventilator while Eliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n and her husband were helped into gowns. The Spanish praise music was readied on a computer tablet to help Toro \"have a smoother transition,\" a staff member said.\n\nThe social worker, Vicari, made a Zoom call to Toro's other family members and went into the room with Eliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n, her husband, Gottesman and a nurse.\n\nToro was breathing but unconscious, having received morphine, a sedative, and the anesthetic drug ketamine. Gottesman had not planned on giving her oxygen by mask or nasal tube because she was sedated and he did not think she needed it for comfort. But the granddaughter requested it, thinking it might help keep her alive.\n\nA chorus of voices rang out from the tablet greeting her, telling her how beautiful she was, thanking her, expressing love.\n\nEliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n pleaded with God for her grandmother to live, even if it meant caring for her on a ventilator. She spoke to Toro, reminding her of how happy she had been that spring was coming so she could take Matias out to enjoy it. \"The flowers are starting to bloom,\" she said. \"Get up -- the spring is finally here.\"\n\nIn her mask, Eliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n leaned over and kissed her grandmother on the forehead. She stroked her face and arms and held her hands. She walked to the bottom of the bed, pulled back the covers and kissed her feet.\n\nAs voices rose in prayer, Toro's breath slowed and, after about an hour, stopped.\n\nEliana Marcela Rend\u00f3n stayed at her grandmother's side, bent with grief, until the team gently said it was time to leave.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nTHESSALONIKI, Greece -- For years, Greece has been seen as one of the European Union's most troubled members, weighed down by a financial crisis, corruption and political instability. But in the coronavirus pandemic, the country has emerged as a welcome surprise: its outbreak appears to be far more limited than what was expected.\n\nAs the virus spread across Europe, many Greeks feared the worst: They would be the next Italy or Spain.\n\nAfter all, the country's health care system had been weakened by a decade-long financial crisis. And Greece has one of the oldest populations in the European Union, second only to Italy, leaving it more vulnerable to the disease.\n\nBut the number of reported deaths and people in intensive care because of the virus in Greece has remained a tiny fraction of what they are in many other European nations.\n\nNow, a country that has grown used to being seen as a problem child in the European Union is celebrating its government's response and looking forward to reopening its economy.\n\n\"Greece has defied the odds,\" said Kevin Featherstone, director of the Hellenic Observatory at the London School of Economics.\n\nBecause Greece has tested a very small percentage of its population, it is impossible to know how extensively the virus has spread in the country. But its total deaths have been low -- 138 in a population of about 10.7 million -- a surprise to experts, especially given the elderly population. And a big relief.\n\nOn Tuesday, just over a month after the government imposed a lockdown, the prime minister announced a time frame for gradually easing restrictions and getting the country back on its feet.\n\nOnly 69,833 people have been tested for the virus in Greece, but experts agree that the country's decision to quickly enforce social distancing measures and fortify its ailing health care system helped curb the outbreak.\n\nSo did a willingness from most Greeks to comply with the orders.\n\nOn Feb. 27, a day after the country's first Covid-19 case was diagnosed in Thessaloniki, Greece's second- largest city, the government canceled the annual Carnival. On March 11, it closed down schools. Two days later, Greece limited nonessential travel and closed down cafes, restaurants, libraries and museums, among other places.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Even if the government doesn't keep students and workers at home, fear of the coronavirus does. Spain's villages wage a lonely fight against the coronavirus. Japan delayed the Olympics to 2021, but even that timeline may be optimistic. See more updates Updated 35m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nSoon, anyone who came from abroad had to go through a two-week mandatory quarantine or risk a fine of about $5,400. Everyone in the country was required to notify the government each time they left their homes, even if it was to walk the dog.\n\n\"We acted pre-emptively,\" said Giorgos Gerapetritis, the Greek minister of state.\n\n\"We consciously preferred to make a significant financial sacrifice rather than sacrifice human life,\" he said.\n\nAs of this week, there have been 2,566 coronavirus infections reported in Greece. Belgium, by comparison, has reported 47,334 infections and 7,331 deaths, even though the countries have a similar population size.\n\nBeginning in February, Greece worked to quickly increase its intensive care beds by more than 70 percent and recruited 3,337 additional hospital staff members, said Vassilis Kikilias, the health minister. It has also opened up 2,500 more hospital worker positions and plans to hire 942 additional doctors, a spokesman for the ministry of health said last week.\n\n\"The mobilization was very fast,\" said Anastasia Kotanidou, associate professor at the Critical Care Department of the University of Athens and the president of the Greek Intensive Care Society. Without it, she said, the health care system would not have been able to handle the outbreak.\n\nAcross the country, many Greeks were quick to accept the new normal, even foregoing things like gathering in groups to roast lamb on Orthodox Easter. That might have been unthinkable just months ago.\n\nA recent poll found that the two most popular people in the country are Sotiris Tsiodras, a soft-spoken infectious disease specialist at the University of Athens, and Nicholas Hardalias, the deputy minister for civil protection. The doctor and the politician host daily virus briefings in Greece, and it has become must-watch television.\n\nMr. Featherstone said that the government had \"followed the science\" by making Dr. Tsiodras the lead on policy, and that giving Mr. Hardalias the power to oversee the country's response to the outbreak helped ensure things ran smoothly.\n\n\"Neither of these actions are typical of Greek governments when faced with challenges,\" he said. They seemed to reflect the business background of Prime Minister Kiriakos Mitsotakis, a former financial analyst, he added.\n\nPavlos Eleftheriadis, a retired stage director at the national theater in Northern Greece, said he was pleasantly surprised by the government's response to the outbreak.\n\n\"I felt pride that there is a state,\" said Mr. Eleftheriadis, who is from Thessaloniki. \"There are politicians who listen to the scientists.\"\n\nBut for all the government's successes so far, it has faced some criticism.\n\nLess than 1 percent of the population has been tested for the virus in Greece, raising concerns about the accuracy of its numbers. Testing has been focused on people admitted to hospitals with symptoms and those who have been in contact with confirmed cases, according to the health ministry spokesman. People coming into the country from abroad are being tested as well.\n\nThere have also been multiple coronavirus outbreaks in the country's cramped and unsanitary refugee camps. And despite calls to evacuate them, few migrants have been released, raising alarm among critics.\n\nAt least 150 people at a hotel being used to house hundreds of migrants tested positive for the virus this month. The migrants were tested only after a hotel employee, her husband and a pregnant woman from Somalia, who was also a migrant, tested positive, local media reported.\n\nAnd some have raised concerns about reports of abusive behavior by police officers enforcing the country's lockdown rules, including the use of excessive force.\n\nFani Kountouri, assistant professor of political science and political communication at Panteion University in Athens, said the current satisfaction with the government could easily disappear, depending on how the country manages the financial impact of the pandemic.\n\nTourism, which accounts for 18 percent of the country's G.D.P., is expected to be one of the hardest-hit sectors in Greece, which was just recovering from the financial crisis that began in 2009.\n\nOn Tuesday, Prime Minister Mitsotakis announced that, starting on May 4, bookstores, hair salons and some other shops will reopen, and that Greeks would no longer have to notify the government before leaving home.\n\nChurches will also reopen for personal worship. High schools will reopen later in May, while restaurants and hotels that operate year-round will most likely begin operating again on June 1, Mr. Mitsotakis said.\n\nFor now, some Greeks are proudly cheering their country as a rare success story in the European Union during the pandemic.\n\nCostas Thimioudis, a 50-year-old taxi driver in Thessaloniki, said he was no fan of the Greek government but approved of its actions. \"The government took measures earlier than the rest of Europe,\" he said.\n\n\"Some Europeans did not hold us in high esteem,\" said Costas Hatzopoulos, 54, an agronomist who is also in Thessaloniki.\n\n\"We've proved them wrong.\"",

        "body": "Many household disinfectants promise to kill 99.9 percent of germs, but some of us might be cleaning too swiftly to let them do their job.\n\nEver since the coronavirus became a threat, many of us are doing a lot more cleaning at home, spraying and wiping pretty much everything in sight, especially high-touch surfaces like door knobs and faucet handles.\n\nBut many of us are used to giving a surface a quick spray, followed by a wipe or two, which may not allow enough time for the product to work. And once you start reading labels on cleaning products closely, it gets really confusing. Several readers pointed out that disinfectant wipes and spray cleaners have different instructions on their labels for how long a cleaner should stay on a surface to effectively kill germs, ranging from 30 seconds to four minutes or even as long as 10 minutes. What's more, some labels recommend cleaning before using a disinfectant.\n\nSo what's the right way to clean? We talked to infectious disease scientists and microbiologists who study and test cleaning products to answer your questions about cleaning in the time of coronavirus. The bottom line: Whether you're worried about coronavirus or other germs that lurk in our homes, many of us are cleaning too fast for the disinfectant to do its job.\n\nHere's what the experts said.\n\nHow long does a disinfectant need to stay on a surface in order to kill germs?\n\nYou probably need to let your disinfectant stay on the surface you're cleaning for far longer than you think.\n\n\"The longer you can let it be in contact, the better,\" said Dr. Andrew Janowski, instructor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine St. Louis Children's Hospital. \"What I've been doing at home: I wait roughly a minute if I'm applying a spray product and then wiping.\"\n\nTo find out how long the recommended time is for a specific product, check the label. The guidance could range from 30 seconds to several minutes of contact time before you wipe. Note that some products may claim to sanitize, which means they reduce the level of certain bacteria, but not viruses. A disinfectant claim means the product destroys or inactivates both the bacteria and viruses noted on the label.\n\nEven cleaners from the same brand have different contact times. My bottle of Clorox bleach says five minutes of contact time, while Clorox Clean-Up Cleaner + Bleach advises 30 seconds. Clorox Anywhere Hard Surface says two minutes (but it promises to kill only bacteria, not viruses), while Clorox Disinfecting Wipes says four minutes. Even among similar Lysol branded wipes, the recommended contact time varies -- the lavender scented wipe recommends 10 minutes of contact time, whereas the lemon-lime scented wipe says four minutes.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The White House will wind down the coronavirus task force in coming weeks. Kushner's volunteer force prioritized medical supplies from Trump's allies. Comparing recent deaths to historical figures hints at real toll in each state. See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nWhy are the recommended contact times so different? It depends on which bacteria and viruses the product claims to kill. To make a disinfectant claim, a product has to go through a strict testing process set forth by a country's regulatory agencies. In the United States, it's the Environmental Protection Agency. To test a disinfectant, scientists cover a surface with a large dose of the organism being studied. They then douse the surface with a disinfectant and let it sit for a set amount of time before testing to determine whether any of the organisms remain viable.\n\nThose tests are essentially worst-case scenarios using excessively high concentrations of germs -- about 100,000 organisms per centimeter -- which is far more than would typically be found in a home setting. \"Most common surfaces in homes and hospitals have less than 100 organisms per square centimeter,\" said Dr. David Weber, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nBut even though the contact time advice is probably overkill, to be certain a surface has been completely disinfected, you should pay attention to the disinfection time recommendations on the label, especially when someone in the house has been sick. In some cases, organism contamination can reach very high levels in a home -- like when you are working with raw chicken in a kitchen or when someone in the house is ill and an area has been contaminated with stool or vomit. And some organisms, like norovirus, which causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms, are particularly tough to eliminate and can cause illness in infinitesimal doses.\n\nWhy does the label say a surface has to be cleaned before using a disinfectant? Do I really have to clean twice?\n\nIf your surface is covered in crumbs, grime or spilled food, then yes, you do need to clean away the debris and dirt before using a disinfectant.\n\n\"For a germicide to work, it has to touch the germs,\" said Dr. Weber, who has consulted for PDI, a firm that makes disinfectants. \"If you have a layer of grime, the dirt can protect the bacteria. Cleaning has to precede disinfection.\"\n\nSome cleaners promise to both clean and disinfect, but even those labels advise pre-cleaning a heavily soiled surface.\n\nThe label on my disinfectant wipes says I should use them for four minutes. Do I really have to wipe that long?\n\nWhen wipes are tested in laboratory conditions, the clock starts with the first wipe and continues until the surface dries. So you don't have to wipe for a full four minutes (or whatever time is advised on the label). The goal is for the wiping time and drying time to last four minutes, says Haley Oliver, a microbiologist and associate professor of food science at Purdue University.\n\nIn a recent study of disinfectant wipes, Dr. Oliver and colleagues tested a six-inch formica square covered with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The surface was wiped four times with a disinfectant wipe and left to dry. Five out of six products tested remained wet on the surface until the label contact time was reached. One product dried 15 seconds too soon, but it still worked well against germs.\n\n\"I think being conscious of contact time is important,\" says Dr. Oliver, whose research includes work with Diversy, a major producer of cleaning and disinfectant products. \"If this is my house and I'm on a wipe campaign, I want to see that the wipe deposited liquid on that surface.\"\n\nI often use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. Should I use a new wipe each time so I don't spread germs?\n\nYou can use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. As long as the wipe remains wet, an indication that it still has plenty of cleaner on it, you don't have to worry about spreading organisms around. That said, most experts I spoke with prefer not to mix rooms. So they would use one wipe on multiple surfaces in a bathroom, for example, but they wouldn't use that same wipe in the kitchen.\n\nDr. Oliver notes that there isn't official guidance on how much surface area one wipe can cover. The key to disinfecting with wipes is to be aware when your wipe is running out of disinfectant. \"If it's not wet, then you're not contacting microbes with the chemistry that was intended,\" says Dr. Oliver. \"If you've run out of the ingredient and your towelette is dry, you could be transmitting those organisms around.\"\n\nWhat's the best cleaner to get rid of coronavirus?\n\nProduct labels will say specifically what types of bacteria and viruses have been tested. But because SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is so new, most cleaning products haven't been tested against it. The E.P.A. has, however, published a list of products expected to kill the virus because they are proven against harder-to-kill viruses or other types of coronavirus.\n\nThe good news is that the new coronavirus is actually much easier to kill than many of the organisms previously studied. So it is likely that even if you haven't been following the contact time recommendations for disinfectants, you have probably been killing the virus. But you need to follow label direction to tackle harder-to-kill germs like e-coli, salmonella or staph.\n\n\"It's important to note that these recommendations are generic and typically based on how long it takes to kill bacteria -- for example, Staph and Strep, which are much harder to kill than a virus like SARS-CoV-2,\" said Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. \"Shorter times of exposure are most likely still quite effective to prevent Covid-19.\"",

        "body": "The man behind Trump's favorite unproven treatment has made a great career assailing orthodoxy. His claim of a 100 percent cure rate shocked scientists around the world.\n\nWhen diagnosing the ills afflicting modern science, an entertainment that, along with the disparagement of his critics and fellow researchers, he counts among his great delights, the eminent French microbiologist Didier Raoult will lightly stroke his beard, lean back in his seat and, with a thin but unmistakable smile, declare the poor patient to be stricken with pride. Raoult, who has achieved international fame since his proposed treatment for Covid-19 was touted as a miracle cure by President Trump, believes that his colleagues fail to see that their ideas are the products of mere intellectual fashions -- that they are hypnotized by methodology into believing that they understand what they do not and that they lack the discipline of mind that would permit them to comprehend their error. \"Hubris,\" Raoult told me recently, at his institute in Marseille, \"is the most common thing in the world.\" It is a particularly dangerous malady in doctors like him, whose opinions are freighted with the responsibility of life and death. \"Someone who doesn't know is less stupid than someone who wrongly thinks he does,\" he said. \"Because it is a terrible thing to be wrong.\"\n\nRaoult, who founded and directs the research hospital known as the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, or IHU, has made a great career assailing orthodoxy, in both word and practice. \"There's nothing I like more than blowing up a theory that's been so nicely established,\" he once said. He has a reputation for bluster but also for a certain creativity. He looks where no one else cares to, with methods no one else is using, and finds things. In just the past 10 years, he has helped identify nearly 500 novel species of human-borne bacteria, about one-fifth of all those named and described. Until recently, he was perhaps best known as the discoverer of the first giant virus, a microbe that, in his opinion, suggests that viruses ought to be considered a fourth and separate domain of living things. The discovery helped win him the Grand Prix Inserm, one of France's top scientific prizes. It also led him to believe that the tree of life suggested by Darwinian evolution is \"entirely false,\" he told me, and that Darwin himself \"wrote nothing but inanities.\" He detests consensus and comity; he believes that science, and life, ought to be a fight.\n\nIt is in this spirit that, over the objections of his peers, and no doubt because of them, too, he has promoted a combination of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and azithromycin, a common antibiotic, as a remedy for Covid-19. He has taken to declaring, \"We know how to cure the disease.\" Trump was not the only one eager to embrace this possibility. By the time I arrived in Marseille, some version of Raoult's treatment regimen had been authorized for testing or use in France, Italy, China, India and numerous other countries. One in every five registered drug trials in the world was testing hydroxychloroquine.\n\nIn March, Raoult announced that his hospital would test and treat anyone who cared to show up. Crowds gathered at the entrance to the IHU in winding single-file lines, like pilgrims shuffling toward their private audience with the oracle. On March 16, Raoult released the results of a small clinical trial that showed, he said, a 100 percent cure rate. The study has since been widely debated, and Raoult's boosterism has been lamented by scientists and health officials around the world; in a comment more or less representative of the tenor of the controversy in France, where Raoult's name and image have now been everywhere for weeks, one detractor, a generally thoughtful politician, suggested that Raoult \"shut his face and be a doctor\" and that he \"stop saying 'I'm a genius' all over the place.\"\n\nHis colleagues liken his psychology to that of Napoleon, though he is not physically small. When asked by one journalist about his tendency to \"swim against the current\" of scientific thought, Raoult responded: \"I'm not an 'outsider.' I'm the one who's farthest out in front.\" Axel Kahn, a geneticist and physician who has known Raoult for nearly 40 years, told me that he has always been this way. \"One of Professor Raoult's abiding characteristics is that he knows that he's very good,\" Kahn told me. \"But he considers everyone else to be worthless. And he always has. It's not a recent development.\" At his home, alongside a collection of Roman busts, he is said to keep a marble statue of himself.\n\nRaoult, who is 68, is a sturdily built but fine-featured man, with high cheekbones and a tight, contemptuous mouth. In recent years, he has hidden these behind a straggly white mustache and goatee and has grown his flaxen hair down to his shoulders. On his right pinkie he now wears a silver skull. In internet memes, he has been depicted as the wizard Gandalf and as a druid; except for his white lab coat, he has the general aspect of a fortuneteller who rides a Harley to work. The French journalist Herv\u00e9 Vaudoit, who has written admiringly about Raoult over the years, once asked him why he'd taken to dressing this way. Raoult replied, \"Because it pisses them off.\"\n\nIn the weeks since SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, spread throughout the world, his disdain for respectable opinion, and for the \"Parisian marquesses\" who are its representatives, has endeared him to a large segment of the French population. According to one survey, by late March, Raoult had become one of France's most popular \"political personalities,\" with particular appeal on the populist extremes. Votives bearing his image were being sold in Marseille, and on some evenings, at 8 p.m., a battalion of municipal garbage trucks assembled on the roadway outside his hospital, where the drivers leaned on their horns in loud and furious tribute. A hundred-foot banner, painted by a club of local soccer fans and strung up near the entrance, read, \"Marseille and the world behind Prof. Raoult!!!\"\n\nRaoult has been collecting the merchandise created by his fans, and he seems to be enjoying his fame, though he claims otherwise. He is certain the drugs will vindicate him in the end; everything else is a matter of appearances. \"I really do think we're in a theater,\" he told me. \"In my play, the people who judge me as a doctor are my patients. As a scientist, it's my colleagues. And time.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, I spoke, from the recommended distance, to a man named Jacques Cohen. He was seated on the sidewalk outside the IHU, an angular monument of concrete and glass about a mile and a half from Marseille's old port. Cohen had his back against a pylon and his wrists on his knees, at the edge of a group of perhaps 60 people. By their unworried proximity to one another -- they were standing around in a loose group, as people used to, waiting to enter the hospital through a side door -- they were identifiable as the unfortunates who already knew they were positive. I had selected Cohen as my interlocutor under the guidance of a nearby nurse. He was not coughing or sneezing; he wore a mask. \"In any case, we're all going to get it,\" the nurse said.\n\nI crouched on the pavement and asked Cohen, who is 76, how he was feeling. For the past two days, he had been taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. \"It's getting better,\" Cohen said through his mask. He looked ashen but optimistic. His fever had fallen, and he had begun to regain his sense of taste. I noted that there was some debate about the efficacy of the treatment. \"There's no 'believing' or 'not believing,'\" Cohen replied. \"We know it's effective!\"\n\nHydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are well characterized, well tolerated and widely prescribed medications. Azithromycin was developed 40 years ago in the former Yugoslavia and is today the second-most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Hydroxychloroquine, along with its more toxic analog chloroquine, was for several decades the most commonly prescribed antimalarial drug in the world. Today it is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. All three molecules are included on the World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Medicines, a compilation of \"the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions.\"\n\nRaoult knows the drugs well. From the start of his career, he has experimented extensively with drug repositioning, in which medicines that have been approved for use against one disease are repurposed as treatments for others. Hundreds and hundreds of molecules have already been approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration. Hidden among these, Raoult contends, are various unanticipated cures. \"You test everything,\" Raoult told me. \"You stop pondering; you just look and see if, by chance, something works. And what you find by chance, it'll knock you on your derri\u00e8re.\" Antidepressants and antihypertensives have been shown to have antiviral properties; lovastatin, which is prescribed to lower cholesterol levels, has been found to be effective, at least in mice, against plague. In a 2018 paper, Raoult and a team of researchers reported that azithromycin showed strong activity in cells infected with the Zika virus.\n\nRaoult spent the first decade of his life in Dakar, in what was then French Senegal, where his father, a military doctor, was posted. To ward off malaria, he was given chloroquine. \"I took it all the time when I was a kid,\" he told me. In the 1990s, in an early repurposing experiment, he tested the effect of hydroxychloroquine on a frequently fatal condition known as Q fever, which is caused by an intracellular bacterium. Like viruses, intracellular bacteria multiply within the cells of their hosts; Raoult found that hydroxychloroquine, by reducing acidity within the host cells, slowed bacterial growth. He began treating Q fever with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline and later used the same drugs for Whipple's disease, another fatal condition caused by an intracellular bacterium. The combination is now considered to be a standard treatment for both diseases.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Fauci will issue a stark warning on the risks of reopening too soon.

Following the SARS outbreak in 2002, researchers found that chloroquine slowed reproduction of the SARS coronavirus in cell cultures. Raoult reviewed that evidence in a 2007 paper, concluding that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might be \"an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases worldwide.\" This winter, as the spread of SARS-CoV-2 began to take on the contours of a pandemic, he surveyed the data that had begun coming out of China. An early report on chloroquine showed good results in vitro. In mid-February, another Chinese team reported that, in more than 100 patients, it had been found to have \"potent activity against Covid-19.\" Raoult was elated.\n\nAt the time, health authorities around the world were warning that a viable treatment could be months away. The Chinese reports, however, appeared to confirm Raoult's longstanding hopes for chloroquine. A deadly virus for which no treatment existed could evidently be stopped by an inexpensive, widely studied, pre-existing molecule, and one that Raoult knew well. A more heedful scientist might have surveyed the Chinese data and begun preparations for tests of his own. Raoult did this, but he also posted a brief, jubilant video on YouTube, under the title \"Coronavirus: Game Over!\" Chloroquine had produced what he called \"spectacular improvements\" in the Chinese patients. \"It's excellent news -- this is probably the easiest respiratory infection to treat of all,\" Raoult said. \"The only thing I'll tell you is, be careful: Soon the pharmacies won't have any chloroquine left!\"\n\nRaoult has spent nearly his entire life in Marseille, a famously ragged and combative city, which he loves. He named a genus of bacteria, Massilia, for it and has given its name or the names of its neighborhoods to numerous other species of microbe. Marseille has been a major port for more than 2,000 years and has a correspondingly rich history of disease. It was the point of entry into France for all three of the great waves of bubonic plague, beginning in the sixth century. Between 1720 and 1722, the plague killed about half of Marseille's population; one of its central neighborhoods, on the old port, is today named for the bishop who tended to the ill while the city's doctors hid in fear.\n\nRaoult wrote his first research paper, in 1979, on a tick-borne infection sometimes known as Marseille fever. The disease was also called \"benign summer fever,\" and more than 50 years of science said it was nonlethal. And yet one of the 41 patients in his data set had died. Before submitting the paper, Raoult, who was then a young resident, gave it to a supervising professor for review. \"And he takes it,\" Raoult told me, \"he doesn't show it to me again, and he publishes it -- and he'd taken out the death. Because he didn't know how to make sense of the death.\" Raoult was disgusted, and the incident shaped his philosophy of scientific inquiry. \"I learned that the people who wanted to follow the familiar path were prepared to cheat in order to do it,\" he said. In subsequent work, he demonstrated that Marseille fever was indeed fatal in almost precisely one in every 41 cases. \"He was a 'follower,'\" Raoult said of the professor. \"And these 'followers' are all cheaters. That's what I thought. And it's still what I think.\"\n\nHe is, fundamentally, a contrarian. In Raoult's view, little of consequence has been accomplished by researchers who endorse the habitual tools and theories of their age. \"I've spent my life being 'against,'\" he told me. \"I tell young scientists: 'You know, you don't need a brain to agree. All you need is a spinal cord.'\" He is thrilled by conflict. It is a matter both of philosophy -- the influence, no doubt, of the thinker he refers to admiringly as \"master Nietzsche\" -- and of temperament. \"He loves to know that things are roiling around him,\" one of his lab technicians told me; he sets off storms and admires them as they roll out over the land. His peers shake their heads at this behavior but grant him a grudging respect. \"You can't knock him down,\" said Mark Pallen, a professor of microbial genomics at the University of East Anglia. \"In terms of his place in the canon, the sainthood of science, he's pretty secure there.\"\n\nHe is also interested in power and has been attentive to it from the start. In 1985 and 1986, Raoult worked at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Md., where he discovered the Science Citation Index. The index, a tool that can be used to measure a scientist's influence on the basis of his or her publication history, was relatively unknown in France. Raoult looked up the researchers reputed to be the best in Marseille. \"It was really the emperor wears no clothes,\" he said. \"These people didn't publish. There was one who hadn't written a paper in 10 years.\" In Raoult's view, French science was a duchy of appearances, connections and self-reverence. \"It was people saying\" -- he mimed the drone of an aristocrat -- \"\u2009'Oh, him, yes, he's very good.' And this reputation, you don't know what it's based on, but it's not the truth.\"\n\nFor decades, Raoult has boasted of his prodigious rates of publication and citation, which, as objective statistics, he considers to be the best measure of his worth as a researcher. Biomedical researchers in France write or contribute to perhaps 10 scientific papers every year and a few hundred in the course of a career. Raoult's name sits atop several thousand; in each of the past eight years, he has produced more than 100. In 2020, he has already published at least 54.\n\nRaoult is reputed to be an indefatigable worker, but he also achieves his extreme rate of publication by attaching his name to nearly every paper that comes out of his institute. Though the practice is not unheard-of, it is unusual. \"Even to just read those papers would take up a large percentage of anyone's time,\" Pallen told me. \"For someone like me to actually go through them carefully, critique them, make a substantial intellectual contribution -- I think that would be practically impossible.\"\n\nWith few exceptions, the department heads at the IHU have worked under Raoult for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. It is an \"ancestral system,\" \"familial\" and \"clanlike,\" said Michel Drancourt, a clinician who is Raoult's longest-serving collaborator. Raoult is, without question, the patriarch, and he is in some respects reputed to be benevolent. The IHU spends a great deal of money on scholarships and research grants for students from the developing world, for instance, and Raoult is known to be accessible to young researchers in a way that distinguishes him from other high-powered scientists. He is also known for berating his subordinates. While visiting the IHU, I watched a young researcher emerge from Raoult's office in tears and rush into the arms of her friends, who were evidently accustomed to this. \"When he's not happy about something, he'll let you know,\" one of them told me. A 2017 employee letter of complaint, which was followed by an investigation of the IHU, described the \"screaming,\" \"insults\" and \"psychological bullying\" of a \"leadership of another era.\" Along the entryway to Raoult's institute, there's a line from Horace: Exegi monumentum aere perennius, \"I have crafted a monument more lasting than bronze.\"\n\nIn recent years, Raoult has amused himself, it seems, by staking out tendentious scientific claims, sometimes in territories that are well beyond the scope of his expertise. He is skeptical, for instance, of the utility of mathematical modeling in the realm of epidemiology. The same logic has led him to conclude that climate modelers are no more than \"soothsayers\" for our \"scientistic era\" and that their dire predictions are mostly just an attempt to expiate our intense but irrational feelings of guilt.\n\nHe is also dismissive of the alarmism that is the default position among specialists of infectious disease. He doubted, initially, that SARS-CoV-2 would spread beyond China, or that it might be a terrible problem if it did. On Jan. 20, Chinese scientists confirmed that infections were being transmitted from patient to patient, and President Xi Jinping, in his first public comments about the coronavirus, declared that all possible measures would have to be taken to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization announced an emergency meeting. The following day, in Marseille, Raoult posted a video to his institute's YouTube channel. He faced his offscreen interviewer with weary eyes, sighed and said, \"You know, the world has gone crazy.\" Every year, he said, there are probably 600 or 700 people who die from coronavirus infections in France and thousands more from other respiratory illnesses. \"The fact that people have died from a coronavirus in China, I don't feel like it means much of anything for me,\" he said. \"I don't know, maybe people don't have anything to do, so they've gone looking in China for something to be scared about.\"\n\nRaoult's most recent book, \"Epidemics: Real Dangers and False Alerts,\" was published in late March, by which time the W.H.O. had reported more than 330,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide and more than 14,500 deaths. \"This anguish over epidemics,\" he writes, \"is completely untethered from the reality of deaths from infectious diseases.\"\n\nBy the standards of molecular biology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, the technology most commonly used to test for SARS-CoV-2, is not extravagantly complex. But it depends upon collection swabs, thermocycling machines, chemical reagents and nucleotide probes and primers, and if any one of these components is in insufficient supply, the tests cannot be run. Beginning in January, when the SARS-CoV-2 genome was first published, the IHU bought or borrowed as much of all these as possible, spending a half million euros on new machines alone. Whatever Raoult's reservations about the virus, he did not intend to miss the opportunity to study it, and perhaps to win the race to find a treatment. His institute receives most of its funding from public sources -- Raoult was given 130 million euros to build it -- but it effectively controls its own budget, and Raoult, as the founding director, has near-complete control of what goes on inside its walls. \"He can essentially say, 'Hold on, I want to turn the bedroom and the dining room into a kitchen,'\" Drancourt said.\n\nNearly 800 people work at the institute. In early March, as coronavirus patients began arriving, almost all the staff members turned their efforts to SARS-CoV-2. Raoult obtained authorization to begin a small clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine. Because viral respiratory infections often lead to secondary bacterial infections, however, Raoult wanted to test a supplementary antibiotic in some patients; he chose azithromycin, which he had previously tested against Zika. \"If you're going to choose one, you might as well choose one that's been shown to be active against a virus,\" said Bernard La Scola, who runs the biosafety lab at the IHU.\n\nHydroxychloroquine is believed to inhibit viral reproduction in infected cells by raising their pH, as in Q fever and Whipple's disease; the antiviral mechanism of azithromycin has not been explained. But what works works. If we relied only upon medications with precisely established mechanisms, a number of popular drugs -- acetaminophen, for instance, the active ingredient in Tylenol -- would not be in use. I asked Raoult if the idea to test the drugs together had emerged from discussions with his team. \"It was me,\" he told me. \"Don't kid yourself.\"\n\nTesting had been scheduled to run for two weeks per patient, but after only six days, the results were so favorable that Raoult decided to end the trial and publish. \"Usually, we'd take time to write, to make corrections, to consider, to go over things 50 times,\" said Philippe Gautret, the department head who was the first listed author on the paper. \"In this case, we were working with a sense of real urgency. Because we thought we had to get the word out, because, maybe, we'd found a way to make things better.\"\n\nOthers might have proceeded with more caution or perhaps waited to confirm these results with a larger, more rigorous trial. Raoult likes to think of himself as a doctor first, however, with a moral obligation to treat his patients that supersedes any desire to produce reliable data. \"We're not going to tell someone, 'Listen, today's not your lucky day, you're getting the placebo, you're going to be dying,'\" he told me. He believes it to be unnecessary, in addition to being unethical, to run randomized controlled trials, or R.C.T.s, of treatments for deadly infectious diseases. If these have become the accepted standard in biomedical research, Raoult contends, it is only because they appeal to statisticians \"who have never seen a patient.\" He refers to these scientists disdainfully as \"methodologists.\"\n\nRaoult's paper included results for 36 patients. Fourteen were treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate; six were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and azithromycin; and 16 served as controls. On Day 6 of the trial, 14 of the 16 control patients still tested positive for the virus. Patients receiving hydroxychloroquine fared markedly better, with only six of 14 testing positive on Day 6. Most encouraging, though, all six patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were found to be rid of the virus.\n\nSeveral prominent French doctors cautioned that the results would have to be confirmed and warned of possible side effects. The French health minister deemed the trial promising but called for more testing. Raoult had already begun assembling data for a larger study, but he dismissed the need for anything particularly vast or lengthy. Like other critics of the R.C.T., he likes to point out that a number of self-evidently useful developments in the realm of human health have never been validated by such rigorous tests. This observation has come to be known as the parachute paradigm: We tend to accept the claim that parachutes reduce injury among people who leap from airplanes, but this effect has never been proved in a randomized study that compares an experimental parachute group to an unlucky parachuteless control. \"It's like Didier says,\" Drancourt told me. \"If you don't have something that's visible in 10 patients, or 30, it's useless. It's not of any consequence.\" An effective treatment for a potentially lethal infectious disease will be visible to the naked eye.\n\nOn March 16, a Long Island attorney and blockchain enthusiast named Gregory Rigano appeared on Laura Ingraham's nightly show on Fox News, \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Ingraham introduced the segment by asking: \"What if there's already a cheap and widely available medication, that's on the market, to treat the virus? Well, according to a new study, there is such a drug. It's called chloroquine.\" Rigano, who at the time was falsely presenting himself as an adviser to Stanford Medical School, had recently self-published an acclamatory report on the potential of chloroquine, \"An Effective Treatment for Coronavirus (Covid-19),\" as a Google Doc formatted to resemble a scientific publication. It had begun to circulate in right-wing media and also in Silicon Valley; Elon Musk tweeted a link to it. Raoult saw it and noticed the attention it was receiving online. Another researcher might have found this sort of publication irresponsible and dangerous. Raoult began corresponding with Rigano and his co-author, James Todaro, an ophthalmologist and Bitcoin investor. Raoult authorized them to share his results before they had been published.\n\nOn air, Rigano announced that a researcher in the south of France, \"one of the most eminent infectious-disease specialists in the whole world,\" was about to publish the results of a major clinical study. \"Within a matter of six days, the patients taking hydroxychloroquine tested negative for coronavirus, for Covid-19,\" Rigano said. (He made no mention of azithromycin.) \"We have a strong reason to believe that a preventative dose of hydroxychloroquine is going to prevent the virus from attaching to the body, and just get rid of it completely,\" he added. \"That's a game changer,\" Ingraham said.\n\nIn the coming days, Ingraham questioned both Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Trump's pandemic task force, and Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, about the drug. Sean Hannity began promoting it as a cure for Covid-19. \"Let's put it this way,\" he said on his radio show. \"If I had it -- personally, I am speaking only for Sean Hannity -- I would be all over this.\" Rigano appeared on Tucker Carlson's show and claimed that Raoult's study had shown hydroxychloroquine to have a \"100 percent cure rate against coronavirus.\" According to Todaro, Raoult had sent him a copy of his study and allowed him to post it on Twitter that day, two days before the preprint release. \"I suspect he gave us permission because he knew it was the fastest way to disseminate the trial results,\" Todaro told me. (Rigano did not respond to requests for comment.) Later, Raoult himself appeared on \"Dr. Oz,\" the talk show hosted by the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, a frequent Fox News guest who has promoted hydroxychloroquine. \"I believe that ideas and theories are epidemic,\" Raoult once wrote. \"When they're good, they take root.\"\n\nTrump began hyping hydroxychloroquine on March 19, at a White House news conference with his coronavirus task force. \"I think it's going to be very exciting,\" Trump said. \"I think it could be a game changer and maybe not. And maybe not. But I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer. Very powerful.\" He suggested, inaccurately, that the F.D.A. had approved the drug for use against Covid-19. He made no mention of azithromycin. Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn of the F.D.A. gently corrected him later and said that a large clinical trial would be the appropriate way to evaluate the therapeutic value of the drug.\n\nStill, because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are available for use in other conditions, doctors were able to provide Covid-19 patients with \"off-label\" treatment if they believed it would provide a benefit. Shortages of the drugs were reported beginning in mid-March. The F.D.A., under what appears to have been strong pressure from the Trump administration, issued an emergency-use authorization for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, giving doctors access to tens of millions of doses of the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile. Unusually, the C.D.C., at what was reportedly Trump's direct urging, issued Covid-19 prescription guidelines for the drugs based upon unattributed clinical anecdotes. (The guidelines were later withdrawn.) A top government biomedical official was removed from his post, he has claimed, for having resisted political pressure to fund \"potentially dangerous drugs,\" including hydroxychloroquine.\n\nThere is much about Raoult that might make him, and by extension his proposed treatment, appealing to a man like Trump. He is an iconoclast with funny hair; he thinks almost everyone else is stupid, especially those who are typically regarded as smart; he is beloved by the angry and conspiracy-minded; his self-congratulation is more or less unceasing. Raoult and I spoke several days after the emergency-use authorization was signed. He said he hadn't heard about it and seemed surprised, but he also said that Trump had impressed him with his intuition on hydroxychloroquine. \"He's not so dumb,\" he said, laughing. Raoult classified Trump's psychology as that of an \"entrepreneur,\" by way of contrast with that of a \"politician.\" \"Entrepreneurs are people who know how to decide, who know how to take risks,\" he said. \"And at a certain point, to decide is to take a risk. Every decision is a risk.\"\n\nThe French waited far too long, in his estimation, to approve the use of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients. The authorization came only after Raoult announced in the press that he would continue, \"in accordance with the Hippocratic oath\" and effectively in defiance of the government, to treat patients with his combination therapy. \"I'm convinced that in the end, everyone will be using this treatment,\" Raoult told Le Parisien. \"It's just a matter of time before people agree to eat their hats.\"\n\nThe dynamics of a crisis are not especially conducive to reliable science. In October 1985, in the terrible early years of the AIDS epidemic, a group of French doctors, joined by the French minister of social affairs, held a news conference to announce to the world that they had discovered what looked like a cure. The drug was cyclosporine, an inexpensive immunosuppressant that had until then been used in organ transplants to prevent the rejection of new tissue. In AIDS patients, cyclosporine had the paradoxical effect of increasing white-blood-cell counts; patients underwent a \"spectacular improvement,\" one researcher said. The announcement was based upon results from only two patients, however, and these patients had begun treatment only one week earlier. The scientists were widely criticized at the time for flouting the norms of biomedical research to report such limited data. \"Given the strength of our hypotheses,\" they responded, \"we believe that, ethically, we could not continue to keep our results a secret just to respect the usual laws of scientific conduct.\"\n\n\"Like Raoult, they felt very strongly about what they said,\" said Jean-Michel Molina, who directs the infectious-disease departments at two public hospitals in Paris. \"They felt that they had found a cure.\" Shortly after the announcement, one of the two patients died, and it was revealed that a third patient had died before the news conference; he had been excluded from the reported results because his case was considered too grave to reverse. Within weeks, the remaining patient's white-blood-cell count had fallen to its previous level. Experimentation with cyclosporine soon stopped.\n\nLike many doctors, Molina viewed Raoult's study with skepticism, but he was also curious to see if his proposed treatment regimen might in fact work. He tested hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 11 of his own patients. \"We had severe patients, and we wanted to try something,\" Molina told me. Within five days, one had died, and two others had been transferred out of his service to intensive care. In another patient, the treatment was suspended after the onset of cardiac issues, a known side effect of the drugs. Eight of the 10 surviving patients still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the conclusion of the study period. Raoult's data had come from patients with mild or early cases of the disease, when viral loads are lower, and I asked Molina if his patients had not been too sick to benefit from the treatment. \"If there is antiviral activity, you should be able to see it,\" he said. \"You know, you may say, 'It's too late, you're not going to see the clinical benefit.' But at least you should see the antiviral activity. If it's an antiviral.\"\n\nRaoult's study had measured only viral load. It offered no data on clinical outcomes, and it was not clear if the patients' actual symptoms had improved or indeed whether the patients lived or died. At the outset, 26 patients were assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine, six more than the 20 who appeared in the final results. The six additional patients had been \"lost in follow-up,\" the authors wrote, \"because of early cessation of treatment.\" The reasons given were concerning. One patient stopped taking the drug after developing nausea. Three patients had to be transferred out of the institute to intensive care. One patient died. (Another patient elected to leave the hospital before the end of the treatment cycle.) \"So four of the 26 treated patients were actually not recovering at all,\" noted Elisabeth Bik, a scientific consultant who wrote a widely circulated blog post on Raoult's study. She paraphrased the sarcasm circulating on Twitter: \"My results always look amazing if I leave out the patients who died.\"\n\nThe report was also riddled with discrepancies and apparent errors. Its selection criteria called for participants above the age of 12, but three of the control subjects were younger than this. The control patients were drawn not only from the IHU but also from hospitals in two other cities, where the standard of care and the testing protocols may have differed. Fourteen of 16 control patients were reported to have tested positive for the virus at the conclusion of the study on Day 6. In fact, according to the initial report, for five of those 14, no data was collected that day. One of the six patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and was recorded as \"virologically cured\" at Day 6 was found, in the end, to be carrying the virus two days later.\n\nThis apparent sloppiness was unsurprising to many of those who have tracked Raoult's work in the past. A prominent French microbiologist told me that, in terms of publication, Raoult's reputation among scientists has been \"long gone\" for some time. \"In private,\" the researcher wrote to me, \"everybody agrees on the low reliability/reproducibility of most of the papers coming out of his lab.\" (He asked to speak anonymously so as not to anger Raoult, whom he knows.) In 2018, after damning evaluations, Raoult's principal laboratory groups were stripped of their association with two of France's top public research institutions. Raoult was found to have produced an extraordinary number of publications but few of great quality. \"It's very easy to publish [expletive] when you know how publishing works,\" said Karine Lacombe, a professor of medicine in Paris who has recently been among Raoult's more outspoken critics.\n\nBeyond its apparent errors and omissions, the study's design -- its small size, its flawed control, the unrandomized assignment of patients to the treatment and control groups -- was widely viewed to render its results meaningless. Fauci repeatedly called its results \"anecdotal\"; the biostatistician who analyzed the paper on behalf of the French government's coronavirus advisory committee wrote that it was \"impossible to interpret the effect described therein as being attributable to treatment with hydroxychloroquine.\"\n\nLarge, well-controlled randomized trials are by no means the only way to arrive at useful scientific insights. Their utility is that they enhance statistical signals such that, amid the noise of human variability and random chance, even the faint effect of some new treatment can be detected. The prime statistical hurdle that any proposed treatment for Covid-19 will have to overcome -- one that is delicate for even Raoult's critics to make note of, amid the sorrow and fear of this pandemic -- is that the signal is likely to be very faint, because the disease is, in the end, rarely fatal. Nearly everyone survives; an effective treatment will save the life of the one or so patients in every hundred who would not have lived without it. \"You know, people sometimes say, 'If the patient gets better, that's because of the drug, and if they get worse, it's because of the virus,'\" Molina told me. \"And of course that's not true. And that's why you need to do a well-conducted, randomized, placebo-controlled study if you want to show anything.\" It is possible that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are an effective treatment for Covid-19. But Raoult's study showed, at best, that 20 people who would almost certainly have survived without any treatment at all also survived for six days while taking the drugs Raoult prescribed.\n\n\"If you haven't done this stuff, you can look at a report of people responding to such a treatment and figure that the answer is here -- right here, and anyone who doesn't see it must have some ulterior motives,\" Derek Lowe, a longtime pharmaceutical researcher, wrote for Science Translational Medicine last month. \"But that's not how it works.\" He went on: \"Alzheimer's drugs, obesity drugs, cardiovascular drugs, osteoporosis drugs: Over and over, there have been what looked like positive results that evaporated on closer inspection. After you've experienced this a few times, you take the lesson to heart that the only way to be sure about these things is to run sufficiently powered controlled trials. No shortcuts, no gut feelings -- just data.\"\n\n\"I've invented 10 or so treatments in my life,\" Raoult told me. \"Half of them are prescribed all over the world. I've never done a double-blind study in my life, never. Never! Never done anything randomized, either.\" He noted, with some satisfaction, that the criticism was more intense than he had anticipated. \"Honestly, I couldn't have imagined that it would set off a frenzy like this,\" he said, leaning back in his office chair and gesturing at the storm he had created in the world outside. \"When you tell the story, it's extremely straightforward, no? It's subject, verb, complement: You detect a disease; there's a drug that's cheap, whose safety we know all about because there's two billion people who take it; we prescribe it, and it changes what it changes. It might not be a miracle product, but it's better than doing nothing, no?\"\n\nHis subordinates defended the study as the best work they could do under the circumstances and the fastest way to alert the world to the possibility of a treatment. The use of off-site controls was not ideal, for example, but it was the only option if they wanted to move fast. \"Of course it's a methodological weakness,\" Gautret, the first author, told me. \"But we made do with what we had.\" As for the six patients \"lost in follow-up,\" even if it had been possible to collect data from them, it would have been nonsensical to include most of them in their report. Their aim was \"to treat people in the early stages of the disease, when it's not yet serious,\" Gautret said. \"We know that in acute viral diseases, the earlier you treat, the better your chances of success. It makes no sense to include people who are at the edge of death in the study. We're not claiming to be able to treat people who are nearly dead.\" Another small study, in 80 patients, likewise showed better results for patients with mild forms of the disease.\n\nIn Marseille, Raoult told me he would be releasing a third study, this one of 1,000 patients, the following week. Initial results were published in mid-April. Raoult had treated 1,061 patients with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The study was neither controlled nor randomized; at the time of the preprint release, eight patients had died, and five remained hospitalized, while 46 in total experienced a \"poor clinical outcome.\" The findings were summarized as \"98.7 percent of patients cured so far.\" The therapy constituted a \"safe and efficient treatment for Covid-19,\" the authors wrote.\n\nOther scientists disagreed with this characterization of the results. \"The cure rate is almost identical to what's been described about the natural course of the disease,\" the virologist Christine Rouzioux told French radio. Lacombe called Raoult's conclusions \"magical thinking,\" adding: \"I very honestly think he hasn't shown anything at all.\" It was soon discovered, too, that the second and third studies had been conducted without approval from a state ethics board. In an initial version of the third paper, Raoult wrote that he had conducted a \"retrospective study on a cohort of patients receiving standard treatment following a research protocol previously registered.\" He provided a reference to the protocol that had been approved for the first trial. But that protocol included hydroxychloroquine alone and not azithromycin; Raoult never received approval to systematically test a combination of the drugs.\n\nThe French medical regulatory agency, the A.N.S.M., sent Raoult a request for evidence of the second study's \"legal status\" in mid-April. Later in the month, the French Medical Council issued a statement, widely assumed to be directed at Raoult, reminding its members that \"the endangerment of patients\" by exposure to \"treatments that have not been scientifically validated\" could be cause for immediate suspension. Raoult responded on Twitter, where he now has a half million followers, that the council's threat was \"obviously\" not applicable to his case. In a statement on the A.N.S.M.'s inquiry, the IHU insisted that the study did not involve experimentation because \"no procedure beyond the standard of care\" -- which, at the IHU, was hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin -- had been employed.\n\nRaoult had by then begun to lose his composure. He accused Lacombe of being a shill for the pharmaceutical industry; his fans sent her death threats. On Twitter, he called Bik, the consultant who wrote critically about the first study, a \"witch hunter\" and called a study that she tweeted -- one of several published in April and May that seemed to suggest that Raoult's treatment regimen was ineffectual or even harmful -- \"fake news.\" The authors of another such study were accused of \"scientific fraud.\" \"My detractors are children!\" Raoult told an interviewer. The world's attention has drifted to new studies of other drugs; Raoult has taken to attacking those studies for their methodological weaknesses.\n\nThe results of his initial trial have yet to be replicated. \"I think what he secretly hopes is that no one will ever be able to show anything,\" Molina told me. \"That all the trials conducted on hydroxychloroquine will not be able to even reach a conclusion of no efficacy.\" In recent weeks, Raoult has in fact tempered his claims about the virtues of his treatment regimen. The published, peer-reviewed version of the final study noted that another two patients had died, bringing the total to 10. Where the earlier version called the drugs \"safe and efficient,\" they were now described merely as \"safe.\"\n\nHe has shown flickers of what appears to be doubt. In one interview, Raoult quoted Camus, from the fatalistic coda of \"The Stranger,\" hoping that \"on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators, and that they should greet me with howls of hatred.\"\n\n\"I don't trust popularity,\" he told the interviewer. \"When too many people think you're wonderful, you should start to wonder.\" His initial YouTube video, \"Coronavirus: Game Over!\" has also been renamed. The new language is more measured, and in place of the exclamation point there now stands a question mark.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- The doctor who led the federal agency involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine said on Wednesday that he was removed from his post after he pressed for rigorous vetting of hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug embraced by President Trump as a coronavirus treatment, and that the administration has put \"politics and cronyism ahead of science.\"\n\nDr. Rick Bright was abruptly dismissed this week as the director of the Department of Health and Human Services' Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, and removed as the deputy assistant secretary for preparedness and response. He was given a narrower job at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nIn a scorching statement, Dr. Bright assailed the leadership at the health department, saying he was pressured to direct money toward hydroxychloroquine, one of several \"potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections\" and repeatedly described by the president as a potential \"game changer\" in the fight against the virus.\n\n\"I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,\" he said in his statement. \"I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science -- not politics or cronyism -- has to lead the way.\"\n\nDoubts about the use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus and the lack of evidence about the drug's effectiveness -- -- including some small studies that indicated patients could be harmed -- appear to have dampened Mr. Trump's p enthusiasm for it.\n\nAs the seriousness of the pandemic became clearer in mid-March, the president seized on anecdotal reports about victims of the coronavirus who recovered quickly after using the drug. Desperate for good news as he watched the death toll climb and the stock market plummet, Mr. Trump could hardly contain his excitement.\n\nIn a post on Twitter on March 21, the president urged federal officials to quickly approve the use of hydroxychloroquine with an antibiotic called azithromycin -- a combination that he believed could work on the coronavirus.\n\n\"Hopefully they will BOTH (H works better with A, International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents) be put in use IMMEDIATELY,\" he tweeted. \"PEOPLE ARE DYING, MOVE FAST, and GOD BLESS EVERYONE!\"\n\nBy then, Mr. Trump's favorite Fox News hosts were echoing his optimism that hydroxychloroquine could be a magic bullet against the virus. A day after meeting in the Oval Office with Laura Ingraham and two doctors promoting the drug as a cure-all, Mr. Trump became First Salesman, promoting it from the White House briefing room.\n\n\"I'll say it again: What do you have to lose?\" Mr. Trump said on April 4, carefully pronouncing the drug, hydroxychloroquine. His presidential prescription: \"Take it.\"\n\nIn briefing after briefing with reporters at the White House, Mr. Trump defied the voices of medical experts and some of his own top advisers -- including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist and an adviser to the coronavirus task force -- who cautioned that hydroxychloroquine, which is used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus as well as malaria, needed to undergo the same kind of rigorous evaluation that other drugs do.\n\nIn mid-April, a small trial in Brazil was halted after some patients developed irregular heart rates. Then a study this week of 368 Veterans Affairs patients, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that it did not help patients avoid the need for ventilators, and that the use of the drug alone was associated with an increased risk of death. And this week, a panel of the government's own experts at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said there was \"insufficient data\" to recommend taking it to treat symptoms from the virus.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A doctor says he was removed after pressing for rigorous vetting of treatments embraced by Trump. The timeline of the virus's spread in the U.S. shifts with the revelation of an early death in California. Not so fast, Trump tells Georgia as it moves to let barbershops and tattoo parlors reopen. See more updates Updated 20m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe president has not talked much since then about hydroxychloroquine.\n\nIn his statement, Dr. Bright did not directly name Mr. Trump. But the searing language he used left little doubt that he viewed the administration's support for the drug as pressure to ignore scientific facts in favor of politics.\n\n\"My professional background has prepared me for a moment like this -- to confront and defeat a deadly virus that threatens Americans and people around the globe,\" Dr. Bright wrote. \"To this point, I have led the government's efforts to invest in the best science available to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, this resulted in clashes with H.H.S. political leadership, including criticism for my proactive efforts to invest early into vaccines and supplies critical to saving American lives. I also resisted efforts to fund potentially dangerous drugs promoted by those with political connections,\" he said, adding that hydroxychloroquine was \"promoted by the administration as a panacea, but which clearly lack scientific merit.\"\n\nAsked about Dr. Bright and his transfer on Wednesday at the daily White House briefing, Mr. Trump said he did not know who he was.\n\n\"I never heard of him,\" the president told reporters. \"You mention the name, I never heard of him. When did this happen? I never heard of him. The guy says he was pushed out of a job. Maybe he was. Maybe he wasn't. I don't know who he is.\"\n\nA career government official who has led BARDA since 2016, Dr. Bright pointed specifically to the initial efforts to make chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine widely available before it was scientifically tested for efficacy with the coronavirus.\n\n\"While I am prepared to look at all options and to think 'outside the box' for effective treatments, I rightly resisted efforts to provide an unproven drug on demand to the American public,\" Dr. Bright said, describing what ultimately happened: \"I insisted that these drugs be provided only to hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19 while under the supervision of a physician.\"\n\nA person familiar with Dr. Bright's account said that he was pressured to rush access to the drug after the president and Larry Ellison, the chairman and chief technology officer of Oracle, had a conversation about chloroquines. Dr. Bright was then directed to put in place a nationwide expanded access program to make the drugs available on a broad basis without specific controls in place, according to the person familiar with his account.\n\nMedical experts say that it is still not known whether hydroxychloroquine might yet emerge as an effective treatment for the most devastating symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The studies in Brazil and at the Department of Veterans Affairs were small and limited. Comprehensive, peer-reviewed studies have yet to be completed, and while hospitals are using the drug, many doctors acknowledge they are doing so only because they have few other tools to help dying patients.\n\nAnd inside the White House, the drug still has its true believers, including Peter Navarro, a trade adviser who has been put in charge of procuring protective gear and other medical supplies to fight the virus. Mr. Navarro is relentless with anyone in the West Wing who will listen, encouraging the government to keep stockpiling the drug and dismissing the recent studies as \"deeply flawed.\"\n\nThe Brazil study gave doses of hydroxychloroquine in excess of the levels recommended by the Food and Drug Administration, he said in an interview. The Veterans Affairs study administered the medicine too late and focused narrowly on an older population with high incidences of cardiac failure, diabetes and lung disease, among other issues, he insisted.\n\n\"None of this was reported by a mainstream media which appears incapable of reading anything more than study headlines,\" he said. \"To date, almost 40 studies have reported apparent usefulness of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine in shortening length of hospital stay, improving symptoms, and resolving lung lesions as seen on X-rays.\"\n\nAnd some doctors around the country are still hopeful that more complete tests of the drug might still yield some positive news.\n\nDr. William W. O'Neill, a cardiologist at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit who is organizing a large randomized study using the drug as a preventive medication in health care workers and emergency medical workers, said he had \"cautious optimism\" but urged the public to avoid drawing premature conclusions.\n\n\"Everybody is desperate to find out all the answers,\" Dr. O'Neill said. \"But we have to be careful about jumping to conclusions either way.\"\n\nDr. Bright said his superiors at the Department of Health and Human Services were doing exactly that.\n\nHe is represented by the lawyers who represented Christine Blasey Ford, who testified against the nomination of Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, accusing him of sexual misconduct decades ago, a claim he denied.\n\nIn a statement, the lawyers called Dr. Bright's change in position \"retaliation, plain and simple\" and said they planned to ask for an investigation.\n\nA White House spokesman, Judd Deere, did not directly address the accusations on Wednesday.\n\n\"While some are rooting for the drug to fail, President Trump is simply offering a consistent message of hope, comfort and optimism while telling Americans to consult with their doctor,\" Mr. Deere said.\n\nA spokeswoman for Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nThe medical publication Stat reported on Tuesday that Dr. Bright had clashed with Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant health secretary for preparedness and response. A former administration official disputed that Dr. Bright expressed significant opposition to the drug and insisted that he was moved out of his position because of longstanding concerns about his job performance.\n\nMichael D.

        "body": "You don't need flying cars to save lives. A little tech can make big improvements.\n\nThis article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.\n\nOverwhelmed government bureaucracy and technology has failed Americans trying to apply for unemployment benefits or business loans.\n\nBut some government technology is holding up well in this crisis.\n\nI talked to two people overseeing 911 emergency response systems whose digital modernization -- not trivial for resource-strapped government agencies -- is helping the helpers help us.\n\nIn New Orleans, recent upgrades to emergency systems have enabled paramedics to do video call assessments of people with symptoms of a coronavirus infection. In Manatee County, Fla., emergency responders can now more precisely pinpoint people's location -- necessary when a call comes from a boat in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIf you're thinking these upgrades seem basic, you're right. We like to imagine fanciful technology feats, but you don't need flying cars to save lives.\n\nTechnology with potentially the biggest impact is often humdrum stuff that drags businesses and government agencies into the age of Google Maps and Zoom.\n\nA little tech can make big improvements. New Orleans was hit in March with a double whammy: Almost every call to 911 or its 311 information line was about the coronavirus, and at times, up to 60 percent of emergency responders were off work because of potential exposure to the virus.\n\nWith technology from a company called Carbyne, the city created a triage system on the fly. Emergency responders were dispatched as usual to people who required medical attention fast. Callers who were assessed as having less serious symptoms would get video calls from paramedics.\n\nThe technology allowed New Orleans to prioritize emergency resources to those in the most need, still help people who didn't require lifesaving interventions, and protect paramedics from unnecessary exposure to the virus, said Tyrell Morris, executive director of the Orleans Parish Communication District.\n\nIn Manatee County on Florida's west coast, technology helped solve a different, thorny problem: Cellphone location data isn't precise enough for 911 operators to know whether a call is coming from the 30th floor of an office building or the first, said Jacob Saur, the county's director of public safety.\n\nUsing technology from RapidDeploy, the operators now have more precise location data even if callers can't give their exact location. Recently, Saur said, 911 operators were able to track someone on a boat who didn't know where he was and needed help for a friend who had been hit in the head with an anchor.\n\nIn the future, the same system could let dispatchers message directly with callers. Saur said someone reporting a traffic accident or fire could stream video of the scene for emergency responders to better assess how to respond.\n\nBoth counties said these improvements wouldn't have been possible without efforts across the country to retrofit telephone-based emergency operations for the internet. Again, boring stuff, but it's expensive and nerve-racking to rebuild a public safety agency where there's zero margin for failure.\n\nTechnology is not a cure-all for overburdened institutions, nor can it replace smart leadership and effective bureaucracy. But as these examples show, it can help do more with less.\n\nFacebook wants you to never leave\n\nFacebook is trying to be a little bit eBay.\n\nThe company introduced a new feature Tuesday called Shops, which will let businesses promote and sell products on their Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nSounds like a website, right? Yup, for a long time, Facebook has been trying to recreate the internet entirely within its walls.\n\nI have no idea if businesses will use the Shops feature in large numbers. But there's a sensible idea at the root: Why should a local toy store maintain a website when it can repurpose a Facebook or Instagram account it probably already has?\n\nMy colleague Mike Isaac, who writes about Facebook, called Shops \"a website in a box.\"\n\nShops has similarities to WeChat, the do-everything app in China that's often the only digital presence for businesses in that country.\n\nMany small business owners consider it essential to have a presence on Facebook. Customers expect to find their favorite shops and restaurants on Facebook (and Google), but most American businesses won't ditch a website. That means drumming up attention and sales on Facebook can be one more draining, expensive and maddening task.\n\nMike said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder and chief executive, called the shots on Shops himself. It's another sign of Zuckerberg taking control of decisions that he once considered below his pay grade.\n\nBefore we go ...\n\nThey remind me of Wall-E, and they're not super useful: My colleagues Cade Metz and Erin Griffith write about robots and drones that have helped deliver groceries and other essentials to people during the pandemic. The problem is the little guys can't carry very much -- a couple muffins or croissants, one customer said -- and robots function effectively only in ideal conditions where sidewalks are plentiful and mean teens don't kick them over. (I'll have a conversation with Cade in tomorrow's newsletter.)\n\nBigger than Taylor Swift and UFOs: Welp, here's a discouraging analysis by my colleagues: The slickly produced, nonsense-filled \"Plandemic\" conspiracy video has gotten more interaction on Facebook than any other moment of digital drama during the pandemic so far -- way more than Taylor Swift's concert announcement and the Pentagon's videos of mysterious \"aerial phenomena.\"\n\nHow badly do you want fried chicken? Cheetah Express is a delivery service on Instagram that ferries KFC orders from the West Bank to Israel and through multiple checkpoints to Gaza. Food arrives cold many hours later, but Cheetah Express has provided \"a rare opportunity to enjoy American fast food in one of the most isolated places on earth,\" says this article in the publication Rest of World.\n\nHugs to this\n\nThe Porter brothers do Irish step dances on TikTok, and they're awesome.\n\nWe want to hear from you.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\n\"Honey\" -- the woman could hear fear tightening her husband's voice as he called out to her -- \"I think your mother just died.\" She ran into the living room. Her 78-year-old mother sat rigid in a chair, her skin gray and lifeless. Her eyes were open but all white, as if she were trying to see the back of her own skull. Then her arms started to make little jerking movements; her lips parted as saliva seeped out the corner of her mouth onto her chin. Then her body slumped. She seemed awake but confused after this seizure-like episode.\n\nShould I call an ambulance? the husband asked. No, his wife responded. Her mother had a complicated medical history, including a kidney transplant 12 years before and an autoimmune disease. An ambulance would want to take her to the nearby Hartford Hospital. But her doctors were at Yale New Haven Hospital -- some 30 miles from their home in Cromwell, Conn. They helped the woman into the car. It was only a half-hour drive to the hospital that March 10 evening, but it seemed to last forever. Would her mother make it? Her eyes were closed, and she looked very pale.\n\nHer other daughter worked at the hospital and was waiting with a wheelchair when they arrived. The daughters made sure that the doctors and nurses knew that their mother took two medications to keep her immune system from killing her transplanted kidney. Because of those immune-suppressing drugs, she'd had many infections over the years. Six months earlier, she nearly lost her kidney to a particularly aggressive bacterium. She'd been well since then, until a few days earlier when she came down with a cold. It was just a sore throat and a runny nose, but the couple were worried enough to move her into their home to keep an eye on her. She didn't want to eat because of the pain in her throat, but otherwise she seemed to be doing well.\n\nA Possible Urinary-Tract Infection\n\nThe exam in the emergency room was mostly unremarkable, though she was a little confused at times. Her kidneys were no worse than usual. Her chest X-ray was fine; there was no sign of pneumonia. The CT scan of her head was normal and provided no explanation for her seizure. Studies of her urine showed what might be an infection. And the woman's white-blood-cell count, which would usually be sky-high if she had an infection, was instead dangerously low. There was no obvious cause of the low white-blood-cell count or the earlier seizure and current confusion. She was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous antibiotics for a presumed urinary-tract infection.\n\nThe admitting team searched for the cause of the seizure. An M.R.I. of the brain showed nothing beyond normal age-related changes. A spinal tap showed no evidence of either a viral or a bacterial invader. After two days, the patient spiked a fever despite the antibiotics, and the team reached out to the infectious-disease doctors.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The stock market rallied after promising news about an antiviral drug. Experts say rushing a vaccine is risky despite Trump's desires. The Los Angeles mayor says all residents can now get tested. See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York A Cough Surfaces\n\nIt was early afternoon by the time Dr. Thomas Holowka, a resident in his second year of training, went to see the patient. The woman's answers were slow and uncertain. Did she have any pain when she urinated? Was she going more often than usual? For patients with bacteria in their urine, these are standard questions to determine whether those bacteria indicate a harmful infection or are peaceful residents of the microbiome. She had no pain, she told the young doctor, but she was peeing every time she coughed. And she was coughing a lot.\n\nHow long has that been going on? the resident asked. A while, the patient answered vaguely. When he examined her, the doctor noticed that she was tender over her right flank -- the site of her transplant years before. The tenderness suggested an infection in that kidney. If so, she was on the right antibiotics. But that infection didn't explain the seizure -- or the cough.\n\nBecause she was immune-compromised, the resident was worried that the patient could have an infection in her respiratory tract as well. He recommended that the team get a CT scan of her lungs and blood tests to look for infections that are more commonly seen in patients who are immune-compromised. She'd been tested for the usual respiratory viruses. Should she be tested for the new coronavirus? At that time, March 13, there had been no cases of SARS-CoV-2 at Yale New Haven Hospital. There had been a couple of dozen cases of Covid-19 in Connecticut, but all of them were linked to a dinner party held in Westport, halfway across the state. It seemed unlikely, but Holowka decided to order it. And so that afternoon the patient was transferred to the floor set aside for hospitalized patients being tested for Covid-19.\n\nProbably Not, But Maybe\n\nDr. Lydia Barakat, the infectious-disease specialist taking care of the patients on the Covid floor, thought the test might be overkill. The patient had the mildest cough and had experienced only a single fever spike since the antibiotics were started. She thought it very unlikely that the patient would test positive. But the family was worried, and Barakat understood why. This older woman was the kind of patient who would be particularly vulnerable if she got the virus.\n\nThe patient recalls clearly how unpleasant the test for the respiratory virus was. \"I didn't expect someone to go up my nose like that,\" she told me. \"I mean, wow!\" The result came back just a few hours later. She was positive for Covid-19 -- the second case, it would turn out, to be diagnosed that night in the hospital.\n\nHer course was complicated. She got very sick. She stayed in the hospital a full month. She was given antimalarials, antibiotics and finally an anti-inflammatory, immune-suppressing medication. Slowly she recovered, and finally she went home.\n\nWhat We Know Now\n\nThis patient came to the hospital early in our understanding of Covid-19. Now we know that this virus, like many viruses, causes the number of disease-fighting white blood cells to drop; it's still not clear why. We also know that neurological symptoms, like headaches or the loss of sense of taste or smell, are common in Covid-19. And that seizures and confusion, while rarer, have been reported -- in Wuhan and in Europe. Indeed, Barakat tells me that she and her colleagues have noticed that in older patients, neurological problems including confusion, falls and weakness may be some of the most frequent early symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nOur knowledge of this illness -- or any illness -- is shaped by what we learn from patients who have the disease. With Covid-19, our inadequate supply of tests means that we've limited our use of them to patients who have what we already expect to see. This woman was tested only when she developed a classic sign of the infection. Yet her positive test taught her doctors something new about this disease -- that it could cause seizures and confusion.\n\nShould we test everyone who comes into the hospital? Perhaps we would learn more quickly about the symptoms of this illness. Moreover, because this patient was in the hospital for three days before being tested, dozens of health care workers and other front-line personnel were exposed.\n\nNo medical center is testing everyone right now. In New York City, all pregnant women who come into the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital system to give birth are automatically checked for Covid. Of 210 asymptomatic women tested on admission to labor and delivery in the first two weeks of the program, 29, or nearly 14 percent, were found to have Covid-19. Early identification of these cases allowed the hospital to use their precious personal protective equipment (P.P.E.) where it was most needed. Of course, no test is 100 percent accurate, and these particular tests, experts estimate, have a false negative rate as high as 30 percent. Trusting our gut, however, or what we think we know about this new disease, has already shown us how wrong we can be.\n\nUpdate April 30, 2020: After this article went to press, Yale New Haven Hospital said all patients admitted to the hospital through the emergency room would be tested for Covid-19.",

Germany has also announced antibody testing using a representative nationwide sample.\n\nThe results could aid in deciding how quickly businesses and schools should be allowed to return to normal operations. On Monday, Israel announced that citizens could leave their homes after a 40-day lockdown, but many aspects of economic and social life remain curtailed.\n\nEven more important, officials said, the survey's findings could spur preparations for any strong resurgence of the virus, perhaps when hospitals and health clinics are also busy with seasonal influenza.\n\n\"This is the most important mission: Get ready for the next wave, especially a wave during wintertime,\" said Moshe Bar-Siman-Tov, director-general of Israel's health ministry, in an interview on Tuesday. \"Luckily, the Covid-19 caught us post-influenza season. But we can't assume that there's not going to be a next wave or that it will be during summertime.\"\n\nOfficials say they hope the survey will identify the portion of the healthy population that has not yet been exposed to the virus, and the portion that has already been exposed but has developed antibodies to it. The answers could have enormous implications for a country's capacity to withstand a new wave of the virus.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak The coronavirus reached France in December, doctors say, rewriting the epidemic's timeline.

He said estimates of the percentage of Israelis with antibodies range widely, from less than 1 percent to upward of 10 percent.\n\n\"We want to know the truth,\" he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has cautioned that no evidence exists that people who have recovered from Covid-19 or have antibodies to it are protected from another infection.\n\nBut Dr. Yair Schindel, a member of a health ministry task force on the virus who pushed for a large survey, said the Israeli study could produce such evidence. \"Part of what we're trying to achieve here is to answer the questions the W.H.O. is raising,\" he said.\n\nDr. Schindel sketched out two scenarios for Israel.\n\nIn the rosier one, the survey would show that 10 percent of Israelis have antibodies to Covid-19. If so, and if a future wave of the virus resulted in the same proportions of Israelis becoming critically ill or dying as have occurred so far, that would mean about 2,300 people would need intensive care, Dr. Schindel said. That would be well within the capacity of the country's health system.\n\nBut in a bleaker scenario, the survey would reveal that only 1 percent of Israelis have antibodies, in which case the number of people needing intensive-care beds in a future wave could exceed 12,000 -- well beyond Israel's capacity, he said.\n\n\"It's quite an exercise in epidemiology -- so critical that it's really important to do,\" said Dr. Schindel, a co-founder of aMoon, an Israeli venture fund that invests in life-sciences start-ups.\n\nIsrael spent nearly $40 million to obtain 2.4 million antibody tests from two suppliers that have received Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration: Abbott Laboratories in the United States, and DiaSorin in Italy.\n\nOne potential pitfall: If the coronavirus mutates, the blood tests might not be able to identify it, Dr. Schindel said. Another is that not all antibody tests approved by the F.D.A. have proved reliable.\n\nThe blood tests check plasma for specific iterations of Immunoglobulin-M, or IgM, and Immunoglobulin-G, or IgG, that are created by the immune system in response to Covid-19. While IgM is created quickly as part of the body's response to infection and dissipates soon, IgG lingers in the body and \"represents our memory of our immunity,\" Dr. Schindel said.\n\nPatients visiting their clinics for blood tests for ordinary reasons will be asked to allow their samples to also be tested for coronavirus.\n\nThey will also be asked to complete questionnaires about whether and when they experienced symptoms, whether they were isolated at home or hospitalized, who among their friends and relatives contracted the virus, and so on.\n\nThose whose blood tests show the presence of coronavirus antibodies will be called back for a standard polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., test for the virus, to determine the correlation between viral load and antibody levels, Mr. Bar-Siman-Tov said.\n\n\"There are so many things that we can learn and research, if we plan it correctly,\" he said.\n\nAsking so many citizens to submit to something as invasive as a blood test could seem a tall order in a country where a digital-surveillance initiative to identify coronavirus patients using smartphone location data set off political protests and lawsuits. Many Israelis, citing privacy concerns, also declined to download a government-sponsored app that was designed to help them avoid fellow citizens who had tested positive.\n\nBut Mr. Bar-Siman-Tov said he did not expect the survey to be a tough sell because participants will be told the results. \"I think the people would like to know,\" he said. \"I mean, I think about myself, and I would like to know.\" He added, \"I think that we'll have more demand than supply.\"\n\nMoreover, whether out of a tendency toward hypochondria or because their socialized health-care system makes it cheap and easy, as many as 70 to 80 percent of Israelis already have blood drawn in any given year, Mr. Bar-Siman-Tov said.\n\n\"Israelis are addicted to health services,\" he said, laughing.\n\nIn addition to the broad nationwide sample, Mr. Bar-Siman-Tov said the ministry planned to test greater concentrations of subjects in cities that have experienced major outbreaks, like Bnei Brak and Jerusalem. Health-care workers will also be tested as a group. The remaining antibody tests will be made available to researchers for further studies, he said.\n\nIf the nationwide survey shows a large portion of the population has gained immunity, that could prompt the government to ease remaining restrictions faster, Mr. Bar-Siman-Tov said. But he said there was no going back to a stricter lockdown based on the serological tests alone.\n\nThough Israelis have complained about chaos and inconsistency in the way the rules have been developed and enforced, the country has fared relatively well, with only 237 dead and 16,268 cases as of Tuesday afternoon. Fatalities per million of population are 27 in Israel, compared to 213 in the United States.\n\nMr. Bar-Siman-Tov said Israel's experience had shown that \"to be pre-emptive, that was the key.\"\n\n\"The time to take action, or to take the measures that you want to take during pandemics, is when you think it's too early,\" he said, recalling decisions beginning with the cancellation of airline flights from China in early February.\n\n\"Everybody thought we were being too aggressive about it, or just exaggerating the threat, that nothing is going to happen, we're just ruining Israeli foreign affairs, or being hysterical, or ruining the economy,\" he said. \"It usually took a day for us to feel that we did the right thing, and about two to three days for others.\"",

        "body": "The Chinese city's goal is unrivaled in scale. But a top expert has questioned the need for it, given the low number of infections.\n\nWuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus pandemic began, has announced an ambitious plan to test all of its 11 million residents for the virus in the coming days, a campaign that will be closely watched by governments elsewhere.\n\nThe testing drive, which is likely to require the mobilization of thousands of medical and other workers, shows the ruling Communist Party's resolve to prevent a second wave of infections as it tries to restart China's economy. The plan was announced this week after Wuhan reported six coronavirus cases, breaking a streak of more than a month without any new confirmed infections.\n\nThe city's goal of testing every resident is unrivaled in scale, and in the speed at which Wuhan apparently plans to carry it out.\n\nSome countries, like South Korea and Germany, have aggressively tested and traced infections, albeit at much lower levels than Wuhan is attempting. In the United States, the rate of testing is still far short of the three to five million tests per week that experts say will be necessary to safely reopen the country.\n\nSuch comprehensive testing poses challenges. It is unclear how Wuhan will procure enough testing kits and process all the samples, and whether such a broad, systematic approach is the best use of resources when the city's infections are low.\n\nHere's what we know about the plan so far.\n\nA '10-day battle'? It depends.\n\nEarly reports had suggested that Wuhan was planning to test all 11 million residents in less than two weeks, citing a government notice that called it a \"10-day battle.\"\n\nBut even state media reports acknowledged the difficulty of that task. The official Health Daily newspaper said in a report on Thursday that Wuhan's authorities would have to conduct at least 730,000 tests a day to finish within 10 days, even after excluding people who had already been recently tested.\n\nThat is several times the current testing capacity in Wuhan, which the paper said could conduct 100,000 tests a day under extreme circumstances. By comparison, South Korea was testing 20,000 people a day at 633 sites nationwide in March, just after its outbreak had peaked. At that rate, it would take about a year and a half to test 11 million people.\n\nAn employee who answered the phone at a hotline set up by Wuhan's mayor said the tests would be carried out in a staggered manner. Some neighborhoods would start earlier than others, but each would plan to finish testing its residents within 10 days, this person said.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak The world is grappling with the unintended consequences of fighting the virus. Millions of children could die of preventable diseases as health services are overtaxed. Manila's top police officer faces charges over a birthday party amid a lockdown. See more updates Updated 7m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nWuhan, by far the hardest-hit Chinese city, has reported more than 50,000 infections and 3,800 deaths since the outbreak started. One major goal of testing would be to identify infected people with no symptoms, who can still spread the virus.\n\nAccording to government notices distributed on social media, at least seven neighborhoods in Wuhan said testing would start on Wednesday.\n\n\"A nucleic acid test is your responsibility to yourself, your family and society,\" read a post from the Changqing Garden No. 2 Neighborhood District Committee. \"Please support and cooperate.\"\n\nLines form as officials say, 'Leave no one behind.'\n\nOrganizers of the drive have distributed fliers and made announcements on loudspeakers and social media urging residents to register for testing slots in their neighborhoods.\n\nIn areas where the drive has started, officials have erected rows of tents and set up folding tables and stools. Social media posts on Wednesday showed dozens of residents lining up to have nasal or throat swabs taken by medical workers wearing safety goggles and protective suits.\n\nDistrict notices shared on social media urged residents to keep a distance from one another and to spread the word about the testing, in order to \"leave no one behind.\"\n\nThe government said it would prioritize residential compounds with older residents, densely populated communities and neighborhoods with rural migrants. People who have been tested within the past week do not need to be tested again. Children under the age of 6 are exempted, some notices said.\n\nSome confusion remains. One hospital, Wuhan First, received so many calls from people asking if one member of each family could be tested, rather than the entire family, that state media published an interview with hospital officials explaining why some family members could be sick while others were healthy.\n\nAn official in one neighborhood told the magazine Caixin that he did not know whether to send all residents in his district to the hospital or invite doctors to come to the neighborhood.\n\nCompanies are rushing to meet the sudden demand.\n\nLate last month, Huang Libin, a government spokesman, said China could now produce five million testing kits every day. Still, companies are scrambling to meet the sudden surge in demand from Wuhan, reports say.\n\nZhang Zheren, an official at a testing lab called Adicon Clinical Laboratories, told Caixin that her company planned to ship equipment from the eastern city of Hangzhou to Wuhan. She expected to increase her company's testing capacity tenfold, she said.\n\nWuhan's deputy mayor, Li Qiang, said last month that there were 53 facilities in the city that together could handle a daily average of 46,000 coronavirus tests.\n\nThe employee at the mayor's hotline said residents would typically be able to receive the results of their tests within 48 hours.\n\nTesting is now widely available in China.\n\nIn the early weeks of the outbreak in Wuhan, many residents struggled to get tested because of a shortage of kits.\n\nNow, testing is widely available around the country. Many companies are arranging for their staff to get tested before they resume work. Hundreds of hospitals and clinics are able to test people, and labs can process the results more quickly.\n\nEven before Wuhan launched its mass testing drive, the government covered nearly the full cost of a test under its basic medical insurance scheme.\n\nThis time, Wuhan residents need not pay at all, according to local government notices and Chinese media reports. The Health Daily article said testing was free and that the cost of the drive -- which it estimated would exceed 1 billion yuan, or around $140 million -- would likely be borne by the city.\n\nBut at least one expert thinks this is overkill.\n\nWhile some residents have been supportive, others are concerned or angry about being asked to join long lines outdoors and risk becoming infected. Even though the lockdown in Wuhan has lifted, many residents have still chosen to stay home as much as possible.\n\nOne senior expert said it was unnecessary to test every resident in Wuhan, given the low number of cases in the city.\n\nWhen asked about Wuhan's new infections, Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist of China's Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview with state television on Tuesday that large-scale testing should focus on \"key areas and key groups.\"\n\n\"In communities without infections, there is no need to screen everyone,\" Dr. Wu said.\n\nAmber Wang and Liu Yi contributed research.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nBy the time New York City confirmed its first case of the coronavirus on March 1, thousands of infections were already silently spreading through the city, a hidden explosion of a disease that many still viewed as a remote threat as the city awaited the first signs of spring.\n\nHidden outbreaks were also spreading almost completely undetected in Boston, San Francisco, Chicago and Seattle, long before testing showed that each city had a major problem, according to a model of the spread of the disease by researchers at Northeastern University who shared their results with The New York Times.\n\nEven in early February -- while the world focused on China -- the virus was not only likely to be spreading in multiple American cities, but also seeding blooms of infection elsewhere in the United States, the researchers found.\n\nIn five major U.S. cities, as of March 1\n\nthere were only 23 confirmed cases of coronavirus.\n\nBut according to the Northeastern model, there could have actually been\n\nabout 28,000 infections in those cities by then.\n\nBoston\n\n2,300\n\nSeattle\n\n2,300\n\nChicago\n\n3,300\n\nSan Francisco\n\n9,300\n\nNew York\n\n10,700\n\nIn five major U.S. cities, as of March 1 there were only 23 confirmed cases of coronavirus.\n\nBut according to the Northeastern model, there could have actually been about 28,000 infections in those cities by then.\n\nBoston\n\n2,300\n\nSeattle\n\n2,300\n\nChicago\n\n3,300\n\nSan Francisco\n\n9,300\n\nNew York\n\n10,700\n\nNote: Numbers are median estimates that the Northeastern model calculated for each city. The true number of infections could have been substantially higher or lower than shown here.\n\nBy Derek Watkins\n\nAs political leaders grappled in February with the question of whether the outbreak would become serious enough to order measures like school closures and remote work, little or no systematic testing for the virus was taking place.\n\n\"Meanwhile, in the background, you have this silent chain of transmission of thousands of people,\" said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston, who led the research team.\n\nModeling the spread of a disease is inherently inexact, involving estimates of how often people come in contact and transmit the virus as they travel, work and socialize. The model estimates all infections, including those in people who may experience mild or no symptoms and those that are never detected in testing.\n\nOther disease researchers said the findings of Dr. Vespignani's team were broadly in line with their own analyses. The research offers the first clear accounting of how far behind the United States was in detecting the virus. And the findings provide a warning of what can recur, the researchers say, if social distancing restrictions are lifted too quickly.\n\nDr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said last week that American health officials had been successful in tracking the first known cases and their contacts in the United States before the outbreak got out of control.\n\n\"Through Feb. 27, this country only had 14 cases,\" he said during a briefing. \"We did that isolation and that contact tracing, and it was very successful. But then, when the virus more exploded, it got beyond the public health capacity.\"\n\nBut the new estimates of coronavirus infections are vastly higher than those official counts.\n\nBy late February, as the world's attention shifted to a dire outbreak in Italy, those 14 known American cases were a tiny fraction of the thousands of undetected infections that the researchers estimated were spreading from person to person across this country.\n\nAnd more cases may have been arriving in the United States by the day.\n\n\"Knowing the number of flights coming into New York from Italy, it was like watching a horrible train wreck in slow motion,\" said Adriana Heguy, director of the Genome Technology Center at New York University's Grossman School of Medicine.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A $484 billion coronavirus aid package is headed to President Trump's desk after the House cleared it, 388-5, on a bipartisan vote. As states face a downturn worse than the Great Recession, McConnell suggests they consider bankruptcy. Wednesday was California's \"deadliest day,\" with 115 deaths, though Pence predicts an end by Memorial Day. See more updates Updated 8m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nDr. Heguy's team and another at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai have found through genetic analysis that the seeds of most infections in New York came from multiple locations in Europe, rather than directly from China.\n\n\"We weren't testing, and if you're not testing you don't know,\" Dr. Heguy said. The new estimates suggesting that thousands of infections were spreading silently in the first months of the year \"don't seem surprising at all,\" she said.\n\nThere are other signs that the outbreak was worse at an earlier point than previously known. This week, health officials in Santa Clara County, Calif., announced a newly discovered coronavirus-linked death on Feb. 6, weeks earlier than what had been previously thought to be the first death caused by the virus in the United States.\n\nSome scientists cautioned that the new report's estimates of an enormous, unseen wave of infections could be too high -- even though testing surveillance lagged at the time.\n\n\"Even with these corrections, it's still on the high side -- this is higher than I would have expected,\" said Dr. Donald Burke, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health.\n\nOthers said that the findings were in line with the fragmentary evidence that had been available until now. Lauren Ancel Meyers, a professor of biology and statistics at the University of Texas at Austin, said that her own risk estimates and most recent projections reveal a grim stealthiness of early coronavirus spread.\n\n\"By the time you see a few cases, it's pretty certain that you already have an outbreak underway,\" Dr. Meyers said.\n\nDr. Vespignani's approach models the outbreak over time based on what is known about the virus and where it has been detected. It estimates the spread of the disease by simulating the movements of individual people based on where people fly, how they move around, when they go to school and other data. By running the model under various conditions -- when schools are closed, say -- his team estimates where the virus may have spread undetected.\n\nUnseen carriers of the disease, many of them with mild symptoms or none at all, can still spread the virus. For that reason, by the time leaders in many cities and states took action, it was already too late to slow the initial spread.\n\nA few cities with early outbreaks, notably Seattle, are believed to have avoided enormous growth later by heeding the models available at the time and taking action well ahead of the rest of the country.\n\n\"We knew the numbers we saw were just the tip of the iceberg, and that there were much greater numbers below the surface,\" Jenny A. Durkan, the mayor of Seattle, said in an interview. \"We had to act.\"\n\nCity and state officials in New York acted more slowly, waiting until known cases were at a higher level to shut down schools and issue a stay-at-home order. Mayor Bill de Blasio was reluctant to embrace shutdowns until mid-March, citing the impact they would have on vulnerable New Yorkers.\n\n\"Even while we learn new things about this virus almost daily, one thing remains consistent: New Yorkers were put at risk by the federal government's total failure to provide us with adequate testing capability,\" said the mayor's press secretary, Freddi Goldstein.\n\nIn mid-February, a month before New York City schools were closed, New York City and San Francisco already had more than 600 people with unidentified infections, and Seattle, Chicago and Boston already had more than 100 people, the findings estimate. By March 1, as New York confirmed its first case, the numbers there may already have surpassed 10,000.\n\nFrom these primary travel hubs and a few other cities, the model shows, the disease was then spread to other locations in the United States.\n\nDr. Vespignani said he and his research team warned officials of the silent spread, posting some of their early projections in mid-February. \"We were talking to officials here, and it was the same reaction we got in Italy, in the U.K., in Spain,\" Dr. Vespignani said. \"They told me, 'OK, that's happening on your computer, not in reality.' Look,\" he added, \"No one's going to shut down a country based on a model.\"\n\nThe virus moved under the radar swiftly in February and March, doctors and researchers said, because few cities or states had adequate surveillance systems in place. And testing, if it was being done at all, was haphazard. Emergency rooms were busy preparing for the predicted onslaught and likely missed some early virus-related deaths, and did not have the time or tools to verify infections on the fly, experts said.\n\nIt was mid-March before teams at N.Y.U. and Mount Sinai began taking samples for testing in New York.\n\nThe new findings from the model produce a range of possible outcomes for when the virus may have infected 10 people in each city. In New York, for example, the model shows that the first 10 infected people could have been walking the streets of the city as early as the last week in January, or as late as the middle of February. From there, the infections in the centers of the outbreak grew exponentially.\n\nTrevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington in Seattle, said it became clear in late February that \"community transmission\" -- an infectious outbreak -- was probably silently underway in Washington after a single test result came back positive for someone who had no symptoms.\n\nWhatever the precise scale of the initial outbreak, that same dynamic will accelerate once measures to mitigate the spread are relaxed without other public health measures in place, Dr. Burke said. \"When you take away social distancing, everything will go right through the roof,\" he said.",

        "body": "MEXICO CITY -- The Mexican government is not reporting hundreds, possibly thousands, of deaths from the coronavirus in Mexico City, dismissing anxious officials who have tallied more than three times as many fatalities in the capital than the government publicly acknowledges, according to officials and confidential data reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nThe tensions have come to a head in recent weeks, with Mexico City alerting the government to the deaths repeatedly, hoping it will come clean to the public about the true toll of the virus on the nation's biggest city and, by extension, the country at large.\n\nBut that has not happened. Doctors in overwhelmed hospitals in Mexico City say the reality of the epidemic is being hidden from the country. In some hospitals, patients lie on the floor, splayed on mattresses. Elderly people are propped up on metal chairs because there are not enough beds, while patients are turned away to search for space in less-prepared hospitals. Many die while searching, several doctors said.\n\n\"It's like we doctors are living in two different worlds, \" said Dr. Giovanna Avila, who works at Hospital de Especialidades Belisario Dom\u00ednguez. \"One is inside of the hospital with patients dying all the time. And the other is when we walk out onto the streets and see people walking around, clueless of what is going on and how bad the situation really is.\"\n\nMexico City officials have tabulated more than 2,500 deaths from the virus and serious respiratory illnesses that doctors suspect are related to Covid-19, the data reviewed by The Times shows. Yet the federal government is reporting about 700 in the area, which includes Mexico City and the municipalities on its outskirts.\n\nNationwide, the federal government has reported about 3,000 confirmed deaths from the virus, plus nearly 250 suspected of being related, in a country of more than 120 million people. But experts say Mexico has only a minimal sense of the real scale of the epidemic because it is testing so few people.\n\nOnly 0.4 of every 1,000 people in Mexico are tested for the virus -- by far the lowest of the dozens of nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which average about 23 tests for every 1,000 people.\n\nThe government says Mexico has been faring better than many of the world's largest countries, and on Monday its Covid-19 czar estimated that the final death toll would be around 6,000 people.\n\n\"We have flattened the curve,\" Hugo Lopez-Gatell, the health ministry official who has become the face of the country's response, said this week.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak E.U. faces new criticism over China's censorship of opinion piece. Kenyans held for weeks in quarantine were told to pay for their release. Sixteen workers crushed by a train in India are the latest deaths resulting from a rush to reopen. See more updates Updated 18m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nBut the government did not respond to questions about the deaths in Mexico City. It also denied repeated requests by The Times over the course of three weeks to identify all deaths related to respiratory illnesses since January, saying the data was incomplete.\n\nOne former health secretary, Jos\u00e9 Narro Robles, has accused Mr. Lopez-Gatell of lying to the people of Mexico. And some state governments are beginning to draw similar conclusions: that, much like Mexico City found, the data presented by the government does not reflect reality.\n\nOfficial counts in many countries have understated the number of deaths during the pandemic, especially where limited testing has prevented the virus from being diagnosed, a Times review of mortality data has found. In Ecuador, six times more people have died than official figures reflect, the data show. In Italy, the overall increase in deaths in March was nearly twice official counts.\n\nIn Mexico City, the doubts started a month ago, when the city's mayor, Claudia Sheinbaum, began to suspect that federal data and modeling on the epidemic were flawed, according to three people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nShe had already instructed her staff to call every public hospital in the Mexico City area to ask about all confirmed and suspected Covid-19 deaths, the people said. In the last week, that effort found that the deaths were more than three times what the federal government reported.\n\nThe disagreements have taken place largely behind the scenes, as Ms. Sheinbaum, who declined to comment for this article, has been loath to publicly embarrass President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, her close political ally. The city and the federal government continue to work together on a number of fronts, including getting ventilators.\n\nBut the data from Mexico City calls into question the federal government's grasp of the crisis in the country.\n\nWith such limited testing and doubts about the government's models, experts say federal estimates for when the nation will reach its peak, how long the epidemic will last and how bad the damage will be may not be reliable.\n\nThat disconnect has left cities and states across the country scrambling to meet the demand for protective equipment and ventilators. It also underplays the severity of the epidemic for millions of Mexicans, making it hard for them to determine how bad the situation is -- and how seriously to take it.\n\n\"That is shocking,\" said Fernando Alarid-Escudero, who has a Ph.D. in health decision sciences and who developed an independent model in collaboration with scientists at Stanford University to chart the curve of the epidemic in Mexico. \"If that is case, and we are not really capturing all those people who eventually die, we are not getting a sense of the picture.\"\n\n\"We are way underestimating the magnitude of the epidemic,\" he added.\n\nIn Tijuana, hospitals are already overwhelmed. Doctors and nurses across the country have held public protests against the lack of protective gear, and several hospitals along the border have suffered outbreaks of the virus among medical personnel. Federal officials have been scrambling to buy respirators, long after seeing the outbreaks grip China, Europe and the United States.\n\nOne big reason for the competing death tolls in Mexico has to do with way the federal government is testing, vetting and reporting the data. The official results include a two-week lag, people familiar with the process say, which means timely information is not available publicly.\n\nMore worrisome, they say, are the many deaths absent from the data altogether, as suggested by the figures from Mexico City, where the virus has struck hardest of all. Some people die from acute respiratory illness and are cremated without ever getting tested, officials say. Others are dying at home without being admitted to a hospital -- and are not even counted under Mexico City's statistics.\n\nBeyond that, Mexico appears to be vastly underreporting suspected deaths from coronavirus. Data published by the federal government on May 7 show only 245 suspicious deaths nationwide.\n\nThe gap in information has left many Mexicans with a sense that their country has avoided the harrowing outbreaks afflicting nations like the United States, where nearly 1.2 million people have been infected and more than 70,000 people have died, according to the Centers for Disease Control.\n\nPublicly, Mr. Lopez-Gatell, the health ministry official, has become something of a celebrity, steering nightly news conferences in which he assures the public that things are moving according to plan.\n\nBut there have been problems with the government's assumptions from the very beginning, according to three people familiar with its preparations. As early as February, they said, the government was using Wuhan, China -- the city where the pandemic originated -- to model the potential needs and response in Mexico.\n\nBut those calculations quickly went awry, the people said, as officials realized the dynamic in China was entirely different from the one in Mexico. As the outbreak spread in Wuhan, Chinese officials locked down the city and the surrounding province, prohibiting tens of millions of people from traveling.\n\nIn Mexico, by contrast, the lockdown measures have been optional, with officials simply urging people to go to hospitals or stay at home, depending on symptoms. There are no travel restrictions in or out of Mexico City.\n\nIn the last month, the government has added experts to review the data and analysis, after urging from the country's foreign minister, Marcelo Ebrard, and other officials. But even those newer models make assumptions that experts feel are inadequate.\n\nThe main model the country is believed to now be using assumes only 5 percent of the infected population show symptoms, and that only 5 percent of those patients will go to the hospital, according to modeling documents obtained by The Times.\n\n\"Their model is wrong,\" said Laurie Ann Ximenez-Fyvie, a Harvard-trained Ph.D. at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, adding that symptomatic and severe cases could be significantly higher. \"There is very good consensus on that.\"\n\nSeveral experts also questioned Mexico's assumptions of how quickly the epidemic will pass. Its model shows a sharp rise in infections, followed by a sharp decline. But in almost no other country in the world has there been a rapid decline after a peak.\n\n\"There is a long tail for the curve, and the number of deaths does not drop to zero anytime in the near future,\" said Nilanjan Chatterjee, a professor in the department of biostatistics at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. \"The graph they are using is inconsistent with the shapes of the curve in other countries.\"\n\nPaulina Villegas contributed reporting.",

        "body": "A sharp drop in coronavirus patients was \"like someone turned off the hose,\" one doctor said. But the city's health system faces challenges ahead.\n\nAcross New York City, hospitals have moved into a new phase in their battle against the coronavirus.\n\nIn the city that was hit hardest by the pandemic in the United States, the number of new patients and the daily death toll have dropped sharply. Many of the refrigerated trucks filled with bodies are gone. Doctors no longer routinely plead for help in makeshift protective gear. The emergency room at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, once overwhelmed, treats barely a third of the people it did before the outbreak.\n\n\"It's like someone turned off the hose,\" said Dr. Eric Wei, an emergency medicine physician and senior vice president of quality for NYC Health & Hospitals, the public health care system, referring to patient numbers in recent weeks.\n\n\"There's a huge psychological desire to be like, 'Whew, we're through the worst of it,'\" he said, but cautioned, \"It's a challenge to fight that human nature to over-relax or say now we can just go back to how things used to be.\"\n\nHospital executives and doctors, wary about what comes next as the city looks to ease out of its near lockdown, are asking whether this is a lull before a new wave of cases or a less chaotic slog. At hospitals, staff members are preparing for both possibilities.\n\nHealth workers are still tending to nearly 500 critically ill Covid-19 patients around the city, but are admitting fewer than 100 new patients a day, down from the peak of nearly 1,700 daily in late March and early April, according to the city's health department. Doctors are culling data to identify best practices in treating them, and institutions are seeking long-term care -- or planning to create it -- for those expected to remain on ventilators.\n\nAt the same time, they are turning hot zones into cold zones, in hospital parlance -- shutting some temporary Covid-19 intensive care units to restore them for regular use. Mount Sinai in Manhattan closed a temporary ward in its soaring atrium, while at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, empty beds have been moved into hallways.\n\nAnd institutions are revamping facilities and taking additional measures to control the spread of the disease. Elmhurst is decontaminating rooms as managers try to persuade community residents to come in for emergencies now and elective surgery as soon Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo lifts a ban imposed in March.\n\nPhysicians there are increasingly worried that stroke victims, heart patients and those with other ailments may be dying at home rather than seeking help. \"Patients who are sick need to come back to the emergency department,\" said Dr. Stuart G. Kessler, its director.\n\n\"It's almost this eerie silence,\" said Dr. Sylvie de Souza, chair of the emergency department at the Brooklyn Hospital Center, an independent institution where the daily E.R. volume last week was less than half of the 200 to 250 patients it typically saw before the pandemic. \"None of us are at peace. We're sort of bracing for it to come back. All of us are wondering, can we go through this again?\"\n\nThe need to shift back to providing a broad range of care is urgent, both for public health and the future of hospitals and health systems, which have in some cases lost millions of dollars a day because of canceled surgeries and other lucrative services.\n\nA recent analysis by the New York City health department found that from mid-March to early May, over 24,000 more deaths than normal occurred, with nearly a quarter involving people not believed to be infected by the virus. Many may have been caused by \"delays in seeking or obtaining lifesaving care,\" the study's authors wrote.\n\nDr. Richard Schwarz, the medical director of Long Island Jewish, part of Northwell Health, the state's largest hospital system, said it had to postpone about 12,000 surgeries since the governor's order.\n\n\"Many of these people are quite sick and have gotten sicker,\" he said, including those whose cancer may be metastasizing. Patients with chronic illnesses like diabetes are also a concern. Last week, he said, surgeons at his hospital performed amputations on two patients who might have kept their limbs if they had come for treatment sooner.\n\n\"One of the things we've got to do a better job of advertising is that we right now have a Covid-free building,\" he said. \"Our main building is Covid-free.\"\n\nHere and across the country, health systems are working to restore staff, supplies and services while trying to protect patients and workers from contagion. But recent visits by The New York Times to a half-dozen of the worst-hit institutions showed that New York City hospitals faced additional challenges. Many workers were too fearful of another surge to feel much relief at the slowdown.\n\nMore than 20,000 people have died from Covid-19 in New York City, according to the health department, which counts confirmed and probable cases. The daily coronavirus death toll in the city peaked at nearly 600 in early April; now it is fewer than 100.\n\nDr. Colleen Smith, an E.R. physician at Elmhurst who recorded a widely shared video showing conditions in late March, said that even as the cases dramatically declined, the new normal did not feel normal.\n\n\"It felt surreal when it was crazy, and it feels surreal a bit now,\" she said, sitting in protective gear in a nearly empty patient area. \"The difference is so stark.\"\n\nAll the Other Patients\n\nHospitals are eager to restart elective surgery, a needed service that is also a major revenue generator.\n\nAt Elmhurst one recent day, staff members told hospital leaders that they were reviewing surgeries that had been delayed since March. They said they had a list of patients who should be operated on this month. That included cancer and neurosurgery patients who, in a tiered system released by Medicare in April, fell into categories marked \"do not postpone.\"\n\nBut preparing to resume the procedures is challenging because spaces reserved for surgery patients -- post-anesthesia units, surgical I.C.U.s. and even operating rooms -- were repurposed around the city to treat those who were critically ill with the virus. On Tuesday, Elmhurst still had 35 critically ill Covid patients, more than the total I.C.U. capacity it maintained before the pandemic.\n\nEven if those areas can be freed up, medical institutions have to create a safe pathway for patients to avoid infection as they enter hospitals, move to operating rooms, undergo monitoring afterward and then recover or receive intensive care.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Some N.Y. hospitals will allow visits to resume under a pilot program. N.Y.U. plans to hold in-person classes, 'with great care,' this fall. N.J. revises how it counts nursing home deaths. See more updates Updated 8h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nWhile Mr. Cuomo recently allowed some hospitals around the state to perform elective surgeries, he has not permitted those in the city to do so. According to rules he set, they and each county as a whole must keep at least 30 percent of hospital and I.C.U. beds available to maintain stability in case of another surge.\n\n\"It's killing us,\" Gary G. Terrinoni, chief executive and president of the Brooklyn Hospital Center, said of the ban. \"We have to be able to open up safely relatively soon or I think things will be tragic.\"\n\nCapacity is also limited because some Covid patients are left needing lengthy treatment on ventilators. Only one hospital offering long-term acute care -- part of the city's health system -- accepts such patients in the state. But it cannot accommodate those who require continuous sedation.\n\nNorth Central Bronx, one of the 11 public hospitals in the city, has raced to build a new I.C.U. Workers are laboring day and night on a unit with 120 beds, which doctors hope may be used for such patients instead. Northwell, a private nonprofit system that includes 23 hospitals in the metropolitan area, is planning to open two units for long-term ventilator patients.\n\nAs hospitals clear out unneeded Covid units, they are taking extraordinary steps to clean them, to build confidence with the community and their own staffs. At Elmhurst, in one of the worst-affected neighborhoods in the city, the virus killed five employees and sickened over 470 others.\n\nUsually, once a patient room is empty, workers wipe it down, swab for biological matter and visually inspect it. Now, they also sanitize all surfaces, vacuum the vents, apply electrostatic spray and strip and wax the floors. At Elmhurst, even the dials on the walls that regulate suction are replaced.\n\nEmployees there and elsewhere are taking an additional step: hauling ultraviolet lights into rooms, stepping outside and closing the doors as the machines inactivate any remaining viruses.\n\nBut once an area is clean and safe for non-Covid patients, how to keep it that way?\n\n\"Who goes there?\" asked Dr. Maurice Policar, an infectious disease specialist at Elmhurst. \"How do we vet these people?\"\n\nWhen new patients are admitted, he said, doctors must decide whether to put them in a ward for Covid-positive patients, where they may be exposed, or an intermediate area with negative pressure, designed to keep infectious particles inside each room.\n\nFor now, everyone is presumed infected until proven otherwise. Before transferring to a non-Covid unit, patients are tested twice for the virus. They also get a chest X-ray. And masks are worn even in areas reserved for uninfected patients.\n\n\"We feel that that's a level of protection, even if we miss it and some people are there,\" Dr. Policar said.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nWhat should I do with my 401(k)?\n\nWatching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions -- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that \"free money.\"\n\nHurdles in Weeks Ahead\n\nThe E.R. staff at Lincoln Medical Center in the Bronx was still dressed in masks, goggles, face shields, gowns, bootees and hair coverings on a recent afternoon, but it was no longer in constant motion. Nearby, rows of beds stood empty.\n\nAt the peak, the hospital had about 425 patients coming in a day, a quarter of them requiring hospitalization and many critically ill, its chief of emergency medicine, Dr. Adrienne Birnbaum, told a group of engineers and hospital officials walking through the E.R.\n\nWorkers unrolled measuring tape and stepped on construction ladders as Christine Flaherty, senior vice president of facilities management for the health system, reviewed airflow and infection control measures.\n\nThe group plans to add movable, washable partitions as privacy barriers, install filters to capture airborne viruses, place computer screens in isolation rooms to communicate with patients from outside, install hooks for staff to hang their protective gear when they go on breaks, and pipe oxygen to new areas and monitor the patients receiving it.\n\nThe staff would also raise Plexiglass barriers to protect greeters, mark the floor with six-foot separations and space patients apart in waiting areas by blocking off seats.\n\nAs Ms. Flaherty walked through the I.C.U. construction site at North Central Bronx that same week, a colleague told her that the additional oxygen she had ordered was expected in 10 weeks. \"I need it in two,\" she replied.\n\nMany other items needed to restore medical services are subject to delays or are unavailable. At Lincoln, a white board in the command center had a handwritten list of nearly a dozen supplies currently or recently out of stock, including dialysis catheters, blood transfusion tubes and tourniquets.\n\nAmid global shortages, the city's public hospital system has centralized ordering of once common items, including disposable protective gear. The projected \"burn rates\" of gloves, masks and gowns -- and the need for scarce medications like some sedatives and the antiviral drug remdesivir -- remained high.\n\nLast Friday, employees discussed a list of long-delayed orders for N95 masks. Danielle DiBari, senior vice president of supply chain, interrupted the meeting to call a vendor who had failed to deliver millions of them. He told her that the handful of Chinese factories making U.S.-approved masks were prioritizing the highest-paid orders, with costs about 500 percent higher than usual.\n\n\"I don't mind if they come in slowly, but they have to come in,\" Ms. DiBari told him. \"I'm burning at a crazy rate.\"\n\nThat rate may only increase, even with fewer coronavirus patients, as services are restored and visitors are allowed again. Before the pandemic, the public hospital system treated about 16,000 people a day in its outpatient clinics, according to officials. Once it struck, only about a quarter of those patients conferred with clinicians, the great majority by phone or video.\n\nSome doctors said they hoped some telemedicine services would be permanent. \"It turns out that we can prevent a large number of visits to the emergency room simply by getting good advice,\" said Dr. Mitch Katz, the public hospital system's president and chief executive.\n\nAs clinics reopen, visits will be staggered over extended hours to lower risk. Patients will be asked to preregister and undergo temperature checks at the door. The system is working to build negative-pressure rooms for those more likely to have the virus.\n\nAt the Brooklyn Hospital Center's outpatient clinic sites -- serving primarily low-income Medicaid patients -- the staff was focusing on bringing in children who needed vaccines, pregnant women who required prenatal care and patients with chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension. But consultations were down by about 70 percent.\n\n\"You wonder, truthfully, where are all these people?\" said Judy McLaughlin, a senior vice president and chief nurse executive. \"And what's happening to them?\"\n\nAt the same time, the enormous pressure on health workers is presenting its own challenges. Hospital leaders realize they must attend to the emotional needs of employees across every line of service.\n\nAt Elmhurst, therapists are available in a Covid support room where notes of encouragement and gratitude paper the walls: \"This too shall pass.\" \"Not all superheroes wear capes.\" \"We love you.\" A nearby room recently opened as a memorial to fallen colleagues.\n\nMount Sinai this month announced an initiative to study stress in medical workers and offer them access to support groups and mental health treatment.\n\nBut there are sources of stress that hospital officials cannot control.\n\n\"Seeing the pictures of people flaunting social distancing,\" Dr. Wei said, \"does feel a little bit like an insult to what we went through as a health care system and health care workers. We risked our lives to save as many lives as possible, and people can't wear a mask -- they can't stay six feet apart.\"",

        "body": "Families everywhere can take lessons from Spain as it struggles to help children cope.\n\nOn March 14, Spain imposed one of the most stringent lockdowns in Europe, especially for kids. Although dogs were allowed regular walks and adults could still run essential errands, it wasn't until April 26 that Spanish minors were finally permitted to leave home for one hour, within allotted time slots and a half-mile radius.\n\nOn May 4, people in areas with fewer Covid-19 infections started to enjoy additional freedom, including travel within their own province. But not everyone is bolting out the front door. The confinement of millions of kids for six consecutive weeks, many in small apartments, has taken a psychological toll.\n\nA new study from Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University, under review by the journal Frontiers in Psychology, examined the psychological impact of the confinement on children in Spain and Italy. About 90 percent of 431 Spanish parents surveyed described emotional and behavioral changes in their kids, including difficulty concentrating, irritability and anxiety.\n\nThe ongoing quarantine in Valencia, Spain's third largest city, is an example of the stresses children are undergoing, with helicopters tracking movements and shining spotlights into homes, waking them at all hours of the night. On children's first day out in Valencia, police hovered above beaches and parks, booming down via loudspeakers: \"This is the police speaking to you, respect the rules!\"\n\nThe Voss family lives near the center of Valencia with their 7-year-old daughter. \"By week four she was suffering from eye ticks, stomach pains, insomnia and a nervous cough,\" the mother, who withheld her daughter's first name to protect her medical privacy, said. \"I was really hopeful going outside would help things, but the first time we left our house, she was very nervous about being stopped by police. Since then, she hasn't been very interested in going outside.\"\n\nExperts are growing increasingly concerned about the potential long term effects of this pandemic on children's health and psychological development not just in extreme cases, like Spain, but across the world, said Richard Meiser-Stedman, a trauma expert and professor of clinical psychology at the University of East Anglia in England. The longer this situation goes on, the more of a concern it is, he said, adding that while we're still living through it, there are simple and effective ways to help children cope.\n\nTrauma Is Often Subjective\n\nOn May 8, the Spanish chapter of the child-rights nonprofit Save the Children warned that social isolation measures imposed during this pandemic may cause \"permanent psychological disorders.\" The organization interviewed 6,000 people in Germany, Finland, Spain, the United States and Britain, measuring the emotional and psychological impact of Covid-19 confinement in these populations. In Spain, where the organization interviewed nearly 2,000 families, their largest sample size, about 40 percent reported higher levels of distress than normal, including many children struggling with fear and anxiety.\n\n\"Trauma is subjective,\" meaning a shared experience may feel traumatic, or lead to symptoms of post-traumatic stress in some but not others, explained Meiser-Stedman.\n\nThe American Psychological Association defines trauma as \"an emotional response to a terrible event like an accident, rape or natural disaster. Immediately after the event, shock and denial are typical. Longer term reactions include unpredictable emotions, flashbacks, strained relationships and even physical symptoms like headaches or nausea. While these feelings are normal, some people have difficulty moving on with their lives.\"\n\nIn Morocco, where the lockdown also is severe, some families are feeling the effects of the strain, said Amanda Ponzio-Mouttaki, a mother of three living in an apartment in Marrakesh. \"We're not allowed outside unless we have a permission slip. One slip per household and only for essential shopping.\" Her two teens \"have some version of trauma and fear from not being allowed out,\" which she said manifests through intense anxiety. \"They think that just stepping outside means they'll get sick and that automatically means being very sick, or death,\" Ponzio-Mouttaki said.\n\nGetting Outside Is Crucial\n\nGrim as it may seem now, there are ways to combat the potential negative psychological effects of the pandemic on kids, both in the short and long term. Spain's quarantine situation may hold two critical lessons for parents worldwide. First is that despite the need for social distance, children benefit from being outdoors each day.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Stocks climbed after encouraging data about the first coronavirus vaccine tested in people. Xi pushes back against Trump accusations and pledges $2 billion for the W.H.O. Treasury has barely tapped into its $500 billion bailout fund. Congress has questions. See more updates Updated 9m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"People who are outside regularly have a lower activity in the part of the brain that focuses on repetitive negative emotions,\" Anne-Sophie Dybdal, senior child protection adviser at the mental health and psychosocial support unit of Save the Children, said in a report from the organization. \"This is one of the reasons children can slide into negative feelings or even depression during the circumstances they are living in now.\"\n\nSeveral studies in the last two decades have shown the beneficial impacts of contact with the outdoors on children and adults. In the Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University study, Italian kids fared better than the Spanish ones, which the authors linked to the differing quarantine conditions.\n\n\"In Italy, at the time we did the study, children were allowed to take a short walk near home. In Spain, however, children could not leave their house. Being outdoors breaks the routine of being at home and can improve the well-being of children,\" Mireia Orgil\u00e9s, Ph.D., a psychology professor and co-author of the study, said in an interview.\n\nResults of the study indicated that children with access to outdoor space were better able to adapt to the current crisis than those trapped inside apartments. \"Lockdown is necessary to stop the pandemic, but to protect children's mental health, it's important they enjoy time outdoors every day,\" Dr. Orgil\u00e9s said.\n\nThis effect can be seen across the world. Maya Demnati, a mother in Berlin, said she had been enjoying daily adventures to parks and nearby lakes, during which she taught her son to ride a bike, and he kicked a soccer ball around with a friend, at a safe distance. Natalie Philpot, a teacher and mother living in the lake region of Northern Italy, said she believed that if her three boys \"didn't suffer any major trauma, it's thanks to their abundance of outdoor time.\"\n\nChildren Mirror Parents' Views and Stress Levels\n\nThe second lesson we can learn from Spain is well known to psychologists. The way that adults talk about the pandemic is how kids will internalize it: Parents' tone can model hope and calm, instead of stress and anxiety. A strong consistency between both the study in Spain and existing pediatric trauma research, Meiser-Stedman said, is that parents' views and voices play a critical role in mitigating long-term negative effects in kids.\n\nHe pointed to a report published in 2016 in the Journal of Pediatric Psychology investigating post-traumatic stress symptoms in children following car accidents. \"When parents were really freaked out and felt their child was really damaged\" by a traumatic event, that \"toxic belief made it worse,\" said Meiser-Stedman, a co-author of the report. \"We don't want parents to worry, to think, my kids are screwed up, or scarred for life. Even if things are tough, kids can get over them.\"\n\nDr. Orgil\u00e9s saw an 80 percent correlation between the stress levels of primary caregivers and their children. The study results indicated that parents who perceived themselves as more stressed by the quarantine reported that their children had more emotional problems. Dr. Orgil\u00e9s said it was crucial for parents to manage their own response.\n\n\"A lot of how kids will react and feel stems from parents' tone,\" said Jamie Howard, Ph.D., a senior clinical psychologist and the director of the Trauma and Resilience Program at the Child Mind Institute, in New York City. \"Keep kids in the loop, but don't scare them,\" Dr. Howard advised. \"Just some basic facts to give meaning to the situation.\"\n\nHow or when the pandemic will end, and how it may affect kids in the long term, is uncertain. \"Existing trauma research indicates that most kids will recover naturally, whether they personally experience the pandemic as a truly traumatic event, or not,\" said Meiser-Stedman.\n\n\"There'll be a transition period; post-traumatic stress symptoms are normal in the first month,\" following a crisis, said Dr. Howard. But both during the pandemic, and after, parents should check on kids, making sure they're sleeping and eating well, practicing self-care and socializing. If a child's basic functioning in these areas, or others, like school or relationships, shows negative change, parents should seek support.\n\nIn the meantime, speak calmly about the situation, normalize kids' fears and confusion, and go outside regularly. \"We cannot underestimate the impact that the pandemic is having on the physical and mental health of children,\" said Dybdal in the Save the Children report. \"We must act now.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn January, at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, one diner infected with the novel coronavirus but not yet feeling sick, appeared to have spread the disease to nine other people. One of the restaurant's air-conditioners apparently blew the virus particles around the dining room.\n\nThere were 73 other diners who ate that day on the same floor of the five-story restaurant, and the good news is they did not become sick. Neither did the eight employees who were working on the floor at the time.\n\nChinese researchers described the incident in a paper that is to be published in the July issue of the Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The field study has limitations. The researchers, for example, did not perform experiments to simulate the airborne transmission.\n\nThat outbreak illustrates some of the challenges that restaurants will face when they try to reopen. Ventilation systems can create complex patterns of air flow and keep viruses aloft, so simply spacing tables six feet apart -- the minimum distance that the C.D.C. advises you keep from other people -- may not be sufficient to safeguard restaurant patrons.\n\nThe social nature of dining out could increase the risk. The longer people linger in a contaminated area, the more virus particles they would likely inhale. Eating is also one activity that cannot be accomplished while wearing a mask. Virus-laden droplets can be expelled into the air through breathing and talking, not just through coughs and sneezes.\n\nAs the C.D.C. now advises, \"Avoid large and small gatherings in private places and public spaces, such a friend's house, parks, restaurants, shops, or any other place.\"\n\nOn the other hand, all of the people who became sick at the restaurant in China were either at the same table as the infected person or at one of two neighboring tables. The fact that people farther away remained healthy is a hopeful hint that the coronavirus is primarily transmitted through larger respiratory droplets, which fall out of the air more quickly than smaller droplets known as aerosols, which can float for hours.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Several states in the South are moving to reopen businesses. Cases surge in an Ohio prison, making it the top known U.S. hot spot. The outbreak is continuing to worsen in some parts of the U.S. See more updates Updated 32m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"I think it's a well-done study with the limitations of being a field study,\" said Werner E. Bischoff, the medical director of infection prevention and health system epidemiology at the Wake Forest School of Medicine in North Carolina. Dr. Bischoff was not involved with the research.\n\nOn Jan. 24, a family went to lunch at the restaurant in Guangzhou, a sprawling metropolis in southern China located 80 miles from Hong Kong.\n\nThe family had left Wuhan, 520 miles to the north and the hot spot of the initial coronavirus outbreak, one day before Chinese officials imposed a lockdown on the city and the surrounding province of Hubei to slow the spread of the disease.\n\nAt lunch, the five members of the family -- designated Family A in the paper -- appeared healthy. But later in the day, one of them, a 63-year-old woman, experienced a fever and a cough and went to the hospital where she tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nWithin two weeks, nine others who ate lunch on that floor of the Guangzhou restaurant that day also tested positive. Four were relatives of the first infected woman. They could have been infected outside of the restaurant.\n\nBut for the other five, the restaurant appears to have been the source of the virus.\n\nFamily A's table was on the west side of the 1,500-square foot dining room, between tables where two unrelated families, B and C, were also having lunch. Family B and Family A overlapped for a period of 53 minutes, and three of its members -- a couple and their daughter -- became sick. Family C sat next to Family A at the other neighboring table along the same side the room, overlapping for 73 minutes, and two of its members -- a mother and her daughter -- became ill.\n\nAn air-conditioning unit next to Family C blew air in the southward direction across all three tables; some of the air likely bounced off the wall, back in the direction of Family C.\n\nBecause the coronavirus had not yet spread widely beyond Wuhan, public health officials were able to trace the recent contacts of Families B and C and determine that the restaurant was the only likely place where they would have crossed paths with the virus.\n\nThe researchers did not state in the paper whether any of the other diners who did not contract the coronavirus were members of the three affected families or if they were all customers at 12 other tables. The 73 people were quarantined for 14 days and did not develop symptoms.\n\n\"We conclude that in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation,\" the authors wrote. \"The key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow.\"\n\nHarvey V. Fineberg, who leads the Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, described the report as \"provocative and eye-opening.\"\n\nHe said restaurants should be mindful of the direction of airflow in arranging tables. Germicidal ultraviolet lights could also be installed to destroy floating virus particles, Dr. Fineberg said. And the paper's findings could have implications beyond restaurants.\n\n\"It's illuminating for the kind of thing we need to keep learning about as we try to configure safe work spaces,\" Dr. Fineberg said. \"Not just safe restaurant and entertainment venues but where you go to work.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "body": "Nick Farenga stood amid the body bags in a refrigerated 18-wheel trailer at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center in Manhattan. \"This is him,\" a hospital worker said, pointing to a white body bag among the roughly 40 others lying on wooden platforms that resembled hastily constructed bunk beds. As a funeral director in the Bronx, Farenga has spent two months on the front lines of Covid-19, picking up dozens of bodies. Yet somehow, until that day in late April, he had escaped the pain of retrieving the body of someone he loved. Philip Foglia was Farenga's former Little League coach. He and his brother, Sal, played baseball with Foglia's sons; the families lived just blocks apart; their fathers were longtime friends.\n\nIn the trailer, Farenga squatted down next to a lower platform. With his gloved hand, he pulled the double zippers down the body bag to Foglia's waist where his hands were folded. Farenga checked his hospital ID wristband before pulling the zippers up.\n\n\"Oh, Phil,\" he said in a hushed voice when he saw his former coach's face. For much of his career, Foglia, who was 69, was a lawyer for the city, state and federal governments, investigating and prosecuting public corruption. Farenga knew Foglia had been in the hospital for more than a month, most of that time on a ventilator. Several days earlier, he was transferred out of the I.C.U. But then one infection set him back, and another, until his heart gave out.\n\nIn the trailer, Farenga, wearing a N-95 mask and medical gown, wrapped his arms around Foglia and the body bag and hoisted him onto a stretcher to bring him to the funeral home.\n\nSince mid-March, about 200 bodies -- compared with about 55 in a typical two-month period -- have come through the back doors of the Farenga Brothers Funeral Home, a brick building that was once a bakery in the Allerton neighborhood in the Bronx. Farenga, who is 34, owns the business, which includes a smaller funeral home in Yonkers, with his older brother, Sal, 40. The bodies come from nursing homes, apartments and houses and from hospitals' refrigerated trailers.\n\nNewYork-Presbyterian's vehicles were organized. Others, especially in the early weeks of the pandemic, unveiled the chaos of mass death. In early April, Sal walked into one trailer with 92 bodies -- twice the number he had seen anywhere else -- covering the floor and piled three high, some face down. There was no space to move, much less wheel in a stretcher. To find the three bodies he was looking for, Sal had to roll one body off another, again and again. And when he still couldn't locate the last one, that of an elderly woman whose family called the funeral home a week earlier, the hospital staff pulled 15 corpses out of the trailer. Sal finally found her at the bottom of a pile of three.\n\n\"There has to be some dignity in this, otherwise I might as well be a garbage man,\" Sal told me by phone one evening in late April.\n\nDeath care in New York City was complicated even before the coronavirus pandemic. Real estate is expensive, so funeral homes are often small and lack significant storage capacities. And the state's funeral laws are some of the strictest in the country, says Tanya Marsh, a professor at Wake Forest University School of Law, who specializes in funeral and cemetery law. Among other regulations is one that requires that only a licensed funeral professional is permitted to drive a body to a grave or crematory. (Gov. Andrew Cuomo has lifted that restriction during the pandemic to allow funeral directors to deputize staff to do so.)\n\nIn the entire New York City metro area, there are only five crematories -- the city of Buffalo has six -- one of the lowest numbers per capita for any city in the United States, says David Fleming, the legislative director of the New York State Association of Cemeteries. And though the death rate has slowed, New York City crematories are still running around the clock, and the city's backlog of bodies waiting to be cremated has reached as high as 3,400. Instead of being able to get a burial or cremation slot in a day or two, the Farengas and other New York City funeral directors have had to wait as long as a month for cremations; two weeks for burials.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Data is expected to show millions more unemployment claims; experts warn of a long struggle ahead.

See more updates Updated 20m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nTo store bodies until slots were available, Nick and Sal turned two rooms into makeshift morgues: the casket showroom and one of the funeral home's chapels, which usually seats 40 people. In the chapel, the staff moved out most of the chairs, set the temperature to 55 degrees and turned on the dehumidifier. They now can store 35 bodies at once in the room. Some are embalmed and lying inside a casket, the lids open to prevent mold and to keep the body cool, awaiting an open-casket funeral or viewing. Others are in closed caskets, ready for the cemetery. Bodies lie across stretchers, set on two chairs, zipped in body bags, draped with sheets and blankets, awaiting caskets. Others are in simple pine or cardboard boxes for cremation. Sal says he will store as many as he can during the pandemic, with one caveat: \"If I have to put a body on the floor, I'm closing down.\"\n\nIn mid-April, Nick and Sal received some relief from the overflow when colleagues at a funeral home near Binghamton, N.Y., where the brothers interned after mortuary school, reached out to them. Because that facility didn't have the wait times of New York City crematories, the staff offered, with families' permission, to take regular van loads of bodies to their crematory. The first batch of bodies left for the three-hour trip in mid-April. Since then, there were three more trips, for a total of 40 bodies. The Farengas now have room for new arrivals.\n\nSal is the old soul of the Farenga family, the one who wears his grandfather's Miraculous Medal around his neck, a Catholic symbol meant to bestow grace on the wearer. (Nick wears his grandfather's World War II dog tags, which he says have felt grimly relevant now.) Sal is also the family worrier: \"An 80-year-old Italian man in a 40-year-old body,\" his mother, Rosemarie, says. On a desk in the office that Sal shares with Nick, stacked papers sit next to a pack of Sal's Marlboros and an array of black neck ties. Nick's dress shoes lie on the floor, along with Sal's crumpled pants, hastily taken off after a funeral and before he had to pick up more bodies.\n\nSal and Nick are the fifth generation of Farengas to own and run the family funeral home, which at 124 years old is one of the oldest in New York City. (Their great-great-grandfather opened the family's first funeral home in Little Italy in 1896, and his wife became one of the first female undertakers in the state.) The brothers' father, Sal Sr., and Rosemarie didn't try to cajole their children into their business (their daughter owns a dog-grooming company). They pushed them to go to college and consider various careers. If you don't have a heart for this work, he told them, you don't belong here. But Sal Jr. came to believe what his father did: They are running a business, but with the mission of taking care of the dead and the families left behind with dignity. Nick, the more rebellious brother who initially resisted the idea that he might go into the field, was fired by his father when he was a teenager for not giving his all when he mopped floors and polished doorknobs at the funeral home. But even then, he was moved by how hard the staff worked to help families during their darkest moments of grief.\n\nFor years, Sal and Nick, and their father before them, prided themselves on never turning down a family because they lacked room. Then, on April 1, just 10 days after Cuomo's state stay-at-home order went into effect, a woman called Sal to say her mother had died in a nursing home where there were a number of Covid-19 cases. New York City's confirmed Covid-19 deaths had reached almost 600 a day, and soon the city's death rate would be six times the normal number. The family wanted a cremation. But the nursing home couldn't hold the body any longer. Sal knew crematories were backed up. And his funeral home was out of refrigerated space. \"I can't take her right now,\" Sal told the daughter. \"I'm not sure when we can.\" He hated the sound of his own words.\n\nThings got worse from there. The phone calls came from the Bronx, which has the highest coronavirus infection rate per capita in the city, but also from Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The phone rang so often -- as many as 100 times a day -- that the staff couldn't keep up; they had calls go to the answering service. When Sal called back, some people begged -- they had already tried 20 other funeral homes. Others sounded resigned; they no longer expected to hear yes. Please call back in a couple days if you don't have luck elsewhere, Sal would say. If a loved one died at home, and the brothers had no room, Nick sometimes suggested that the family allow the medical examiner's office to keep the body until space freed up. At one point, Nick and Sal said no to 50 families a day over two days. By late April they had turned away more than 200.\n\nThe pandemic was thwarting the decades-old promise of the American funeral industry. We've come to expect death care to be efficient, tidy and sanitized. Funeral directors come almost as soon as we call. They remove the bodies swiftly and discreetly. Instead, Nick and Sal simply couldn't meet the need, even working six and seven days a week, 15 and 16 hours a day. They were short on staff: One of their funeral directors, who had heart surgery not long ago, was taking a leave. Another tested positive for Covid-19 in late March and hasn't returned to work. Along with temporarily hiring a funeral director who had retired from the field, Sal and Nick relied on their employee Gabby Carrea, 24, who received her funeral-director license just two years ago.\n\nUsually, one funeral director tries to take care of each family from that first call to the final disposition of the body in a cemetery or crematory. But now Nick and Sal have reorganized tasks. Nick, savvier with technology and better on the phone, helps families make plans for funerals, cremations and burials, doing most of it from a distance: He sends paperwork electronically as much as possible, along with photos of caskets and urns. He explains that funerals and visitations are now limited to one hour and 10 mourners. At cemeteries, too, only 10, or sometimes fewer, people are allowed. And at one, families can't even leave their cars. Crematories also prohibit loved ones from coming inside and holding services. It pains Nick and Sal not to fulfill their client's expectations -- and their own -- about facilitating generations-old mourning rituals with the many accouterments that help define so many funerals. The pallbearers, ushers, receptions and crowds are all gone. The prayer cards, the hearses, the expensive caskets and the flowers remain. \"My drive is always to get a family what they want,\" Nick told me. \"It's not what's wrong and right in how you remember a life. For me it's 'How can I make that happen?' All these restrictions and telling people 'no' goes against every fiber of my being.\"\n\nSome funeral directors have told Sal that he is crazy to continue embalming. Though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says it's OK, with precautions, to embalm during the pandemic, the World Health Organization advises against it. It's unclear how long the virus can live in the nose and mouth of a newly dead person, and there's concern it can escape the lungs if a dead body is jostled. Sal is undeterred. During each procedure, he wears a Tyvek suit, a head covering, gloves, a face shield and an N-95 mask. He also sprays the dead body's nose, mouth and eyes with disinfectant and covers the face with alcohol-soaked paper. Next, during the 90-minute embalming process, he washes the body and moves the limbs to loosen any rigor mortis, before pumping in a mix of formaldehyde and other chemicals through an artery and draining the body of blood through a vein.\n\nLately, though, the staff has been dangerously low on personal protective equipment. One Saturday afternoon, after embalming a 51-year-old man and a woman in her 80s, Sal pointed to a spot on his mask. He had penned three small dots on it, marking the three days in a row that he wore it.\n\nAs the Bronx has changed over generations, so have the Farengas' clients -- in addition to Italians, Irish and Puerto Rican families, Nick and Sal work with families who are Albanian, Guyanese, Nigerian, Indian and Vietnamese. The brothers know all about Irish wakes and large Italian funerals but also that Albanians sometimes ship the dead home, to be buried in their ancestral ground. Many Hindus, Sikhs and Buddhists hold ceremonies at crematories where they witness the body being placed in the retort, as the cremation furnaces are known.\n\nThat's what Kam Johal's family would have typically done during a funeral. Her parents are Sikh, and they lived a few blocks from the Farenga Brothers. Years ago, in college, she worked as a secretary for Sal Sr. Then on March 27, Kam, who is 49 and the oldest of five sisters, had to call the funeral home on behalf of her family. Her father, Paramjit Singh Purewal, who was 74, died the day before.\n\nEarlier that week, when her father was suffering from a fever and painful cough, Kam's youngest sister, Narinder, who is 34 and lives in the apartment above her parents, called for an ambulance. The E.M.T.s said he was safer staying at home. But the symptoms continued and then got worse: He had difficulty breathing; his oxygen-saturation level, which Narinder measured with a pulse oximeter, was low. After talking to a doctor, Narinder called 911 again. She was told by an E.M.T. that she couldn't go with her father. So instead Paramjit walked to the curb with her before getting in the ambulance, carrying his phone, a printout of his medical information and his cane. Narinder stayed behind to care for her mother, Gurmit Kaur, who was also struggling with Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nIn the emergency room, medical workers had trouble communicating with Paramjit. Originally from Punjab, he immigrated to England at 15 before coming to the U.S. in 1980; English was his second language, and his hearing was failing. The staff called the family periodically for help, including when they were trying to get him onto his stomach, known as proning, to increase oxygen to his lungs. His wife, Gurmit, 68, meanwhile, was getting sicker. The night her husband went to the hospital, she had a fever and began throwing up. Narinder found her on the floor in the middle of the night, having fallen out of bed.\n\nThe next morning, Narinder, along with Kam, who was her parents' health care proxy, made plans to send their mother to the hospital. Then, at 10:35 a.m., 17 hours after their father left his apartment, a doctor called: Their father, he said, was dead. Within minutes, Kam and Narinder were on the phone with their three sisters. Each one fell to the floor when they heard the news.\n\nIt would be hard to conjure a more tight-knit family than the Purewals. When they first married, to save money to buy a house, four of the five daughters lived rent-free in the apartment above their parents in the house that Paramjit and Gurmit bought or in one they owned next door. Dishi, a kindergarten teacher, drove in from Long Island early each weekday morning and had breakfast with her parents before going to work. Her sister Jazz dropped off her children there before heading to her job. Nena often called them a few times a day to check in.\n\nWhile her parents were sick, Narinder and her husband took care of them around the clock, giving them Tylenol, making them soup, taking their fluctuating temperature every four hours, rubbing their feet to help them sleep. The other four daughters self-isolated in their own homes: Jazz with her husband and children in New Jersey. Dishi, Kam and Nena with their families on various parts of Long Island.\n\nWhen Kam talked to Nick, she told him that her family wanted an open-casket funeral, but she also explained that her mother was extremely sick in the hospital. They were praying she would improve and that they could hold the funeral once she was released. Sal agreed to perform a more intensive embalming procedure for her father -- going in multiple arteries with embalming fluid, rather than just one -- to preserve the body for the two to three weeks it might take before her mother would be well enough to attend. Nick also told Kam that he would make an exception and hold two one-hour viewings: one for the daughters, their mother and three of the sons-in-law, and a second, after a one-hour window to disinfect the room, for the seven older grandchildren, ages 8 to 17, and two of their fathers.\n\nThe daughters began to put together the funeral. Narinder, after finding several closed shops, discovered a nearby store owner who agreed to sell her yards of white silk fabric to make traditional kurta pajamas for her father's burial clothing, cracking the shop door open to hand it to her. And Jazz found a tailor in New Jersey who sewed the outfit in two hours, donating his fee to a local Sikh temple. In the midst of their planning, their mother, to the daughters' enormous relief, was released after a week in the hospital, some of that time on a ventilator. She moved in with Dishi to recover.\n\nNormally, more than 50 relatives would have flown in from England and elsewhere for the funeral. Neighbors would have come, along with members of their father's religious community. Instead, on April 10, the daughters arrived, one by one. For the first time since their father died two weeks earlier and since their mother came near death, the sisters were seeing one another. They couldn't kiss or hug. They couldn't fall into one another's arms. They spoke their sorrows from a distance, their words muffled behind masks.\n\nInside one of two large chapels at the Farenga Brothers there were 10 chairs, instead of the usual 70 to 80, staggered throughout the room, six feet apart, looking awkward and forlorn. Typically Sal or Nick would oversee the entire funeral, rarely leaving. Now, for the safety of the staff and the families, Kam, her sisters and her mother were left alone.\n\nAs the funeral service began, a Sikh religious leader from the parents' temple read a few prayers from one corner of the room. Gurmit, wearing a white embroidered head covering, prayed in front of her husband's body. Their daughters stood in two rows to her right.\n\nEach one approached the casket and told their father how much they loved him and admired his kindness. They revered their father for creating such a strong family and rich life out of hardship. After immigrating to New York City, he became a mechanic for the cookie company Stella D'oro. Sometimes he worked a second job at a restaurant and instead of going home, he slept on a park bench to save money on the commute. He, along with Gurmit, who cleaned houses during the day and cooked at White Castle at night, had skimped and saved enough to buy two properties and to send each of their daughters to college.\n\nGurmit went to the casket and reached out her gloved hand and touched her husband's forehead, wished him goodbye and laid her head at his waist. Each daughter took a white rose from a chair on which stood a photo of their parents when they were first married and lay the flowers across his body. Jazz lifted her N-95 mask and kissed his cheek. Kam put her face to her father's chest and placed a note inside his casket. \"I don't know how I'm going to do this life without you,\" she had written. \"It didn't matter what I was doing. It was always good to know that you were near and that I could call you and tell you what was on my heart.\"\n\nIf not for the pandemic, the family would have then held a ceremony at a crematory. As the oldest child, Kam would have walked to the retort and pushed the button to start the incineration process, reminiscent of the centuries-old tradition of funeral pyres in India. Instead, after the funeral, the sisters got in their separate cars to head to their separate homes, to mourn.\n\nAround noon four days later, Nick texted Kam that he had left the funeral home with her father's body and was on his way to Ferncliff Cemetery's crematory in Hartsdale, N.Y., less than half an hour north. Kam asked him to text her again when he arrived. She looked up an image of Ferncliff to imagine where her father's body was headed and prayed that the crematory workers would be gentle with the casket and with him. She had already texted a link to her sisters and her mom: a Sikh meditative prayer that her father loved. As Nick drove on the Bronx River Parkway with Kam's father in the back of his hearse, in an apartment in the Bronx, in a house in New Jersey and in three different homes on Long Island, the six women who most loved Paramjit Singh Purewal prayed for him.\n\nAfter 20 minutes, Kam got a text: \"He's here,\" Nick wrote.\n\nKam texted her entire family. \"It is done.\"\n\nThen, sitting alone at her kitchen table, she wept.\n\nPhilip Montgomery is a photographer whose current work chronicles the fractured state of America.

    "How Does Antibody Testing Work? We Went Behind The Scenes to Find Out": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Stanford Health Care gave us exclusive access to show how coronavirus antibody testing works. So we followed two caregivers and their blood, through the testing process.\n\nAs time goes on, more people are wondering, did I have coronavirus already. \"I can help the next patient [INAUDIBLE].\".\" Now, Stanford hospitals in northern California are giving their health care workers the answer with antibody testing for all. We were given exclusive access to follow two caregivers and their blood through the antibody testing process. \"I do have a loved one at home, my mother, who is high risk. So I want to get tested just to make sure I'm O.K., and kind of maybe surprise her and say, I get to come see you.\" First, they're swabbed to make sure they're not currently infected. \"Oh my god.\" And then they give a vial of blood for the antibody test. \"There's so many asymptomatic carriers around, and there's so many people that may have had it or had mild symptoms, and not had known. If I have the antibodies and someone needs my plasma, I'd love to help out.\" \"Honestly, I'm hoping that comes back positive, that it'll teach us a lot.\" \" -- the blood antibody test for the COVID-19 virus.\" This blood test, also known as serology, will show if they had coronavirus in the past, and their immune system raised antibodies to fight it off. But it can't predict if those antibodies will make them immune. What this and other reliable antibody tests can do is give us a better picture of how widespread coronavirus actually is. And they're helping researchers design possible treatments and vaccines. \"More widespread testing will help us to better understand more quickly what are the important variables, you know, who's going to be protected, who's not.\" These are samples from the people we just met including, Heidi and Jamshid. Here, they'll be spun to separate blood cells from plasma. Next, that plasma is taken to a different lab on campus for analysis. \"You can see the robot is precisely putting in the right amount of each sample into the wells of the plate.\" \"There's been great demand for the test. The lab is basically open 24 hours. The instruments have been running day and night.\" Dr. Scott Boyd and his team developed this test, and now they're ramping up quickly. They've just received a new shipment of robots called ELISA Instruments. Soon, the team hopes to process at least 4,000 samples a day. They use controls to validate their tests, so they know it works. The positive controls are from coronavirus patients at Stanford, and the negative are from healthy blood donors, taken before coronavirus jumped to humans. Out of 200 people, the results for a few may be inaccurate. But this kind of test is among the best we have. You can see the controls here in the left column of each assay plate. Once the plate finishes processing, you can see a yellow color in the patient samples that have antibodies. The darker the color, the more antibodies there are. \"But just measuring the total quantity doesn't tell you all the information you'd like to know. The question is, does somebody likely have immunity. The answers are not yet as clear.\" Only some antibodies actually fight or neutralize the virus. So the next step for researchers is to identify those ones. Then, how much of those neutralizing antibodies are needed to block the virus and prevent re infection? \"So we're also now working on developing a neutralizing anybody test that would allow us to test a lot of patients in the hospital, and also health care workers.\" That neutralizing antibody test, which Dr. Boyd hopes to have ready by the end of May, will give a better sense of who is actually immune. Remember Heidi from earlier? Well, we watched her sample go through the process. \"Coronavirus.\" And now her results are in. \"Not detected.\" All right, so what did the results say? \"Negative. Negative COVID and negative serology, unfortunately. But it's a good thing, right? It can still be good. Today's really my only safe day, because I go back to work tomorrow. So I feel pretty safe that I can go over, see my mom without a mask. I don't think she's got the ability to survive a disease like this, so I've had to be very careful. I haven't seen her face. She hasn't seen my face without a mask on since like, the beginning of March. I'm negative.\" \"What?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Yay!\" \"You get to take your mask off, at least for today. Come out here.\" \"Oh my goodness. I'm so happy.\" \"I missed you.\" \"I missed you. Oh, I haven't had a hug forever. Oh, I'm so happy. O.K. Bye bye, sweetheart. Bye bye.\" \"All right. Bye bye.\" \"Thank you.\" Jamshid's results are the same as Heidi's \"So I do not have the antibodies, which is great, because it means PPE works, which is fantastic. I've definitely been in multiple rooms with people with known COVID, and I've been wearing PPE. And I'm glad that I was at a place that I didn't have to reuse or recycle my PPE.\" Preliminary data is starting to show that Heidi and Jamshid's negative antibody results are representative. \"Hi, Romey.\" In places like the Bay Area that haven't been hard hit, only a small fraction of people are testing positive for antibodies. \"You know, where I go to the grocery store, I get it. I go to work again, I get it. It's out there, so I'm still going to take the same precautions. I'm going to still wear a mask.\" But these tests are a first step towards understanding immunity. Just having antibodies is not a free pass. \"Hopefully if someone's positive, it doesn't give a false sense of security. I still think that everybody needs to protect themselves just the way that we currently are.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn March, Andrew Atkeson, an economics professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, tried to assess the mortality rate from the new coronavirus based on what is known about its spread.\n\nDoes it kill 1 percent of those infected, roughly the case fatality rate on the Diamond Princess cruise ship? Or might it be closer to 0.1 percent, the mortality rate in the United States from the common flu?\n\nIf two-thirds of the population becomes infected, as would be needed to achieve what is known as \"herd immunity,\" the difference between those mortality rates would amount to two million deaths nationwide.\n\nBut the answer was elusive. \"I wanted to see if we can estimate where we are,\" Mr. Atkeson said. \"I realized no, we can't.\"\n\nHe was missing one critical number: the infection rate in the general population. Three economists -- Magne Mogstad and Alexander Torgovitsky of the University of Chicago and Andres Santos of U.C.L.A. -- have devised a technique to provide it, by figuring out how to coax even people who believe they are healthy into taking a test for the coronavirus.\n\nShort of testing everybody -- an onerous exercise, even if enough test kits were available -- figuring out the infection rate across the population requires a representative sample. The sample will include sick people clamoring to be tested but also people who have little interest in going through the ordeal.\n\nThat raises a problem. In Iceland, which performed tests on a big share of its population, researchers said the results might have been skewed because those concerned about potential infection were more likely to take part.\n\nLatest Updates: Markets and Business Mayhem in oil markets drags Wall Street lower. Here's the latest earnings reports from big companies. Netflix is expected to report a surge in subscriptions. See more updates Updated 30m ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nMr. Mogstad, Mr. Torgovitsky and Mr. Santos figured a way around this constraint: Offer prizes to encourage those who believe themselves healthy to get a test anyway.\n\nThe method is crafty. Say you split the sample into 11 equal random slices and offer people in each a reward. For simplicity, say the reward for taking the test scales up from nothing in the first group to $200. This method would yield the share of people who would take the test for nothing, the share who would do it for $20 and so forth.\n\nTo figure out who would take the test for $100 but not for $80, you would subtract the share of people who responded to the $80 reward from those who took it for $100. The infection rates for the group could be computed in a similar fashion, to reveal the pattern about how testing changes and the infection rate changes as rewards increase.\n\nThere are likely to be people who decline to take the test even at the highest reward. But the researchers can approximate their infection rate by extrapolating from the information they have. If they know how the participation rate and the odds of testing positive change as the reward rises from $160 to $180 to $200, they can deduce what the results would be at $220 and $300.\n\nThe underlying assumption is that people's behavior changes smoothly as incentives change. If that holds, the researchers could construct a decent estimate of the infection rate in all or most of the population.\n\nAs the virus becomes more and more prevalent across countries, such testing will become critical. \"What is the probability that if I go to the store I will become infected?\" asked Marc Suchard, a professor of biomathematics at U.C.L.A. \"You can't nail that down without knowing the underlying rate of infection.\"\n\nNotably, as Mr. Atkeson found out, it's hard to tell what share of infected people die from the virus if you don't know how many have had it. You could get the same number of deaths with a high mortality rate and a low infection rate or the other way around, if the virus propagated very fast but killed fewer people.\n\nDifferent findings would call for different strategies. A slow spread with a high death rate might suggest the containment policies deployed around the world are working, and would support maintaining a strict lockdown. The alternative could suggest that more people have some resistance to the virus and support relaxing quarantines across U.S. cities and states.\n\n\"Distinguishing between these two scenarios is key,\" Mr. Mogstad said.\n\nAnd yet nobody has measured this statistic. Countries testing for the virus have mostly focused on testing people suspected of being sick -- people with symptoms and those who have come into contact with them.\n\nTake the National Institutes of Health. In a two-year study about to begin, it will perform an antibody test on 10,000 volunteers from around the country. The number is large. But the N.I.H. decided to apply it on an \"opt in\" basis, to anybody who asked for it, so it will not amount to a representative sample of the population.\n\nIt will represent only those who want it most, capturing mostly Americans who fear they are sick. It will miss many asymptomatic carriers of the virus, who see no point in getting tested. The exercise will then fail to provide a faithful picture of how the new coronavirus has spread across the country.\n\nThere is other valuable testing to be done. Some health experts argue that, early in an epidemic, it is more useful to test specifically those suspected of carrying the virus, to trace their contacts and introduce more nuanced separation and quarantining policies.\n\n\"I don't care about the prevalence of the infection in the population,\" said Stefano Bertozzi, a professor of health policy and management at the University of California, Berkeley, who was the last director of the World Health Organization Global Program on AIDS. \"I care about when the infection rate will overwhelm the capacity of the health system.\"\n\nThere are more urgent questions at this stage than the overall infection rate in the population, he noted. For instance, what is the share of infected people who get sick, and how fast is the infection rate growing across thousands of cities? There is hope that epidemiological modeling based on testing of infected people can approximate this answer effectively, he said.\n\nAnd yet, Mr. Mogstad argued, tracking the infection rate in the population is essential to track the evolution of the virus, including asymptomatic cases, and how it affects people of different races and income levels. That is critical to deciding when to relax restrictions, evaluating the effectiveness of measures taken and calibrating epidemiological models.\n\nFiguring out this rate of infection is not that costly. \"It's not about how many you test -- it is about who you test,\" Mr. Mogstad said, adding that 5,000 tests could do the trick.\n\nThe economists' technique could find other applications. Norway's statistical agency is planning to use it to improve the response rates to surveys about people's reaction to the virus and their engagement in social distancing, especially among the young and old.\n\nThe University of Chicago is raising funds to roll out three sets of antibody tests using the incentive technique -- one on a nationwide sample and two on samples in Chicago, one of people living below the poverty line, and another of people living above the poverty line. The idea is to provide a proof of concept so the technique can be put into broader use. It could apply equally to antibody tests, which determine which people have been infected, and RNA tests to determine which people are currently infected.\n\nThere are other challenges to understand the spread of the coronavirus. Notably, tests are far from perfect. In particular, there are not yet good antibody tests that can faithfully pinpoint people who have been infected with a specific strain of coronavirus. Even when one is developed, tests will have to be deployed across a range of populations and over time, to understand the evolution of the virus and its distribution.\n\nAnd yet the urgency to figure out the reach of the virus is increasing as it spreads. As Mr. Suchard pointed out, individual tracing of the virus can be useful in closed communities or places where it is less common, but in some cities where the virus has become prevalent, \"we need population-based sampling\" to save lives.",

        "body": "For two weeks after the first confirmed case of coronavirus emerged in New York, 33,000 city employees were still punching in and out of work by resting their hands on a shared scanner. Sanitizer was placed nearby. It often ran out.\n\nSome city workers, concerned about infection, took to wearing masks and gloves on the job. At least one agency ordered them to stop because they might induce panic.\n\n\"Staff are NOT permitted to use masks or gloves while serving clients,\" read an email sent on March 12 to members of the city's Human Resources Administration.\n\nThat same day, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would begin a work-from-home policy for municipal employees, even though many of its agencies were not capable of implementing it.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has posed a slew of challenges that are unprecedented in modern history, forcing governments around the world to take extraordinary measures to try to curb the outbreak as the number of cases has surpassed 2.4 million.\n\nNew York City, like many other governments, adopted policies that adhered to guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization. As the virus quickly spread, city and state officials took a more aggressive posture: Large gatherings were banned, schools were closed and businesses were ordered to have their workers telecommute.\n\nBut when it came to its own huge work force of more than 300,000 full-time employees, New York City faced a different challenge: how to keep essential levels of government functioning without unduly exposing workers to the virus.\n\n\"We have less flexibility because our people have to be where they have to be when they have to be,\" Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference last month. \"Our first responders, our teachers, our health experts, you know, our nurses, our doctors have to be where we need them.\"\n\nCity Hall officials defended the way that the de Blasio administration has balanced the need to keep the city running while protecting its workers.\n\n\"All of our guidance to the staff was consistent with what the science and the situation dictated,\" Michael Lanza, a spokesman for the city health department, said.\n\nYet in some instances, the city seemed slow to adapt. Hand scanners remained in use for city employees to punch in and out of work until March 15, three days after the mayor had declared a state of emergency in New York.\n\nIn early March, the state was recommending quarantine for anyone who had been in close contact with someone who had the virus. Yet the city health department was advising its workers that if they were exposed to the virus but had no symptoms, they should \"be reporting to work as usual,\" according to a message to employees reviewed by The New York Times.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York The mayor's fireworks announcement is greeted with ... fireworks. The City Council introduces a broad virus relief package. Deaths in New York passed 15,000. See more updates Updated 4m ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nAnd because the city did not have enough protective gear for front line workers, District Council 37, the city's largest municipal union, in early April purchased 125,000 N95 masks for its members, 80 of whom have died from the virus.\n\nAt least 209 city workers have died because of the coronavirus, a death toll that includes 63 employees of the Education Department, 33 employees of city hospitals and 31 in the Police Department.\n\nThe rate of deaths per capita among the city's work force is lower than the city as a whole, but the work force is also significantly younger: About 5 percent of city workers are over 65, versus more than 14 percent of New Yorkers. (Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has been disproportionately fatal for those over 65, who make up nearly two-thirds of the deaths in the city.)\n\nMichael Mulgrew, the president of the city's teachers' union, suggested that thousands of city school workers may have been exposed to the virus or spread it over a critical two-week period through the second week in March, when schools remained open despite pressure to close them, and then for another week when teachers received in-school training for distance learning.\n\nAsked whether he blamed those decisions for the number of dead school employees, Mr. Mulgrew hesitated. \"I would like to see the science behind it, but logic would say that had something to do with it,\" he said.\n\nThousands more have been sickened. In a one-week period, from late March to early April, there were 5,804 employees on excused leave, which includes sick leave -- seven times more than during the same period last year, according to city data that surveyed a little over half of the work force.\n\nAt the Police Department, 18 percent of the officers were out sick by mid-April. At the Fire Department, 23 percent of its emergency medical responders and 16 percent of its firefighters were out sick.\n\n\"Our city is going through an unprecedented crisis and we owe an extraordinary debt to the city workers helping us,\" Mr. de Blasio said in a statement. \"These are our co-workers, our fellow public servants, people we know personally.\n\n\"Each loss hurts and we mourn as though they were part of our family,\" he continued. \"We'll never forget those who dedicated their lives to our city, and we're doing everything in our power to protect every single one of our public servants.\"\n\nThe city's challenges in responding to the virus also extended to the administration's transition to having its workers telecommute.\n\nTo keep a city the size of New York running smoothly requires that an enormous number of people do face-to-face and hands-on work, even during a pandemic-driven shutdown.\n\nHospital clerical staff had to show up to process medical records. Those who worked on public benefits had to be present to answer phones. The city also lacked the secure servers and laptops that many employees would need to access sensitive information from home.\n\nAnd the city had no telecommuting policy, making the transition difficult.\n\nDeanne B. Criswell, the commissioner of emergency management, acknowledged in March that telecommuting was \"not something that the city has done before\"; the city had to write the policy from scratch, she said.\n\n\"I can't speak to why there wasn't one put in place prior to this, but we are writing the telework policy right now,\" Ms. Criswell said then.\n\nThe city had to re-evaluate who was an essential employee: workers involved in responding to the Covid-19 emergency; people whose work protects and saves lives such as 911 operators and utility workers; and others who operate the systems and critical equipment that allow the government to be productive and generate revenue.\n\nLaura Feyer, a City Hall spokeswoman, said that New York had broad plans in place before the crisis to ensure the city could still operate in an emergency.\n\n\"In this unprecedented crisis, we have managed to quickly mobilize the city work force to adapt to the current reality,\" said Ms. Feyer, adding that the number of city employees working from home is \"nothing short of incredible.\"\n\nBy the middle of April, the city was requiring one-third of its work force -- emergency responders, hospital staff and sanitation workers, but also tens of thousands of people who handle records, cook in cafeterias and tend to parks -- to show up to work, city officials said.\n\nNearly two-thirds of city workers are people of color, a number that is even higher in many front-line and health care agencies. More than 80 percent of the employees of the city's hospital system, all of whom have been deemed essential, are nonwhite. So are a majority of police officers.\n\nHenry Garrido, the head of District Council 37, said he felt pride in the work of essential city employees, but questioned the cost to their health. He characterized the federal government's inability to provide access to protective gear for front-line workers \"unforgivable\" and added that the city's efforts were \"simply not enough.\"\n\n\"Our members are still dying from exposure, and we cannot undo the damage that has been done to our members and their families,\" he said.\n\nEven when a city agency wants to have more of its staff working from home, the logistics can be daunting. Social workers for the Administration for Children Services cannot investigate child abuse claims using video conferencing, officials pointed out. Sanitation workers have to toss bulging trash bags onto the back of garbage trucks. Workers who maintain the water supply must access the aquifers.\n\n\"One of the challenges we have is converting client services that are delivered from office settings to be delivered remotely,\" said Steven Banks, the commissioner of the Department of Social Services, who oversees the city's homeless shelters as well as its benefits offices.\n\nFunctions that have been hard to make remote include processing applications and receiving phone calls. Mr. Banks said that more than 5,000 employees of the agency were still reporting to work, and about 9,400 were working from home.\n\nAt the Buildings Department, about 40 percent of its nearly 2,000-person staff were still working in the field or in the office -- including inspectors and field engineers, with the rest working from home.\n\nAt the Parks Department, about 90 percent of nearly 8,000 full-time workers have been deemed essential, and three-quarters of the staff was still reporting to work -- maintaining the green space and also enforcing social distancing rules.\n\nOther nonuniformed agencies, like the Department of Environmental Protection and the Finance Department, for example, also have a large number of essential employees.\n\nEven though city schools have been closed since mid-March, about 11,500 employees at the Education Department show up to work each day, according to a spokeswoman, out of a usual full-time staff that approaches 150,000.\n\nThe agency has been operating centers for the children of emergency medical workers and health care workers, and has also provided more than three million takeout meals for children and adults at hundreds of sites over the last month.\n\nThe city's shifting guidance regarding its workers and face coverings, which tracked with the recommendations from federal health agencies, also may have left people at risk.\n\nOn Feb. 5, the Health Department issued guidance that face masks were not warranted for workers not involved in health care, \"even for those with frequent interaction with the general public.\"\n\nThe guidance added that \"no coronavirus-specific precautions are recommended for interactions with the general public, including asymptomatic travelers\" from parts of the world where the virus was prevalent.\n\nWhen federal guidance changed at the end of March, city officials said, so did their recommendations for staff.\n\n\"The health guidance was that masks were not required, and there was a concern about panicking other staff as well as clients,\" said Mr. Banks, who also oversees the Human Resources Administration, in explaining the March 12 email forbidding masks.\n\nLast weekend, Mr. de Blasio mandated that all city workers who come in contact with the public while on duty wear face coverings, and said that the city would provide as many face coverings as necessary.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nALBUQUERQUE -- New Mexico has fewer hospital beds per capita than nearly every other state. It has a rapidly aging population and widespread poverty. Its residents have the highest rate by far of chronic liver disease -- just one of the underlying medical conditions that are widespread in New Mexico that heighten the risk of dying from Covid-19.\n\nStill, infectious disease specialists say New Mexico seems to have staved off disaster -- for the moment, at least -- with a coronavirus death rate that is lower than neighboring states like Colorado and Oklahoma.\n\nNew Mexico, which this week is reporting a crucial slowing in the spread of the infection, is not the only relatively poor state yielding impressive results against the virus. West Virginia has also moved aggressively, with even fewer per capita deaths. And the fast-spreading virus has caught more than one state by surprise, as unexpected new outbreaks develop.\n\nBut as state and local authorities grasp for strategies, New Mexico's series of decisive moves early in the crisis reflect how even states with a dearth of resources can mount a dynamic pandemic response.\n\nNew Mexico's measures included shutting down schools before most states, aggressively expanding social distancing, ramping up testing beyond levels achieved in richer states and using a pioneering telemedicine initiative to quickly train rural health workers for coronavirus care.\n\n\"Hundreds of lives were saved because of what the state did early on, and that's using conservative estimates,\" said Helen Wearing, a mathematician specializing in disease ecology at the University of New Mexico.\n\nStill, Dr. Wearing, who is part of a virus modeling group working with state health officials, warned that the state could see new waves of infection if nearby states loosen stay-at-home restrictions more quickly.\n\n\"As neighboring states ease back, New Mexico could get hit badly,\" Dr. Wearing said. \"But right now, we have some breathing space we didn't think would exist just a few weeks ago.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Congress has allocated $2.7 trillion, but as jobless claims mount, states struggle to meet needs. New York study suggests a much wider exposure to virus. Experts dismiss Trump's claim that sunlight and household disinfectants can treat the virus. See more updates Updated 46m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nEpidemiologists express concern about other risks for a coronavirus surge in New Mexico, including the potential that construction crews working to expand the wall on the border with Mexico could spread the virus around the southern part of the state. Moves by local authorities could also trigger outbreaks. The mayor of Grants, a small town in western New Mexico, said on Thursday that he would allow small businesses to reopen next week in defiance of shutdown orders.\n\nDisease specialists point out that outbreaks in some places come down to chance, though an array of factors can play an important role. New Mexico is more sparsely populated than some hard-hit states, potentially curbing the virus's expansion. But the deadly onslaught of cases in the Navajo Nation, which spreads over parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, shows how the virus can easily ravage rural areas.\n\nPolitical acrimony could also erode some of New Mexico's gains in fighting the virus. Republicans are hitting back at the state's Democratic leadership, contending that social distancing measures are crippling businesses and religious congregations.\n\nEven so, prominent Republican leaders in New Mexico have somewhat refrained from attacking the broader containment strategies established by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, focusing instead on the economic strain in the state.\n\n\"Our main difference with the governor is the inequity,\" said Steve Pearce, chairman of the Republican Party in New Mexico and a former candidate for governor who lost to Ms. Lujan Grisham in 2018.\n\nMr. Pearce said he was focusing criticism on Ms. Lujan Grisham's decision to allow large stores like Walmart to remain functioning while smaller operations are shut down. \"It's unfair to side with major out-of-state corporations over local businesses,\" Mr. Pearce said.\n\nWhile New Mexico has not experienced so-called \"reopen\" protests of the size or intensity as those in other states, some legal challenges to virus-containment measures are emerging from conservative groups, including the National Rifle Association.\n\n\"Our governor left abortion clinics open but closed us down,\" said Steve Smothermon, the senior pastor of Legacy Church, an Albuquerque megachurch that sued Ms. Lujan Grisham this month over a ban on mass gatherings in places of worship.\n\nA judge rejected Legacy's request to throw out the ban. Mr. Smothermon is holding Friday night services in Legacy's parking lot where congregants can tune into services from their cars.\n\nMs. Lujan Grisham said her previous experience as state health secretary and director of New Mexico's agency on aging informed her strategies in the chaotic early days of the crisis.\n\n\"I was looking at our chronic care issues and our levels of poverty and I was praying every day,\" said Ms. Lujan Grisham, who announced on March 12 that schools in the state would close at a time when New Mexico had no coronavirus deaths and six identified cases.\n\nMs. Lujan Grisham followed that announcement with calls to the leaders of New Mexico's tribal nations, pleading with them to shut down casinos and begin their own distancing measures. They did so, potentially averting deadly outbreaks in some tribal areas that have scarce running water and multiple generations living under the same roof.\n\nThe spread of the virus among Native Americans in the state remained a pressing crisis, the governor emphasized. While Native Americans account for about 11 percent of New Mexico's population, new data on Thursday showed that they make up 44 percent of the state's confirmed coronavirus cases.\n\nAs the pandemic approached, Ms. Lujan Grisham also moved quickly to offer free testing, including for people not showing symptoms. She directed the state scientific laboratory to work with a private company, TriCore Reference Laboratories of Albuquerque, to establish testing sites in each of New Mexico's 33 counties.\n\nCiting New Mexico's financial constraints, Ms. Lujan Grisham said federal assistance was also crucial for the state's virus response. But tension with federal authorities has also shaped the state's pandemic policies.\n\nFor instance, Ms. Lujan Grisham voiced frustration over obtaining equipment in a phone call in March between governors and President Trump. Her concern involved being placed by federal authorities in a queue without prioritization to buy testing equipment.\n\nMs. Lujan Grisham requested a follow-up call with Vice President Mike Pence, who moved to ease the delays. As of Wednesday, New Mexico figured among the top 10 states in coronavirus testing with a rate of 19.5 tests per 1,000 people, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That compares with a rate of 8.2 tests per 1,000 people in neighboring Colorado.\n\nThe testing capacity has allowed health officials to determine where the virus is spreading, as it is now in counties near the Navajo Nation, and allocate resources to these areas.\n\nAnother factor in New Mexico's response involved Project ECHO, a telemedicine initiative developed at the University of New Mexico that has previously been used in developing countries such as India and Vietnam.\n\nIn New Mexico, Project ECHO, which already has extensive experience working in rural areas in the state, pivoted to prepare doctors and other health workers in those areas for treating coronavirus patients and to convert operating rooms in hospitals into acute respiratory care units.\n\nEpidemiologists credit the state's early moves to put into place social distancing as crucial in limiting the spread of the virus, especially in cities such as Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Las Cruces.\n\nNew Mexico is drawing from a team of national defense scientists from Los Alamos National Laboratory -- which was created in 1943 to design and build an atomic bomb -- to assist with contagion forecasts.\n\nSara del Valle and Carrie Monroe, mathematical epidemiologists at Los Alamos, said that by April 19, New Mexico had already experienced a stunning decline of more than 40 percent in the number of originally forecast total cases.\n\n\"Because of the stay-at-home order,\" Ms. del Valle and Ms. Monroe said in a statement, \"the virus had fewer people to infect so the growth rate declined.\"\n\nMitch Smith contributed reporting from Chicago.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nRight now, there is no cure for the coronavirus. And although doctors and researchers are making progress on different ways to treat the illness, much remains uncertain.\n\nMany common symptoms continue to be identified, and families staying at home can take steps now to prepare in case someone falls ill, to best monitor one's health and to alleviate symptoms. Many people who get coronavirus feel lousy, but they get better in a few weeks.\n\nMake sure, to start, that you have at least a 30-day supply of prescription medications if you take them, and check that you have a well-stocked first-aid kit, too.\n\nTo get a sense of what else you should -- and should not -- have in your medicine cabinet at this time, we talked to doctors and pharmacists across the country. Here is the medicine and equipment they recommend.\n\nMedicine Cabinet or Hall Closet?\n\nEven before you head to the pharmacy, make sure your medications and equipment can be stored safely.\n\n\"A medicine cabinet in a bathroom that gets steamy from a bath or shower isn't an ideal place,\" said Dr. Ilisa Bernstein, the senior vice president of pharmacy practice and government affairs at the American Pharmacists Association. \"The humidity could impact the ingredients over time.\"\n\nA hallway linen closet is better, she said. That doesn't mean you need to throw out old medications, but it's good to know for the future. Wherever you keep them, make sure the bottles are away from children.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Georgia moves ahead with some reopenings despite plenty of misgivings. With the federal deficit projected to hit $3.7 trillion, Trump signs the latest aid package. Reopenings in several states on Friday offer the first wider test for the nation. See more updates Updated 23m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York Thermometers\n\nFever is one of the most prominent symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nIf you have a thermometer in your house already, make sure you have extra batteries. If you have two, check your temperature on both: they are not infallible. Between uses, disinfect the thermometer with alcohol or peroxide.\n\nIf you are buying a thermometer, oral readers are the best, said Dr. Stacey Curtis, a clinical assistant professor at the University of Florida College of Pharmacy. An ear thermometer needs to be placed properly for accuracy, and a forehead thermometer might not get a good reading if the patient is sweating, she said.\n\nBut some pharmacies are out of stock, and some online options are not verified or will take a long time to be delivered. If you cannot get a thermometer quickly, do not panic.\n\nAlthough it can be comforting to know the precise number, it will be obvious if you have a fever, said Dr. Stephen Eckel, a clinical associate professor at the University of North Carolina Eshelman School of Pharmacy. You will be cold and shivery, and will often sweat or be flushed. If you are exceptionally weak, dizzy or hallucinating, call your doctor. Consult with them before you go to the hospital.\n\nPulse Oximeters\n\nSome patients develop a pneumonia that can cause oxygen levels to drop before they experience severe symptoms. A pulse oximeter is a hand-held, clip-like device that measures the oxygen level of your blood stream. Some clip onto fingertips or earlobes. Normal readings usually range from 95 to 100 percent. A blood-oxygen level under 90 is considered low.\n\nThere have been shortages of pulse oximeters, too. If you can't find one right away, you can probably find one that can be delivered in a few weeks or a month.\n\nIf you get sick and don't have a home pulse oximeter, don't panic. Although it can be comforting to put a number to a symptom, it is not always necessary, said Dr. Albert Rizzo, the chief medical officer of the American Lung Association.\n\n\"I hate to have my patients fixate on numbers like this,\" he said. \"I think it's more important that you listen to what your body is telling you.\"\n\nIf you are struggling to draw a full breath, call your doctor and communicate concrete symptoms: I'm more short of breath now than I was yesterday. I can't climb the stairs. I'm coughing more.\n\n\"I'm not saying don't buy it, but it's not the thing I'd have at the top of my list when it's hard to get,\" Dr. Rizzo said of pulse oximeters. \"If you felt short of breath enough that you want to get a pulse ox, call your doctor.\"\n\nMost people do fine without them. You also can also borrow one from a friend (they are easily sanitized) or talk to your doctor about getting your oxygen levels checked at an urgent care center.\n\nFever Reducers and Painkillers\n\nBoth acetaminophen and ibuprofen will reduce a fever, and can be used to treat the uncomfortable symptoms of fever: headache, aches and chills.\n\nPharmacists caution against taking too much acetaminophen, which can cause severe liver damage. And you should be aware that many over-the-counter cough medications also contain acetaminophen. The total amount of acetaminophen taken in pain relievers and cold medications should not exceed 3,000 milligrams a day. Additionally, alcohol should not be consumed when taking acetaminophen.\n\nPatients with underlying conditions should check before taking any medication. Also, children and adults have different dosages. Be sure to read the label before giving children medication.\n\nSome doctors caution against reducing a fever at all. The immune system works better when the body's temperature is higher, and dozens of studies have shown fever to be beneficial in fighting infections.\n\n\"When you treat with fever-reducing medicines, as has been shown again and again and again, you decrease the body's ability to make antibodies,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, an infectious disease expert at the University of Pennsylvania and Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.\n\nEven if it is uncomfortable, it might be best to sweat this one out.\n\nThere has been controversy about whether ibuprofen is safe to take for coronavirus. The World Health Organization said it was not aware of any research showing that the over-the-counter drug should not be taken by infected patients.\n\nOver-the-Counter Remedies\n\nThere are other things that might alleviate some symptoms. Throat lozenges will soothe an aching throat, which can come from coughing. Be sure children do not choke on them. If you are worried, honey works, too.\n\nThe coronavirus can lead to nausea or diarrhea. Although it can be uncomfortable, it might be best to let whatever gastrointestinal distress happen, because it is a way your body gets rid of infection. \"We are not recommending anyone take anything to stop the diarrhea,\" said Dr. Curtis of the University of Florida. \"We want them to go ahead and have diarrhea.\"\n\nBut diarrhea can cause dehydration, so she recommends getting an electrolyte-replenisher like Pedialyte to replace minerals. Regular sports drinks are sugary, and have less of an impact.\n\nCold medicines are largely ineffective, but antihistamines can help if you have seasonal allergies.\n\nThe most important thing, if you are feeling sick, is to communicate with a doctor or pharmacist. Although it may take time to wait in the line, a call to a pharmacist is free. He or she can help you talk through your concerns, and offer advice.\n\nTara Parker Pope contributed reporting.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nGrocery stores have bare shelves. Consumers are hoarding. Supply chains are disrupted. As the coronavirus upends the business world, few sectors have been more affected than food and beverage manufacturing. Small and medium-size companies were particularly vulnerable, yet some have managed to thrive.\n\nDr. Praeger's Purely Sensible Foods, a privately held maker of veggie burgers and meat alternatives based in New Jersey, saw the crisis swelling in the New York region in mid-March. Seeking to stay ahead of it, Larry Praeger, a co-founder and the chief executive, took a series of swift actions that prioritized sanitation and social distancing in the company's factory.\n\nIn San Francisco, Hint Water was facing its own challenges. Though the company's automated manufacturing facilities were less vulnerable to disruption, Hint had to figure out what to do with its employees who usually spend their days handing out samples at grocery stores and events. Kara Goldin, the Hint founder and chief executive, redeployed those staff members, and has managed to avoid layoffs. Both Dr. Praeger's and Hint are now hiring.\n\nThis conversation, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was part of a series of new live Corner Office calls discussing the crisis. Visit timesevents.nytimes.com to join upcoming calls.\n\nDAVID GELLES Kara, when was it that you realized this was going to be something that disrupted your business in pretty fundamental ways, and what steps did you start taking to adjust?\n\nKARA GOLDIN On March 13, I flew to San Francisco and stopped in a local store on my way home. I noticed that their supply of Hint had been depleted. While I had heard about hoarding starting and people were really stocking up, I really hadn't pieced together the effect that that would have on our own brand. At that point, I reached out to our sales team and our supply chain and basically said, \"I don't know what's going on, but I've now stopped into a second store just to see, and it's a consistent pattern. We're either very low or out of stock on a bunch of our flavors.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Economy The federal budget deficit will be nearly $4 trillion in 2020, the C.B.O. says. As they're urged to reopen, movie theaters say it is too soon. Consumer sentiment saw a record plunge in April but may be leveling off. See more updates Updated 31m ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nThat weekend, we were pretty quick to reach out to our grocery buyers throughout the country and say, \"Hey, if we are out of stock and there's some sort of hiccup in your supply chain, or you guys are inundated with doing a lot of other stuff right now, we're more than willing to jump in and send trucks in direct to you.\" And many of them actually jumped on that, just to be able to stock their shelves.\n\nGELLES Larry, right around the same time, you also started to recognize that this was going to have an impact. Your company is based in New Jersey, and you took pretty dramatic action quite early. What did you do to try to stay ahead of this?\n\nLARRY PRAEGER Our manufacturing facility is based out of northern New Jersey, and we were having similar discussions about what we needed to do. A priority was really to make sure that we had a safe working environment for all our factory workers, as well as the people that were in the office. So around March 18, we did take a bit of a drastic step and closed down our factory for four days.\n\nThat was to try to do a heavy sanitizing of the building and the manufacturing facility, but also to give us some time to really come up with a plan so that, when we reopened, we could bring back our factory workers and feel safe about doing it. Now we're taking temperatures when people enter the facility, we're providing masks and gloves for all the employees, we've increased the cleaning in the factory, we have heavy sanitation in high-touch areas, and we've added space in the break and lunchroom spaces, and set up some satellite break and lunchroom spaces.\n\nThe one thing that we really wanted to instill in the employees was to make sure that they understood that if they weren't feeling well, they should not come into work, and their job wasn't in jeopardy. The most important thing, as a first line of defense, was to have them not come to work. If people aren't coming to work sick, then you have less to worry about in your facility.\n\nGELLES Kara, you have manufacturing lines in the United States as well. What changes did you make, if any?\n\nGOLDIN We have multiple bottling facilities throughout the U.S., and we were actually very well set up. We pasteurize our product because we're not using preservatives, and the actual location where it's being filled is a clean room, so there's no people in there when it's going through the process of killing any microbes. So there has not been a dramatic change in the way that we're filling.\n\nGELLES Larry, despite the precautions you took, at least four of your employees have tested positive for the virus, including some who worked inside your factory. What happens when factory workers at a food company test positive for this virus? What steps have you taken to ensure that their illness didn't become a problem for the business?\n\nPRAEGER We've had about four or five cases. Those people are quarantining at home for 14 days. And we've actually had one person who's come back since then. They saw a doctor and have a doctor's note that confirms that they're OK.\n\nGELLES Has this caused any disruptions to your manufacturing?\n\nPRAEGER It's definitely slowed down some of the manufacturing. In addition to the confirmed cases, we probably have another about 12 to 15 cases where people have had symptoms and they've stayed home because of that, or because they have no child care. It's definitely a challenge. We're definitely not running as efficiently as we used to be. But that's OK, as long as it's a safe environment.\n\nGELLES Kara, Hint employs a large marketing team that goes to events and in stores to hand out samples. What are they doing in the midst of all this?\n\nGOLDIN We have about 200 people in the company, and that same weekend in March, we decided that it probably wasn't a great idea to have our team handing out sample cups. I don't know how you can stay six feet apart in that case. So we decided to reallocate those people into sales and other roles, and we haven't furloughed or laid anybody off.\n\nGELLES Larry, did Dr. Praeger's see a spike in demand as people stocked up? If so, were you able to meet it?\n\nPRAEGER Starting in March, we saw a big uptick in purchases at the retail level, supermarket level and club channel level. It was across the board, from veggie burgers to chickenless tenders to products for kids. We've seen that come down a little bit in April. But our food service division, which is mostly selling to restaurants and hotels, has seen a huge decline. In March, we saw it head way down, and now we're seeing probably close to 70 percent decline in comparison to the prior year.\n\nGELLES Kara, people haven't hoarded flavored water in quite the same way they have hoarded toilet paper, but what have you seen on the demand side?\n\nGOLDIN The good news for the business was the hoarding, to some extent, in the grocery businesses and really stocking up on Hint. We've seen that start to slow in retail stores, but we've actually seen it pick up in other areas that we know where people are going into stores, including Instacart. And our direct-to-consumer business, which is HintWater.com and Amazon, has gone up a crazy amount. I mean over 100 percent. In times like these, it's really about convenience and what the customer wants to do.\n\nGELLES Larry, you have a complex supply chain, with lots of different ingredients, the need for cold storage and shipping all around the country. What disruptions have you seen to your supply chain, be it on the materials side or on the delivery?\n\nPRAEGER We're seeing costs going up on vegetables because people in the farms are not working as well, or there are a limited amount of people. And the freight prices coming in have been increasing. But the supply chain over all, so far, has been pretty steady.\n\nGELLES What advice would you give to someone who's currently looking for a job?\n\nGOLDIN You should work for companies that you're really passionate about, that you really believe are doing things that you want to be doing every single day. I've talked to a few people that I know that, before, were just working for companies that they didn't necessarily believe in or enjoy, and they got furloughed. Now they're looking at it as another chance to just go and try and figure things out. So, if that's you in this situation, try and figure out, \"What is the perfect thing that I want to be doing? What company do I want to support to really go and be that company that I want to invest in?\" Maybe you started moving up in that company, getting paid too much money, whatever it is, and now this is an opportunity to go and reset a little bit.\n\nGELLES When this is over, what's the biggest change that you'll be making at your companies?\n\nPRAEGER The biggest change will definitely be moving more toward some of this distancing that we've done in the factory. It would have been a benefit to really come into the crisis having those kinds of systems set up.\n\nGOLDIN We had already set up for direct-to-consumer and Amazon and some of these other services. But as we see consumers' habits changing, we will be looking at growing those businesses, working closer with an Instacart and just making it faster, quicker and easier for the consumer to get our product.",

        "body": "Want to get The Morning by email? Here's the sign-up.\n\nGood morning. A fired inspector general was investigating the secretary of state. Shopping malls are in trouble. And we're about to enter a confusing period with the coronavirus.\n\nLife in New York City felt pretty normal in early March. Children were going to school. Restaurants and theaters were packed. On March 9, I recorded a podcast in front of a few hundred people in Times Square.\n\nIn hindsight, we know that the coronavirus was then sweeping across the city. Deaths peaked in early to mid-April. And the typical time from contraction to death is from three to five weeks, according to my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli -- which suggests early March was near the peak for transmission.\n\nOver the next couple of weeks, it's going to be important to keep this recent history in mind. Without mass testing -- and the United States is not doing mass testing -- there is a lag before a virus outbreak becomes apparent. Most people who develop symptoms don't do so for at least five days, and sometimes longer. The worst symptoms usually take almost three weeks to appear.\n\nWith more parts of the U.S. starting to reopen, many people will be tempted to look at the data this week and start proclaiming victory over the virus. But this week's data won't tell us much. It will instead reflect the reality from early May and late April, when much of the country was still on lockdown.\n\n\"The data are always two or three weeks old,\" Ezekiel Emanuel of the University of Pennsylvania told me. \"And we have a hard time understanding that things are different from what we're looking at.\" Crystal Watson of Johns Hopkins University told The Associated Press that we wouldn't really know how reopening had affected the virus's spread for five to six weeks.\n\nIt's possible that the reopenings won't cause the outbreaks that many epidemiologists fear -- because many people will still stay home, or because they will venture out cautiously, or because the virus may spread more slowly in warmer air. But it's also possible that the country will find itself suffering through a new wave of outbreaks in June.\n\nEither way, I'd encourage you not to leap to premature conclusions.\n\nIn other virus developments:\n\nThe World Health Organization's decision-making body will meet starting today and likely discuss whether to investigate China's response to the outbreak.\n\nAs more children survive a mysterious syndrome linked to the virus, their experiences are helping doctors understand what they're up against. \"It was almost like someone injected you with straight-up fire,\" said one ninth grader in Queens.\n\nAnna Sauerbrey, a contributing Opinion writer in Berlin, writes about the complications of reopening society, \"The way out is much harder than the way in.\"\n\nTHE MORNING FIVE1. Scrutiny on Pompeo's use of taxpayer funds\n\nBefore President Trump announced his firing on Friday, the inspector general of the State Department had begun an inquiry into the agency's leader, Mike Pompeo. The investigation focused on Pompeo's possible use of a political appointee to perform personal tasks, such as walking the dog and picking up dry-cleaning.\n\nTrump has taken several steps this year to quash independent voices within the executive branch. \"I cannot see how any inspector general will feel in any way safe to do a good job,\" Danielle Brian of the Project on Government Oversight, a nonprofit group, has said.\n\n2. A coming mall apocalypse?\n\nJ.C. Penney, which filed for bankruptcy on Friday, is likely to begin closing some of its 800-plus stores soon, which could create major problems for already struggling malls. Department store chains like J.C. Penney account for about 30 percent of the total mall square footage in the U.S., providing rent and increasing foot traffic.\n\nRetail analysts say that some malls are at risk of not surviving the pandemic. They had already been losing sales to online shopping and big-box retailers and now face months of depressed sales. Both J. Crew and Neiman Marcus have also filed for bankruptcy, and Nordstrom plans to shut 16 of its 116 stores.\n\n3. The Republican plan to patrol the vote\n\nThe Republican Party is mounting a national effort to shape who votes in November, with plans to recruit as many as 50,000 volunteers to monitor polling places. The program is premised on preventing voter fraud, though the threat of that is virtually nonexistent, researchers say. Democrats say the true aim is to suppress minority voters.\n\nThe Times's Michael Wines explains that the plan was made possible by a 2018 federal court ruling that, for the first time in nearly four decades, allowed Republicans to mount campaigns against purported voter fraud without court approval. Courts had previously banned such campaigns, after finding instances of Republicans intimidating minority voters.\n\n4. A critical eye on a star reporter\n\nBen Smith, The Times's media columnist, has published an examination of Ronan Farrow's reporting, both in The New Yorker and in his book, that found \"some shakiness at its foundation.\"\n\n\"He delivers narratives that are irresistibly cinematic,\" Ben writes, \"and often omits the complicating facts and inconvenient details that may make them less dramatic.\"\n\nDavid Remnick, editor of The New Yorker, defended Farrow's reporting and said the magazine was \"proud to publish him.\" Farrow said he brought \"caution, rigor, and nuance\" to each of his stories.\n\n5. Police killings surge in Rio\n\nKillings by the Rio de Janeiro police surged to more than 1,800 last year, a record high. A Times analysis of 48 such killings indicated routine police brutality and a culture of impunity set by President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil.\n\nOne quarter of the cases in the analysis involved an officer who had previously been charged with murder. The trend -- which has coincided with a drop in crime in the city -- is consistent with campaign promises from Bolsonaro, whose policies on crime resemble those of President Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines.\n\nHere's what else is happening\n\nA Canadian Air Force jet crashed in British Columbia, killing one person on board, during a flyover that was intended as a tribute to workers fighting the coronavirus.\n\nTwo Kansas City, Mo., police officers have been indicted on assault charges after they were caught on video using excessive force to arrest a transgender woman last year.\n\nBACK STORY: WHAT'S IN A NAME?\n\nThe New York Times article heralding Amelia Earhart as the first woman to fly a solo, uninterrupted trip across the Atlantic Ocean referred to her as \"Mrs. Putnam,\" because she was married to George Palmer Putnam. Only after she wrote a letter to the publisher at the time, Arthur Hays Sulzberger, did The Times begin using her \"professional name.\"\n\nAfter Veronica Chambers and Amisha Padnani, two editors here, came across that story, they decided to dig into the paper's history of calling women by their husbands' names -- like \"Mrs. Diego Rivera\" (Frida Kahlo) and \"Mrs. Martin Luther King Jr.\" (Coretta Scott King).\n\nThe result is the Mrs. Files project, which includes essays, photos and poetry. And you can see Earhart's letter to Sulzberger here.\n\nPLAY, WATCH, EAT, LISTENOde to joy\n\nIf you need a burst of joy on this Monday morning, here are 14 essays on all the weird ways that people are finding happiness now, despite ... everything.\n\nThere's Taffy Brodesser-Akner on the joy of plans canceling themselves, Caity Weaver on her passion for deleting mediocre photos off her phone, and Jenna Wortham on the simple pleasures of watching her scallions grow.\n\nSpeaking of scallions: This comforting chicken and rice dish, served with a tangy scallion-ginger sauce, also sparks joy.\n\nCello concert for one, please\n\nLucky residents of Germany have been attending a series of one-on-one, 10-minute performances. Organized by local orchestras, the recitals offer attendees their first taste of live music since the country went under lockdown in March.\n\nOne concert moved an onlooker to tears: \"I didn't know if she was sad, maybe thinking of someone she had lost, or she was happy because of the music,\" a bassoonist said.\n\n'Last Dance' finale\n\nThe final episodes of \"The Last Dance,\" ESPN's hit documentary about Michael Jordan and the 1997-98 Chicago Bulls, aired last night. So it's a good time to put Jordan in some historical perspective.\n\nThat 1997-98 season capped the most successful stretch that any athlete in the three biggest American pro sports leagues has had over the past half-century.

        "body": "The virus has exposed gender fault lines in myriad ways. Nahla Valji, senior gender adviser at the UN, unpacks them.\n\n\"Our formal economy is only possible because it's subsidized by women's unpaid work.\"\n\n-- Nahla Valji, the senior gender adviser to the Secretary General of the United Nations\n\nIn Her Words is available as a newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe coronavirus has worsened existing social and economic inequalities, especially for women.\n\nWhile both women and men are suffering the economic fallout of the virus across the world, it is women -- already more likely to be in poverty than men, already more likely to be earning a smaller paycheck, already with less savings, already more likely to be in precarious jobs -- who are being disproportionately squeezed.\n\nAdd to that, the next-to-invisible but overwhelming burden of unpaid labor, the bulk of which is shouldered by women in every country in the world.\n\nThe virus has exposed gender fault lines in myriad ways. And it raises questions: What do we know so far? What will we learn from it? How will things look on the other side?\n\nI asked Nahla Valji, the senior gender adviser to the secretary general of the United Nations, and Alisha Haridasani Gupta, gender reporter for In Her Words, to unpack these issues with me.\n\nYou can listen to our discussion here, or read the edited excerpts below.\n\nFrancesca Donner: We know that economies the world over have been ravaged. What does this mean for women in particular?\n\nNahla Valji: Crises amplify existing inequalities, and so across the world women are being affected more severely by the socioeconomic impacts of this pandemic. This is because in every country women earn less, they save less, they're more likely to be in precarious jobs with little security or protections if they do work, or in the informal sector, with no protections at all. And that means that they have less buffer to economic shocks, such as the ones we are experiencing.\n\nThen, when we start to drill down into specific groups we see, for example, that the majority of single parent households are women. The majority of refugees and internally displaced individuals around the world are women and girls. So there's layers of inequality here.\n\nWhat we've learned from past pandemics is that while everyone suffers economically in the short term, men's incomes tend to return to some degree of normalcy much faster. For women, the economic shocks last longer.\n\nThat's a grim picture. Alisha, can you paint the economic picture for women in the U.S. specifically?\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Medical experts show cautious optimism that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready sometime next year. A prototype vaccine has protected monkeys from the virus, researches have found. See more updates Updated 6m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAlisha Haridasani Gupta: There's a very real push and pull here. On one hand, women make up the essential workers on the front lines. The New York Times analyzed government data and found that one in three jobs that have been designated essential in this pandemic is held by a woman -- jobs like health care workers (around 78 percent are women), cashiers at grocery stores, drugstore pharmacists. Women are doing crucial work, but it's underpaid and undervalued.\n\nOn the other hand, women in nonessential work -- retail, for example -- are being laid off. Historically, economic crises have hit industries that are male-dominated like manufacturing, agriculture, mining, but this time it's the inverse. In Minnesota, for example, every week more women than men are filing for unemployment.\n\nIt's hard to talk about paid work without acknowledging the unpaid labor at home -- things like cooking, cleaning, caring for kids or aging parents -- the work people do because they have to. Nahla, can you speak to the effect that the coronavirus has had on unpaid labor, and what that means for women?\n\nNahla: It's one of the starkest consequences that we're seeing from this crisis. The care work in the home has really grown exponentially with children out of school. We have elder care needs that have increased, we have health systems that are overwhelmed and people who are sick and still require assistance that are now at home. And historically, traditionally, these responsibilities have fallen on the shoulders of women in the home. As you said, disproportionately, women do more of the work in the home than men -- the global average is three times more but that varies geographically and country by country. In some countries, it's six or seven times more\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nWhat should I do with my 401(k)?\n\nWatching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions -- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that \"free money.\"\n\nAnd, you know, this really underpins so many of the inequalities that women experience. These are hours that could be spent on income generation. It's at the heart of the motherhood penalty, wage inequality, structural biases in recruitment and promotion of women and jobs -- and the pandemic is really making visible.\n\nOur formal economy is only possible because it's subsidized by women's unpaid work. And so we have almost this black box over the home and everything that happens there has a zero dollar value on it. We don't have adequate child care anywhere in the world. As social services, social protections and health care access decrease, we put more strain on the home. And I think that's becoming really visible at the moment with this crisis.\n\nSo we need to be thinking about how we rebuild in a way that's more equitable. And that will also ensure that we're more resilient to future shocks. So any conversation that we're having with regards to building back better, we really need to place the care economy at the center of our economic models.\n\nAnd this is happening even in countries we think of as very female favorable...\n\nAlisha: Right. I've really been thinking a lot about what might be a possible cultural shift here. I spoke to an economics professor at Northwestern University, Matthias Doepke, who said something that stuck with me: For many families where women are the essential paid workers -- for example, nurses, doctors, grocery cashiers -- all of those families might, for the first time, have a situation where the woman is out working and perhaps the husband is at home. So this might force a change in that the men have to suddenly start cooking and cleaning and taking care of the kids. I don't know how long term that might be, but there is evidence to show that even if you have a temporary shift in the care burden it tends to last. So, I don't know that you could call it a silver lining, but it might be interesting to watch going forward.\n\nNahla: There's a possibility we'll come out of this with some positives. We're seeing a lot more acceptance of flexible work arrangements and telecommuting that might help all of us rebalance work and family life in a different way. That would be positive for equality.\n\nBut we need women in positions of leadership to ensure that solutions are informed by a diversity of views and experiences. Because if not, we could deepen inequalities. One example of that is the discussion about how we reopen countries that have been on lockdown. How do we sequence businesses and schools? If schools are staying shut, but the economy is opening, there's an expectation that one parent is going to stay at home. And because of traditional norms and gender roles and because of wage inequality, the likelihood is that it ends up being the woman who stays home.\n\nAnd so we potentially risk taking ourselves backward in terms of women's labor force participation, equality, and more generally, with regards to the division of labor.\n\nIf you are enjoying In Her Words, invite a friend to sign up.

        "body": "After recovering from the coronavirus, the Rev. Peter Purpura found a way to bring the church directly to his people.\n\nThe Rev. Peter Purpura walked slowly down the middle of a street lined with brick rowhouses in Middle Village, Queens. He wore a black cassock, white vestments and a light blue surgical mask as he led a procession.\n\nEvery few houses a family waited outside in their compact front yard, many standing next to makeshift altars adorned with flowers, candles and religious statues. Father Purpura stopped at each house, saying blessings and offering prayers.\n\nIt was Sunday morning, and in more normal times Father Purpura would have been presiding over crowded services at Our Lady of Hope Church. Since coronavirus restrictions forced him to close the church doors in March, he had been celebrating mass in an empty chapel, streaming it live on Facebook. But after his own bout with the coronavirus, he decided to meet his parishioners where they are -- at home.\n\nFather Purpura stopped in front of a brick home and greeted Alessia, 8, who was supposed to receive her first holy communion at the church this week. Instead, her rosary beads lay on a table set up by her parents, flanked by tulips. Father Purpura and Deacon Robert Lavanco joined Alessia and her family in reciting the Our Father and Hail Mary prayers.\n\nAt another house an older woman pleaded with the priest to give a blessing to her husband, who was very sick and could not come to the door. Father Purpura obliged, ducking inside.\n\nMany of the hundreds of parishioners who have come out to greet Father Purpura have been deeply affected by the coronavirus as it ravaged New York City. Some have lost their jobs as businesses closed and have been mostly stuck inside their homes for weeks. Others have risked their lives working as essential personnel. Middle Village, where most of his flock lives, is near Corona, Queens, one of the hardest-hit areas of the city.\n\n\"At this point everyone here is connected to someone who has been sick or has died,\" said Father Purpura, 38. He estimates that at least two dozen of his parishioners have died from the virus. \"I really do believe that this procession is a source of hope for people.\"\n\nThe coronavirus has not spared Father Purpura, or his family.\n\nLast month, as he prepared to record Palm Sunday mass, Father Purpura found that he could barely stand. His temperature reached 105 degrees. During Holy Week he developed shortness of breath, began coughing and was unable to celebrate mass for two weeks while he battled the symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Some N.Y. hospitals will allow visits to resume under a pilot program. N.Y.U. plans to hold in-person classes, 'with great care,' this fall. N.J. revises how it counts nursing home deaths. See more updates Updated 6h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nWhile he was sick, his aunt, Marcella Purpura, 85, a nun who lived in Rockaway Beach, Queens, died from the virus, and he could not officiate at the burial. His mother was hospitalized with Covid-19 a week before his own illness and is still dependent on oxygen treatments. His father became sick with the virus around the same time but has since recovered.\n\nFather Purpura realized that the church was shut down during a time when his parishioners needed it the most: \"I became a priest to be intimately involved in people's lives. As a priest you share in people's joys, and you share in people's sorrows.\"\n\nAfter he recovered, he started holding the outdoor procession every Sunday morning, walking his parish bearing a golden monstrance containing a communion wafer. Though this procession, called the Blessed Sacrament, is normally held outside once a year in June, on the Feast of Corpus Christi, Father Purpura intends to continue it on a weekly basis until the church can reopen.\n\n\"With this procession I am able to bring the church to them, when they're not able to come to us,\" said Father Purpura, who grew up in Breezy Point, Queens.\n\nLast Sunday was his third procession.\n\nVincent and Carmel Ann Caputo and their three children welcomed Father Purpura with a simple makeshift altar decorated with candles and statues. The words \"Welcome Fr. Peter\" were scrawled on the sidewalk in chalk.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes.

The church is the people of God.\"",

Ms. Kr\u00fcger Allman asked a nurse to hold a phone to her husband's ear, allowing him to hear the music and her farewell.\n\nAfter he died, Mr. Allman's doorway was crowded with notes, flowers and gifts from neighbors.\n\n\"He was a community-minded soul,\" Ms. Kr\u00fcger Allman said. \"He made a beautiful impact on the world.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Who's still getting hospitalized in N.Y.?

See more updates Updated 11m ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S. Caridad Santiago, 43A subway worker on the front lines\n\nCaridad Santiago, was a fun-loving, lifelong Bronx resident who was well known in her Belmont neighborhood for loving the card game spades and singing along to R&B tunes.\n\n\"She could make a dull room light up,\" said Crystal Puertas, 26, the eldest of Ms. Santiago's three children. \"Everyone gravitated toward her energy. She was the life of the party.\"\n\nBut Ms. Santiago, known as Cari, also brought a serious work ethic to her job as a subway station cleaner for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a position that gave her and her family financial stability.\n\n\"She did come from poverty, in a sense, and her getting that job made life a little better for us,\" Ms. Puertas said.\n\nMs. Santiago, who died at home on March 29, is one of more than 80 authority workers whose deaths were caused by the virus.\n\nShe worked the overnight shift, which often required long, late-night commutes by bus and train to haul trash, mop stairways and, especially lately, sanitize turnstiles and MetroCard machines.\n\nAs the virus spread in New York, Ms. Santiago remained on the front lines. She changed her Facebook photo to one that showed her at work. \"I can't go home,\" the caption said. \"I'm an essential worker.\"\n\n\"She was very confident,\" Ms. Puertas said. \"She could swim deeper and dive from higher than anyone. At amusement parks, she would be on the scariest roller coaster.\"\n\nOne place she feared -- and avoided, even as her symptoms worsened -- was the hospital, because of news reports of patients dying in droves, Ms. Puertas said.\n\nHer confidence never seemed to waver, even as she lay dying in bed.\n\n\"She told us, 'You guys are going to be OK, always,'\" Ms. Puertas said.\n\nEd Antonio Jr., 79The original 'take care of your essential workers' person'\n\nEd Antonio Jr. made a daily habit of inviting the mail carrier into his home in the Rockaway section of Queens for a sandwich and bathroom break.\n\nHe attended the wedding of the sanitation worker who picked up his trash.\n\n\"He was the original 'take care of your essential workers' person,\" said his grandson Eddie Joe Antonio, 23. \"Everyone he encountered became a friend.\"\n\nMr. Antonio looked after his neighbors, too. He brought in their trash cans and walked an older neighbor's dog every day.\n\nHis appetite for activism seemed boundless. He spent his evenings serving on school and community boards, and on neighborhood and other civic associations.\n\n\"He showed up to everything,\" said his son, E.J. Antonio, 55. \"He had the ability to walk up to somebody and in seconds make them feel like he knew them forever.\"\n\nHe was an adopter of abandoned bicycles. He would fix them and give them to local children or add them to a fleet he kept for the friends, families, disabled veterans and strangers whom he invited over for beach days.\n\nMr. Antonio, a retired pharmaceutical salesman, and his wife, Paula, were married for 60 years. They had met as toddlers living on the same block in Brooklyn's Sheepshead Bay section. Later, they were high school sweethearts.\n\nAfter Hurricane Sandy decimated the Rockaways in 2012, the couple stayed in their home despite having no electricity. They fed cleanup workers and watched over the homes of neighbors who had decamped.\n\nMr. Antonio died at home on April 14. He may have exposed himself to the virus by mobilizing a mask-making effort for hospital workers while many New Yorkers sheltered in place, his son said.\n\n\"He was still looking for ways to help first responders,\" his son said.\n\nMarianne 'Peachy' Herlihy, 79A cheerful New Yorker who dispensed 'Peachy's proverbs'\n\nGrowing up in the Bronx, Marianne Herlihy picked up the nickname \"Peachy,\" a jaunty moniker that matched her outlook on life.\n\nMs. Herlihy was developmentally disabled and she lived under her parents' care into her 50s. She worked an assembly-line job, sorting makeup kits for meager pay.\n\nBeneath her cheery, charismatic exterior, Ms. Herlihy, who died on April 6, had an intense desire to live as independently as possible.\n\nAs a child she memorized words to win spelling bees, said a sister, Eileen Powers, 82. She watched television obsessively and kept notes on shows in carefully archived notebooks. To travel the city, she memorized bus and subway routes.\n\nAnd, Ms. Powers said, she came up with volumes of \"Peachy's proverbs,\" practical dictums and coping expressions she lived by and preached to others, often with hilarious timing.\n\nFor example, she fiercely guarded her pocket money because, she said, \"When you have Mr. Twenty, take care of him until you need him.\"\n\nShe said that she rarely declined a social invitation because, \"If you say no, you won't be invited again.\"\n\nFor the past 20 years, Ms. Herlihy lived at Fineson House, a group home in Manhattan.\n\n\"Everybody who knew Peachy loved her; she gave life lessons to me and my daughters,\" Ms. Powers said. \"She was a hero among us.\"\n\nSam Hargress Jr., 84Owner of 'Harlem's oldest and only live jazz dive'\n\nSamuel Hargress Jr. opened Paris Blues more than a half-century ago.\n\nThe live music joint, which he liked to refer to as \"Harlem's oldest and only live jazz dive,\" became a neighborhood institution, as did Mr. Hargress.\n\nAnd as gentrification brought corporate chains to Harlem, he considered it a badge of honor to run a thriving, black-owned establishment.\n\nOver the years, Mr. Hargress spurned lucrative offers to sell the five-story building that housed the bar, said his son, Sam Hargress III, 43.\n\nDressed in a sharp suit, hat and sunglasses, the elder Mr. Hargress would plant himself at the bar's entrance to greet customers, whether they were regulars, new residents or tourists.\n\n\"His high in life was talking to people from everywhere and having common ground with them,\" his son said.\n\nMr. Hargress's business cards listed not just him, but also his bar staff by name, and he would cook food himself and set it out free for customers.\n\nA military veteran, he insisted on waking at dawn, so he would leave the bar at midnight for his apartment upstairs. He loved music and he enjoyed falling asleep listening as the band kept playing downstairs, his son said.\n\nAs the virus spread, and nonessential businesses were ordered to close in March, Mr. Hargress reluctantly shut Paris Blues.\n\n\"To close the bar, something he never had to do since 1969, was painful,\" the son said, adding that he planned to keeping the place open in memory of his father, who died on April 10.\n\n\"This was more than a job for him,\" his son said. \"This was his life.\"\n\nThose We've Lost\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has taken an incalculable death toll.

        "body": "The coronavirus scuttled plans and forced officials to ask people to get out of the woods. Of the thousands who hoped to hike the trail this year, only a few hundred remain.\n\nWhen Kelsey Foster started hiking the Appalachian Trail in early March, she had left her whole life behind -- her job, her apartment, her family.\n\nThe mood was still lighthearted as news about the coronavirus trickled out to hikers in those first few days. \"There started being kind of jokes about it, like, 'You left society at the right time,'\" Ms. Foster said. \"'There's no way to social distance better than being a backpacker.'\"\n\nBut by the end of the month, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the organization that leads management of the trail, which crosses 14 states along its 2,190-mile route from Georgia to Maine, was urging hikers to stay away. It set off an exodus from the trail and a bitter debate about those who stayed behind.\n\nAfter weeks of struggling to decide, Ms. Foster ultimately went home, joining millions of other Americans who were suddenly set adrift as the coronavirus battered the economy. Just as the annual hiking season was beginning this spring, the pandemic has devastated trail towns up and down the East Coast, created rifts in a tight-knit community and left hikers, small businesses and the trail's caretakers facing almost impossible questions.\n\nIs backpacking still safe, or does it put hikers and the towns they visit in danger? Should a hostel ordered to close still serve a hiker in need? What if the hiker refuses to wear a mask, or the hostel is going bankrupt? And how do you manage nearly 2,200 miles of trail, served by thousands of volunteers and businesses, overseen by a patchwork group of parks and agencies, in the middle of a pandemic?\n\nOfficially, the trail itself is not closed. But access to it depends on jurisdiction: Shenandoah National Park is closed, for instance, and the U.S. Forest Service has shut down some shelters, access points and trailheads in line with local guidance. (On Wednesday, as some states began to ease stay-at-home orders, the conservancy offered a safety update to day and overnight hikers, while still asking thru-hikers to postpone their trips.)\n\nSandra Marra, the president of the conservancy, said the request to stay off the trail was not made lightly. Infections were rising around the country -- and cases included park service employees. Volunteers who clean shelters and privies do not have protective equipment. There was a fear that hikers could bring infections to vulnerable towns, and an injury on the trail could further strain medical resources.\n\nAnd even though hiking may seem like an exercise in isolation, Ms. Marra said, \"you can't hike the trail for more than a day or two before you're walking into towns, roads, businesses and people.\" Normally, 3,000 to 4,000 people attempt to thru-hike -- only about one in four succeed -- and 3 million people visit part of the trail every year.\n\nMs. Marra said that the overwhelming majority of thru-hikers -- those who try to complete the entire trail -- heeded the request to stay away. But a few hundred hikers have stayed on. \"They call themselves the resistance,\" she said.\n\nOn social media, where the trail community is usually an oasis of positivity -- lots of trail stories and tips about gear, and very little politics -- venom started to fly. Some users accused hikers of selfishly endangering others; others compared trail closures to fascist decrees.\n\nJanet Major, 61, who stayed on the trail, said she had endured a wave of \"hate and actual threats of violence\" after someone accused her of being a \"spreader.\" Many hikers said that misinformation had swept through the community, and that they undertook a daily battle to counter it with accurate information about closures and resources.\n\nCaught between were hostel owners and \"trail angels\" like Odie Norman, who every year travels up and down the trail in his school bus, knitting the community together as he compiles a hiker yearbook. Mr. Norman, 37, said he helped hundreds of hikers get off the trail this year, and also helped dozens more resupply to stay on.\n\n\"My heart has chosen to serve the hiking community and that's on both sides of the coin right now,\" he said. Other trail angels provided protective equipment or even took hikers into their homes to quarantine. Mr. Norman has since gone to live in his parents' attic in Alabama. \"Me going on my bus from town to town is not congruent with what we should be doing in America,\" he said.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Disease models suggest tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented.

This year, its owner, Alison Coltrane, had one guest between April 6 and May 14 as she abided by a county ban on short-term lodging. Ms. Coltrane, 55, was able to get a three-month deferment on her mortgage, and to stay afloat, she started delivering pizza for Domino's at night and working 5 a.m. shifts at a Walmart distribution center.\n\n\"I am a one-woman show,\" she said. \"It's been rough. I miss my hikers.\"\n\nColin Gooder, the owner of Gooder Grove Hostel in Franklin, N.C., was an early bearer of warnings to hikers, even before he shut down in mid-March. While most hikers followed official guidance, he said, some were offended that he asked them to take precautions and wear masks.\n\n\"There was almost a subculture of indignation about it,\" he said. \"The division that has hit all of society is now affecting the Appalachian Trail's society and culture.\"\n\nAnd he said that although his business has been devastated -- his application for government aid is in limbo, and he is only now cautiously reopening under state guidelines -- he did not regret raising an early alarm. \"It's hard to tell people that something they had planned for years, for the next six months of their lives, is impossible right now,\" he said. \"Don't shoot the messenger.\"\n\nSome hostels have tried to continue serving thru-hikers. David Magee, the owner of the Station at 19E in Roan Mountain, Tenn., said he has had hikers stranded from Europe and Hawaii.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\n\"What do I do? Close and go home while I've got these grubby hikers here?\" he said. \"I can't turn my back on hikers.\"\n\n\"It's a hard choice, it's like there is no good answer,\" he said.\n\nMany hikers, on and off the trail, suggested there was no right answer for everyone. Even those who disagreed with the conservancy's decision said they respected the organization and understood its leaders' rationale.\n\n\"They had to cover themselves and do something,\" said a thru-hiker who asked to go by her trail name, Caboose, to avoid the backlash some hikers have experienced. \"The question everyone is asking themselves is what could the A.T.C. have done to make sure that we could still have the hikers and still have the distancing. I don't know.\"\n\nUltimately, she said, she and her sister decided to start hiking this month. \"We're doing it for us,\" she said.\n\nDavid Chandler, a 39-year-old thru-hiker, said that most hikers he encountered had stayed for \"a spiritual journey\" and were trying to act responsibly by wearing masks in towns and minimizing time off the trail. \"No one's out here wanting to violate federal law. We want to walk through the parks,\" he said from a hostel near Pearisburg, Va.\n\nHikers described the experience of the trail this year as sometimes moving, sometimes unnerving and often eerily quiet. \"There are many day hikers and a few long section and thru-hikers, but the trails seem empty,\" said a hiker who goes by Triton. \"The bears don't seem to mind.\"\n\nBut while it can be a relief to find room in a shelter at the end of the day, many hikers also miss forming bonds with others traveling in their \"bubbles.\" Trail Days, the festival in Damascus, Va., that draws tens of thousands of people every ear, was canceled. For many who went home or never started out this year, a route emptied out of thru-hikers was also drained of the generous community and \"trail magic\" they were searching for.\n\nMark Waligora, 51, had quit his job of almost three decades to hike the trail, \"refocus with people again and be more connected with nature.\" The pandemic scuttled his plans. As the weeks passed, he realized that in addition to the safety risks, \"it would not have been the experience I wanted, having all these international folks from all walks of life and all the great states.\"\n\nStill, he said he would not judge the people who carried on. \"I wish people listened to the A.T.C., but if people decided to stay, then by all means I hope they're being safe. Personally, I don't know what to believe, what's right or wrong in relation to Covid,\" he said.\n\n\"Hike your own hike, you know?\"",

Apple's Group FaceTime is also free, and allows up to 32 people, but guests must have an Apple device (an iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch) to join.\n\nDepending on the service you use, you may be able to preserve the video on the platform or on YouTube -- enabling you and your guests to watch it in the future at any time.\n\nWork Out the Logistics\n\n\"There's a lot that goes into livestreaming a wedding,\" said Caroline Creidenberg, the founder and chief executive of Wedfuly, a Denver-based online wedding planning company. \"It's not as simple as pressing a button and letting the camera roll.\"\n\nJolie Behrns-Vitale, 35, and Brad Kelly, 36, who livestreamed a wedding ceremony at their home in Detroit, invited guests to join their celebration via livestream using the Joy app. They married March 28 after canceling their wedding, which was scheduled for the same date, at an art gallery in the city. The couple encountered technical issues during their livestream. \"Zoom has a 40-minute timeout when you use the free version, so we did the first half of our wedding ceremony and right when I was about to say my vows everyone got kicked off,\" said Ms. Behrns-Vitale, a data analytics director at a retail company. \"We were able to get everyone back on fairly quickly, but it wasn't the smoothest transition.\"\n\nTo avoid technology hiccups, Ms. Creidenberg suggests couples ask someone to manage their livestream and oversee tasks such as muting guests while the couple exchanges vows. \"We run a rehearsal the morning of or the day before the ceremony so that couples can make sure their camera is set up properly and the audio is working correctly,\" she said.\n\nHelp for the Technologically Challenged\n\nFor couples who aren't tech savvy, or who don't want to deal with the hassle of handling technical issues during their ceremony, Mr. Joshi suggests they assign a person to help set up the livestream, ensure it runs smoothly, troubleshoot any issues and answer questions from guests.\n\nWedfuly, which partnered with Zoom in March to provide a virtual wedding option for its customers, offers a free virtual coordinator to take on such duties. \"This person should be making sure everyone is muted and unmuted when they need to be,\" Ms. Creidenberg said. In addition, they can play music, videos, or slides, said, and \"they can act as M.C. and tech support during the call so that if any issues do come up, the guests can contact this person instead of the couple or the family.\"\n\nTo avoid any issues, Jenn Philippon and Spencer Booth, both 25 of Columbus, Ohio, opted to have Wedfuly handle their upcoming wedding.\n\nThe couple had planned to marry April 18 at the White Dove Barn in Beech Grove, Tenn. At first they postponed their wedding until June 12, 2021, because of the coronavirus outbreak. But after seeing a few virtual wedding ceremonies posted on Instagram and Facebook, they had a change of heart and decided to exchange their vows on their original wedding date on the campus of Ohio State University in Columbus, where they met in 2015 as students. Although campus buildings are closed to the public, campus grounds remain open, allowing the couple to host their small ceremony there.\n\n\"After we say our vows we're going to do our first dance, a toast, and a cake cutting,\" said Ms. Philippon, a pharmacist.\n\nA minister and the couple's immediate family attended the wedding in person and more than 200 people joined via Zoom, \"which is more than the 180 guests we were planning to have at our wedding, because some of our friends will be sharing the link with their parents or siblings or people who weren't going to attend the wedding,\" said Mr. Booth, a forensic accountant.\n\nSpread the Word\n\n\"When you livestream your wedding, you can invite a lot more friends and family to join you without having to break the bank,\" said Mr. Joshi, who recommends couples consider expanding their guest list. Send an electronic invite to guests to let them know when you plan to livestream the event. \"You can also announce the date and time on your social media,\" Mr. Joshi said.\n\nPro tip: Make sure your event is password protected to prevent uninvited users from crashing the party. (Reports of \"Zoombombing,\" where online users break into Zoom meetings, have emerged in recent weeks.)\n\n[Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.]\n\nSet the Stage\n\nCreating a backdrop that captures your style can make your virtual ceremony feel more personal. Ms. Kohanzadeh and Mr. Saadat, who got married at the home of the bride's parents in Beverly Hills, Calif., set up a huppah near the swimming pool. \"We built it ourselves out of PVC pipes we bought at Home Depot, and we used Scotch tape to attach flowers,\" Mr. Saadat said. \"We're Persian Jews, and it was really important to us to incorporate some of our religious traditions.\" (The couple also signed a ketubah, a Jewish marriage contract.)\n\nNeed some design inspiration? Strategically placed flowers or candles can transform a backyard or a room into a beautiful setting for a wedding, Ms. Creidenberg said.\n\nPosition the Device\n\nYou don't need to purchase expensive equipment to set up a livestream, Mr. Joshi said. \"Select your personal device with the highest quality camera, whether it's a laptop, smartphone or tablet,\" he said.\n\nMr. Joshi suggests buying an inexpensive tripod to safely position your device to help provide a steady shot. For optimal audio, find a quiet space away from loud background noise. Your device's built-in microphone will typically suffice, Mr. Joshi said, \"but adding an external microphone will improve your audio quality and is relatively inexpensive, with several options available under the $50 mark.\" But he added: \"If you are livestreaming in an outdoor location, such as your backyard, a microphone is a worthwhile investment.\"\n\nTo ensure your livestream is well lit, \"consider the time of day of your ceremony and find the spot in your house with the best lighting at that time,\" Mr. Joshi said. Also, avoid direct overhead lights, which can cause shadows.\n\n\"Another important pre-livestream step is to make sure you have a strong Wi-Fi signal,\" Mr. Joshi said. He recommends checking the internet speed using www.speedtest.net.\n\nIt's also important to consider how your camera is positioned. \"We recommend flipping the phone to be horizontal so that the guests have a wider view,\" Ms. Creidenberg said.\n\nMake it Interactive\n\nAlthough your guests will be tuning in remotely, they can still take part in the festivities. For instance, you can ask virtual attendees to make cocktails at home and share a toast with you, or encourage people to wear black-tie attire.\n\nAnother way to engage your audience is to unmute their audio and ask them to recite a prayer or sing a song that's meaningful to you. And, depending on what service you're using to livestream your wedding, guests may be able to post comments during the event and express their well wishes.\n\nSave Something Special for Later\n\nIf you're planning on having a larger wedding celebration with guests down the road, consider saving something special for the event.\n\n\"I didn't wear my wedding dress,\" Ms. Behrns-Vitale said. \"I wore a white-laced shirt I bought on Amazon. We figured we would save my wedding dress and Brad's suit for our real wedding, which we're planning to have in October.\"\n\nContinue following our fashion and lifestyle coverage on Facebook (Styles and Modern Love), Twitter (Styles, Fashion and Weddings) and Instagram.",

        "body": "Volume is not the only measure to consider. Duration also contributes to damage to our kids' ears.\n\nChildren glued to their headphones. It's a familiar scene these days.\n\nLauren Breeze of Nashville finds her 15-year-old son, Declan, wearing headphones all day. \"He has always been a big music fan, but this is new since we have been home in quarantine. It's almost like he has to have a soundtrack to his life.\"\n\nHer attitude: Anything to make it through the day. \"I haven't tried to get him to stop, especially now that things are so different,\" she said. \"Before, he didn't walk around the house like this.\"\n\nWith more families squeezed together for longer periods of time during the coronavirus pandemic, there's more of a need for one's own listening space. But lengthy listening on headphones or earbuds can be harmful. And volume is only part of the equation.\n\nIt's noise dose that is significant, or roughly the duration times the volume. As one increases, the other should decrease.\n\nWithout proper safety measures, children could end up with hearing loss, communication difficulties and distressing symptoms of ear-ringing, aural fullness, sensitivity and pain.\n\n\"We have done an atrocious job of teaching people to value their hearing,\" said Brian Fligor, Ph.D., a pediatric audiologist in Boston.\n\nDana Dinerman of San Diego often reminds her 8-year-old son, Patrick, to keep his headphone volume low. (Her mother, a former aerobics instructor who taught classes to loud music, wears hearing aids.)\n\n\"People are more worried about social media, video games and screen time,\" Dinerman said. \"The doctor gives you a checklist: Does anybody smoke in the house? How much TV does he watch? What kind of food is he eating? But they never ask about headphones or volume or anything like that.\"\n\nShe is also concerned about her 10-year-old nephew, who wears his headphones constantly while playing video games. The volume is so loud that, \"if you ask him a question, he can't hear,\" she said.\n\nWith kids inclined to listen with headphones for longer periods of time these days, we asked some experts about safe listening habits.\n\nAre headphones made for children safe?\n\nNot necessarily. Children's headphones are generally capped at 85 decibels, which helps. But there's more to it.\n\n\"Treating 85 decibels as a safe level makes no sense at all,\" said Rick Neitzel, Ph.D., an associate professor of environmental health sciences at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"Exposure is not just intensity -- it is also how long it lasts and how frequently it occurs,\" he said. \"Ignoring the time is missing the point. This 85-decibel number has achieved mythical status not because it is safe but because it is one of the few ways that occupational noise is regulated.\"\n\nWhat's more, some children's headphones -- the ones with volume limits touting their safety -- are marketed as having comfortable ear pads and a long battery life, so children can rock all day long. \"It is totally conflicting messaging,\" Dr. Neitzel said.\n\nTurning up a favorite song is fine. It's constant exposure to much lower volumes that people don't realize is so damaging.\n\nSo what is a safe amount of listening?\n\nThere is no one-size-fits-all answer. If forced to put numbers on such a complex concept, a safe limit for most headphone users for an unlimited amount of listening is 70 decibels, said Drs. Neitzel and Fligor, who published a recent paper on recreational sound exposure.\n\nBoth are consultants to the World Health Organization's Make Listening Safe program, an initiative to raise awareness about noise-induced hearing damage.\n\nFor eight hours of daily exposure to noise, a \"more liberal\" limit is 83 decibels, but 75 decibels is a \"realistic compromise.\"\n\nThere is no need to suck the joy out of music. \"When you impose some draconian maximum, you turn people off from what is an otherwise well-considered message,\" Dr. Fligor said.\n\nFor comparison, 70 decibels is the whir of a small canister vacuum and 85 is a powerful upright vacuum.\n\nNoise, however, is not always steady. It includes peaks and troughs, as well as factors such as frequency, harmonics and reverberation.\n\nFurthermore, noise exposure is cumulative. If a headphone-loving child also practices the drums, mows the lawn or bangs on pots and pans every night at 7, the day's noise dose soars. (For those activities, experts advise protective earmuffs. Earplugs can work for older children, but they are not especially user-friendly and they pose a choking hazard for young ones.)\n\nAn unknown factor is individual susceptibility. It's impossible to predict whose ears are tough and whose are tender.\n\n\"The same noise dose has no apparent impact on some and a life-altering impact on others,\" said Bryan Pollard, president of the nonprofit Hyperacusis Research, which funds research about noise-induced pain.\n\nDamage from constant low-level noise builds up with little warning. People must decide for themselves how much risk they are comfortable with.\n\nHow do we know if we are damaging our ears?\n\nIt is often hard to tell until it is too late.\n\n\"A change in auditory perception can be gradual or sudden,\" Pollard said. \"You never know which exposure will be the straw that breaks the camel's back.\"\n\nHearing loss doesn't mean things sound softer. It means that communicating is more challenging -- people can hear but they can't understand. Speech sounds muffled; music sounds dull. Conversations turn from effortless to burdensome.\n\nThen there is tinnitus, the ear-ringing that affects 10 to 20 percent of the population. It generally takes less noise exposure to cause tinnitus than to cause hearing loss. \"Tinnitus is much more troublesome to people,\" Dr. Neitzel said. It is often accompanied by a feeling of pressure or clogging called aural fullness.\n\nEven more crippling is hyperacusis, a sensitivity that makes environmental sounds seem uncomfortably loud and can progress to a point where the clanking of dishes at mealtime causes lingering ear pain.\n\nWhat can parents and children do to make listening safer?\n\nParents should check that they can't hear sound leaking from their child's headphones. They should also check the volume periodically or use locking controls. And the child should be able to hear when spoken to. Kids should also take breaks from listening.\n\nNoise-canceling headphones, though pricey, are good for eliminating background noise, like during a car ride, so the child can hear clearly without raising the volume. Such headphones should not be confused with volume-limiting headphones or noise-blocking earmuffs, which are different technologies used for different purposes.\n\nDr. Fligor also suggests that a child's hearing be tested at least every three years. A standard audiogram and a speech-in-noise test can catch future problems. Parents might also note whether a child says \"what?\" too often.\n\nAny ear symptoms are serious -- ringing, muffling, fullness, fluttering, thumping, sensitivity, distortion, pain -- even if temporary. \"They mean you have had a warning shot to your hearing,\" Dr. Fligor said. \"Hearing can be taken away fairly easily, and there is no fix for that.\"",

        "body": "It's normal to feel a sense of hopelessness and loneliness in these times. But there are proven and proactive ways for you to get through it.\n\n\"When will this end? And if it ever does, will I be OK?!\"\n\nThese are the questions patients in my therapy practice are asking, and I can't emphasize enough that it's normal to feel anxious now. The risk of developing a life-threatening illness alongside the loss of the things that usually anchor us is a brutal one-two-punch that would leave anyone feeling on edge.\n\nHow you handle stress makes a difference in how you ultimately cope. You can create positive habits and reduce response patterns that predict post-traumatic stress disorder, in which a terrifying event leads to symptoms such as disturbing flashbacks and severe anxiety. Unfortunately, we can't will away sadness and fear. Living through such emotions without exacerbating your pain and suffering takes skill.\n\nThe hopeful truth is that there are proven steps you can practice to improve your emotional health during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAppreciate your innate resilience\n\nHere's a comforting thought in these dark days. For most of us, \"the most common response to trauma is resilience,\" said Dr. Denise Sloan, a professor in psychiatry at Boston University and associate director of the National Center for PTSD. In fact, the overwhelming majority of people who endure a life-threatening event recover on their own and never meet criteria for PTSD.\n\nWhen my patients ask me whether things will get better for them, I tell them that trusting they will recover increases their chances of doing so. Expecting the worst actually predicts heightened risk of PTSD, and my clients often notice that they cope with challenges better than they imagine they will. So, I motivate them, as I encourage you, to expand their perspective and consider how they've managed during stressful times in the past, and to revisit this reminder of their strength when they're feeling shaky.\n\nFor those who are struggling more profoundly: Research shows that even the most intense feelings of hopelessness eventually pass, especially when you strategize ways to feel better.\n\nPurposefully increase your well-being\n\n\"If you are obsessed with this pandemic, you need to find ways to distract yourself,\" recommends Dr. Edna Foa, a professor in psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and one of the world's leading experts in anxiety and trauma. \"We are in the middle of the trauma, not post-stress,\" she said, highlighting that during a crisis we need to take breaks to soothe ourselves. One study even found that playing Tetris in the emergency room after a car accident appeared to reduce the development of traumatic memories.\n\nWhile it's normal to get hijacked by bad news, add positive activities to your routine to offset the pain. Do something you'd normally do if you were feeling optimistic (without turning it into a negative, like bingeing on a new show and losing sleep). While this might simply feel like another chore, engrossing yourself in something you once enjoyed and practicing gratitude improve well-being and resilience in a crisis.\n\nOf course, this advice may sound dismissive if a loved one is sick, or you are in financial crisis. But as A.J. Jacobs, author of \"Thanks a Thousand,\" has written, you can override your negativity bias by slowing down to notice, appreciate and give thanks. That could mean taking a moment to reflect on all the people who've provided the dinner on your table, from the farmer to the delivery person. Not only will gratitude offer you a break from your worries, it also helps others. (And remember to tip generously and if you can, donate to those struggling.)\n\nConnect and share\n\nAnother key resource now, and always, is perceived social support -- the feeling that we can all get through this together. We are all part of a global community going through the same thing at the same time, a rare occurrence in itself. To experience a sense of community, watch clips of people worldwide cheering for health care workers. Confide in others about what you are experiencing and ask others to share in return. Feeling connected protects against PTSD.\n\n\"People need to talk to one another, especially if you are seeing horrible things,\" Dr. Foa said.\n\nIf, like so many, you are feeling lonely, it may help to think about your support system more broadly, from the friend who texted you to your neighbors. Participating in a group wellness activity, like virtual mindfulness talks or fitness classes can also improve your sense of connection and mood.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Disease modelers find that tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented with earlier lockdowns. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Scientists express cautious optimism about developing a vaccine quickly. See more updates Updated 15m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAnd if you need professional help, there are experts to consult, especially if you believe you are struggling with a psychological disorder. Therapy can make a difference without taking too long.\n\nNotice your narrative\n\nThoughts powerfully impact your feelings, so much so that your beliefs predict your risk of PTSD. Look out for self-blaming thoughts, like criticizing yourself for not having more in your savings account to prepare for layoffs, or, for medical professionals, faulting themselves for not being able to optimally care for everyone. Beating yourself up will only leave you feeling tortured.\n\nAlso observe judgments that supercharge your stress, like, \"I can't take it,\" and shift into a more encouraging mind-set.\n\nOne way to move away from negative thoughts is to ask yourself, \"Is this helpful?\" Self-compassion is a meaningful way to cope with pain and while you're at it, let go of judging others. Studies show that doing so can significantly reduce loneliness.\n\nBreakup with overthinking\n\nDo you feel compelled to review details of an upsetting experience over and over again? Ruminating is a mental habit where you repeatedly think about \"why?\" and \"what if?\" in a way that doesn't inspire problem solving as much as it leaves you feeling stuck.\n\nIf you struggle with these mental loops, now is a great time to work on your exit plan.\n\nOne landmark study, which began several weeks before the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake in California, found that ruminating predicted depression and stress symptoms after the trauma, even more so than being personally affected by the disaster. And not only is overthinking a risk factor for depression and PTSD, it also affects your ability to benefit from treatment.\n\nTo process thoughts about the pandemic that replay in your mind, one option is to put your concerns on paper. Expressive writing is one way to reflect without ruminating.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nAnother technique, especially when your thoughts aren't useful, is to engage in mentally absorbing activities, like listening to your favorite playlist while doing burpees; working on a crossword puzzle; or grounding yourself by noticing three sights, three sounds and three sensations in your environment, again and again. When ruminating starts catch it and exchange it for gratitude.\n\nAnother way to think of it: If a friend were going on and on in a way that was obviously making her suffer, you'd steer her in another direction, right?\n\nChoose courage over avoidance\n\nIt is instinctive to want to avoid negative emotions, but you also don't want to suppress or push them away. Instead, notice your emotions, specify how you feel and respond with kindness.\n\nPracticing mindfulness and viewing your experience with perspective helps you create a healthy relationship with your thoughts. Try to observe unhelpful judgments before compassionately letting them go, the same way a spam filter sorts junk messages.\n\nUltimately, it's key to balance accepting difficult feelings, without multiplying them, while increasing your emotional immune system. Later, when this ends, if you find yourself becoming what Dr. Foa described as a \"super avoider\" -- someone who tries to escape thoughts and situations that are no longer harmful -- remember that it's important to face your fears.\n\nDr. Natalia Garcia, a psychologist in Seattle and trauma researcher, who is uniquely empathic to the plight of trauma, has used her own expertise to cope with the sudden death of her 2-year-old son. She initially struggled to watch videos of him, but after giving herself a grace period where she focused on getting through each day, she was able to return to those clips. Today, she is surprised by how much she cherishes them. \"The only thing worse than losing him would be also losing the memory of him,\" Dr. Garcia said.\n\nShe added: \"I can't say I emerged from the ashes of despair into some majestic phoenix, but I do believe I have experienced growth with exercised intentionality around not letting tragedy be the end all of my story.\"\n\nLike Dr. Garcia, you can also increase your sense of control by reflecting on what matters most to you. Cultivating a strong sense of purpose based on what you value, and using that to figure out your next steps can give you a feeling of possibility, increasing both your physical strength and emotional recovery. And don't we all need a sense of possibility right about now?\n\nJennifer Taitz is an assistant clinical professor in psychiatry at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of \"How to be Single and Happy: Science-Based Strategies for Keeping Your Sanity While Looking for a Soul Mate\" and \"End Emotional Eating.\"",

        "body": "It is understandable if the coronavirus pandemic has put you in a funk, but depression should be evaluated and treated.\n\nFor quite a while after it hit, life wasn't bad. I had a job, at least, and was buoyed by family togetherness, by connecting and reconnecting virtually with friends. By the sensation of living through history. By walks in the park, observing fellow New Yorkers trying to fortify themselves, like I was.\n\nThe last few weeks have been much harder. We're holed up in Manhattan, the future a fog without end. The days bleed together. Why get up? Easier to work from bed, especially as I'm tired and sleep deprived. Why reaffirm connection when I can scroll internet memes? And family members, can't they take care of themselves?\n\nI know these aren't ideal coping patterns. I've struggled with them before. They're harbingers of depression, described by William Styron, author of Sophie's Choice, as a storm of murk. In ordinary times, clinical depression, often believed to have biological underpinnings, is not uncommon. In 2017, the last year for which statistics are available, 17.3 million, or about 7 percent of American adults (twice as many women as men) experienced it.\n\nBut these aren't ordinary days; rather the state of affairs is a veritable petri dish for brewing depressive symptoms (sadness, insomnia, irritability, exhaustion, under- or overeating, trouble concentrating). We're locked in, some of us alone or in very stressful conditions. Tens of millions have lost livelihoods, and many are grieving friends or family. Normal outlets for rejuvenation -- gym workouts, vacations, church, office banter, drinks with friends -- are often unavailable. We can't necessarily make routine health care appointments either.\n\nThere's already evidence that growing numbers of people are depressed. From Feb. 16 to March 15 the number of antidepressant prescriptions filled in the United States rose by 18.6 percent. A University of Michigan survey of some 460 people, conducted in mid-April, found 33.6 percent of respondents reported symptoms of major depression, including fatigue, insomnia and feelings of hopelessness.\n\nEven so, mental health specialists are reluctant to label what people are experiencing as depression, in the usual sense.\n\n\"I don't know anyone right now that's not having depression-like symptoms,\" said Luana Marques, a psychologist at Harvard Medical School and the president of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America. \"It's hard to keep going when our brains are constantly on fight or flight. It makes people really tired. If you're having trouble concentrating or getting out of bed, it's not abnormal. It's an evolutionary response to a threat.\"\n\nCraig Sawchuk, a psychologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., agreed. \"One concept that fits is depressive realism,\" he said. \"It's not necessarily that we're overexaggerating. An unusual set of circumstances calls for an unusual way of responding and interpreting. We have to accept this is a really difficult, in some cases, a tragic situation.\"\n\nBut that doesn't mean we should give in and suffer. Depression, no matter its provenance, hurts, stoking feelings of worthlessness and siphoning pleasure. It can lead to complications like substance abuse, relationship conflicts, or at the extreme, suicide. Some 60 percent of those who take their lives are depressed. The earlier we intervene on our own -- or someone else's -- behalf, the better.\n\n\"We don't know how long this pandemic will go on,\" said Dr. Neil Greenberg, a psychiatrist at King's College London, who studies how disasters affect mental health. \"What you shouldn't do is just cross your fingers and hope. The nip-it-in-the-bud approach is absolutely what we should all be doing. Otherwise your mental health could spiral down.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Modelers find that tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Scientists express cautious optimism about developing a vaccine quickly. See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nFamiliarize yourself with depression's physical and mental markers. Or take a self-diagnostic test. When depression isn't severe, a self-care routine may be enough, said Dr. Joshua Gordon, director of the National Institute of Mental Health.\n\n\"If you're just feeling a little down, maybe having some trouble sleeping but functioning well, there are things you can do such as exercise, social contact, getting regular sleep cycles and eating healthy,\" Dr. Gordon said. \"Put those together and you've got a generally good program to stave off mild depressive symptoms.\"\n\nFind workouts to do at home, if need be. Ask others to hold you to routines. Or seek virtual support: online forums and apps exist for anything you're struggling with, whether it's poor eating habits or lack of sleep. At first it may seem you're going through the motions. But you're creating a feedback loop, in which taking action improves mood, allowing you to follow up with things to improve mood even more.\n\n\"I think about my car battery,\" Dr. Marques said. \"I have to drive it to recharge it, there's no other way. Our bodies are similar. You have to spend energy to feel better.\"\n\nFor some people, though, self care alone won't work. Perhaps you're already prone to depression. Maybe you've been hit by major loss or financial hardship. Front line workers are at higher risk for depression; a study showed more than 20 percent of health care workers at a Chinese hospital still had significant depressive symptoms three years after the SARS outbreak. Last month, two New York City emergency responders died by suicide, days apart.\n\n\"If you really can't sleep, your appetite is changing, you can't function, can't work, can't take care of your kids or can't grocery shop, that's a sign you need professional help,\" Dr. Gordon said. \"If you're wondering, 'Why should I get out of bed or reach out for help?' those very questions are symptoms of your disorder.\"\n\nMedication and psychotherapy combined are typically considered today's treatment gold standard, though each can work alone. No single antidepressant is a panacea and not all therapists are equally effective.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\n\"Look for evidence-based psychotherapy,\" Dr. Marques advised. \"Interview your therapist. Don't work with someone you feel doesn't have the skills.\"\n\nYour primary care doctor can connect you to specialists; the Anxiety and Depression Association of America has a therapist locator. Most psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers have migrated to telemedicine. Many states are allowing Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement for mental health services during the pandemic; resources are available for those in financial distress. You can call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the suicide prevention line, or use the Crisis Text Line.\n\nThink you should be able to bootstrap it alone? In such stressful conditions, go easy on yourself.\n\n\"You're human and this takes a toll,\" said Dr. Sawchuk. \"Look at your mental and emotional health just like part of your health, like diabetes. There are things you can do to feel better when you're diabetic. This is important, too.\"\n\nDepression can be a wily beast. In my case, it makes me lethargic, self-isolating and grouchy. Banish it one day -- it's back the next. I've long taken antidepressants, so no change there. But if I push myself to take a walk, FaceTime a friend or tidy the house, almost without fail I feel better, able to envision a day when we will emerge from the fog. I'm more hopeful, the opposite of depressed. Add one small triumph to the daily tally sheet.\n\nMost experts expect to see rates of depression and other psychological disorders increase in the coming months, as the pandemic continues. And yet, a majority of those who seek treatment for depression will improve if they persist.\n\n\"When we look back at natural disasters or wartime, when really bad things happened on a grand scale, the majority of people didn't get stuck,\" Dr. Sawchuk told me. \"They didn't end up with clinical anxiety or depression. Resiliency is our natural trajectory. It doesn't mean we're unscathed or that we bounce back to exactly where we were, prestressor. But we can get to a better place than we're at right at the moment.\"",

        "body": "By The New York Times News Service Syndicate | wordpress@medianewsgroup.com |\n\nAccording to historians, pandemics typically have two types of endings: the medical, which occurs when the incidence and death rates plummet, and the social, when the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes.\n\n\"When people ask, 'When will this end?,' they are asking about the social ending,\" said Dr. Jeremy Greene, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkins.\n\nIn other words, an end can occur not because a disease has been vanquished but because people grow tired of panic mode and learn to live with a disease. Allan Brandt, a Harvard historian, said something similar was happening with COVID-19: \"As we have seen in the debate about opening the economy, many questions about the so-called end are determined not by medical and public health data but by sociopolitical processes.\"\n\nEndings \"are very, very messy,\" said Dora Vargha, a historian at the University of Exeter. \"Looking back, we have a weak narrative. For whom does the epidemic end, and who gets to say?\"\n\nAn epidemic of fear can occur even without an epidemic of illness. Dr. Susan Murray, of the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, saw that firsthand in 2014 when she was a fellow at a rural hospital in Ireland.\n\nIn the preceding months, more than 11,000 people in West Africa had died from Ebola, a terrifying viral disease that was highly infectious and often fatal. The epidemic seemed to be waning, and no cases had occurred in Ireland, but the public fear was palpable.\n\n\"On the street and on the wards, people are anxious,\" Murray recalled recently in an article in The New England Journal of Medicine. \"Having the wrong color skin is enough to earn you the side-eye from your fellow passengers on the bus or train. Cough once, and you will find them shuffling away from you.\"\n\nThe Dublin hospital workers were warned to prepare for the worst. They were terrified and worried that they lacked protective equipment. When a young man arrived in the emergency room from a country with Ebola patients, no one wanted to go near him; nurses hid, and doctors threatened to leave the hospital.\n\nMurray alone dared treat him, she wrote, but his cancer was so advanced that all she could offer was comfort care. A few days later, tests confirmed that the man did not have Ebola; he died an hour later. Three days afterward, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola epidemic over.\n\nMurray wrote, \"If we are not prepared to fight fear and ignorance as actively and as thoughtfully as we fight any other virus, it is possible that fear can do terrible harm to vulnerable people, even in places that never see a single case of infection during an outbreak. And a fear epidemic can have far worse consequences when complicated by issues of race, privilege and language.\"\n\nBubonic plague has struck several times in the past 2,000 years, killing millions of people and altering the course of history. Each epidemic amplified the fear that came with the next outbreak.\n\nThe disease is caused by a strain of bacteria, Yersinia pestis, that lives on fleas that live on rats. But bubonic plague, which became known as the Black Death, also can be passed from infected person to infected person through respiratory droplets, so it cannot be eradicated simply by killing rats.\n\nHistorians describe three great waves of plague, said Mary Fissell, a historian at Johns Hopkins: the Plague of Justinian, in the sixth century; the medieval epidemic, in the 14th century; and a pandemic that struck in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nThe medieval pandemic began in 1331 in China. The illness, along with a civil war that was raging at the time, killed half the population of China. From there, the plague moved along trade routes to Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. In the years between 1347 and 1351, it killed at least one-third of the European population. Half the population of Siena, Italy, died.\n\n\"It is impossible for the human tongue to recount the awful truth,\" wrote 14th-century chronicler Agnolo di Tura. \"Indeed, one who did not see such horribleness can be called blessed.\" The infected, he wrote, \"swell beneath the armpits and in their groins and fall over while talking.\" The dead were buried in pits, in piles.\n\nIn Florence, Italy, wrote Giovanni Boccaccio, \"No more respect was accorded to dead people than would nowadays be accorded to dead goats.\" Some hid in their homes. Others refused to accept the threat. Their way of coping, Boccaccio wrote, was to \"drink heavily, enjoy life to the full, go round singing and merrymaking, and gratify all of one's cravings when the opportunity emerged, and shrug the whole thing off as one enormous joke.\"\n\nThat pandemic ended, but the plague recurred. One of the worst outbreaks began in China in 1855 and spread worldwide, killing more than 12 million in India alone. Health authorities in Mumbai, India, burned whole neighborhoods trying to rid them of the plague. \"Nobody knew if it made a difference,\" Yale historian Frank Snowden said.\n\nIt is not clear what made the bubonic plague die down. Some scholars have argued that cold weather killed the disease-carrying fleas, but that would not have interrupted the spread by the respiratory route, Snowden noted.\n\nOr perhaps it was a change in the rats. By the 19th century, the plague was being carried not by black rats but by brown rats, which are stronger, more vicious and more likely to live apart from humans.\n\n\"You certainly wouldn't want one for a pet,\" Snowden said.\n\nAnother hypothesis is that the bacterium evolved to be less deadly. Or maybe actions by humans, such as the burning of villages, helped quell the epidemic.\n\nThe plague never really went away. In the United States, infections are endemic among prairie dogs in the Southwest and can be transmitted to people. Snowden said that one of his friends became infected after a stay at a hotel in New Mexico. The previous occupant of his room had a dog, which had fleas that carried the microbe.\n\nSuch cases are rare and can now be successfully treated with antibiotics, but any report of a case of the plague stirs up fear.\n\nAmong the diseases to have achieved a medical end is smallpox. But it is exceptional for several reasons: There is an effective vaccine, which gives lifelong protection; the virus, Variola minor, has no animal host, so eliminating the disease in humans meant total elimination; and its symptoms are so unusual that infection is obvious, allowing for effective quarantines and contact tracing.\n\nBut while it still raged, smallpox was horrific. Epidemic after epidemic swept the world for at least 3,000 years. Individuals infected with the virus developed a fever, then a rash that turned into pus-filled spots, which became encrusted and fell off, leaving scars. The disease killed 3 out of 10 of its victims, often after immense suffering.\n\nIn 1633, an epidemic among Native Americans \"disrupted all the native communities in the northeast and certainly facilitated English settlement in Massachusetts,\" said Harvard historian David Jones. William Bradford, leader of the Plymouth colony, wrote an account of the disease in Native Americans, saying the broken pustules would effectively glue a patient's skin to the mat he lay on, only to be torn off. Bradford wrote, \"When they turn them, a whole side will flay off at once as it were, and they will be all of a gore blood, most fearful to behold.\"\n\nThe last person to contract smallpox naturally was Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Somalia, in 1977. He recovered, only to die of malaria in 2013.\n\nThe 1918 flu is held up today as the example of the ravages of a pandemic and the value of quarantines and social distancing. Before it ended, the flu killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide. It preyed on young to middle-aged adults -- orphaning children, depriving families of breadwinners, killing troops in the midst of World War I.\n\nIn the autumn of 1918, William Vaughan, a prominent doctor, was dispatched to Camp Devens near Boston to report on a flu that was raging there. He saw \"hundreds of stalwart young men in the uniform of their country, coming into the wards of the hospital in groups of 10 or more,\" he wrote. \"They are placed on the cots until every bed is full, yet others crowd in. Their faces soon wear a bluish cast; a distressing cough brings up bloodstained sputum. In the morning the dead bodies are stacked up in the morgue like cord wood.\"\n\nThe virus, he wrote, \"demonstrated the inferiority of human inventions in the destruction of human life.\"\n\nAfter sweeping through the world, that flu faded away, evolving into a variant of the more benign flu that comes around every year.\n\n\"Maybe it was like a fire that, having burned the available and easily accessible wood, burns down,\" Snowden said.\n\nIt ended socially, too. World War I was over; people were ready for a fresh start, a new era, and eager to put the nightmare of disease and war behind them. Until recently, the 1918 flu was largely forgotten.\n\nOther flu pandemics followed -- none so bad, but all nonetheless sobering. In the Hong Kong flu of 1968, 1 million people died worldwide, including 100,000 in the United States, mostly people older than 65. That virus still circulates as a seasonal flu, and its initial path of destruction -- and the fear that went with it -- is rarely recalled.\n\nWill that happen with COVID-19?\n\nOne possibility, historians say, is that the coronavirus pandemic could end socially before it ends medically. People may grow so tired of the restrictions that they declare the pandemic over, even as the virus continues to smolder in the population and before a vaccine or effective treatment is found.\n\n\"I think there is this sort of social psychological issue of exhaustion and frustration,\" Yale historian Naomi Rogers said. \"We may be in a moment when people are just saying, 'That's enough. I deserve to be able to return to my regular life.'\"\n\nIt is happening already; in some states, governors have lifted restrictions, allowing hair salons, nail salons and gyms to reopen, in defiance of warnings by public health officials that such steps are premature. As the economic catastrophe wreaked by the lockdowns grows, more and more people may be ready to say \"enough.\"\n\n\"There is this sort of conflict now,\" Rogers said. Public health officials have a medical end in sight, but some members of the public see a social end.\n\n\"Who gets to claim the end?\" Rogers said. \"If you push back against the notion of its ending, what are you pushing back against? What are you claiming when you say, 'No, it is not ending.'\"\n\nThe challenge, Brandt said, is that there will be no sudden victory. Trying to define the end of the pandemic \"will be a long and difficult process.\"",

During the day, many rest at their hotels, amid darkened Broadway marquees, quiet streets and boarded up shops. At night, they face crowded hospital corridors, panicked patients and strained intensive care units.\n\nAnd death.\n\n\"I have never seen patients so sick before,'' said Tamara Williams, a 40-year-old nurse from Dallas. \"And dying, despite everything that we're doing.\"\n\nEven as the daily death toll has fallen in recent weeks, the coronavirus is still spreading.

And, as nurses around her developed symptoms, she feared her own exposure to the virus.\n\nDuring a recent shift, Ms. Williams saw nurses huddled in hospital corridors, sobbing, after a colleague they had been treating died from Covid-19. \"I see them crying over this person they worked with for so long, and I'm just imagining my own people back home,\" she said, breaking into tears.\n\nHeather Smith from Topsail Island, off the coast of North Carolina, who is working at Elmhurst Hospital Center in Queens, said that after seeing so many patients die, she wondered if she made a difference. \"Every day you go in and you're like, 'Can I do this for one more day? Why did I wake up?'\"\n\nAnother nurse, Maggie Scott of San Diego, 24, said she was in the wrenching position of having to arrange final FaceTime calls between dying patients and their family members -- not just once, but three times in a single shift. Molly Teeter from Magnet Cove, Ark. said that bodies sometimes remained in hospital rooms for hours before they could be taken to refrigerated trucks being used as makeshift morgues.\n\nJim Malatras, president of SUNY Empire State College who is assisting Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in New York's Covid-19 response, said the influx of nurses from outside the state had provided relief for hospitals, allowing them to rotate out exhausted health care workers.\n\nJoseph Moscola, senior vice president at Northwell Health, said the 500 out-of-state nurses -- from nearly every state -- who had been placed at the 23 hospitals throughout the health care network's system had been invaluable.\n\n\"It's been this infusion of energy,\" he said.\n\nBut nurses are exhausted.\n\nOlumide Peter Kolade, 30, who has worked 12-hours shifts for 34 of the past 36 days, said that for the first time in his life, he'd started to meditate, saying \"that kind of helps.\" He added that sticking to a routine has also helped: work, shower, talk to his family and watch TV -- anything but catching up on the news.\n\nSeveral nurses said that the cheers of support for health care workers at 7 p.m. heard across the city and the hot meals delivered to them by a charity had made them feel welcomed by New Yorkers. But others said there had been a bit of a culture clash between local nurses and those from other parts of the country.\n\n\"I come in a little loud and a little country,\" said Karma Johnson-Brown, a 49-year-old nurse from Houston. She tries to bring some spirit to the Susan Smith McKinney Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Brooklyn, where 17 residents have died from Covid-19. \"Every day, you have to put your game face on and start all over again,\" Ms. Johnson-Brown said.\n\nAnother nurse, Shameka Dugger from Fort Valley, Ga., says the other nurses have only just begun to warm up to her and make conversation when she says good morning. \"I guess the Southern hospitality is starting to rub off on them and everything, so the rudeness has calmed down some,\" Ms. Dugger, 39, said.\n\nA mother of six, Ms. Dugger said that when she explained to her children that she would be away for a long time, her 7-year-old said: \"'Mommy, you're going to be a unicorn super hero!' I was like yea, that's what I'm going to call myself.\"\n\nMs. Dugger, who had always wanted to visit New York, has managed to visit the Empire State Building, Madison Square Garden and Central Park. Still, she has found the city not as glamorous as she had imagined from the movies.\n\nEach morning, before she arrives at Jacobi Medical Center in the Bronx, she listens to gospel music and prays for the people of New York City. \"If you're not scared to be here, you're not human,\" she said.\n\nBut there were also some reasons to be hopeful. On Sunday, three patients were extubated, Ms. Dugger said. Every time this happens, the hospital plays Rachel Platten's pop hit \"Fight Song\" over the loudspeaker. \"It makes me cry,\" she said. \"I was like, 'Oh, Lord.' It's an awesome feeling.\"\n\nShe misses home and dreams of hugging and smelling her children, and cooking Southern food for them: fried chicken, collard greens and cornbread.\n\nNot yet, though. \"I'm not leaving until this is over,\" she said. \"I feel like it's my duty to stay here.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn 2016, Dr. David Hirsch, a maxillofacial surgeon, performed pro bono reconstructive surgery on Dustin E. Kirby, a Navy corpsman who had been struck in the face by a bullet while serving in a Marine Corps infantry battalion in Iraq in 2006. In March he contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. While recovering at home he shared the experience of his infection, and what he learned from it, by narrating to C.J. Chivers, who traced Dustin Kirby's medical journey in a book, \"The Fighters.\"\n\nWhen the coronavirus was spreading in China, Iran and Europe, Lenox Hill Hospital, where I'm the chief of maxillofacial surgery, was getting ready. I was impressed; they were on it. They were saying, \"The disease is coming and it is coming fast.\" Back then, only a few weeks ago, I would also look at the Johns Hopkins predictions about flattening the curve and how this was going to skyrocket, and say, \"No way that all of this is going to happen.\" I think now that every one of the predictions happened.\n\nElective surgery shut down on March 16. As a maxillofacial surgeon, I work on people's mouths, jaws and faces. To treat Covid-19 patients with respiratory disease, I was going to be a backup doctor, in reserve, for whenever the hospital needed me. I expected to go to one of three places: the emergency room, intensive care or an outpatient testing facility. In the beginning it was eerily quiet. Everybody was talking about this thing happening, but it was one or two patients being admitted. The next thing you know, within a week, it was more than 100 patients and people were talking about running out of equipment.\n\nI saw my last patient on March 13 and put myself and my family in complete lockdown in our house in Suffern, N.Y., where we live. I have three girls, 18, 15 and 12. They still had parties and bar mitzvahs to attend, but I told them early on that we were not going to see anybody. At first I told them, \"You can see one person each, but I want to talk with each person's family, to know what the risk factors are.\" But pretty soon, by March 15, I said: \"No, we're shutting this down. We're not seeing anyone else.\"\n\nWe were alone at home. I felt that sitting at home I was useless, so I started to go on a crusade to find personal protective equipment for people at the hospital. It became a hustling game. I put something on social media and see if people would do good for us. I received a reply, about an exterminator who might have some protective equipment, and I followed the lead and he said, \"I don't have N95 masks, but I have hazmat suits.\" And I said, \"Send me those.\" And then he knew another guy who had a couple of boxes of N95s, and I had them shipped to the hospital, care of the executive director.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Georgia moves ahead with some reopenings despite plenty of misgivings. Reopenings in several states on Friday offer the first wider test for the nation. The F.D.A. issued a warning against using anti-malaria drugs that Trump has touted. See more updates Updated 7m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nI was ready to be called in to help. Unfortunately that hasn't happened, because I got sick.\n\nOn Wednesday night, March 25, I woke in the middle of the night with wicked heartburn. I hadn't overeaten. I just woke up with heartburn. I hiccupped for four hours and had bad indigestion. The next morning I woke up and was really tired, and my G.I. was a little off. I must have cleared my throat about 800 times in an hour. Then it just hit. I went upstairs, because I was very, very sick: body aches, headache, fever, off-and-on sweating and chills, and the G.I. symptoms continued. For two days all these symptoms persisted, and I also had nausea and vomiting. In the back of my mind, though, I thought, I don't have any respiratory symptoms; I don't have a cough or shortness of breath.\n\nBy March 28, I suspected Covid. I knew people who had it, medical colleagues who I trusted, and they were a little ahead of me in the disease. They were saying that on Day 5 I would have respiratory problems. Sure enough, on Day 5 I started having shortness of breath. Around the same time, all the flulike symptoms got a little better, and I thought, OK, I am going to get better. But then I started not being able to get deep breaths.\n\nI'm 47. I wrestled in college; I'm still fit and consider myself strong. I know what going anaerobic is like, and this was different. I am a surgeon and speak in public. I had never had a panic attack in my life. And I was having trouble breathing. I wondered if it was a panic attack. The chest-wall rigidity would last four hours at a time. In those hours, I would not know what to do. I was scared. I was scared that I was going to die.\n\nI had to shut off social media and stop taking calls. The bad news was too much for me; I could not take harrowing statistics and bad news, the virus had played on my mind. I wanted positivity. Here I am, supposed to be a tough guy, and I turned into a wimp. That lasted for at least a couple of days, and I only had a moderate case of this disease. There are people going through 10 or 20 times worse.\n\nI was also scared that I was going to have to go to the hospital -- and I didn't want to go to the hospital. I knew what was going on at the hospital. I understood how lonely this disease can get. If somebody with Covid is sick enough to be dropped off at the hospital, the terror of that has to be the most isolating and lonely experience in the world, going to a hospital where you will not have visitors and where people caring for you -- giving you the care that will save your life -- will be scared, too, and covered in protective clothing and face shields and masks.\n\nSo I tried to bring the hospital to me. I gave myself I.V.s to remain hydrated. I had an oxygen-saturation meter. But you can't tough this out. I did not see my daughters for about three weeks. I was in my room, and they had to stay away. My wife was living in the basement and bringing me food and over-the-counter medicines. She probably kept me alive.\n\nMy colleagues were helping me, too: checking in, texting, telling me what to do and what to expect. When I got in a panicky mood, I would reach out to my friends and see what they thought I should do. And my wrestling community: I am 26 years out of college, but I was getting texts from old coaches and teammates and current wrestlers. These guys are tough, tough as nails, and it helped me. When I was wrestling and I was tired and my opponent was strong, and I would say to myself, \"Am I going to roll over and take this or am I going to get up and do something about it?\" I channeled that.\n\nAfter the wrestlers texted me, I would get up and go walk in the yard. I walked as fast as I could, which was pretty slow, and I tried to take a breath and hold it 10 seconds and maybe expand my lungs. No matter how bad I felt the whole time, I made sure I got out of bed, I put on a mask, and I went out into my yard. I walked around the yard five times. I did not let my lungs get stagnant. By that point I had figured out other strategies, too. For example, if you are going to lie down, you have to lie in a prone position, on your chest. It makes it easier to breathe.\n\nI woke up on Day 8, and I felt great. I thought this thing was over -- but I was wrong. Even with moderate cases, the disease keeps circling back, with a vengeance. I probably had a good 12 hours and it just came back, the chest tightness and shortness of breath. On Day 11 I became phlegmy. It was an emotional setback, because I thought I might have turned the corner, and now it had come back again. I would feel a little better, then it would come back. On Day 16, I felt great in the morning, then, wham, I started having bronchial spasms. They got worse. In the afternoon I was acutely out of breath. I just couldn't breathe. We started some new medicines and inhalers to open up the airway -- steroids, Albuterol -- to increase air flow to my lungs.\n\nIt was bad enough that the next day I went to an urgent-care clinic to see what was happening. My wife drove me in a mask and gloves. I tried two urgent-care places. They wouldn't let me in. They want you to stay outside and tell them what is going on. I told them I was a doctor and had been dealing with Covid for more than two weeks. I told them I wanted to get a chest X-ray and that I have a cardiologist and a pulmonologist -- I needed an X-ray. They flat-out refused.\n\nAt the third urgent-care center, they finally did the X-ray. It showed that I did not have pneumonia but that the bronchi in my lungs were exceptionally inflamed and just kept going into spasms. I am on a pretty hefty dose of drugs. I just hope that little by little now, I get this thing out of me.\n\nI've learned a lot. As a surgeon you have to have compassion, but you also have to detach from your emotions so you can do the mechanical part of your job. This virus? It magnified for me my understanding of how patients are vulnerable. I was vulnerable, and I was scared.",

In Chicago, the nation's third-largest city, fear of explosive growth -- the kind that overtook New York City, Detroit and New Orleans -- has faded in recent days, but the Chicago area has faced its own stubbornly high numbers.\n\nCook County, Ill., which includes Chicago and its closest suburbs, has added more cases of the coronavirus than any other county in the United States on some recent days. On Friday, Cook County added more new cases than the five boroughs of New York City combined.\n\n\"Watching a city of such global importance go through this absolutely horrific experience is so incredibly sad to see, but also of course a cautionary tale for the rest of us,\" Chicago's mayor, Lori Lightfoot, said of New York City. She said she had conferred with mayors in many of the country's largest cities in recent weeks. \"All of us have to be prepared, and thinking about, 'How do we not become the next hot spot?'\" she said.\n\nBut the nation's largest cities after New York -- Los Angeles and Chicago -- are wrestling with a puzzle somewhat different from the one New York faced: a caseload that has not skyrocketed but nonetheless remains steadily worrisome.\n\nMs. Lightfoot said that the numbers of new cases and deaths in the city itself each day had recently fallen somewhat, even as the number of cases in the larger county remains mostly flat. Cook County has added at least 1,265 cases on each of 18 consecutive days, and the death toll has more than doubled, to 2,264, in that same period.\n\nTogether, the counties around Chicago and Los Angeles and the five boroughs of New York City accounted for about 15 percent of the country's newly identified cases on a recent day.\n\nCook County has about 51,600 total cases and has been mostly adding between 1,400 and 1,900 new patients each day. Los Angeles County has more than 31,000 total cases, with average daily growth of about 850 cases over the last week. And New York City has more than 188,000 cases and 19,000 deaths, but its new cases have slowed to about 1,700 per day in the past week.\n\nIn an interview, Ms. Lightfoot said she was particularly concerned about data that shows that the virus has had a disproportionate effect on black and Latino residents.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Tracking the high coronavirus toll in U.S. nursing homes. Trump is losing ground with seniors when it comes to his handling of the virus. A virus 'conspiracy' video has gone viral.

And black residents, who make up about 30 percent of the city, account for 50 percent of the city's death toll in the pandemic.\n\nProPublica Illinois reported that 70 of the first 100 people who died of the virus in Chicago were black and that many victims had received unclear guidance about treatment or lived near hospitals that were unprepared to treat coronavirus patients.\n\n\"This is the manifestation of decades of neglect,\" Ms. Lightfoot said. \"There's no way to sugarcoat it. It's exactly that.\"\n\nMs. Lightfoot said she was also worried that warmer weather would lure Chicagoans out of their homes and too close to one another, as it had in New York, leading Mayor Bill de Blasio to limit crowds at two popular parks. The prospect of a long, steady -- but not exploding -- outbreak may complicate the task of officials in trying to persuade residents to continue staying home.\n\nLast month, a house party in Chicago drew widespread outrage after a video showed scores of people crammed together as music blared. The man who hosted the party told news outlets that he hadn't known how serious the virus was.\n\nMs. Lightfoot has said that people flouting stay-at-home rules may be cited for violations and sent to jail. But she has used less traditional approaches to send the message, embracing photoshopped memes of herself popping up around the city and creating a Tik Tok video to announce a virtual commencement ceremony for high school seniors.\n\nOn Friday, she outlined plans for Chicago to further reopen businesses, issuing a set of benchmarks that would need to be reached before some nonessential workers could return to work. Among them: a consistent decline in cases over two weeks, a decline in emergency department visits for coronavirus symptoms and the capacity to test 5 percent of Chicago residents each month. So far, none of the benchmarks have been met, an official said, and no date has been set for reopening.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt continued its monthslong fight against the novel coronavirus, with at least one sailor aboard the ship testing positive, according to crew members.\n\nThe infected sailor, who had tested negative before reboarding the Roosevelt, was quickly whisked off the ship, which is docked in Guam as Navy officials make preparations for the vessel to deploy. The episode underscores the stubborn challenges facing top Navy officials as a second investigation into the service's handling of the virus -- this one by the Defense Department's inspector general -- got underway this week.\n\nNavy officials said they had been aggressively screening and testing as crew members return to the Roosevelt after quarantining in Guam over the past month. Officials on the ship, they say, are requiring masks and repeatedly cleaning and sanitizing to prevent another outbreak of the virus that struck in March, which infected about 1,100 crew members.\n\nThe crew's attempts to stop the virus from returning has turned into a frantic game of cat and mouse. Sailors in what looked like biohazard suits were assigned to clean one area of the ship this week, while two hangar bays were unexpectedly sealed off on Tuesday right before food was served pier-side to transfer to shore a sailor, most likely infected with the virus, according to those on board.\n\nIn one email sent to much of the crew on Tuesday, a sailor in the medical department said that a current crew member who was undergoing medical screening had failed for four days to report an inability to smell, often a symptom of the virus.\n\n\"Please stress the importance of being truthful,\" the email read. \"So we don't potentially have Covid+ aboard this ship.\"\n\nThese daily setbacks, along with the Navy's timetable to get the ship back to sea, has left the vessel's commanders with difficult choices. One idea under consideration is to stop the remaining sailors quarantined on Guam from returning to the ship and setting sail with a smaller crew.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The Trump administration is reviewing an order to extend its virus border restrictions indefinitely. Powell warns that the economic damage could become permanent as Congress debates providing more support. The Texas attorney general warns Austin, Dallas and San Antonio over defying state orders. See more updates Updated 25m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nIn a message to the crew Wednesday night, broadcast over the Roosevelt's main loudspeaker system, the commander of the ship, Capt. Carlos A. Sardiello, said that medical scrutiny aboard has increased, comparing the ship to a rose garden still riddled with weeds. And he emphasized that the ship's departure date was based on the conditions on board.\n\nCaptain Sardiello's remarks may conflict with the Navy's desire to push the Roosevelt back to sea as soon as possible, with the hopes of uniting his carrier with two others -- the Ronald Reagan and the Nimitz -- for a public show of strength in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nNavy officials said Wednesday that anyone aboard the Roosevelt who displayed symptoms associated with the coronavirus was immediately tested and, regardless of the results, taken off the ship. The Navy has stopped releasing daily updates on the number of virus cases among the crew after publicly announcing that all sailors had been tested.\n\nThe Navy's top leaders are eager to put the Roosevelt's problems behind them, and to project an image that the fleet is ready to confront threats around the globe.\n\nBut aboard the Roosevelt, the ship's continued infections have quickly become the theme of the deployment. A \"cruise\" patch, designed by one of the aircraft squadrons on board, resembles the Corona Beer logo -- except in this case it reads, \"Corona Virus Cruise, USS Theodore Roosevelt, WestPac2020.\" In the center are the words \"Double Dragon for You,\" a subtle nod to the Navy's nickname for a stomach virus often transmitted while at sea.\n\nAdm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, wrote on Twitter over the weekend heralding news that six of the Navy's 11 carriers were now at sea. In fact, only two of the nuclear-powered carriers, the Truman off the East Coast and the Eisenhower in the Persian Gulf region, are on monthslong deployments. The other four ships are conducting training or qualifying crew members.\n\nAnd the Roosevelt's return to the Pacific has been delayed by other factors related to the virus. The series of events prompted by the virus's arrival on the Roosevelt caused a political uproar in Washington, led to the removal of the ship's captain and the resignation of the acting Navy secretary.\n\nThe new positive case on the Roosevelt comes as a second investigation of the Navy's handling of the virus -- this one by the Defense Department's inspector general -- was announced this week.\n\nThe inspector general said in a statement that it would assess the effectiveness of policies and procedures the Navy has put in place to prevent and mitigate the spread of infectious diseases, including the coronavirus, on surface warships and submarines. A spokeswoman declined to say when the report would be completed, but such reviews typically take at least several weeks.\n\nMeantime, a wider Navy inquiry into the events aboard the Roosevelt continues. That investigation, led by Adm. Robert P. Burke, the vice chief of naval operations, was directed last month by the acting secretary of the Navy, James E. McPherson.\n\nIn ordering the wider investigation, Mr. McPherson shelved the recommendation of a preliminary Navy review that restored Capt. Brett E. Crozier to command of the Roosevelt. The results of the Navy's latest investigation are due by the end of this month, and will examine a broader range of issues, including why the Roosevelt made a port call in early March to Da Nang, Vietnam, despite the spread of the virus across Asia.\n\nWhile Mr. McPherson requested the most recent Navy inquiry, the decision whether to accept its finding and recommendations will most likely fall to Kenneth J. Braithwaite, President Trump's nominee to be Navy secretary. The Senate is expected to approve Mr. Braithwaite by mid-June.\n\nSeveral sailors on the Roosevelt, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of losing their jobs, expressed concern over how they will manage to maintain six feet of social distancing aboard the cramped quarters of an aircraft carrier.\n\nIn addition to the Roosevelt, the Navy also experienced a serious coronavirus outbreak aboard a destroyer, the Kidd.",

        "body": "Almost as soon as it appeared, Covid-19 seeded a peculiar and deep dread of the literature it might someday inspire. \"Novel coronavirus\" -- in the literary sense -- already conjures contempt and exhaustion, but why? What do we fear? Limp attempts at parody? Schematic sci-fi? Autofictional accounts of quarantine in Brooklyn in which the pandemic serves as backdrop to the personal epiphany of an alienated protagonist who discovers the virtues of the simpler life, via much massaging of dough and theoretical jargon? (Yes.)\n\nThe conversation obscures the fact that there is already a predominant genre, in full sway -- in the flourishing of first-person narratives, the innumerable pandemic diaries in every discipline. Artists paint the views from their windows; war photographers stuck at home train their lenses on their kitchen tables and the bodies of their children at play. An e-book, \"Wuhan Diary,\" was published this week, covering 76 days of quarantine in the epicenter of the outbreak. Writers emote like it's 2015 again, the heyday of the personal essay. Here's What I Cooked, they share. Here's What I Wore, What I Long For.\n\nSuch accounts -- many banal, at best -- turn interesting, even significant, when read together and regarded as a wave of testimony. The writers are an unusually cocooned bunch, safely distant from the world of layoffs, mass graves, Zoom funerals. (It's only more recently that we've seen first-person accounts by subway workers, paramedics, ER doctors and nurses.) Their quarantines are, on the surface, bucolic interludes laced with light anxiety; panic is sieved through Instagram's tidy grid of artful domesticity, simmering bone broth, early bluebells and the first fledglings spied on solitary walks. The uncertainty of the tone is what makes these pieces oddly moving, the damp childlike fright that creeps through resolve. Together, they represent a struggle in real time to give language to a set of emotions that are, as yet, painfully nameless.\n\nAny effort at naming is an ungainly process, and begins with metaphor -- what does this moment recall? The isolation of quarantine is compared to everything from living in wartime or as a refugee to being friendless at work. The hazy quality of time evokes the postpartum months or aimless afternoons of childhood. It replicates the solitude of wilderness, the cloister, coping with chronic illness. To Lorrie Moore it resembles \"a zombie apocalypse\"; to Donald Antrim, an episode of major depression. Ottessa Moshfegh described it as \"doing time.\" (The incarceration metaphor is so common, it elicited an exasperated response from Angela Davis. \"As someone who was once really in lockdown, we can't minimize the experience of people in prisons,\" she said in an interview. \"It is not what we're experiencing in our homes today.\") Jamaica Kincaid has compared it to a version of afterlife: \"It's as if we are dead and somehow have been given the unheard-of opportunity to see the life we lived, the way we lived it.\"\n\nSo few of these metaphors satisfy -- they're heightened, meager, inappropriate -- but there is something stirring in their awkwardness, in seeing a new phenomenon slip the net of ready-made language. The novelist Jamie Quatro, writing in the New York Review of Books's \"Pandemic Journals,\" opens her curtains one morning and wonders if she's looking at snowflakes or cherry blossoms. Why can't she tell -- and why doesn't the season seem to matter?) Nick Laird, writing in the same series: \"My daughter shouts at my son, my son shouts at my daughter, and then I shout at both of them. There is a manic quality to the time. It is like being on acid or crazed from lack of sleep.\"\n\nThese could be outtakes from \"Alice in Wonderland,\" set in another strange month of May. How many times had I read the book before I noticed, only this week, why Alice follows the rabbit? It isn't that he speaks, or is so nattily dressed. It's his watch. \"When the Rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to her feet.\" The defining feature of Wonderland is its eeriness of time and scale -- the hours move unpredictably, time itself can be threatened with murder or cajoled to speed up.\n\nPandemic diaries are not merely documents of a particular time but documents of entering into a particular, altered relationship with time. Some of us have become \"billionaires of time,\" as Katherine Sharpe writes in n+1, describing her \"slow-simmering crock pot of envy\" toward the childless, \"the kind of people who are the intended audience for the recent gush of articles advising them on what to read, watch, cook or how otherwise to while away the endless expanse of their time in quarantine.\"\n\nThere are the paupers of time, too -- the sick, the vulnerable, the caregivers -- pinched and frenzied. Everyone is out of sync, jet-lagged in ordinary life, untethered to ordinary time while also being obsessively clock-struck. In quarantine, \"time itself is the task,\" as Kierkegaard wrote, and counting the order of the day. How long has that package been disinfecting outside -- two days or three? When was that doorknob last disinfected? When will the check arrive? When did her symptoms abate? How much longer like this?\n\nTo describe the passage of time has always been one of the favorite challenges of the writer or philosopher. \"Where is it, this present?\" William James wondered. \"It has melted in our grasp, fled ere we could touch it, gone in the instant of becoming.\" In Nabokov's \"Ada; Or Ardor,\" the heroine declares: \"We can never know Time. Our senses are simply not meant to perceive it.\" The mysteries of time are bound up in the great unknowns of the body and universe, from consciousness to black holes. But we've always reached for it, attempted to fix time, in language or theory, to possess it, reclaim it from the white rabbit. In a moment of uncertainty, what else can we do but grasp at the time we have and can perceive, how beautifully ordinary is this desire, how reassuring even our failure, as it slips away.",

        "body": "BIRMINGHAM, England -- Normally, the mosque, one of England's largest, would be filled with thousands of worshipers during the holy month of Ramadan, but now it is mostly empty, except for stacks of coffins.\n\nEvery few hours a van pulls up in front of the white marquee of the Central Jamia Mosque Ghamkol Sharif, its entrance emblazoned with the Quranic verse: \"Verily we belong to God, and verily to him do we return.\"\n\nVolunteers dressed in protective coveralls and masks come out and carefully unload black-velvet-covered coffins and carry them inside a makeshift mortuary in the mosque's parking lot. There the bodies are washed, shrouded and refrigerated.\n\nBefore the coronavirus outbreak, the funeral service at the mosque in the hard-hit city of Birmingham, Britain's second largest, would receive one or two bodies a week. But last month -- as Britain hit its peak infection numbers -- five to six bodies were brought in each day, forcing the mosque to build a makeshift mortuary in its parking lot, which it has opened to all faiths.\n\n\"I've lost count of the bodies that have come in and out of here,\" said Javid Akhtar, the mosque's funeral director, hastily pulling his mask away from his mouth to catch his breath. \"I've never seen anything like this.\"\n\nThe virus has claimed over 31,000 lives in Britain, and while London has been the epicenter of cases and deaths, Birmingham and surrounding areas in the West Midlands have emerged lately as a virus hot spot. In April, the University Hospitals Birmingham N.H.S. Trust, a public hospital network in the Midlands region, recorded more deaths than any other N.H.S. trust in England.\n\nCommunities from black and religious minority backgrounds, which make up around 26 percent of Birmingham's 842,000 residents, have been disproportionally affected by the virus, prompting a government investigation into the cause. A study by N.H.S. England found that 16 percent of coronavirus victims who died up to the week of April 17 came from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nOut of more than 100 health workers who have died from the virus, 63 percent have been identified as from those backgrounds.\n\n\"We have seen, both across the population as a whole but in those who work in the N.H.S., a much higher proportion who've died from minority backgrounds and that really worries me,\" Britain's health secretary, Matt Hancock, said during a news briefing last month.\n\nSeveral committee members at the Ghamkol Sharif mosque, who helped set up the mortuary in Birmingham's Small Heath district, have fallen ill with coronavirus symptoms, leaving a group of young volunteers to run the operation.\n\n\"Everyone in the community knows someone who has died or is sick,\" said Tariq Mahmood, a 24-year-old brand specialist, who is volunteering at the mosque and handled his first body last week -- a middle-aged man who died in prison.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak New cluster in China highlights the challenge of controlling infections as countries open up. Berlin Cathedral holds its first Sunday services since Germany lifted lockdown measures. Hong Kong police storm malls, accusing protesters of violating social distancing rules. See more updates Updated 29m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nThe mortuary is divided into four sections. In the entrance, dozens of empty wooden coffins lie neatly stacked against one another, awaiting the bodies of the newly announced dead.\n\nTo the left, large industrial refrigerators with a storage capacity of up to 400 bodies are lined up back to back, facing a large tarp curtain that covers the mortuary washing table.\n\nOn a recent rainy day, Mr. Akhtar, the funeral director, and a volunteer tried to put one of the corpses on the table to be washed, but the basin and floor were flooded and there was no time to dry it because another body needed to be collected.\n\n\"This is a slower week, but even now it's hard to keep up,\" Mr. Akhtar said. \"These days it can take one or two hours to pick up a body because there are so many people dying and all the paperwork takes time.\"\n\nOn the far side of the mortuary, six green plastic chairs and two prayer mats were laid out for the small-scale funeral services that are performed daily for the families of the deceased.\n\nUnder Islamic funeral rites, burials must take place as swiftly as possible, usually within 24 hours of a death. But as bodies have piled up in recent weeks, many Muslim funerals have been delayed, sometimes up to seven days.\n\n\"The families are suffering the most, they have no one around them while they grieve,\" Mohammed Zahid, a committee member at the mosque, said after returning from the burial of a 37-year-old man who died within days of testing positive for the virus despite his youth and lack of underlying health conditions.\n\n\"Only six people were allowed at the funeral. What do you do if you have five brothers and two sisters?\" he asked. \"Who do you take and who do you leave at home?\"\n\nMr. Zahid lost two aunts to the virus in April and could not attend their funerals because of capacity restrictions. When asked how he had grieved, he said, \"I didn't. How can I when we have five to six bodies coming in here every day? There is no time.\"\n\nOne of the biggest challenges for Muslim leaders in Birmingham has been getting the community to abide by the government lockdown restrictions, especially in late March, when they were first announced.\n\nKhalid Mahmood, a member of Parliament representing Birmingham, said many elderly Muslim and Sikh people struggled to stay away from their places of worship because of their strong religious convictions.\n\n\"It's like a jungle out there,\" Mr. Zahid said. \"Many people are now staying home, but still there are lots of people who don't really understand the severity of the threat because they can't physically see it.\"\n\nBarkha Ayoub, a 21-year-old engineering student from Birmingham's Washwood Heath district, said she saw several religious gatherings during the first few weeks of lockdown.\n\n\"It's quieter now, as it's Ramadan and people are starting to see how dangerous the virus is, but some older people and big families are still meeting every day to break their fast together,\" Ms. Ayoub said in a phone interview.\n\nOn a recent day, she took a long walk past her local mosque and saw two coffins being loaded into a van while a family stood at a distance and wept through their masks. A day later, she saw another coffin being offloaded from a van.\n\n\"So many people are dying right in front of our eyes, it's terrifying,\" she said. \"All I wanted to do was walk up to the family, hug the mother, hold her. Tell her everything would be OK. But all I could do was stand there and watch. It felt very unnatural.\"\n\nAfter returning from collecting another body, Mr. Akhtar, the funeral director of the Ghamkol Sharif mosque, explained how on some days it can take hours to pick up bodies as hospitals and care homes struggle to process the daily tolls.\n\n\"The bigger funeral companies come with larger vehicles and slide eight bodies in at a time, it's mad,\" he recalled. \"You don't really realize the scale of this virus until you see all the bodies.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nCHELSEA, Mass. -- Paul Nowicki, the director of operations for the housing authority in this small, crowded immigrant city, walked the halls of the Buckley Apartments last week in a plastic face shield and white gown, trying to stop an invisible predator.\n\nChelsea is the epicenter of the coronavirus crisis in Massachusetts, with rates of infection that surged last week to 3,841 per 100,000 people, around six times the statewide average. And officials fear the virus is still spreading.\n\nTake Mr. Nowicki: There were nine confirmed cases of the virus in the Buckley Apartments, tucked among eight floors of public housing. Mr. Nowicki had ordered waves of deep-cleaning, wiping of railings and elevator buttons. He watched the residents shuffle in and out of the lobby, mostly grandparents, fragile and disabled. It was his job to safeguard them.\n\nBut how could he do that when, because of medical privacy laws, he did not know where the nine infected people lived? \"It's the specificity of the floor you'd like to know,\" Mr. Nowicki said. \"Like, are the cases on the 7th floor or the 9th floor? Are all the infections on one floor? Or is it spread along all the floors? You'd like to know.\"\n\nHe is not the only one. Residents call Mr. Nowicki's wife, Tracy, the city's director of elder services, demanding to know who in their building is positive, and she gently deters them.\n\n\"They want to make sure they don't knock on their door,\" she said. \"I totally understand that. I totally understand why the residents that are still healthy want to stay that way.\"\n\nAs the virus spreads through American communities, many leaders will face the same stubborn challenge: How, in a country that values its citizens' medical privacy and autonomy, can authorities separate the sick from the well?\n\nThe question is an urgent one if public life is to resume.\n\nChinese cities solved this problem by giving infected people no choice. In the city of Wuhan, authorities realized that social distancing was not enough to rapidly bring the virus's reproduction rate down to near zero, which they felt was necessary to reopen schools and businesses.\n\nHousehold transmission represented the bulk of new cases. So when people had mild symptoms, or were known to have been exposed, they were removed to vast quarantine centers. There, they were medically monitored and provided with food, until two successive tests showed they were not infectious.\n\nTwo months of this regimen brought the number of new confirmed cases to nearly zero, allowing the city to reopen two and a half months after the outbreak began, said Xihong Lin, a biostatistician at Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health. But the United States, she said, will have to encourage sick people to separate from family voluntarily.\n\n\"Western countries are different from Asian countries,\" she said. \"One cannot force people to do things.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump's remarks on disinfectants prompt a scramble from doctors, manufacturers, and his party. Three states are moving to reopen. But the path ahead is far from simple. Most coronavirus antibody tests are found wanting by researchers. See more updates Updated 13m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nChelsea, a city of 40,000 people crammed into less than two square miles, has 1,447 confirmed cases, according to state data, by far the highest rate in Massachusetts.\n\nAnd those confirmed cases represent only the tip of an iceberg. Last weekend, when researchers from Massachusetts General Hospital conducted antibodies tests on 200 apparently healthy pedestrians in Chelsea, selected at random, nearly a third of them tested positive, suggesting that many had been infected without knowing it.\n\n\"They may infect other people around them who are high risk,\" said John Iafrate, vice chairman of Massachusetts General's pathology department and the study's principal investigator. \"That is a very, very serious infection control issue.\"\n\nThis month, city officials began offering people who tested positive for the virus the option of moving into a 157-room hotel in nearby Revere, to avoid infecting their family members or housemates. Ten days later, though, only 14 people from Chelsea are staying there.\n\n\"We were expecting the floodgates to open,\" said Alexander Train, the assistant director of the city's Department of Planning and Development. He said undocumented immigrants may be afraid to take advantage of the offer, fearing it would lead to deportation.\n\n\"I think there is some uncertainty and anxiety that is inhibiting the flow of guests to the hotel, because it is attributed to the government,\" he said. \"It's about, 'what if I don't make it back to my family?'\"\n\nMost people, given a choice, will stay home, despite the risk of infection, said Roy Avellaneda, the City Council president, who said he tried in vain to persuade an employee at the restaurant he runs, who risked infecting her family members, to check into a hotel.\n\n\"For all the love we have in this country,\" Mr. Avellaneda said, \"the reason we're probably going to be hit sicker is that we still have a government that cannot make those decisions for the benefit of its residents.\"\n\n'The Air Would Have Been Contaminated'\n\nSeparated from Boston by the Mystic River, Chelsea is a world apart, a first stop for immigrant families -- Lithuanian, Polish, Irish, Puerto Rican, and more recently Honduran and Guatemalan -- who cannot afford the bigger city's sky-high rents.\n\nIt has a population density of nearly 17,000 people per square mile, with whole families crowding into single rooms in triple-decker rowhouses, buildings with high rates of lead paint, asbestos and air pollution.\n\nKatharine Robb, a researcher at the Harvard Kennedy School who spent a summer following housing inspectors in Chelsea, was stunned by what she found -- families living on porches, in unfinished basements or even closets, without access to running water, heat or sanitation.\n\n\"I didn't think conditions like this were happening in the 21st century,\" she said. \"It reminded me of stories I heard of the late 1800s, at the beginning of sanitary reform, at the beginning of urbanization.\"\n\nThis spring, the fast-spreading virus collided disastrously with the city's overcrowded housing. A warning flare came in the second week of April, when, late at night, a young mother called the city housing authority from the street; she had disclosed her test results to her roommates, and they had kicked her out. \"It dawned on me that this situation was going to replicate itself,\" said Thomas Ambrosino, Chelsea's city manager, \"and we better have a solution.\"\n\nOver the weeks that came after, some of the sick isolated themselves. One man, worried about infecting his family, slept in his car for two days, until his relatives sought help from the city.\n\nGladys Vega, a longtime community activist, helped a man who had been banished to a freezing, unfinished dirt basement, where he was riding out the illness on a piece of cardboard. Another man had been sent to sleep on a porch, despite temperatures that still dropped below freezing at night.\n\n\"People are being treated as if they have leprosy,\" said Ms. Vega, executive director of the Chelsea Collaborative.\n\nOthers did their best to ride out the virus in small spaces. Marisol Lima, 35, was eight days from her move-out date, in the tiny room she rented from a Colombian family. when she noticed that her downstairs neighbor was coughing. Within days, six of the seven people in the apartment were seriously ill, feverish, breathing with difficulty.\n\n\"I think it was impossible not to get the virus,\" she said. \"It was a very small living space. The air would have been contaminated.\"\n\nWendy Rosales, a restaurant kitchen manager, discovered she had the virus when she went to the doctor for an earache, and tried to isolate from her husband and daughters by staying in a bedroom. But the room had no lock and her three-year-old toddled into the room any time her father's attention drifted, running to hug her mother. When Ms. Rosales pushed her out and shut the door, the girl would stand outside, crying.\n\n\"I didn't sleep,\" she said. \"I spent almost the whole night thinking what to do, and thinking about the little one -- she's young and doesn't understand what's happening.\"\n\nA Safety Valve\n\nThe opening of the Quality Inn in Revere last weekprovided the city with a safety valve. Those who checked in would get three meals a day and medical monitoring, but would not be allowed to leave their rooms, or leave until cleared by medical staff.\n\nMs. Rosales was one of the first to check in.\n\nAfter her night of crying, she stuffed a few possessions into a backpack and left home without saying goodbye, or even looking back. Now in her seventh day at the Quality Inn, she is both intensely homesick and intensely relieved.\n\n\"I was terrified I was going to infect them,\" she said. \"It was the best decision.\"\n\nBut many in the city are choosing to ride out the illness at home.\n\nFor Mr. Ambrosino, the city manager, it is part of a bigger problem for the city of Chelsea: Infected people must be persuaded to take difficult steps -- like social distancing and isolating in the hotel -- themselves. \"We're not going to engage in violent physical sealing of doors, that's not how we operate in the U. S. of A.,\" he said.\n\nHe said compliance rates were very good, as high as 95 percent, but that left a significant number to spread the virus.\" If the compliance rates were 95 percent, that means that I have 2,000 nitwits out on the street,\" he said.\n\nAnother obstacle, he said, are medical privacy laws that can prevent the city's public health staff from disclosing who, in this crowded city, has tested positive.\n\n\"She can't call me and say, 'I've got someone in Unit 6 who is positive,'\" Mr. Ambrosino said. \"I can't know their names or addresses. She can say, 'the city is ready to help you, call this help line,' but if that person doesn't call, because they don't understand, or they're afraid of the government, there is no way for us to help them.\"\n\n\"Unless someone tells us they're Covid-19 positive, I have no way of knowing,\" he said.\n\nAnd many sick people are withholding their status out of fear. Earlier this month, Maria Belen Power, a community activist, found herself begging an undocumented friend, Floridalma , to call 911. Ms. Power was weeping; her friend had spent the night gasping for air.\n\n\"They just didn't want to call, because they were afraid,\" said Ms. Power, associate executive director of GreenRoots, an environmental justice organization. \"She kept saying, 'but what if they ask me for papers?' Honestly, I thought she could die. I was saying, 'You have to call. You're losing time.\"\n\nMs. Lima, who was infected by one of her roommates, said many people she knows don't want to reveal that they have the illness.. \"Fear exists heavily among the Latino people,\" she said. \"A lot of people do not want to speak, or even accept that they are sick, because they are scared of how the rest of the people will look at them.\"\n\nAnd many simply cannot fathom leaving sick relatives alone. Ruth Gabriela Santos Ochoa, 34, is counting the days until her mother, Floridalma, is released from the hospital. She has been on a respirator for three weeks, a period during which the city was transformed.\n\n\"The impact is terrible,\" said Ms. Ochoa. \"Knowing you are at the epicenter, looking around and realizing how many people have died. And that the numbers of infections are not only increasing, but doubling and tripling. Learning that people you've known your whole life are infected.\"\n\nBringing her mother home, into a four-room apartment with eight other people, comes with the risk that she is contagious. But Ms. Ochoa cannot bear to think of her mother's loneliness if she should be moved to the hotel She wants to cook for her.\n\n\"Our parents had their time,\" Ms. Ochoa said. \"They gave everything to us. Now it is my time to return it, and take care of them.\"\n\nVanessa Swales contributed reporting from New York.",

        "body": "This isn't the first time Vicki Dobbins's town has been forced to shelter in place.\n\nLast year, the Marathon Petroleum refinery that looms over her neighborhood near Detroit emitted a pungent gas, causing nausea and dizziness among neighbors and prompting health officials to warn people to stay inside. When a stay-at-home advisory returned in March, this time for the coronavirus, \"it was just devastating,\" Ms. Dobbins said.\n\nMs. Dobbins, who is 76, later contracted Covid-19, and spent two weeks on oxygen in intensive care. Now she has a question. \"Do the polluters in our area make us more susceptible to asthma, bronchitis, heart failure, cancers?\" she asked. \"Is the virus just going to be one of the ones added to that list?\"\n\nNationwide, low-income communities of color like hers, River Rouge, Mich., are exposed to significantly higher levels of pollution, studies have found, and also see higher levels of lung disease and other ailments. Now, scientists are racing to understand if long-term exposure to air pollution plays a role in the coronavirus crisis, particularly since minorities are disproportionately dying.\n\nThe science is preliminary -- the virus, being so new, remains poorly understood -- though researchers are finding reason to look closely. People with two conditions tied to air pollution, inflammatory lung disease and coronary heart disease, face a higher risk for severe Covid-19, preliminary research has shown. Last month, work by Harvard specialists found that coronavirus patients in areas with historically heavy air pollution are more likely to die than patients elsewhere.\n\nAnd while it's impossible to say with certainty that any one person was made more vulnerable to the virus because of pollution, earlier studies of other respiratory diseases have established that long-term exposure to air pollution increases the risk of those illness.\n\n\"The system has allowed, basically, low-income people and people of color to have to breathe the pollution,\" said Dr. Abdul El-Sayed, an epidemiologist and Detroit's former health director.\n\nThe tensions are playing out in minority communities across the country that live with industrial air pollution and the health risks that come with it. A neighborhood in Houston, Texas, for instance, that is home not only to factories making plastics materials used in medical masks, but also incinerators that burn medical waste. A community outside San Francisco near the state's largest refinery but far from most hospitals.\n\nAnd the county where Ms. Dobbins lives, which has seen more Covid-19 deaths than almost any other outside of New York state.\n\nMichigan:\n\nA National Hot Spot\n\nMs. Dobbins lives in one of Michigan's most polluted ZIP codes.\n\nThere's a refinery, two power stations, a steel mill and a sewage treatment plant within a five-mile radius. The area's levels of ozone, a gas that has been linked to lung disease and other ailments, frequently exceed federal limits.\n\nHer county has seen 2,192 deaths so far, putting it in the same league as much larger Cook County, Ill., which is home to Chicago and 2,589 recorded deaths. In Michigan, African-Americans have accounted for more than 40 percent of deaths, even though they make up only 15 percent of the population.\n\nA substitute teacher, Ms. Dobbins had already struggled to breathe since developing asthma after moving back to the neighborhood 20 years ago to care for her mother. She got used to carrying around her inhaler and also sheltering in place, as she did a year ago during the warning about the Marathon refinery.\n\nBack then, the Detroit Health Department advised people to stay indoors with the windows closed, saying that the odors could cause \"symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, headaches, or difficulty breathing\" among people sensitive to the smells. A flare failure had released hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide and other compounds, Marathon told regulators. In a statement, a company spokesman, Jamal T. Kheiry, said the plant operator \"did not detect any emission levels of concern\" in the episode.\n\nToday, amid the pandemic, Marathon has urged state regulators to suspend environmental monitoring rules, partly so its staff will not have to work and risk infection. On April 2, Timothy J. Peterkoski, Marathon's environmental director, wrote to regulators that some \"sampling, testing, record-keeping and reporting activities may need to be deferred.\"\n\nWhen the virus lockdown came in March, the entire state sheltered at home, including Ms. Dobbins. Only then did she discover that she had already caught the coronavirus, most likely at a birthday party a few weeks earlier in Detroit, where she danced the night away with friends, she said.\n\nShe was hospitalized with pneumonia, then transferred to intensive care. Then, her kidneys failed. She was among the lucky and today is recovering at home. Nevertheless, Ms. Dobbins now struggles to take the 20 steps to and from her bathroom. \"I'm so winded I can't breathe,\" she said, pausing to catch her breath while speaking on the phone.\n\nAnd she struggled to describe the industrial smells that plague her neighborhood: \"I smell it every day. I live it every day.\"\n\nTexas\n\nMaking Plastic, Burning Plastic\n\nThe neighborhoods surrounding the Houston Ship Channel, a bustling petrochemical hub of refineries and oil tankers, produce the raw materials vital to some of the most highly sought-after products in the nation right now: masks, plastic gowns and other medical equipment.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. W.H.O. gathers to push for global coordination amid a deepening rift between the U.S. and China. The first coronavirus vaccine tested in people appears to be safe and generates an immune response. Firms face tough choices as the deadline to return government loans arrives. See more updates Updated 9m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAnd when that gear is discarded, residents fear that some of it is coming back to be incinerated in the five medical waste facilities in and around Houston, Port Arthur and surrounding counties.\n\nIt is the kind of one-two industrial punch that has contributed to air pollution for decades around the neighborhoods' sizable African-American and Hispanic populations. The American Lung Association ranks Houston among the nation's most polluted cities.\n\nToday, Harris County, which includes metropolitan Houston, has reported more than 9,000 coronavirus cases. Minority groups have accounted for about two-thirds of early Covid-19 deaths in the city, despite making up only 22 percent of the population.\n\n\"Hospitals need the masks, the gloves,\" said Yvette Arellano, a community organizer in Houston's polluted neighborhoods. But the irony, she said, is that communities like this \"are breathing in the toxins that industry says is necessary for the safety of other people.\"\n\nDespite the economic shutdown, petrochemical companies around Houston have kept operating because they are essential for the production of masks and protective equipment. Research has shown that most waste incinerators in the United States are in lower-income communities of color, and medical waste, when burned, can release dioxins and other compounds.\n\nDenae W. King, an expert in environmental health at Texas Southern University, said more research was needed to pin down if and precisely how air pollution might make communities more vulnerable. But particulate matter, which can lodge deep in the lungs and cause inflammation, adds risk, she said. \"If your lungs have already been exposed, you already have underlying issues related to inflammation, and then you're diagnosed with Covid-19, that just exacerbates the problems that already exist.\"\n\nMs. Arellano says she suspects, but can't be sure, that her own mother caught coronavirus. She had the dry cough, a headache and muscle pain. But health officials said her mother wouldn't qualify for a test without proof that she had run a sustained fever, a tricky ask for Americans with no family physician.\n\nHer mother never got tested. But because of her cough, she hasn't been able to keep working as a grocery cashier.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPollution Nearby, Hospitals Far Away\n\nSiengther Lakthanasuk fought for the Americans against communist forces for 15 years in Indochina, and waited another 16 years at a refugee camp in Thailand before landing in 1991 in Richmond, Calif., in Contra Costa County, just a few minutes from a Chevron refinery that is the state's largest polluter.\n\nMr. Lakthanasuk's neighborhood, a community of people hailing from his native Laos, is also affected by other industrial pollution, including coal trains headed to port.\n\nWhile Richmond doesn't lack for industrial infrastructure, it does fall short in health care options. The only public hospital serving the city of 110,000 shut its doors in 2015.\n\nHunkered down at home, Mr. Lakthanasuk worries what might happen if his daughters bring the virus into the house from their work. \"When I was in the war, we could hear the enemy, we could hear the guns shooting, and we could protect ourselves,\" Mr. Lakthanasuk said, speaking through a translator. But \"you cannot see the coronavirus.\"\n\nContra Costa County has recorded 1,089 coronavirus cases, and its fatality rate has climbed to nearly 3 percent, almost twice that of wealthier San Francisco a short drive away. That disparity underscores regional inequalities even as California has been praised for its early virus intervention -- including the nation's first shelter-in-place orders in six counties, including Contra Costa.\n\nMany local families are like Mr. Lakthanasuk's, intergenerational households with service industry jobs that are either risky or have disappeared. Mr. Lakthanasuk's wife lost her job at a nearby casino shuttered by the pandemic. His two adult daughters work at nearby grocery stores, essential workers both to the community and for their income.\n\nJohn Gioa, who serves on the county's board of supervisors and the state's Air Resources Board, said a new medical station in Richmond with 250 beds, housed in a former Ford Motor factory, would bring much-needed care. And testing had been greatly expanded, he said, with at least three locations in the city.\n\n\"I'm still concerned about the future,\" he said. \"Lower-income communities and those impacted by air pollution are at greater risk, and we need to be prepared.\"\n\nIn 2012, a fire at the Chevron facility sent more than 10,000 people to seek treatment for respiratory difficulties, including Mr. Lakthanasuk and his family. \"We were packed in the hospital,\" Mr. Lakthanasuk said, recalling the fire. \"But that's not the only time. There's been a lot of incidents.\"\n\nLast year at the refinery, episodes of flaring, the intentional burning of hydrogen, sent black smoke across the neighborhood, prompting an investigation by air-quality officials. Chevron said the flaring was related to the start-up of a more efficient hydrogen processing unit, now complete.\n\nA spokesman for Chevron, Braden Reddall, said the refinery air-monitoring systems measure five chemical compounds at three locations, and those readings as of mid-May do not exceed health limits.\n\nMr. Lakthanasuk's health concerns and financial strains are now starting to reach well beyond his boxy, red-and-yellow home in Richmond. His extended family back in Laos is now feeling the effects, too.\n\nThey are rice farmers, he said, and their crop last year was hit hard by drought, which local officials have linked to climate change. Despite fears for his own safety, Mr. Lakthanasuk recently ventured out to wire his nephew an emergency payment of $300 so he could buy food.\n\nIn his many years spent fighting communists in Indochina, Mr. Lakthanasuk said, he is proud of having never been captured. The virus, though, has given him a small taste. \"Right now, home is worse than being a prisoner,\" he said.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSomething was wrong with a tiger in central India's Pench Tiger Reserve earlier this month. For several days, wildlife managers had observed the 10-year-old male making frequent visits to a nearby pond, possibly, they speculated, because it was running a high fever. Though staff administered antibiotics, the tiger didn't improve and eventually died by the water hole. A mysterious respiratory illness was at first the suspected cause of death.\n\nTwo days later -- before authorities determined that an impacted intestine arising from a giant hairball had likely killed the cat -- Indian officials put the country's 50 wild tiger reserves on high alert. The country is home to 2,967 wild tigers, roughly three-quarters of the world's total remaining non-captive population. And the cats are known to suffer from respiratory ailments, such as rhinotracheitis. But the announcement that a captive 4-year-old tiger at New York's Bronx Zoo had tested positive for the coronavirus -- the first confirmed case of the virus in a big cat -- intensified concerns.\n\n\"This coronavirus could turn out to be very dangerous,\" said Anup Kumar Nayak of the National Tiger Conservation Authority, the government agency charged with protecting India's big cats. \"We do not know what will happen in the future, but we are taking every precautionary measure. We have to take care of them.\"\n\nDr. Nayak's agency and India's Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change have advised wildlife wardens in all states with tigers to restrict the movement of people into national parks, sanctuaries and reserves. Tigers must also be observed for respiratory symptoms, such as nasal discharge, coughing or labored breathing, the authority said. Personnel relocating tigers that have been in conflict with people or handling sick cats would also need to be tested for the virus before any interactions with the animals.\n\nAt the time of the Pench tiger's death, the agency had not established a protocol for coronavirus testing. Moving forward, veterinarians conducting post-mortem investigations will be required to collect and send samples to national laboratories.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Clues emerge on the origin of the nationwide spread, and the C.D.C. head warns of a \"second wave\" this winter. Trump backs away from a broad ban on immigration, but many will still feel effect of the restrictions. Disease detectives learn more about the virus's spread -- and why it will be so hard to contain. See more updates Updated 25m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nIn the two weeks since the advisories were issued, Dr. Nayak said wildlife wardens have not reported behavioral changes in tigers that would indicate any had become infected. But they continue to look out for more sick tigers.\n\nIndia entered a nationwide lockdown on March 24, but many wildlife workers have remained on the job. At Kanha Tiger Reserve in the central state of Madhya Pradesh, hundreds of rangers patrol the 362-square-mile area to protect the 90 endangered tigers estimated to live there.\n\n\"In Kanha, we have our own vets and veterinary hospital, so we are well prepared,\" said L. Krishnamoorthy, field director of the reserve. \"It's a concern everywhere, but we are very watchful.\"\n\nIn a series of lab experiments at China's Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, researchers demonstrated that the virus reproduces \"efficiently\" in domestic cats and can be transmitted by respiratory droplets between animals. The results were uploaded last month to a preprint website, and have not yet been subject to peer review.\n\nScientists aren't yet sure how the coronavirus could affect big cats in the wild. A controlled or modified setting, such as a lab or a zoo, doesn't offer an accurate model for how species interact in an ecosystem. Chris Walzer, executive director of health at the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York, suggested that the virus may have spread to Nadia, the Bronx Zoo Malayan tiger, through pressure-washing of cages that vaporized the virus. Still, she only expressed mild symptoms -- a cough and decreased appetite -- as did six other big cats at the zoo.\n\nTigers are known to be vulnerable to rabies, anthrax and canine distemper, an often fatal morbillivirus commonly spread by stray dogs. The cats can also fall victim to feline infectious peritonitis, a disease caused by another coronavirus strain that affects the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nIndia is likely exhibiting an overabundance of caution because of the fragile status of tigers in the country. And some critics say authorities are focusing on the wrong problem.\n\nUllas Karanth, the director of the Center for Wildlife Studies in India, thinks fears over the virus are misdirected. Illegal hunting of the tiger's prey species for meat by desperate locals during the lockdown is a bigger threat to wild tigers than the disease itself, he says. Seven poachers were recently arrested in Bandipur Tiger Reserve with dead deer. \"There is a real surge in this kind of hunting,\" Dr. Karanth said.\n\nOther conservationists warn that because of the restrictions, impoverished people living near and in protected areas will be unable to collect subsistence products, like firewood and food. In a letter to the environment ministry, Ravi Chellam, an Indian wildlife biologist, and others urged officials not to restrict or evict villagers from protected areas.\n\n\"Indian wildlife faces far greater threats from habitat fragmentation, degradation, destruction, climate change, poaching and potentially many other diseases than from Covid-19,\" Dr. Chellam said.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nGood morning.\n\n(Here's the sign-up, if you don't already get California Today by email.)\n\nToday, we have another dispatch from students at the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, written by Jesse Bedayn and Brett Simpson:\n\nOAKLAND -- Anthony Deloney is homeless and 63 years old, a frightful combination in this pandemic. Yet this is how Mr. Deloney described his fate on a recent Thursday afternoon: \"Every day the sun rises, there's something for me to look forward to.\" His hopefulness, it turned out, rested on a single lucky break that graced an otherwise hard-luck life.\n\nMr. Deloney had found refuge in the only homeless shelter in the Bay Area dedicated to serving seniors.\n\nThere are some 28,000 homeless residents in this region. Thousands are senior citizens. Out of that population, just 11 homeless seniors -- Mr. Deloney among them -- found themselves quarantined inside St. Mary's Center in downtown Oakland. They were watched and worried over by a vigilant, exhausted staff of mostly volunteers who worked around the clock in masks and gloves serving meals, delivering medicine, changing sheets, cleaning toilets, sanitizing surfaces and doing their utmost to make sure no one from the infected world beyond the center's steel gates set foot inside.\n\n[Read about an outbreak at San Francisco's largest homeless shelter.]\n\n\"The good Lord takes care of the blind and crippled as well as the seniors,\" Mr. Deloney said as he gave an impromptu tour of the center's garden of blossoming trees and flowers.\n\n\"We don't think about the virus in here,\" he said.\n\nBut, in fact, the virus was about all Sharon Cornu could think about. As the executive director of St. Mary's, Ms. Cornu was all too aware of how the novel coronavirus is ravaging places where the elderly live in close quarters. Only weeks ago, men in hazmat suits were carrying bodies out of a nursing home in nearby Hayward, where scores of residents were infected.\n\nShe was no less fearful of what will happen if the virus begins to hopscotch through the Bay Area's vast shadow world of homeless encampments. How long, she wondered, could shelters like St. Mary's stay virus free? The question hit especially hard when officials disclosed that 96 residents in a homeless shelter in San Francisco had tested positive for Covid-19. In New York, at least 23 shelter residents have died from the outbreak.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. 4.4 million more workers file for unemployment. House will vote on a $484 billion relief plan, and McConnell suggests states declare bankruptcy. Jobless figures are set to soar, again. See more updates Updated 4m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"None of our procedures anticipated this scale of a global pandemic,\" Ms. Cornu said.\n\nThe full weight and meaning of this realization first coalesced within Ms. Cornu in mid-March when the order came for the entire Bay Area to shelter in place. At the time, she had 30 homeless seniors in her care at St. Mary's. They slept in cots a few feet from one another, and there wasn't near enough space to enforce proper social distancing.\n\n[Track every confirmed coronavirus case in California by county.]\n\nSo Ms. Cornu and her staff scrambled to move guests out of St. Mary's and into every nearby single-room apartment they could find. They sought to reunify others with relatives. Although they could arrange spots for only 19 people, their efforts created enough room to position cots at a safe distance for the remaining 11. Ms. Cornu also had much of her staff work from home, leaving only a skeleton crew of people like Janny Castillo, who found herself choking back tears when they discussed how to protect those who remained. Once homeless herself, Ms. Castillo was terrified of carrying the disease into St. Mary's.\n\n\"Homelessness is traumatic enough without a pandemic,\" she said. \"If I bring this virus back to our seniors, they probably won't make it.\"\n\nResearchers estimate homeless seniors will be up to three times as likely to die if infected by Covid-19. This is because homeless seniors have higher rates of chronic illnesses, and their bodies seem to age faster on the street. (Many develop frailties commonly seen in people 20 years older.) \"It's a crisis upon a crisis upon a crisis,\" said Margot Kushel, director of the Center for Vulnerable Populations at the University of California, San Francisco.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom has responded by securing 15,000 hotel rooms around the state for the homeless, with preference given to the elderly, those with symptoms and those who test positive. But according to the latest state figures, most of the rooms remain unused, which leaves thousands of homeless seniors either in the street or in shelters that offer none of St. Mary's special protections.\n\nNot far from St. Mary's is St. Vincent de Paul of Alameda County, an 80-bed shelter for the general population. On a rainy afternoon, a line formed under the building's awning, where Mary Hanna, 79, sat knitting on a milk crate. Ms. Hanna, a former English professor, always gets a bed at St. Vincent's -- she volunteers two hours a day to secure first pick. But the sleeping area, she said, is crowded. \"I hear coughing all night, and that worries me,\" she said.\n\nBack at St. Mary's, Mr. Deloney was taking advantage of the relative safety and comfort, even using the shelter's computers to take courses in automotive technology.\n\nBut for the small staff of St. Mary's, the stress of protecting and caring for 11 people week after week was becoming unbearable and unsustainable. They began searching for \"transitional housing'' where they could place their remaining clients, Mr. Deloney included. They began exploring how they could support their clients by delivering meals and medicine to their temporary homes.\n\n\"Like other shelter providers, as we learned of the challenges faced by hospitals and nursing homes in managing exposure to Covid-19, we determined that we were not equipped to continue providing a healthy environment and needed to move shelter residents to individual rooms,\" Ms. Cornu wrote in an email.\n\nBy April 7, the Bay Area's last refuge for homeless seniors sat empty, one more victim of Covid-19.\n\nDo you have a connection to a California nursing home?

        "body": "Dining rooms are reopening in many states, but that doesn't mean you should go. Before you decide, public health experts advise taking these steps.\n\nRestaurants are slowly returning in many states. Just because you can eat out again, though, does not mean that you should. And if you decide to go back before the virus is under control, it will not necessarily be clear which dining rooms are safest.\n\nRestaurants will have to navigate a situation that is new to them and to the rest of the world. New guidance for restaurant operators from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favors broad principles (\"Intensify cleaning, sanitization, disinfection and ventilation\") over specific standards.\n\n\"There really is no scientific study\" on the best ways for restaurants to reopen following a Covid-19 outbreak, said Dr. Robert W. Amler, dean of the School of Health Sciences and Practice at New York Medical College. Nevertheless, doctors and public health experts have some suggestions for handling the risks of dining out while the virus is still a threat.\n\nCheck your community's health.\n\nDining rooms are open again in several states that have not met the criteria for progress against the virus suggested by the White House for a phased reopening. The states' reopening is a public-policy decision, but going out to eat is a personal one. At the very least, you should check the latest data on coronavirus cases in your city or county before making up your mind.\n\n\"I would certainly want to have some awareness of how much transmission seems to be going on in my community,\" said Craig W. Hedberg, a professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Minnesota. \"So if you know that there are new cases continuing to be occurring every day in your community, you have to assume there's going to be a risk for transmission in public settings.\"\n\nKnow your personal risk.\n\nAnyone who has symptoms of Covid-19 or who has recently come into contact with someone who has had the virus should stay home, Dr. Hedberg said. As people leave home more often, gathering in groups will start to seem normal. But it will increase the risk of the virus spreading.\n\nAnyone who falls into one of the high-risk categories identified by the C.D.C. should be especially cautious about going out to restaurants. In particular, older people, which the agency defines as those age 65 and above, \"really do have to be extra careful, and their family members have to be extra careful,\" Dr. Amler said.\n\nAsk questions before you go.\n\nJust as you'd interview a babysitter you were thinking about hiring, you can quiz a restaurant's staff in advance about its safety practices, or look for a summary on its website or social media accounts.\n\nBenjamin Chapman, a professor and food safety specialist at North Carolina State University, who has collaborated on a training program to help restaurants in his state manage their response to the coronavirus, said that among the things he would hope to hear are: \"We're taking this seriously. We've trained our staff on how to wear masks, on the importance of hand washing and hand sanitizing. We've changed what we're doing to ensure that we're practicing social and physical distancing to keep you safe.\"\n\nLook around once you arrive.\n\nA fast glance can tell you a lot about how thoroughly the management has responded to the pandemic. \"A restaurant that looks exactly like it did before is probably not the kind of restaurant I want to go to,\" Dr. Chapman said.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Fears grow over new outbreaks as more states lift restrictions on bars, beauty shops and other businesses. The latest retail sales report depicts the largest two-month decline on record. Who's enforcing mask-wearing rules? Often it's retail workers. See more updates Updated 16m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAre the tables far apart? Will the chairs permit at least six feet of space between customers? Is the restaurant allowing staff or customers to gather in clusters?\n\n\"The biggest red flag would just be crowding,\" Dr. Hedberg said. \"If people are crowded near the entrance or around the bar, or there's a lot of interaction going on between staff and customers in close proximity, then obviously they're not operating in a mode that's designed to prevent transmission of the virus.\"\n\nConsider a table outside.\n\nThe virus spreads readily indoors, as shown by a study of a woman who appears to have transmitted it to nine other people who were eating in the same room of a restaurant in China. Recent evidence suggests that the risk of infection may be lower outdoors. Alfresco dining has other advantages. Dr. Chapman pointed out that there may be more space outside to spread out, and that all-weather furniture may be easier to rearrange than a fixed booth in a dining room.\n\nExpect face coverings.\n\nThe C.D.C. recommends wearing masks or cloth face coverings when out in public, to keep people who don't know they're sick from spreading the virus by respiratory droplets. This applies to restaurant workers. \"What that shows is that the business is really trying to take the idea of asymptomatic carriers of the virus seriously,\" Dr. Chapman said.\n\nEating a meal with a mask on is a challenge. Diners should arrive with face coverings, remove them temporarily to eat or drink, and put them on again before talking. A new study shows that in an unventilated room, droplets produced by normal conversation could linger in the air for as long as 14 minutes.\n\nDon't expect gloves.\n\nIn many places, the law already requires people who prepare food to wear gloves. That hasn't changed. For hosts and servers in the dining room, however, gloves are not necessary, and some experts believe they're a bad idea.\n\n\"The real problem is, over a period of time, if you're using these gloves, you're going to get a false sense of security,\" Dr. Amler said. \"It's better to be concerned about your hands' getting contaminated, and to be washing more frequently.\"\n\nBe conscious of shared surfaces.\n\nAlthough surface contact is not believed to be the primary way the virus spreads, experts still recommend being careful about surfaces that other people may have touched: tabletops, silverware and so forth. Looking at a chalkboard menu might be safer than picking up a laminated one.\n\nIf you do touch common surfaces, wash or sanitize your hands and don't touch your face. Thoughtful restaurateurs will provide sanitizer throughout the establishment, but it's a good idea to bring your own. If you need to wash your hands in the restroom, Dr. Hedberg suggested that its condition may give you an insight into the restaurant's overall commitment to a sanitary environment.\n\nPicking up a French fry or a burger with your bare hands is permissible, once you've taken care of personal hygiene. But you were probably doing that before the pandemic, too. \"You should always be washing your hands before you eat,\" Dr. Hedberg said.\n\nRelax, but not for long.\n\nAlthough we often go to restaurants so we can slow down, unwind and forget our worries, the pandemic makes a more businesslike approach advisable. \"The longer you stay in an area where there's this potential for transmission, the greater the likelihood that something could happen,\" Dr. Hedberg said.\n\nIn other words: If ever there was a time to eat and run, this is it.\n\nFollow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nROME -- When her middle-aged son got sick, Ruffina Pompei did what she had done for decades, bringing vegetable soup and freshly squeezed orange juice to his room. She slept in an armchair outside his room and changed his clothes. She told her husband, 89, to steer clear.\n\nBut the coronavirus tore through the apartment.\n\nHer son died in a hospital in the region of Abruzzo on March 29. Her husband died the next day in the same hospital. Ms. Pompei, 82, was also diagnosed with the virus.\n\n\"I could not leave him alone,\" she said of her son.\n\nBefore everyone else in the West, Italians received and largely obeyed an order to stay at home. \"I'm staying home\" became a hashtag, then the name of a national ordinance and then a motto hung from balconies and windows. But while staying home has worked, reducing the rate of infections, bringing down the daily toll of the dead and creating breathing room for hospitals, home has become a dangerous place for many Italians.\n\nItalian households represent \"the biggest reservoir of infections,\" said Massimo Galli, the director of the infectious diseases department at Luigi Sacco University Hospital in Milan. He called the cases \"the possible restarting point of the epidemic in case of a reopening.\"\n\nThe family acts as a multiplier, said Andrea Crisanti, the top scientific consultant on the virus in the Veneto region. \"This is a ticking time bomb,\" he said.\n\nThe predicament of home infections is emerging not just in Italy but in hot spots across the globe, in Queens and the Paris suburbs, as well as the working-class neighborhoods of Rome and Milan. It is also a problem that local officials and epidemiologists say is getting too little attention, particularly as the government has announced tentative steps toward reopening in early May.\n\nItaly's leading virologists now consider home infections, alongside clusters in retirement homes, to be a stubborn source of the country's contagion. Living together in close quarters and the failure to move the infected into dedicated quarantine facilities have, they say, paradoxically propped up the curve of infections that \"stay home\" measures were designed to suppress.\n\nThe problem is one the Chinese government bludgeoned quickly. It ordered the roundup of all residents in Wuhan infected with the coronavirus, warehousing them in quarantine camps, sometimes with little care. While that approach may have helped contain the virus, ripping people apart from their homes is anathema to Western democracies, especially Italy, where tight-knit families are the rule.\n\nItaly, like other Western democracies, has wrestled with the difficulty of balancing the containment of the virus with the economic, social and political costs of removing people without symptoms from their own homes. The government has not made isolating patients outside their homes a priority.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Britain expands coronavirus testing availability to all essential workers. Pakistani doctors warn that the country is loosening its lockdown too soon. Australia and New Zealand, whose leaders are political opposites, are quietly beating the virus. See more updates Updated 13m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\n\"As a doctor I would say let's put tanks in the streets and let's do a police state,\" said Guido Marinoni, the president of the Bergamo doctors' association. \"But the Western world has different realities.\"\n\nItaly has not enacted, or articulated, a clear national effort to prevent contagious people from infecting their households. The country has essentially accepted a controlled tragedy at home as it focuses on preventing a contagion from running like wildfire through the society at large.\n\n\"Domestic contagion is the lesser evil,\" said Giorgio Pal\u00f9, a former professor of virology and microbiology of the University of Padova and the former head of the European and Italian Society for Virology. Compared to unleashing the contagion on the streets, it was better to keep the virus in the family. \"At home,\" he said, \"I block it.\"\n\nSilvio Brusaferro, the president of Italy's national health institute, and one of the leading advisers to the Italian government in the crisis, acknowledged that homes were \"higher-risk places.\" What is essential is home infections ''do not spread further,\" he added.\n\nBut that offers little solace to the close-knit, multigenerational families decimated by the virus in their own homes -- to the infected sisters who lost their father and then saw their grandfather hospitalized in hard-hit Bergamo; to the Campanian hairdresser who lost both her parents; to the metalworker in Voghera who died days after losing his two sons.\n\nExperts have estimated that more than a million people in Italy could be infected with the virus at home. The persistence of cases is telling. Despite a nationwide drop in the number of new infections and deaths, Lombardy, which remains the Italian epicenter, announced nearly 4,000 new cases this week alone, with more than 700 deaths.\n\nMany public health officials say that the actual number of infections could be as many as 10 times that.\n\nFederico Ricci-Tersenghi, a scientist at the University of Rome La Sapienza who specializes in theoretical modeling, said that stemming the contagion required facilities like in China dedicated to isolating positive cases.\n\n\"Staying home is not the solution, not for the economy or for the epidemic,\" he said. \"To reopen without having this in place is very risky. It's probable that the epidemic will start up again.\"\n\nWhen a delegation of Chinese doctors came to Italy in March, they emphasized the importance of prefabricated structures with a high number of beds to isolate all the positive cases.\n\n\"They explained that it was essential to separate positive cases from the family,\" recalled Giampietro Rupolo, the president of the Red Cross in Padua, who was among those who greeted them. \"Otherwise it was harder to contain.\"\n\nBut Italian officials have clearly determined that housing the infected in dedicated facilities is not feasible.\n\nGiovanni Rezza, director of infectious diseases at the national health institute, said that the government did not think that a centralized effort was \"feasible, possible, appreciated.\"\n\nItalian media have reported that the government is considering making the lifting of lockdowns in Italy's regions contingent on local authorities providing quarantine facilities for the infected. Experts have also emphasized the importance of contact tracing and early diagnoses, since contagion can also happen before a patient starts showing symptoms.\n\nFor now, however, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has largely steered clear of the issue of home infection. A government decree in March allowed local authorities to seize hotels to host patients who cannot safely self-isolate at home. But, as is the case with many of the government decrees, it is being interpreted and implemented differently around the country.\n\nIn most cases, only people with confirmed cases can go to dedicated hotel rooms. But the hotel rooms are not available everywhere, and neither are tests for the virus, which in the hardest-hit places are given only to people who have been hospitalized.\n\nOfficials in Tuscany have urged people who left the hospital with mild symptoms to isolate in converted hotels. But urge is all they could do, and by mid-April only 200 had chosen the facilities. Others preferred to sign a document declaring they would self-isolate at home. In Milan, the Michelangelo Hotel, set aside for residents with positive coronavirus test results, was far from full.\n\nIn Bergamo, the hardest-hit part of Italy, there are only 400 spots set aside in local hotels for an infected population at home estimated to be around 65,000, according to the local doctors' association.\n\nWorking-class Italians often face the hardest choices.\n\nIn the southern region of Calabria, Paolina Mazza, 63, who has the coronavirus, self-isolated at home after her husband was hospitalized with the virus. She expressed frustration that authorities gave her no alternative but to go home, where she tried to keep some distance from her son, 39.\n\n\"We don't have a second house to isolate and they live in a tiny apartment,\" her daughter Daniela said. \"We are constantly scared.\"\n\nEven some doctors considered the infection of their own families as inevitable.\n\nFederica Brena, a 35-year-old doctor in the coronavirus ward of Bergamo's Humanitas Gavazzeni hospital, came down with symptoms and immediately diagnosed herself and self-isolated at home, with her husband and 1-year-old son.\n\n\"The ideal option would have been to never go back home,\" she said. \"It was obvious that I would infect the two of them.\"\n\nHer son came down with a fever and a cough. Her husband also got sick a few days later, and his fever did not go down for 12 days. \"Living in a home with other people, for as much as one tries to isolate, it's hard,\" she said, adding everyone was improving. \"Especially if you don't live in a palace.\"\n\nSelf-isolating was also especially difficult for older people, who often need special care and attention.\n\nIn late February, Emanuele Visigalli and his brother looked after their mother, 79, who had come down with a cough and temperature in the Lombardy town of Fombio, near the country's initial outbreak.\n\nHe tried to get her hospitalized, but dispatchers from the coronavirus hotline suggested she self-isolate at home. The idea of abandoning them, he said, was impossible.\n\nAn ambulance first came for his mother. Then for his father, 81. Then, a week later, another came for him. Both his parents died in the hospital, but he improved and doctors sent him home.\n\nHe said he did not hug his children or kiss his wife when he got back, and started sleeping in a separate room that his wife disinfected every day.\n\n\"At the dinner table, I sit on one side of the table and they all sit on the other side,\" he said. Looking out his window, he said he grew upset by the people walking the streets. \"What is their problem with staying at home?\"",

        "body": "As states reopen, experts say socially distant outdoor activities, like swimming or running along the shore, are some of the safer ways to re-engage with the world. Here, tips for how to enjoy the beach now.\n\nAs climbing temperatures herald summer's return, cities and states around the United States are beginning the stilted process of reopening. In many places, that means a chance to return to the beach. Texas state beaches were ordered to reopen on May 1; now state beaches in Florida, Oregon and California are also starting to reopen. On the East Coast, New York, New Jersey, Delaware and Connecticut recently announced plans to reopen state beaches by the Memorial Day weekend, though with limits on capacity and other measures. (Cities, counties and other municipalities may have different restrictions; New York City's 14 miles of public beaches, for example, remain closed.)\n\nFor those concerned about their safety during the coronavirus pandemic, the current consensus is that socially distant outdoor activities are some of the safer ways to re-engage with the world.\n\n\"Outdoor settings, like beaches, are less likely to spread the virus than indoor settings,\" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security.\n\nProfessor Linsey Marr, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech who specializes in the airborne transmission of infectious diseases, agrees that a beach visit should be fine -- as long as you are able to maintain social distancing.\n\n\"The good news is that the virus dies off relatively quickly in direct sunlight,\" she said. \"There's often some wind at the beach, which really helps disperse the virus particles in the air.\"\n\nBut no activity is going to be completely risk-free.\n\n\"The steps you take are not going to be one-size-fits-all; it depends on your individual risk tolerance,\" said Dr. Adalja.\n\nHere are five things to keep in mind when planning a beach day.\n\nGetting there\n\nRead up on local rules and regulations\n\nLike most things in the time of Covid-19, rules governing beach access, use and safety change frequently and likely differ depending on your state, city and even your beach.\n\n\"We're in a very dynamic place right now in terms of beach access,\" said Dr. Chad Nelsen, chief executive officer of Surfrider Foundation, a nonprofit organization that has been compiling resources and providing recommendations regarding water quality and beach safety with regards to Covid-19. The group also works with coastal communities on opening beaches safely.\n\nStart by learning the regulations of your area and your beach by accessing government websites for your city or county. And consider how far along your local area is in terms of reopening.\n\n\"If your community is still in active mitigation mode, plan on being extra cautious,\" said Christine Stratton, president and chief executive officer of the National Recreation and Park Association, a nonprofit organization that recently published guidelines for phased re-openings of public spaces, including beaches.\n\nYou should expect new rules this season. Picnicking might be allowed, or beach access may be for recreation only. Masks might be required and entries may be timed. Parking lots, public bathrooms and concession stands may or may not be open, or offer only limited access.\n\nOther resources to tap include websites for your local parks and recreation or public health department, the local beach manager or your local lifeguard department.\n\nConsider your day, and your beach's geography\n\nThe varied regulations are because of the diversity of beaches across the United States and the likelihood of crowds.\n\n\"Local context matters,\" Dr. Nelsen said. \"The U.S. coastline is hugely varied in terms of its geography and population. You could go up to Oregon, or Northern California, and be at a beach all day alone. Urban beaches in Southern California or Miami are a different story.\"\n\nDensely crowded beaches make maintaining six feet of distance more difficult, and increase the likelihood of more sustained exposure to the virus. You may need to navigate a crowded parking lot, or take a narrow path or stairway to access the sand.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Modelers find that tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Scientists express cautious optimism about developing a vaccine quickly. See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"Make an informed judgment: 'Does it seem like the beach is on the busy side?\" Ms. Stratton said. \"If you're pulling up to a beach and the parking lot is full, our recommendation is that you find a less-populated spot.\"\n\nProfessor Marr suggests vetting beaches beforehand via a webcam, if possible, to assess the crowd.\n\nSafety at the shore\n\nStay moving or stay far away\n\nKeeping your hands clean, avoiding touching your face and, of course, maintaining at least six feet of social distance are as paramount at the beach as they are anywhere else.\n\n\"If it's a crowded beach with people playing games, or parties mixing with other parties, there is always a risk of transmission,\" said Dr. Adalja. \"There will be people who think that risk is acceptable, others who don't, especially at at-risk populations.\"\n\nSurfrider's current recommendations encourage beachgoers to \"keep it moving.\" The N.R.P.A. similarly recommends that, in these early days of reopening, it's safer to plan on shorter, recreation-driven visits.\n\n\"If you're out swimming or paddling, walking or running, it's going to be easier to avoid the packed towel-to-towel beach crowd,\" Dr. Nelsen said. A recreation-only policy is currently in place in Los Angeles County; similar policies tend to prohibit beachgoers from bringing chairs, umbrellas, coolers, barbecues and other gear (again, check on the latest status at your local beach before going).\n\nDr. Adalja agrees that being on the move is, over all, a safer proposition: \"If people are running by each other, the virus can't magically transport from one person to another,\" he said, noting that the highest risk for exposure comes from spending anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes within six feet of another person.\n\nWhen you are in and near the water, there may be fewer lifeguards than usual, or none at all.\n\n\"Many of our parks and rec agencies are already affecting budget cuts, there's a real risk of not being able to staff beaches with required lifeguards,\" Ms. Stratton said. \"There may be continued beach closings, both out of concerns for public health, and because of limitations of staffing, recruiting and training.\"\n\nWhen lifeguards are present, keep in mind that you are not only exercising caution for your sake, but for theirs, too -- fewer lifesaving situations means less exposure for them.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\n\"We're trying to keep the lifeguards up in the stands as much as possible, and in a safe, socially distant place,\" said Tom Gill, vice president of the United States Lifesaving Association. \"The less they have to interact with the public, especially in an emergency situation, the safer everyone's going to be.\"\n\nEnjoy your swim and your own beach gear\n\nWhile much about transmissibility of the coronavirus remains unclear, waterborne transmission appears to be less likely.\n\nAs for other surfaces you might encounter at the beach, such as rental beach chairs and kayaks, or even beach toys, Ms. Stratton urges caution in all regards.\n\n\"We strongly discourage sharing equipment outside of your household -- throwing a Frisbee, or tossing a ball around,\" she said. \"Before you rent equipment, ask the question: was this item cleaned and disinfected in between uses? If not, the recommendation would be to not use equipment.\"\n\nYour own chairs should not be an immediate risk factor -- assuming six feet of social distancing can be maintained -- as there is no evidence pointing to easy transmission in the sand. To be safe, clean your beach equipment with household disinfectants when you return home.\n\nAnd take your garbage home too. Single-use plastics have been on the rise, and beaches are taking the hit -- after some in Florida reopened, nearly 12,000 pounds of trash were left behind according to news reports. But pandemics don't render environmental concerns irrelevant. If there is no trash collection or it appears to be overwhelmed, take your trash home with you to dispose of accordingly.\n\n\"Our municipalities are going to be incredibly challenged from a budget perspective,\" Ms. Stratton said. \"Rather than leave trash in receptacles that are overflowing, do your part and carry it out.\"\n\nAbout those restrooms ...\n\nPublic restrooms are a tough topic these days. They have high-touch, frequently shared surfaces, and some reports also cite a possibility of transmission via an aerosolized \"toilet plume.\"\n\nRecommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for public restrooms include guidelines for regular cleaning and disinfection, operational toilets and well-stocked handwashing supplies. But beachgoers should check out facilities when they first arrive, to see if restrooms are clean and can allow for social distancing.\n\n\"We, of course, are recommending that municipalities and parks and recreation maintain facilities, but beachgoers should not assume that that's the case,\" Ms. Stratton of the N.R.P.A. said.\n\nIt's always wise to bring hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes, wear a mask, close the lid of the toilet when you flush, if possible, and thoroughly wash your hands.\n\nThe safest course: Keep your beach visit short enough that using public restrooms won't be necessary -- use the bathroom, and change into your swimsuit, before you leave home.\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

        "body": "ROME -- Cooped up, stir crazy and desperate for their lives back, many Europeans and Americans have seized on antibodies and their promise of potential immunity to the coronavirus as the golden ticket to reopen societies and economies.\n\nNot long ago, politicians in Italy -- which, as the epicenter of Europe's contagion, is further in the pandemic's cycle than other Western nations -- proposed issuing licenses to those who had beaten the virus and developed the right antibodies to get back to work.\n\nResearchers and politicians in China, the United States, Germany, Britain and beyond have latched onto antibodies as a potential solution to the virus and an outlet from containment measures.\n\nBut that talk, always ahead of the science, has grown more muted in recent weeks. With the research refusing to cooperate, experts in Italy say the promise of antibodies may not be what people have imagined. At least for now.\n\n\"We don't know if everyone who has had the disease has developed an acceptable protective immunity,\" said Dr. Alessandro Venturi, the president of the San Matteo hospital in the Lombardy town of Pavia. The hospital validated the antibody screening test used for mapping the virus in Lombardy, Italy's hardest hit region.\n\nInfected people develop different quantities of antibodies, and researchers are still studying the level that offers protection, and for how long.\n\n\"We don't know how long they last,\" Dr. Venturi said. ''This is the central point.\"\n\nThat is tough news not only for Italy, which is loosening its lockdown on Monday, but for the rest of the world.\n\nItaly's government will soon start testing 150,000 people for antibodies for a \"sample survey on the spread of the infection,\" according to its website.\n\nMany regions, including Lombardy and Veneto, are still doing such screenings. But whereas last month the presidents of those regions promoted the idea of issuing licenses to members of an immune work force, now they have downgraded the tests from panacea to a research tool.\n\n\"Immunity licenses are just rubbish,\" said Mario Plebani, the coordinator of the antibody tests for the Veneto region.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Nations confront the possibility that reopening may be harder than locking down. Boris Johnson said he received 'liters and liters of oxygen' while hospitalized with the virus. Pompeo asserts 'enormous evidence' ties the virus to a Wuhan lab, a claim not backed yet by U.S. intelligence. See more updates Updated 9m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nPoliticians and experts have tried to lower expectations. But that has not stopped citizens, desperate to know if they have had the virus and are protected from it, and companies, eager to return to normalcy, from flocking to antibody screenings.\n\nMany businesses in the region have been paying for employees to get the tests, so that they could go back to work if they tested negative for the virus or positive for the antibodies.\n\nDr. Venturi said those tests were essentially \"useless\" because they did not describe whether a person had the right level of antibodies and because no one knew yet how long they lasted.\n\nSome virologists said they worried that all the hype around antibodies would lead to bad behavior among those who consider themselves invincible, thus leading to more infections.\n\n\"I am very worried that the irresponsible use of serological tests will jeopardize phase two,\" the start of Italy's reopening, Dr. Alberto Mantovani, a leading Italian immunologist, told the TV channel Sky TG24 last week.\n\nBut Dr. Venturi said antibodies with the ability to neutralize the virus still had important functions, including for developing plasma that could aid patients, and still held the potential for breakthroughs that could eventually help Italy reopen more fully.\n\nHis Humanitas research hospital near Milan treated Italy's first known coronavirus patient and has deep experience with the virus. It has been examining the 2 or 3 percent of people in the region who swab tests show are actively infected but whose blood also contains the antibodies -- known as immunoglobulin G, or IgG, antibodies -- that should neutralize the virus. In other words, these people are no longer contagious.\n\nIn those cases, Dr. Venturi said, the virus did not replicate and cause a broader infection.\n\n\"It means it's not contagious,\" he said, adding that the hospital's study is being scaled up as its researchers seek 200 such cases from throughout Lombardy, where they estimate 10 percent of the roughly 10 million residents have contracted the virus.\n\nLocating those cases has not been easy considering the rarity of finding someone who has both the desired antibodies and the virus contemporaneously.\n\nResults will take weeks more, but if confirmed, he said, it would show that people who test positive for an adequate level of neutralizing IgG antibodies do not pose a danger of contagion.\n\nIn theory, even those lucky few would not need to wait for two consecutive negative swab tests -- which sometimes take months -- before being released from quarantine and allowed back to work. \"It would be like a negative test result,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, though, Dr. Venturi said it was impossible to consider a work force made up only of people showing neutralizing antibodies.\n\nInstead, he said, Italy's reopening phase needs to rely on uninfected people, which he considered to be 90 percent of the population, and on social distancing and other protective measures.\n\nIn talking about immunity licenses, he said, politicians have \"gotten ahead of themselves.\"\n\nThis past week, the office of Lombardy's president, Attilio Fontana, who had predicted that immunity licenses would be in place by April 21, said everyone still needed to follow recommended lockdown measures.\n\n\"There is no immunity license,\" Giulio Gallera, the region's top health official, said.\n\nStill, as some mayors continue to promote antibody tests as a possible way out of lockdown, people have waited for hours in gymnasiums to have their blood drawn.\n\nPaolo Passaggio, 45, an exporter of home appliances, jumped at the chance when the mayor of his small Lombardy town, Robbio, recently offered antibody screening.\n\n\"I did it to free myself of this doubt,\" said Mr. Passaggio, who last month showed Covid-19 symptoms, including a low fever. Unable to get tested for the virus, as swabs are generally reserved for the hospitalized, he took precautions to avoid contaminating others, including staying isolated for weeks.\n\nLast Tuesday he got the results: high levels of immunoglobulin G, or IgG, antibodies. Mr. Passaggio said he understood from doctors on television that it meant a degree of immunity, confidence he was not a danger to others and that he could possibly \"go to work before someone else.\"\n\nHealth experts say that is far from clear. But in any case, Mr. Passaggio said he did not plan to alter his behavior drastically. While he aimed to see his elderly parents for the first time in months, he expected to stay in the yard and wear a mask.\n\nSome of Italy's mayors, furious that testing for the virus has not been more widespread, argue that antibody screening is important psychologically, scientifically and practically. They have clung to the hope that immunity licenses will become available to those with the right antibodies.\n\n\"We were the trailblazers,\" said Roberto Francese, the mayor of Robbio, which began testing in April. \"Now, everybody is doing it.\"\n\nMr. Francese said that a month ago, 50 people in the town showed clear symptoms of the virus, but that the health authorities failed to test them. They got sick, and then their relatives got sick and cases kept building.\n\nThe town, out of desperation, tracked down serological tests offered by a Chinese factory that the mayor said had an 96 percent accuracy rate, and which he said Italy's national research center had approved.\n\nRobbio has already tested about half of its residents and found and isolated many positive cases, about half of whom had symptoms, he said. He also said that the tests had shown 12 percent had IgG antibodies.\n\nHe said he considered those people \"immune and thus would be eligible\" for an eventual immunity license, despite health experts' doubts.\n\nMayor Luca Dure' of Cisliano, also in Lombardy, said tests showing the presence of protective antibodies would \"determine a sort of license of immunity\" at some point in the phase of reopening beginning on Monday.\n\n\"We don't know how long, but surely for some months, they can remain in the blood for a year or two,\" he said, calling this \"surely a positive thing.\"\n\nEven someone with IgG antibodies must act responsibly, Mr. Dure' said.\n\n\"It's not like a person can go to the theater or dancing at the disco,\" he said, but people could feel a measure of safety.\n\n\"We cannot wait anymore,\" he said.\n\nEmma Bubola contributed reporting from Milan.",

        "body": "NAIROBI, Kenya -- When Valentine Ochogo arrived home in Kenya after being laid off from her job at a hot-air balloon business in Dubai, she was put in quarantine in a university dormitory with other travelers -- one step in the government's aggressive, often-lauded campaign to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nBut instead of the mandated 14-day quarantine period, she was confined for 32 days, often cold, hungry and so frightened that she said she blocked the door at night with an empty bed. Although she tested negative for the coronavirus three times, she said that government officials would not release her until she paid $434 in fees.\n\nAfter she managed to negotiate the amount down to $65, Ms. Ochogo, 26, was freed.\n\n\"Am out,\" a relieved Ms. Ochogo texted on April 24, saying later, \"I got really lucky.\"\n\nKenya's government is now facing mounting criticism for its response to the pandemic -- particularly its use of quarantine centers.\n\nCitizens stopped by the police for violating curfew or not wearing masks have been sent not to police stations, but to quarantine, sometimes held in compounds with people known to be infected.\n\n\"During an emergency like this, you need to be persuading people to cooperate rather than coercing them, especially if your argument is that it is in their best interest,\" said Dr. Lukoye Atwoli, associate professor at Moi University's School of Medicine and the vice president of the Kenya Medical Association.\n\nIn interviews, seven people in quarantine or just released accused the government of putting them in unsanitary isolation units, holding them longer than 14 days, giving them inadequate food and water and failing to inform them of their coronavirus test results. Many say they were held until they paid hefty bills.\n\nAfter 50 people broke out of a quarantine center in Nairobi last month, the government was forced to respond: on Wednesday, the Health Ministry announced that it would stop requiring people in quarantine to pay fees because the policy was deterring people from coming forward for testing.\n\nAnother policy change was announced last Sunday: officials will put curfew breakers in a designated \"holding place\" -- not into quarantine.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Celebrations commemorating the end of World War II in Europe are subdued in a continent under lockdown.

In the first 10 days of the curfew, Kenyan police officers killed at least six people while trying to enforce the lockdown, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nAnd the virus continues to spread. Officials on Wednesday imposed lockdowns on one neighborhood in Nairobi and another in Mombasa where the virus is said to be proliferating.\n\nEven as the Health Ministry has urged citizens to come forward for testing, government officials elsewhere have said they would force residents to undergo mass testing.\n\nBut experts said the poor treatment of those held in quarantine centers could discourage people from reporting symptoms or volunteering for testing.\n\nThose like Ms. Ochogo, who arrived back in Kenya in late March, said their problems began at the airport in Nairobi, with serpentine queues to get through immigration, passengers jostling one another and officials failing to enforce social distancing.\n\nMany arrivals from the Middle East were blue-collar workers, like nannies and drivers.\n\nThose who could pay were escorted to hotels, but others were taken to government facilities and told their stays would be free, several said.\n\nMs. Ochogo said that she and more than two dozen passengers boarded a bus, with no protective gear, and were first driven to a facility that was full. Around midnight, they finally arrived at the dormitories of Kenyatta University, where law enforcement officers with no masks, gloves or hand sanitizers helped unload their bags. Ms. Ochogo said no guidelines or instructions were provided.\n\nShe took her room keys and went to bed.\n\nAt another quarantine center in Nairobi, established at Mbagathi Hospital, Shabu Mwangi said he faced officials who berated him for having traveled to Italy -- in mid-January. He had voluntarily gone to the quarantine center with flu symptoms a day after he arrived in Kenya in March.\n\nLeft to sit in his car for an hour, medics arrived. But, said Mr. Mwangi, a 35-year-old artist, \"Their big concern was, 'Why did you go to Europe?'\"\n\nFor the three days he awaited test results, he said he was put in the same room with nine men where they freely mingled and even borrowed phone chargers from one another. Doctors gave him no medicine, he said. And while he tested negative, a Burundian in the room tested positive, he said.\n\nGospel musician Eko Dydda was among hundreds of people put in quarantine for defying the evening curfew. He said he was arrested while fetching medicine for his sick wife. After spending a night in jail and three days in quarantine, Mr. Dydda was released following a public uproar.\n\n\"Quarantine can't be a response to people breaking the law,\" said George Kegoro, the executive director of the Kenya Human Rights Commission, a nongovernmental organization, \"because what it does, it exposes them to the possibility of infection, the very thing you are trying to fight.\"\n\nAs more people were admitted into quarantine centers established in high school dorms and other government buildings, the chorus of disapproval in the country grew. People posted photos and videos on social media of dirty and broken toilets in overcrowded facilities, where some slept on the ground covered in flimsy sheets.\n\nBut even some people confined in hotels claimed they were denied food, because they had not paid fees. Others complained that they ran out of medications.\n\nThe Kenya Legal and Ethical Issues Network, a nongovernmental organization, and the nonprofit Katiba Institute along with seven people who say they were held in quarantine have filed a lawsuit against the government for violating the human rights of those held in mandatory quarantine.\n\nAlmost three weeks into her stay at Kenyatta University, Mr. Ochogo said she suffered an anxiety attack. As she cried for hours, she said she called and texted health officials for help. They promised to come, but no one did.\n\nWhen officials presented people with bills sometimes totaling hundreds of dollars, demanding payment before they could leave, those in quarantine in places like Kenyatta University staged public protests.\n\n\"We left Dubai because we didn't have jobs,\" said Ms. Ochogo, who had $200 with her when she arrived.\n\nShe and others confronted health officials about the payments and the delays in their discharge.\n\n\"I was told I was rude and somehow, they wanted to deal with me,\" she said. \"They had told us they had marked us.\"\n\nWhen a threatening security officer in the center used a ruse to learn her full name, she pushed a spare bed in her room against the door at night: \"I was afraid for my life.\"\n\nKenya's laws say that placing a person in quarantine should involve a doctor and a magistrate, said Mr. Kegoro of the Kenya Human Rights Commission. The cost of isolation, he added, should also by law be borne by the state.\n\n\"The government has a law. It has put it to one side,\" Mr. Kegoro said of the recent decisions to make poor Kenyans pay. \"We can't tell where their powers are coming from.\"\n\nDays after returning home, Ms. Ochogo said she was still numb from her quarantine ordeal.\n\n\"I don't even recognize myself,\" she recently said over the phone. \"I can't do the things I used to do. I am still struggling to sleep at night.\"",

        "body": "A medida que los restaurantes vuelven a abrir lentamente, los propietarios se esfuerzan por reducir los riesgos y tranquilizar a los clientes con una variedad de medidas. Las mascarillas marcan el camino.\n\nReg\u00edstrate para recibir nuestro bolet\u00edn con lo mejor de The New York Times.\n\nATLANTA -- La otra noche com\u00ed en un asadero. Nunca me hab\u00eda sentido tan feliz de ver una ensalada Wedge en mi vida.\n\nNo hab\u00eda visitado un restaurante desde el 15 de marzo, unos d\u00edas antes de que el alcalde de Atlanta ordenara el cierre de todos los comedores. El 27 de abril, Georgia se convirti\u00f3 en el segundo estado de Estados Unidos, despu\u00e9s de Alaska, en permitir la reapertura de los restaurantes desde el inicio de la pandemia. Chops, un restaurante de 31 a\u00f1os de antig\u00fcedad que es un templo de las cuentas de gasto en el vecindario de Buckhead, fue uno de los primeros en poner su negocio en marcha de nuevo.\n\nMi mesero, Roberto Velasco, se ve\u00eda tan feliz de estar trabajando como yo de estar sentada en un restaurante. Al menos eso parec\u00eda. Era dif\u00edcil saberlo con la mascarilla.\n\nPara muchas personas, la idea de comer en un restaurante sigue pareciendo aterradora. Para m\u00ed lo fue. Me sent\u00e9 en una mesa en la parte trasera y me pregunt\u00e9 si el coronavirus estar\u00eda flotando en el aire acondicionado o si uno de los comensales que orden\u00f3 un cabernet en una mesa a tres metros de distancia ser\u00eda portador. En cuanto al servicio de valet, \u00bfes broma?\n\nNo obstante, la mascarilla de Velasco, junto con sus visitas constantes a una botella de desinfectante de manos bastante visible, calmaron mi ansiedad. Cuando llegaron el rib-eye t\u00e9rmino medio rojo y el platillo de esp\u00e1rragos, me sent\u00ed tan fascinada como Dorothy en un campo de amapolas.\n\nLos restaurantes est\u00e1n comenzando a abrir de manera intermitente en Estados Unidos, guiados por una mezcolanza de leyes federales, estatales y locales y recomendaciones que parecen cambiar a diario. Los propietarios de restaurantes deben establecer sus propias pr\u00e1cticas e idear formas de reducir el riesgo para la salud que les proporcionen seguridad a unos clientes sin alejar a otros.\n\nContra ese panorama, es dif\u00edcil saber c\u00f3mo ser\u00e1 el nuevo rostro de la hosteler\u00eda estadounidense, pero es probable que utilice mascarilla.\n\nLa mascarilla es la herramienta m\u00e1s utilizada, y tal vez divisiva, de un arsenal de medidas de protecci\u00f3n, como los men\u00fas desechables y las separaciones de pl\u00e1stico que los restaurantes est\u00e1n incorporando a una cultura emergente de hosteleria en plena pandemia.\n\nLa mascarilla se ha convertido en parte del equipo est\u00e1ndar desde los niveles m\u00e1s altos de la gastronom\u00eda hasta los m\u00e1s bajos. Los ejecutivos de Burger King est\u00e1n revisando dise\u00f1os de mascarillas que podr\u00edan convertirse en parte del uniforme est\u00e1ndar. En The Inn at Little Washington, un restaurante con tres estrellas Michelin en el condado de Rappahannock, Virginia, el chef Patrick O'Connell ha ordenado la elaboraci\u00f3n de mascarillas personalizadas con dise\u00f1os de las sonrisas de Marilyn Monroe y George Washington, previendo la reapertura el 29 de mayo.\n\n\"Es evidente que la gente necesita salir y no quiere entrar a un entorno que aumente su ansiedad\", se\u00f1al\u00f3. \"Quieren algo que disipe el momento que estamos viviendo\".\n\n(O'Connell ir\u00e1 a\u00fan m\u00e1s lejos: para ayudar a contrarrestar la \u00e1rida apariencia de un restaurante a medio cupo, como lo solicita el estado para cumplir con el distanciamiento social, sentar\u00e1 en las sillas vac\u00edas a maniqu\u00edes vestidos con atuendos de la d\u00e9cada de 1940. \"Siempre me han gustado los maniqu\u00edes\", dijo).\n\nPara algunos comensales, ver que el personal usa mascarillas es un consuelo. Para otros, estas provocan ansiedad, dijo. Si los comensales solicitan que los atienda un camarero sin mascarilla y hay alguno dispuesto, el restaurante acceder\u00e1.\n\n\"Invitamos a todos nuestros clientes a que se diviertan como gusten\", dijo O'Connell. \"Nuestro principal objetivo, siempre, es ser sanadores. Hemos creado un santuario, un lugar reconfortante, y para algunas personas una mascarilla es s\u00edmbolo de eso, pero para otras no\".\n\nLas mascarillas pueden ser un punto pol\u00edtico \u00e1lgido. El D\u00eda de la Madre, cientos de personas sin mascarillas se congregaron en el C & C Breakfast & Korean Kitchen en Castle Rock, Colorado, al sur de Denver, para una fiesta de protesta organizada por los due\u00f1os, quienes dijeron que el gobierno estatal se ha sobrepasado al limitar a los restaurantes a los servicios para llevar y a domicilio, y al exigir que los trabajadores usen mascarillas. El departamento de salud del estado cerr\u00f3 el restaurante al d\u00eda siguiente.\n\nEn Texas se recomiendan las mascarillas, pero no son obligatorias, aunque algunas leyes locales son m\u00e1s estrictas. El Hillstone Restaurant Group, que administra 45 restaurantes en varios estados, decidi\u00f3 que sus empleados en Texas no usar\u00edan mascarillas, en parte porque el accesorio para la cara no coincide con el estilo del servicio. Un empleado present\u00f3 una demanda; un juez emiti\u00f3 una orden de restricci\u00f3n temporal y se espera su decisi\u00f3n final. Eso, y la creciente presi\u00f3n en las redes sociales, llev\u00f3 a un cambio en las pol\u00edticas.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Medical experts show cautious optimism that a coronavirus vaccine will be ready sometime next year. A prototype vaccine has protected monkeys from the virus, researches have found.

Davis consigui\u00f3 la primera reservaci\u00f3n en Soby's New South Cuisine, en Greensville, Carolina del Sur, cuando reabri\u00f3 el 11 de mayo. No pod\u00eda esperar para comer una orden de tomates verdes fritos de la casa. Pero le habr\u00eda gustado ver la cara de la persona que lo atendi\u00f3.\n\n\"En lo personal, me habr\u00eda sentido bien si no hubieran usado mascarillas\", dijo. \"Entiendo por qu\u00e9 lo hac\u00edan, pero gran parte de la experiencia de cenar en los restaurantes es la calidez, que a veces es m\u00e1s importante que la comida. Es dif\u00edcil negar el hecho de que ver el rostro del camarero es parte de eso\".\n\nDavis no us\u00f3 mascarilla en el restaurante, y tampoco lo us\u00f3 ninguno de mis compa\u00f1eros comensales en el asadero Chops Steakhouse.\n\nNo obstante, las mascarillas son parte de lo que hizo que Tonia Wilson se sintiera c\u00f3moda cuando se sent\u00f3 en Goldbergs Fine Foods en Atlanta el jueves de la semana pasada para comer una orden de refrito de carne curada con papas.\n\nWilson llevaba una mascarilla al entrar y se alegr\u00f3 de que Ola Garc\u00eda, su mesera, tambi\u00e9n trajera puesta una. A ambas se les revis\u00f3 la temperatura al llegar, a Garc\u00eda antes de empezar su turno y a Wilson en la puerta del establecimiento.\n\n\"No como en cualquier sitio, y no voy a ir a otros lugares que han abierto\", afirm\u00f3 Wilson. \"Pero he visitado este lugar suficientes veces y veo c\u00f3mo hacen la limpieza, usan guantes y mascarilla, y as\u00ed s\u00e9 que estoy a salvo\".\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nWhat should I do with my 401(k)?\n\nWatching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions -- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that \"free money.\"\n\nLos restaurantes est\u00e1n experimentando con varias formas de mantener seguros a los comensales y empleados, y afirman que la desinfecci\u00f3n se toma en serio. Un lugar para desayunar en Ohio colg\u00f3 cortinas de ba\u00f1o de pl\u00e1stico transparentes y lavables entre las mesas. Un restaurante de Atlanta les pide a sus meseros que se pongan guantes de diferentes colores cada vez que se dirigen a una mesa, para garantizarles a los comensales que los guantes est\u00e1n limpios.\n\nPara otros comensales, ni todos los camareros con mascarilla ni divisores de plexigl\u00e1s del mundo podr\u00edan convencerlos de ir a un restaurante todav\u00eda.\n\n\"No es un asunto de falta de confianza en ellos, sino en los idiotas que visitan el lugar\", dijo Dale Benerofe, un trabajador de la salud de Atlanta que sol\u00eda comer fuera dos o tres veces a la semana. \"Quiero que los restaurantes abran. De verdad que s\u00ed, pero no ahora. Es demasiado estresante\".\n\nIncluso Danny Meyer, quien escribi\u00f3 un libro sobre hosteler\u00eda, dijo en una entrevista reciente que no ten\u00eda inter\u00e9s en reabrir sus restaurantes de alta cocina si la capacidad se redujera tanto que no fuera rentable y el riesgo de contraer el virus fuese tan alto que la toma de temperatura y las mascarillas tuvieran que incluirse en el servicio.\n\n\"Con lo que estamos lidiando, todos nosotros, es el miedo\", me dijo la semana pasada. \"Siempre he cre\u00eddo que la hosteler\u00eda es el ant\u00eddoto contra el miedo. En lo que realmente somos muy, muy buenos es en dar la bienvenida a las personas y hacerlas sentir bien alrededor de una mesa. Pero esa herramienta ha sido arrebatada de nuestras manos\".\n\nAlgunos dicen que los signos visibles de higiene, incluidas las mascarillas, simplemente se convertir\u00e1n en la nueva marca de la hosteler\u00eda, al igual que los c\u00f3digos de salud, los requisitos de licencia o los avances en tecnolog\u00eda como las reservas en l\u00ednea son parte de la operaci\u00f3n.\n\n\"Ahora, la hosteler\u00eda significa que tendr\u00e1s que demostrar estas cosas\", dice Alex Susskind, profesor en la Universidad de Cornell y director de su instituto de alimentos y bebidas.\n\nTodo esto puede ser desconcertante para los due\u00f1os de los restaurantes, mientras intentan equilibrar la seguridad con las expectativas del cliente.\n\nCraig Richards es el chef de Lyla Lila, un restaurante de gastronom\u00eda del sur de Europa que se convirti\u00f3 en un \u00e9xito instant\u00e1neo cuando abri\u00f3 en Atlanta en diciembre. Ha estado encuestando a sus clientes en Facebook e intercambiando notas con otros chefs que, como \u00e9l, esperan reabrir en las pr\u00f3ximas semanas.\n\n\"He dicho desde el principio que queremos que nuestro restaurante fuera un respiro de la vida diaria, pero, \u00bfc\u00f3mo se ve eso ahora?, dijo. \"Quiero que se olviden de todo lo que est\u00e1 pasando, y que no est\u00e9n rodeados de todos estos recordatorios\".\n\nEl recordatorio m\u00e1s obvio, al menos por ahora, es la mascarilla. Los due\u00f1os de restaurantes est\u00e1n reflexionando si deber\u00edan ser de papel tipo quir\u00fargico -- que son relativamente abundantes, econ\u00f3micas y que pueden cambiarse con cada grupo nuevo de comensales -- o un escudo de pl\u00e1stico transparente usado como un collar. Algunos consideran a\u00f1adir el logo del restaurante o buscan opciones m\u00e1s estilizadas, como las mascarillas de suave algod\u00f3n org\u00e1nico que fabrica la dise\u00f1adora Natalie Chanin en Alabama.\n\nCada peque\u00f1o toque de hospitalidad es una oportunidad para convertir la sombr\u00eda marcha del regreso al negocio en una oportunidad para ser creativos, dice Ashley Christensen, quien vende kits de cena y bebidas alcoh\u00f3licas para llevar mientras reflexiona sobre c\u00f3mo y cu\u00e1ndo reabrir sus populares restaurantes en Raleigh, Carolina del Norte.\n\n\"Cuando tomas la decisi\u00f3n de que todav\u00eda hay espacio para ser creativo en este modo\", dijo, \"se siente m\u00e1s emocionante y alegre y no se trata solo de la p\u00e9rdida\".\n\nKim Severson es una corresponsal con sede en el sur de Estados Unidos que cubre la cultura alimentaria del pa\u00eds y contribuye con NYT Cooking.

        "body": "Deaths doubled in Lima, rivaling the worst month of the pandemic in Paris. They tripled in Manaus, a metropolis tucked deep in Brazil's Amazon -- a surge similar to what London and Madrid endured.\n\nIn Guayaquil, a port city in Ecuador, the sudden spike in fatalities in April was comparable to what New York City experienced during its worst month: more than five times the number of people died than in previous years.\n\nAs the coronavirus' toll eased in New York and in European capitals, a devastating wave has struck cities in Latin America, one that rivals the worst outbreaks in the world, an analysis of mortality data by The New York Times has found.\n\nBrazilian cities are resorting to mass graves to bury rows of stacked coffins. Hundreds of Ecuadoreans are still searching for the bodies of family members who went to hospitals and never returned.\n\nAnd while the catastrophes in Europe and the United States were closely monitored, playing out under intense international media scrutiny, much of Latin America's pain is unfolding far from global view, under governments that can't -- or won't -- offer a full tally of the dead.\n\n\"We weren't prepared for this virus,\" said Aguinilson Tikuna, an Indigenous leader in Manaus who has lost friends in the pandemic. \"When this disease hit us, we locked ourselves in, locked our homes, isolated ourselves, but no one had the resources to buy masks, medicine. We lacked food.\"\n\nThe Times measured the impact of the pandemic in major cities around the world by comparing the total number of people who have died in recent months against the average in each place over the past several years.\n\nThe totals include deaths from Covid-19, as well as those from other causes, including people who could not be treated as hospitals that became overwhelmed with patients. And while no measure is perfect, the increase in deaths offers the most complete picture of the pandemic's toll, demographers say.\n\nIn Latin America, the pandemic has been worsened by underfunded hospitals, lean support systems and struggling economies with far fewer resources than in Europe or the United States.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak New clusters emerge in countries praised for successful coronavirus fights. Modi announces a more than $260 billion rescue package, 10 percent of India's G.D.P. Infections in camps in South Sudan and Greece's Aegean islands raise fears of rapid spread. See more updates Updated 16m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nPeruvian highways swelled with the biggest wave of internal migration in years as people fled to the countryside when jobs disappeared. Tens of thousands of Venezuelan refugees have been forced to walk back to their destroyed homeland because work in neighboring countries has become so scarce.\n\nThe pandemic is hitting the region after a long economic stagnation, which led several countries, including Ecuador and Brazil, to slash health care budgets. These two countries are now seeing the worst death rates in the region.\n\n\"We cannot have health systems that only serve people who can afford it,\" said Carina Vance, Ecuador's former health minister. \"As long as the person with the smallest income cannot access the most basic and essential health services, everyone is at risk.\"\n\nFacing the pandemic in the wake of China, Europe and the United States brought an additional set of challenges. Exhausted local officials in Ecuador, Peru and Brazil pointed to global test shortages and explained they were being outbid by richer nations on scarce medical supplies.\n\nPresident Trump's decision to freeze funding for the World Health Organization could hamper its relief efforts, which extend to particularly vulnerable countries like Venezuela and Haiti. And China, which extended multibillion dollar loans to Latin America during the global financial crisis in 2008, has limited itself to sending a few shipments of protective gear and test kits.\n\nComplicating the response further, the disease has hopscotched across the region, defying explanation. Relatively well-off Chile has been spared so far, but so has poorer Paraguay.\n\nPeru's government responded quickly with a strict lockdown, but deaths have spiked there, much as they have in Brazil and Mexico, where leaders underplayed the virus' threat.\n\nThe Mexican government has not reported hundreds, possibly thousands, of deaths from the coronavirus in Mexico City, obscuring the toll of the epidemic, according to officials and confidential data.\n\nBrazil, the region's most populous nation, now has more than 11,519 dead from the virus, according to the official tally. That is one of the world's highest death counts, but the country's president, Jair Bolsonaro, continues to shrug off responsibility and deny the need for social distancing. The real figure in Brazil is likely much higher because of limited testing.\n\nWhen asked about the mounting toll, Mr. Bolsonaro replied, \"So what? I'm sorry. What do you want me to do?\"\n\nThe virus has been particularly hard on Manaus, a hot, humid and remote metropolis of two million in the Amazon rainforest. The city recorded about 2,800 deaths in April, about three times as many as its historical average for the month. The increase is comparable to what Madrid experienced at the peak of its epidemic, from mid-March to mid-April, according to The Times analysis.\n\nThe outbreak in Manaus laid bare the consequences of Brazil's deep economic inequality and polarized politics. Manaus has struggled to obtain the medical equipment it needs, said its mayor, Arthur Virg\u00edlio Neto.\n\n\"We suffer from the absence of federal government,\" said Mr. Virg\u00edlio, choking back tears. He has blamed the population's lax compliance with the lockdown on Mr. Bolsonaro's public disdain toward social distancing.\n\nThe delivery of supplies has been further complicated by logistics, since the region has few access roads and must rely on river or air transport to meet its needs, he said.\n\nIn the city's overcrowded cemeteries, gravediggers last month stacked coffins three layers deep in wide mass graves to meet the demand for burials. As hospitals collapsed under a deluge of patients, bodies filled their hallways. Around town, ambulances struggled to collect all of those who never made it to the hospital and died at home.\n\nManaus's crisis is also raising concern for the hundreds of Indigenous groups living in the surrounding forest. They often have little or no access to health care, and may be exposed to the virus as they flock to cities to get emergency cash transfers offered by the government or during encounters with illegal miners and loggers who enter their land.\n\nWhen Aldenor Basques F\u00e9lix, an Indigenous leader and teacher, fell ill in Manaus with coronavirus symptoms in late April, he was treated at home -- he had no money for the bus ride to the closest hospital. As his condition deteriorated, his friends spent five hours trying to reach an ambulance, but couldn't get through.\n\nWhen his impoverished community finally got together the money for a taxi, Mr. Basques F\u00e9lix, 49, was dead. At the hospital, attendants refused to take the body, saying the morgue was full. His friends had to wait with the corpse in an evangelical church until they could find undertakers to take it away.\n\n\"They refused to take his body away, they refused to do the tests,\" said Mr. Tikuna said of the hospital workers.\n\nBrazil's chaotic response to the pandemic contrasts with the swift and efficient measures implemented in neighboring Peru.\n\nThe country's president, Mart\u00edn Vizcarra, ordered one of the first national lockdowns in the continent, and sent police and military to the streets to catch any violators. Years of prudent economic stewardship allowed the country to roll out the region's most comprehensive economic aid package, including cash transfers and affordable loans intended to help citizens stay home.\n\nBut the reassurance many Peruvians felt has turned into resignation as the virus has swept through the country.\n\nMounting deaths last week forced a Peruvian hospital to pile bodies outside. Other hospitals had to treat patients outdoors because they did not have enough beds. In the country's Amazonian region of Loreto, doctors said Covid-19 patients were dying at a rate of one per hour amid a severe shortage of oxygen tanks.\n\nOverall, Lima had about 6,200 deaths in April, or more than twice its historical average for that time period, and roughly equaling Paris' death rate in its worst month under the pandemic.\n\n\"It doesn't seem fair,\" said Jimena Villavicencio, a 28-year-old accountant on her weekly outing to buy groceries in Lima. \"We've sacrificed so much.\"\n\nIn Ecuador, soldiers continue to patrol the streets of Guayaquil weeks after a coronavirus outbreak brought a surge in deaths that was more than five times the average of recent years. That is similar to the increase New York City experienced during its peak.\n\nFor two weeks, Guayaquil collapsed, forcing residents to leave dead bodies on the streets for days or bury them in cardboard boxes. With deaths now declining, Ecuador's government is trying to restart the ravaged economy, announcing last week a gradual release of the lockdown. But nearly a week later, only two of the country's 221 cities have moved toward relaxing the quarantine out of fear of a new outbreak.\n\nJos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda L\u00e9on Cabrera contributed reporting from Quito, Ecuador, Isayen Herrera from Caracas, Venezuela, Mirelis Morales from Lima, Peru, Mar\u00eda Silvia Trigo from Santa Cruz, Bolivia, and Josh Katz from New York.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nLeandro Barbosa had lofty goals for 2020. Barbosa, 37, who had played 14 seasons in the N.B.A., was hoping to make his third trip to the Olympics with Brazil's national basketball team.\n\nIn these coronavirus times, Barbosa, like so many others, had to abruptly modify his wish list. Actually seeing his baby daughter and holding her became his priority.\n\nWhile playing for Minas T\u00eanis Clube in Brazil as the league's top scorer at 20.1 points per game, Barbosa learned on March 21 that he had tested positive for Covid-19 two days earlier in Belo Horizonte. Talita Rocca, his wife, was 38 weeks pregnant and due to give birth on March 26 in Brazil's largest city, S\u00e3o Paulo, where the couple live full time.\n\nAmid soon-to-be-confirmed fears that Rocca, a model, had also contracted the virus, her doctors decided, for the baby's safety, that labor would be induced immediately -- with Barbosa barred from the hospital. Rocca's mother, Geli, took Barbosa's place in the delivery room. He watched as much of the March 22 birth of Isabela Rocca Barbosa as possible on FaceTime.\n\n\"I didn't know what to do,\" Barbosa said. \"All I did is just talk on the phone: 'Listen, you're going to have to do it by yourself.' I told my wife, 'Think on the baby, not on me.'\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. In a call with governors, Trump suggests some states should reopen schools before the end of the academic year. Texas, the nation's second most-populous state, moves to reopen. As more states let businesses reopen, challenges persist. See more updates Updated 3m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"We're all good now. We're healthy. The baby didn't have the virus and thank you, God.\"\n\nBarbosa, who won a championship with Golden State in 2015 and last played in the N.B.A. with Phoenix in 2016-17, spent the first two weeks of Isabela's life quarantined away from her and his wife. He said he was still working through how much the episode shook him.\n\n\"That night was the worst night of my life,\" Barbosa said, referring to March 17, when coronavirus symptoms hit him the hardest after an evening practice with his team.\n\nMinas played its last game on March 14, securing a road win over Corinthians Paulista inside a steamy arena in a game without fans, with Barbosa managing just 10 points in conditions that he said left him dehydrated. Before tipoff, he had lobbied team officials to push for the league, Novo Basquete Brasil, to suspend play. Minas's March 16 game against Pinheiros was indeed postponed, but he began suffering from a blast of pain at \"a point in the middle of the head\" the next day. The discomfort led Barbosa to fear the worst.\n\n\"Really, I felt that I was going to die, my man,\" Barbosa said. \"I was having a crazy fever. My head was extremely bad. My nose felt like it was closed, but it wasn't closed. I was feeling a lot of pain in my back -- I couldn't find a position to lay down.\"\n\nBarbosa added: \"I had fever before. I had pain in my head before. I had pain in my whole body when I was sick, but nothing similar to that. Whatever I get, I always fight through. That's just something I learned when I got to the N.B.A. But that night was something; it was tough to fight. Because it was different.\"\n\nAdding to the stress, Barbosa said, was the refusal of the team's medical staff to treat him at his home in fear of contracting the virus. Barbosa credited the family's driver, Fabiano da Silva, for nursing him through the first night and driving him six hours from Belo Horizonte to S\u00e3o Paulo after it was confirmed he had the virus and air travel was no longer possible.\n\nAfter concerns about her own breathing and platelet count during delivery, Rocca had to wait 24 hours before she was allowed to take Isabela in her arms. Barbosa was instructed to isolate for two weeks once he arrived in S\u00e3o Paulo, but his brother Marcelo insisted that Leandro stay with him. The brothers are close after they spent considerable time together in the United States during Leandro's N.B.A. career.\n\n\"He wouldn't let me be alone,\" Leandro Barbosa said. \"I said, 'What if you get it?' He said: 'I don't care. Then we'll both have it.'\"\n\nHe added: \"Talita's mother didn't get the corona. My brother didn't get the corona. My driver didn't get the corona. Just me and my wife, man. Can you believe that?\"\n\nBarbosa, who has two children from a previous marriage, was not expecting such a trying start to building a family with Rocca. They were married last July, and he signed with Minas in December, figuring a strong season in the N.B.B. would serve as ample preparation for an Olympic qualifying tournament in June.\n\nBrazil was originally scheduled to join Germany, Mexico, Russia, Tunisia and the host, Croatia, in a six-team playoff for one of the four remaining berths in the 12-nation men's Olympic basketball field for Tokyo. Those Olympics were postponed for a year, until July 2021, leaving him with a new basketball aim: He continues to urge the Brazilian league to cancel the rest of its season.\n\nMinas's game on March 14 was the league's second to last before play was suspended. Barbosa has been critical of the league for not shutting things down earlier -- \"They were the last sport in Brazil to stop,\" he said -- and he questioned the wisdom of planning to restart when \"everything is shut down over here.\"\n\n\"I would have loved to come back,\" Barbosa said. \"The reason why is because I think we have the potential to win the championship. But I got the virus. I know how it is. It's impossible to have the league continue. Right now, it's not about the business. It's about our health.\"",

As some states and countries are easing stay-at-home orders, historians look to the past to anticipate what is yet to come, and some say that any ending will be \"messy.\"\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn about how three historical pandemics ended. Then you will choose one pandemic to research further and draw your own conclusions about its medical and social ending.\n\nWarm Up\n\nChoose one of the two paintings from the article, \"What Can We Learn From the Art of Pandemics Past?,\" and then answer the questions below.\n\nWhat do you notice about the painting? What was your eye drawn to first?\n\nWhat do you wonder about the painting? What can you infer about the pandemic through the painting?\n\nIs there a story or a narrative that you imagine is connected to the painting?\n\nQuestions for Writing and Discussion\n\nRead or listen to the article, then answer the following questions:\n\n1. What are the two ways that most pandemics end? Why did Dora Vargha, a historian at the University of Exeter, say that pandemic endings can be very \"messy\"?\n\n2. What did Dr. Susan Murray, of the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, notice about an epidemic of fear? What role have you seen fear play in the coronavirus pandemic?\n\n3. What are some of theories behind how the bubonic plague died down? How was the bubonic plague's decline different from that of smallpox?\n\n4. What was the social ending of the 1918 flu? How did the flu of 1918 evolve and fade medically?\n\n5. What are some of the predictions that historians and doctors have made about how Covid-19 will end medically and socially? Based on what you learned in the article, what do you think might happen?\n\nGoing Further\n\nWhich historical pandemic would you like to know more about? You can choose one mentioned in the article -- the bubonic plague, smallpox or the 1918 flu -- or research another pandemic or epidemic, such as AIDS or polio.\n\nUse these three questions to guide your research:\n\nWhat are the origins of the disease? When did it first appear?\n\nWhat are the symptoms of the disease? How is it transmitted?\n\nHas the disease \"ended\" yet? If yes, how did it fade or end medically and socially?\n\nHere are some sites you can use to start your research:\n\nScience News for Students has articles about all of the above-mentioned diseases. For example, you can enter keywords into the search engine to find sources like this H.I.V./AIDS explainer or this vaccine explainer.\n\nThe National Geographic Resource Library has an interactive map you can use to track the spread of the Black Plague and a collection, \"Infectious Agents,\" that has infographics, articles and interactive features all related to different infections.\n\nIf you are researching a pandemic that happened in the last 150 years and want to see how it was talked about at the time, you can use your New York Times account to access TimesMachine. The TimesMachine search engine allows you to read original Times articles from 1851 to 2002.",

In this lesson, students will learn about the risks in going outdoors again -- and precautions they can take to minimize them.\n\nFind all our Lessons of the Day here.\n\nLesson Overview\n\nFeatured Article: \"What We Know About Your Chances of Catching the Virus Outdoors\" by Michael Levenson, Tara Parker-Pope and James Gorman\n\nAs states move to relax restrictions intended to fight the coronavirus pandemic, even the simplest outdoor activities seem fraught with a thousand questions and calculations. Is it safe to stroll on the beach? How about a picnic in the park? Or coffee with a friend at an outdoor table?\n\nIn this lesson, you will learn about the risks in going outdoors again and the precautions you can take to minimize them. In a Going Further activity, you will design a poster or public service announcement to inform others.\n\nWarm Up\n\nTake a moment to study the graph below of the level of human contact in various social spaces from this week's \"What's Going On in This Graph?\" feature. Then, respond to the following questions:\n\nWhat do you notice? If you make a claim, tell us what you noticed that supports your claim.\n\nWhat do you wonder? What are you curious about that comes from what you notice in the graph?\n\nWhat's going on in this graph? Write a catchy headline that captures the graph's main idea.\n\nFeel free to share your responses on our What's Going On in This Graph? page, which already has over 130 responses from teenagers.\n\nQuestions for Writing and Discussion\n\nRead the featured article, then answer the following questions:\n\n1. What is the \"good news\" from a growing consensus among experts about going outdoors? On the other hand, what activities do experts express particular caution toward? Are you surprised by either?\n\n2. The authors state that the different approaches taken by states to reopen have left many Americans \"bewildered about what is safe behavior outside.\" What examples from the article best support this claim? How accurately does the statement characterize your own understanding of what is safe and what is not? Would you say that you are largely bewildered or confused?\n\n3. What is the ideal way to socialize, according to the article? What precautions can reduce your risk if you cannot meet that ideal?\n\n4. What is viral load? Why is it essential to understanding why transmission rates are lower outdoors than indoors?\n\n5. Why are pools and beaches considered areas of risk even if pool water, fresh water in a lake or river, or seawater exposure would be extremely low transmission risk?\n\n6. What advice does the article provide about what to do if you encounter someone too close to you and they are not wearing a mask? Do you find it useful?\n\n7. The article concludes:\n\nAnother worry: Because it can take two weeks for symptoms to appear after a person is infected, there is no way to know if you're going to the beach or the park in the midst of an invisible local outbreak, experts said. It's yet another reason to take precautions.\n\n\"If we now go back to the old normal and don't follow the social distancing strategy anymore, it's like a ticking time bomb,\" said Peter J\u00fcni, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital. \"You never know where it blows up and when.\"\n\nDo you agree with Peter J\u00fcni? Will you continue to practice social distancing now that states are easing restrictions? How concerned are you about getting the virus now that states are reopening?\n\n8. What did you learn from the article? What questions still remain about catching the virus outdoors? Which outdoor spaces and activities described in the graph and the article are you most likely to visit or engage in now that states are easing restrictions? Which will you still avoid? Explain why.\n\nGoing Further\n\nOption 1: Inform Others\n\nHow you can inform others about what you have learned from the article?\n\nWho would be your target audience -- teenagers, older adults or the general public? What message do you want to convey? What, specifically, does your audience need to know about the risks and recommended precautions for going outdoors again? What kind of language, images and graphics will grab their attention?\n\nHere are two creative options you might try:\n\nYou might use information from the article or your own research to create a poster. You might use Canva or another design program to produce your designs. Use open-source images or create graphics that help get your point across. Be sure to cite all the sources you use. Then share what you made via social media or with peers at your school.\n\nOr you can create a public service announcement using still photographs from this article, or from your own research, along with text, statistics and music. You might consider storyboarding your public service announcement, and if you have time, record, edit and share it with your class and your school. Scholastic provides some useful tips and a sample P.S.A. storyboard.\n\nOption 2: Research a Question Further\n\nThe authors write that \"even the simplest outdoor activities seem fraught with a thousand questions and calculations.\" What questions do you still have?\n\nChoose a question about the risks of transmission outdoors to research further.\n\nYou might start your research with the Times Coronavirus Topics page, or these Times articles:\n\nSee Which States Are Reopening and Which Are Still Shut Down\n\nIs It Safe to Go Out to Eat?\n\nIs It Safe to Go Back to the Gym?\n\nIs It Safer to Visit a Coffee Shop or a Gym?\n\nExercising During Coronavirus: Can I Jog? Is That Water Fountain Safe?\n\nIs the Virus on My Clothes? My Shoes? My Hair? My Newspaper?\n\nOr use these online government resources:\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's general recommendations to address the coronavirus here and resources to assist states to reopen here.\n\nThe White House's \"Guidelines for Opening Up America Again\"",

        "body": "If we understand how conspiracy theories spread online, we can help stop them.\n\nThis article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.\n\nSometimes the online cesspool makes me want to scream my head off. Like right now.\n\nMillions of people have watched an online video that recycled discredited health conspiracies into what looked like a slick documentary about the coronavirus and vaccines.\n\nThe success of the video, part of a documentary called \"Plandemic,\" has crystallized everything terrible about the internet. People pushing a baseless conspiracy used extreme online savvy to unleash a misinformation goulash, the internet companies couldn't do enough to prevent its spread, and we ate it up.\n\nThis happens again and again. But we can help stop it.\n\nAll of us need to understand that misinformation spreads with the sophistication of a blockbuster-movie marketing campaign. Authority figures must learn to play the game of online popularity like a Kardashian. And the online hangouts need to coordinate effectively against the garbage-peddling showmen.\n\nFirst, there is power in understanding the mechanics that made the \"Plandemic\" scene go wild.\n\nMy colleague Davey Alba described how a fringe group of people, dubious news outlets and online personalities started weeks ago to promote the discredited scientist featured in the video. And once it was released, online groups that frequently promote false conspiracies helped spread it on Facebook and YouTube. Great marketing makes a product -- whether a superhero movie or a baseless video -- go big.\n\nEven those who didn't believe the pseudoscience in the video may have inadvertently been helping spread its false ideas. When we share information in our social circles -- even to tell people how wrong we think it is -- it spreads even more, said Ben Decker, a disinformation researcher who works with The Times.\n\nInstead, if we want to fight misinformation in our networks, we should talk to our loved ones directly, and have empathy for why they might believe bad information.\n\nDecker also said the internet companies needed to work together to slow misinformation that is coordinated across multiple online hangouts. Facebook and YouTube did delete the original \"Plandemic\" scene -- after millions of people saw it. And versions keep popping up.\n\nAfter the mass murder at a New Zealand mosque last year, Facebook put identifiable markers in a live-streamed video from the shooter, so pieces of it couldn't be reposted when the original video was deleted. That hadn't happened yet with the \"Plandemic\" video, Decker said.\n\nTo their credit, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and others have tried to fight the spread of misinformation related to the coronavirus by directing people to reliable sources like the World Health Organization.\n\nBut as my colleague Kevin Roose and the misinformation researcher Ren\u00e9e DiResta have pointed out, conventional authority figures largely haven't learned to make accurate information as appealing for internet audiences as have the worst online actors. And unfortunately, accurate information is often more complex than the appealing clarity of conspiracy theories.\n\nBogus information is only going to get worse in this pandemic as some people sow distrust of medical experts and any potential coronavirus vaccines. This is dangerous, and we can stop them by understanding the mechanics of bad information, and by not fanning the flames.\n\nTip of the WeekSpotting bogus information\n\nBrian X. Chen, a personal technology columnist for The Times, has some practical advice for recognizing false information in our online feeds that appears to come from a recognizable news source:\n\nMisinformation on the web comes in many forms. This makes finding accurate information about the pandemic extra challenging.\n\nSocial media sites are a major contributor to the spread of misinformation, because anyone can post something that looks like a legitimate news article but is actually from a bogus source.\n\nMany fake news articles, fortunately, can be easy to spot. Here are some telltale signs:\n\nA shady URL: Fake news sites sometimes use legitimate brand names, but their domain names may end with \".com.co,\" \".ma\" or \".co.\" ABCNews.com.co, now a defunct site, was a famous example.\n\nGrammatical errors: Fake news writers aren't exactly wordsmiths, so one big giveaway is the number of typos and grammatical errors that make it into their stories.\n\nUnverifiable information: If an article's information were legitimately outrageous, plenty of other news outlets would have written about it, too. When in doubt, do a Google search to check if trustworthy publications have reported the same information.\n\nBefore we go ...\n\nThe land grab for back-to-work technology: Eager to reopen factories and offices, employers are buying apps that check symptoms and fever-screeners that promise to spot sick workers. But the technology may not work, it might let your boss spy on you, or both, my colleague Natasha Singer writes. (I'll have a conversation with Natasha in Tuesday's newsletter.)\n\nCould Goliath write checks to David? Ben Smith, the media columnist for The Times, writes that he is encouraged about regulatory rules and political pressure that may compel Google and Facebook to pay news outlets for posting snippets of their work or full articles in search results and on social media feeds.\n\nNational protection for computer chips: The federal government wants to encourage computer chip makers to manufacture their products in the United States, The Wall Street Journal reported. There has been anxiety for years that essential technologies such as mobile internet equipment and the chips that power smartphones are mostly controlled by foreign companies or produced in overseas factories.\n\nHugs to this\n\n\"Why are birds so perfect we don't deserve them,\" my colleague (and apparent avian lover) Taylor Lorenz tweeted.\n\nWe want to hear from you.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThis obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here.\n\nLiu Ouqing's life was one of service to his country. At a young age, he joined the Chinese Army. He then worked in a state-owned factory, before becoming a civil servant and a school administrator.\n\nIn the 1990s, as China was moving to open up its centrally planned economy, Mr. Liu was party secretary of the Wuhan Grain Bureau, responsible for ensuring that the city had enough to eat. Later, he helped establish what is now known as Wuhan Business University.\n\nMr. Liu died of complications of the new coronavirus on Jan. 29 at a hospital in Wuhan, said his son, Liu Pei'en. He was 78.\n\nHe developed symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, two weeks after checking in to the hospital for his yearly health exam, and died days later.\n\nNot long after his death, local officials in Wuhan began pressuring Mr. Liu's son to quickly bury his father, as the government was moving to control the narrative of the outbreak. The younger Mr. Liu did not protest, even though he resented being forced to share such a private moment with government-appointed chaperones.\n\nHe did not want to ruin the reputation his father had built as an upstanding public servant, he said. \"My father was a man of integrity,\" the younger Mr. Liu said. \"All he wanted in his life was to have a clean reputation.\"\n\nLiu Ouqing was born in 1941 into a poor family in Huanggang, a city in the central Chinese province of Hubei, of which Wuhan is the capital.\n\nAfter finishing high school, Mr. Liu enlisted in the People's Liberation Army in 1961 and built railways in the northeastern Chinese province of Heilongjiang. In 1968, he went to Wuhan to work at a state-owned machinery factory.\n\nMr. Liu joined the civil service in the late 1980s, and was soon promoted to be party secretary of the Wuhan Grain Bureau. The job involved frequent travel abroad, including a visit to the United Nations headquarters in New York to negotiate prices on the import of grains and oil to Wuhan.\n\nMr. Liu's life took a turn in 2000, when he was reassigned to work as a manager at a vocational school. To Mr. Liu, it was a demotion -- \"the consequence of offending the mayor,\" he later said in a memoir he was writing for his family. His son said he had been punished for looking into a bribery case involving a man connected to the Wuhan mayor at the time.\n\nMr. Liu persevered in his new position, fighting to secure government funding for the school, and playing a key role in merging the institution with several others to establish what is now Wuhan Business University.\n\nHe retired in 2006. In recent years, he and his wife began visiting Sanya, a resort town popular among older Chinese for its sunny weather and beaches.\n\nOn Jan. 6, before his annual trip to Sanya, Mr. Liu went to a hospital in Wuhan for his health checkup. The day before, 59 cases of an unexplained \"viral pneumonia\" had been reported in the city, but local officials insisted there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.\n\nBy late January, he was hooked up to a ventilator and his blood oxygen levels were plummeting. He knew that he would not be able to finish his memoir, which he had hoped to give to his granddaughter as a life guide. Without telling anyone, he ripped up the papers and stuffed them into the pocket of his down jacket.\n\nNot long after he died, his son found the scraps in his father's pocket.\n\n\"My life was that of an ordinary man,\" Mr. Liu had written. \"But it has also been a life of striving.\"",

        "body": "Reg\u00edstrate para recibir nuestro bolet\u00edn con lo mejor de The New York Times.\n\nEl presidente de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, revel\u00f3 el lunes 18 de mayo que est\u00e1 tomando un medicamento contra la malaria como medida preventiva contra el coronavirus, el mismo medicamento que ha promovido durante dos meses con poca evidencia de su eficacia y a pesar de varias advertencias sobre efectos secundarios peligrosos.\n\nEl medicamento, hidroxicloroquina, ha sido invocado por Trump repetidas veces desde marzo durante las sesiones informativas en la Casa Blanca sobre la pandemia del coronavirus, a pesar de las reservas de m\u00e9dicos y cient\u00edficos, incluidos algunos que aconsejan al presidente. \u00c9l ha llamado al medicamento, que ha sido promovido por algunos analistas conservadores, un \"punto de inflexi\u00f3n\".\n\nTrump dijo que comenz\u00f3 a tomar una p\u00edldora una vez al d\u00eda hace una semana y media. No qued\u00f3 claro de inmediato si Trump comenz\u00f3 el r\u00e9gimen en respuesta a que dos miembros del personal de la Casa Blanca -- uno de los ayudantes personales del presidente y Katie Miller, la portavoz del vicepresidente Mike Pence -- dieron positivo por el virus.\n\nY la semana pasada, el jefe de una agencia federal que hab\u00eda estado involucrado en desarrollar una vacuna contra el coronavirus testific\u00f3 ante el Congreso de Estados Unidos. que hab\u00eda sido destituido del cargo porque hab\u00eda presionado por un escrutinio riguroso de la hidroxicloroquina. El funcionario, Rick Bright, quien encabez\u00f3 la Autoridad de Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo Biom\u00e9dico Avanzado, tambi\u00e9n dijo que fue presionado para dirigir dinero hacia la hidroxicloroquina.\n\nEsto es lo que sabemos sobre la droga:\n\n\u00bfQu\u00e9 es la hidroxicloroquina?\n\nLa hidroxicloroquina es un medicamento que se vende con receta m\u00e9dica y se aprob\u00f3 hace d\u00e9cadas para tratar la malaria. Tambi\u00e9n se usa para tratar enfermedades autoinmunes como artritis reumatoide y lupus. A veces se le conoce por su nombre comercial, Plaquenil, y est\u00e1 estrechamente relacionada con la cloroquina, que tambi\u00e9n se usa para tratar la malaria.\n\n\u00bfPor qu\u00e9 la hidroxicloroquina ha sido considerada un posible tratamiento para el coronavirus?\n\nHay varias razones. Un prometedor estudio de laboratorio, con c\u00e9lulas cultivadas, encontr\u00f3 que la cloroquina podr\u00eda impedir que el coronavirus invadiera las c\u00e9lulas, lo que debe hacer para replicarse y causar la enfermedad. Sin embargo, los medicamentos que vencen virus en tubos de ensayo o placas de Petri no siempre funcionan en el cuerpo humano, y los estudios de hidroxicloroquina han descubierto que no pudo prevenir o tratar la influenza y otras enfermedades virales.\n\nInformes de m\u00e9dicos en China y Francia han dicho que la hidroxicloroquina, a veces combinada con el antibi\u00f3tico azitromicina, parece ayudar a los pacientes. Pero esos estudios fueron peque\u00f1os y no usaron grupos de control adecuados: pacientes cuidadosamente seleccionados para que coincidan con aquellos en el grupo experimental pero a quienes no se le da el medicamento que se est\u00e1 probando. Y, desde entonces, el estudio franc\u00e9s ha sido desacreditado: el grupo cient\u00edfico que supervisa la revista donde fue publicado dijo que no cumpli\u00f3 con sus est\u00e1ndares.\n\nUn estudio de China s\u00ed incluy\u00f3 un grupo de control y sugiri\u00f3 que la hidroxicloroquina podr\u00eda ayudar a los pacientes con casos leves de la COVID-19, la enfermedad causada por el coronavirus. Pero ese estudio tuvo limitaciones: tambi\u00e9n fue peque\u00f1o, con un total de 62 pacientes, y se les dieron varias otras drogas adem\u00e1s de la hidroxicloroquina. Los m\u00e9dicos que evaluaban los resultados sab\u00edan qu\u00e9 pacientes estaban siendo tratados, y esa informaci\u00f3n podr\u00eda haber influido en su juicio. Incluso si los hallazgos se mantienen, se aplicar\u00e1n solo a las personas que est\u00e1n levemente enfermas. Y los propios investigadores dijeron que se necesitaban m\u00e1s estudios.\n\nOtra raz\u00f3n por la que el medicamento ha sido considerado para pacientes de coronavirus es que puede controlar el sistema inmunitario hiperactivo, por lo que se usa para tratar el lupus y la artritis reumatoide. En algunos casos graves de la COVID-19, el sistema inmunitario parece funcionar a toda m\u00e1quina y causar inflamaci\u00f3n que puede da\u00f1ar los pulmones y otros \u00f3rganos. Los m\u00e9dicos esperan que la hidroxicloroquina pueda calmar la afecci\u00f3n -- llamada a veces \"tormenta de citoquinas\" -- , pero hasta ahora no hay prueba de que tenga ese efecto.\n\n\u00bfPuede la hidroxicloroquina protegerte de contraer el virus?\n\nNo hay evidencia de que la hidroxicloroquina pueda proteger de la infecci\u00f3n del coronavirus. Sin embargo, investigadores de la Universidad de Minnesota y el Sistema de Salud Henry Ford, en Detroit, est\u00e1n probando la droga en personas que viven con pacientes de coronavirus para ver si puede protegerlos.\n\n\u00bfLa hidroxicloroquina est\u00e1 aprobada por la Administraci\u00f3n de Alimentos y Medicamentos (FDA)?\n\nS\u00ed, pero para la malaria, el lupus y la artritis reumatoide, no para la COVID-19. Por d\u00e9cadas, a los m\u00e9dicos se les ha permitido legalmente prescribirla para cualquier afecci\u00f3n en la que crean que puede ayudar, una pr\u00e1ctica llamada uso no contemplado.\n\nPero la FDA emiti\u00f3 una advertencia de seguridad el 24 de abril para la hidroxicloroquina, que, seg\u00fan dijo, podr\u00eda causar anormalidades peligrosas en el ritmo card\u00edaco en pacientes de coronavirus. El medicamento debe usarse solo en ensayos cl\u00ednicos o en hospitales donde los pacientes puedan ser monitoreados de cerca por problemas card\u00edacos, dijo la FDA.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Medical experts show cautious optimism that a vaccine will be ready sometime next year. A prototype vaccine has protected monkeys from the virus, researchers have found. See more updates Updated 10m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nA finales de marzo, la FDA obtuvo la aprobaci\u00f3n de emergencia para permitir a los hospitales el uso de hidroxicloroquina de la reserva nacional para tratar a pacientes que de otro modo no calificar\u00edan para un ensayo cl\u00ednico. Bajo su aprobaci\u00f3n, los pacientes y sus familias recibir\u00e1n informaci\u00f3n sobre el medicamento, y los hospitales tienen que rastrear la informaci\u00f3n sobre los pacientes que lo recibieron, incluyendo su condici\u00f3n de salud y efectos secundarios graves. Pero la autorizaci\u00f3n de la FDA para uso de emergencia no es equivalente a cumplir con los requisitos federales de Estados Unidos, incluida la evidencia cient\u00edfica a trav\u00e9s de ensayos, que considerar\u00eda a la hidroxicloroquina como un tratamiento comprobado contra el virus.\n\nDebido al acaparamiento y la alta demanda por hidroxicloroquina, algunos estados como Nueva York han ordenado a los farmac\u00e9uticos surtir las recetas solo para usos m\u00e9dicos aprobados por la FDA o para personas que participan en ensayos cl\u00ednicos. Las recetas m\u00e9dicas para el medicamento han aumentado desde que Trump comenz\u00f3 a promocionarlo.\n\n\u00bfSe est\u00e1 administrando ahora hidroxicloroquina a los pacientes de coronavirus?\n\nS\u00ed. Al principio de la epidemia, muchos hospitales comenzaron a d\u00e1rselo a los pacientes porque no hab\u00eda tratamiento probado, y esperaban que ayudara. Los ensayos cl\u00ednicos con grupos de control han comenzado en todo el mundo. Un ensayo nacional comenz\u00f3 el 2 de abril en Estados Unidos; hab\u00eda planificado inscribir a 510 pacientes en 44 centros m\u00e9dicos.\n\nLos investigadores dicen que esos estudios son esenciales para averiguar si el medicamento funciona contra el coronavirus. Si no lo hace, el tiempo y el dinero pueden ser redirigidos a otros tratamientos potenciales.\n\n\u00bfHay alg\u00fan peligro al tomar hidroxicloroquina?\n\nComo cualquier medicamento, puede tener efectos secundarios. No es seguro para las personas que tienen anormalidades en su ritmo card\u00edaco, problemas oculares que involucran la retina o enfermedades hep\u00e1ticas o renales. Otros posibles efectos secundarios incluyen n\u00e1useas, diarrea, cambios de humor y erupciones cut\u00e1neas.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense.

Even small differences in timing would have prevented the worst exponential growth, which by April had subsumed New York City, New Orleans and other major cities, the researchers found.\n\n\"It's a big, big difference. That small moment in time, catching it in that growth phase, is incredibly critical in reducing the number of deaths,\" said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia and the leader of the research team.\n\nHow Earlier Control Measures Could Have Saved Lives\n\nNumber of reported\n\ndeaths by May 3\n\n65,307\n\n60,000 deaths\n\nEstimated deaths if\n\nsocial distancing\n\nstarted ...\n\n40,000\n\n... one week earlier\n\nthan it did in March\n\nRange of\n\nestimates\n\n29,410\n\n20,000\n\n... two weeks earlier\n\n11,253\n\n0\n\nMarch 1\n\nApril 1\n\nMay 3\n\nNumber of reported\n\ndeaths by May 3\n\n65,307\n\n60,000 deaths\n\nEstimated deaths\n\nif social distancing\n\nstarted ...\n\n40,000\n\n... one week earlier\n\nthan it did in March\n\nRange of\n\nestimates\n\n29,410\n\n20,000\n\n... two weeks earlier\n\n11,253\n\n0\n\nMarch 1\n\nApril 1\n\nMay 3\n\nNumber of reported\n\ndeaths by May 3\n\n65,307\n\n60,000 deaths\n\nEstimated deaths\n\nif social distancing\n\nstarted ...\n\n40,000\n\n... one week earlier\n\nthan it did in March\n\n29,410\n\n20,000\n\n... two weeks earlier\n\n11,253\n\n0\n\nMarch 1\n\nApril 1\n\nMay 3\n\nNumber of reported\n\ndeaths by May 3\n\n65,307\n\n60,000 deaths\n\nEstimated deaths if\n\nsocial distancing\n\nstarted ...\n\n40,000\n\n... one week earlier\n\nthan it did in March\n\n29,410\n\n20,000\n\n... two weeks earlier\n\n11,253\n\n0\n\nMarch 1\n\nApril 1\n\nMay 3\n\nBy Weiyi Cai\u00b7Source: \"Differential Effects of Intervention Timing on COVID-19 Spread in the United States,\" by Sen Pei, Sasikiran Kandula and Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University\n\nThe findings are based on infectious disease modeling that gauges how reduced contact between people starting in mid-March slowed transmission of the virus. Dr. Shaman's team modeled what would have happened if those same changes had taken place one or two weeks earlier and estimated the spread of infections and deaths until May 3.\n\nThe results show that as states reopen, outbreaks can easily get out of control unless officials closely monitor infections and immediately clamp down on new flare-ups. And they show that each day that officials waited to impose restrictions in early March came at a great cost.\n\nAfter Italy and South Korea had started aggressively responding to the virus, President Trump resisted canceling campaign rallies or telling people to stay home or avoid crowds. The risk of the virus to most Americans was very low, he said.\n\n\"Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,\" Mr. Trump tweeted on March 9, suggesting that the flu was worse than the coronavirus. \"At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!\"\n\nIn fact, tens of thousands of people had already been infected by that point, researchers later estimated. But a lack of widespread testing allowed those infections to go undetected, hiding the urgency of an outbreak that most Americans still identified as a foreign threat.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment, but Mr. Trump has repeatedly cited restrictions on travel from China in January and Europe in mid-March as actions that halted the spread of the virus.\n\nOn March 16, Mr. Trump urged Americans to limit travel, avoid groups and stay home from school. Bill de Blasio, mayor of New York City, closed the city's schools on March 15, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo issued a stay-at-home order that took effect on March 22. Changes to personal behavior across the country in mid-March slowed the epidemic, a number of disease researchers have found.\n\nBut in cities where the virus arrived early and spread quickly, those actions were too late to avoid a calamity.\n\nIn the New York metro area alone, 21,800 people had died by May 3. Fewer than 4,300 would have died by then if control measures had been put in place and adopted nationwide just a week earlier, on March 8, the researchers estimated.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Disease modelers find that tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented with earlier lockdowns. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Scientists express cautious optimism about developing a vaccine quickly. See more updates Updated 10m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAll models are only estimates, and it is impossible to know for certain the exact number of people who would have died. But Lauren Ancel Meyers, a University of Texas at Austin epidemiologist who was not involved in the research, said that it \"makes a compelling case that even slightly earlier action in New York could have been game changing.\"\n\n\"This implies that if interventions had occurred two weeks earlier, many Covid-19 deaths and cases would have been prevented by early May, not just in New York City but throughout the U.S.,\" Dr. Meyers said.\n\nThe fates of specific people cannot be captured by a computer model. But there is a name, a story and a town for every person who was infected and later showed symptoms and died in March and early April. Around the country, people separate from this study have wondered what might have been.\n\nRushia Stephens, a music teacher who had become a county court records technician in an Atlanta suburb, collapsed on her bedroom floor, unable to breathe, and died on March 19. Adolph Mendez, a businessman in New Braunfels, Texas, was confined to his own bedroom as his terrified family tended to him until he died on March 26. Richard Walts, a retired firefighter in Oklahoma, was ferried to a hospital in an ambulance and died two weeks later, on April 3.\n\nMr. Mendez's widow, Angela Mendez, said she still couldn't say for sure whether action should have been taken earlier. It didn't matter now anyway, not for her husband.\n\n\"They probably could have had earlier a better way to not let this pandemic go that far,\" she said. \"But they didn't.\"\n\nOfficial social distancing measures don't work unless people follow them. While the measures have enjoyed generally widespread support among Americans, the findings rely on the assumption that millions of people would have been willing to change their behavior sooner.\n\nPeople are apt to take restrictions much more seriously when the devastation of a disease is visible, said Natalie Dean, an assistant professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida who specializes in emerging infectious diseases. But in early March, there had been few deaths, and infections were still spreading silently through the population.\n\n\"If things are really taking off, people are likely to clamp down more,\" Dr. Dean said. \"Do people need to hear the sirens for them to stay home?\"\n\nDr. Shaman's team estimated the effect of relaxing all control measures across the country. The model finds that because of the lag between the time infections occur and symptoms begin emerging, without extensive testing and rapid action, many more infections will occur, leading to more deaths -- as many as tens of thousands across the country.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nThe timing and circumstances of those who were infected in March raise haunting questions.\n\nIt was a Friday night in mid-March when Devin Taquino began feeling sick. Neither he nor his wife was thinking at all about the coronavirus. There were already more than 200 cases in the state by that time, but most of those cases were in the eastern part of the state, not in the small city of Donora, south of Pittsburgh.\n\nPlus, Mr. Taquino did not fit the profile: he was only 47 years old with no underlying conditions and his main symptom -- diarrhea -- was not something broadly associated with the disease. He was planning to work a Saturday morning overtime shift at a call center half an hour away, but he called in sick. Offices all over the area were asking people not to come in, but Mr. Taquino's had not taken that step.\n\nHe worked on Monday, but on Tuesday he returned home sick from work, passed out in bed and didn't wake up for 16 hours. The next morning, his wife, Rebecca Taquino, 42, woke him up and told him they needed to get tested. She didn't think he had the virus, but she thought it was the smart thing to do.\n\nWithout primary care doctors, they went to a nearby urgent care clinic, where they learned that his blood oxygen level was very low. The people at the clinic offered to call an ambulance, but fearing the cost, and still skeptical that this was that serious, the Taquinos chose to drive to an emergency room.\n\nAt the hospital, he was given an X-ray and diagnosed with pneumonia. He stayed, kept in an isolation unit just in case, and she returned home. The next evening, March 26, he called her with two developments. One: his work had emailed with the news that someone at the call center, where the work stations sat about a foot apart, had tested positive for the virus. The other bit of news was that he had tested positive.\n\nThere has been a lot for Ms. Taquino to think about in the weeks since that phone call, including the long days during which she never left the house and her husband's situation got more horrifyingly worse.\n\nShould the call center have sent the employees home earlier? When she called the center on Friday to report his condition, it was already empty: the workers had been sent home. Did they act too late?\n\n\"I kind of tossed that one back and forth myself,\" she said. \"I really want to blame it on them, I really do.\"\n\nCould she know definitively where he got it? It was hard to say for sure. Still, given that email the day of his diagnosis, it seemed by far the most likely possibility that he got it at work.\n\nAfter three weeks of agony, Mr. Taquino died on April 10. Whether he was one of the thousands of people who might be alive if social distancing measures had been put in place a week earlier can never be known.\n\nMs. Taquino said officials should have known.\n\n\"If it's spreading that fast you have to know it would have come here,\" Ms. Taquino said. \"They should have been implementing programs. I think it was a giant lapse in our country. There was no way to think that we were going to be spared from this.\"\n\nCampbell Robertson reported from Pittsburgh.",

        "body": "Like countless parents before her, LaTasha Webber worried about her 17-year-old after she signed an age waiver allowing him to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps. Her son, Charlie Jennings, left for boot camp at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island in South Carolina on Feb. 24, following in the footsteps of his father, who was also a Marine.\n\nThe United States had already confirmed its first cases of the novel coronavirus, but President Trump had not yet declared the pandemic a national emergency. The virus didn't top Webber's list of concerns until last month when she heard reports of an outbreak at the base. \"I kind of freaked out,\" she said. \"Oh my gosh, why are they still sending people over there knowing it could start spreading once they send new recruits?\"\n\nThe outbreak prompted Parris Island to stop accepting new recruits on March 30, as it figured out how it was going to train future Marines under the limitations imposed by the coronavirus, which has infected more than 900,000 Americans to date. The problem is one faced by the entire military, which continues to grapple with maintaining a combat-ready force while also weighing the possibility of infection -- a risk raised by the confined spaces and close contact that are standard for many units.\n\nOn Monday, Parris Island resumed its intake of new recruits as part of a retooled Marine-making system. Routines that are meant to place recruits under extreme duress -- such as forcing recruits to quickly shower and eat meals in large groups -- have been adjusted to follow social distancing rules. Some training events, like martial arts classes, have been moved to later in the training timeline, or about 30 days after recruits arrive at Parris Island, according to a spokesman, Capt. Bryan McDonnell. He said that while the Marine Corps is taking precautions to protect new arrivals, \"they will experience the same training all Marines before them have undergone.\"\n\nUpon arrival, new recruits undergo a screening, which includes a temperature check, a risk-factor questionnaire and a medical evaluation, according to McDonnell. They are also required to sign a form attesting that they self-quarantined at home for 14 days before shipping out. Recruits are then sequestered in large tents while attending virtual classes for 14 days, a striking departure from the typical first two weeks of boot camp, when they are assigned to their drill instructors and undergo strenuous physical training. After those 14 days are up, they step onto the iconic yellow footprints outside the receiving building, and formally begin their journey to becoming a Marine.\n\nDrill instructors, known for screaming into the faces of new arrivals as a form of Marine motivation, must now do so while wearing masks. Bunk beds have been spaced six feet apart in the squad bays and chow hall configurations have been tweaked to give recruits more space when they eat, according to McDonnell. Commanders have latitude to enforce additional measures to ensure drill instructors and recruits stay Covid-19 free, McDonnell said.\n\nOne company each of male and female recruits started boot camp this week, although officials declined to say exactly how many people that included. Traditionally, roughly 700 recruits make up two companies, according to McDonnell. For the time being, Parris Island will be training recruits in smaller classes. A Marine Corps recruiting video on Facebook indicated that numbers have been cut in half at Parris Island and Marine Corps Recruit Depot San Diego, which handles all male Marine recruits west of the Mississippi River, to allow for more social distancing.\n\nMaj. Joshua Benson, a spokesman with Marine Corps Combat Development Command, said shipping dates for some recruits are being changed, but he declined to say whether those changes specifically applied to hard-hit states, like New York and New Jersey.\n\nThe pandemic has forced the other services to also make adjustments to their recruit training regimens. The Army, Air Force and Navy have enacted 14-day \"restriction of movement\" protocols in order to monitor new arrivals for coronavirus symptoms. They implemented distancing and masking policies similar to the Marine Corps as well. The recruit depot in San Diego has followed the same guidelines as Parris Island, but has not paused the intake of new arrivals so far.\n\nDespite reassurances from military leaders, some question how effectively these systems will work. \"The military cannot do the things it needs to do to maintain readiness without bringing groups together in close proximity,\" said Andrew Milburn, a retired Marine Corps colonel who led a special operations task force in Iraq and graduated from Parris Island in 1987 before later becoming an officer. \"Recruit training is an obvious example.\"\n\nMilburn was assigned at one point to the Marine Corps boot camp in San Diego and said diseases tended to spread rapidly through recruit populations. Now the corps must take severe measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus by fundamentally altering the training meant to make a Marine, a process that has changed very little over the years.\n\n\"They're desperately trying to make this work under the rules they've been given,\" he said. \"When you start tinkering with that machine, it's very hard for me to imagine you're going to get the same quality output.\"\n\nIf you're part of the military community and want to tell the At War team how the military's efforts to contain the coronavirus are affecting you, email us at atwar@nytimes.com or visit The Times's Tips page.",

        "body": "With over 38 million U.S. unemployment claims in nine weeks, one economist says the situation is \"grimmer than we thought.\"\n\nEven as restrictions on businesses began lifting across the United States, another 2.4 million workers filed for jobless benefits last week, the government reported Thursday, bringing the total to 38.6 million in nine weeks.\n\nAnd while the Labor Department has found that a large majority of laid-off workers expect their joblessness to be temporary, there is growing concern among economists that many jobs will never come back.\n\n\"I hate to say it, but this is going to take longer and look grimmer than we thought,\" Nicholas Bloom, an economist at Stanford University, said of the path to recovery.\n\nMr. Bloom, a co-author of an analysis of the coronavirus epidemic's effects on the labor market, estimates that 42 percent of recent layoffs will result in permanent job loss.\n\n\"Firms intend to hire these people back,\" Mr. Bloom said, referring to a recent survey of businesses done by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. \"But we know from the past that these aspirations often don't turn out to be true.\"\n\nIn this case, the economy that comes back is likely to look quite different from the one that closed. If social distancing rules become the new normal, causing thinner crowds in restaurants, theaters and stores, at sports arenas, and on airplanes, then fewer workers will be required.\n\nLarge companies already expect more of their workers to continue to work remotely and say they plan to reduce their real estate footprint, which will, in turn, reduce the foot traffic that feeds nearby restaurants, shops, nail salons and other businesses.\n\nConcerns about working in close quarters and too much social interaction could also accelerate the trend toward automation, some economists say.\n\nNew jobs, mostly at low wages -- as delivery drivers, warehouse workers and cleaners -- are being created. But many more jobs will vanish.\n\n\"I think we're in for a very long haul,\" Mr. Bloom said.\n\n6\n\nmillion\n\n38.6 million\n\n5\n\nClaims were filed in\n\nthe last nine weeks\n\n4\n\nInitial jobless claims, per week\n\nSeasonally adjusted\n\n3\n\n2\n\nRECESSION\n\n1\n\n'06\n\n'08\n\n'09\n\n'12\n\n'16\n\n'20\n\n6\n\nmillion\n\n38.6 million\n\n5\n\nClaims were filed in\n\nthe last nine weeks\n\n4\n\n3\n\nRECESSION\n\n2\n\nInitial jobless claims, per week\n\nSeasonally adjusted\n\n1\n\n'06\n\n'08\n\n'09\n\n'12\n\n'16\n\n'20\n\nSource: Department of Labor\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nIn the meantime, the Labor Department's latest data on unemployment claims, for new filings last week, reflects the shutdown's continuing damage to the labor force.\n\n\"The hemorrhaging has continued,\" Torsten Slok, chief economist for Deutsche Bank Securities, said of the mounting job losses. He expects the official jobless rate for May to approach 20 percent, up from the 14.7 percent reported by the Labor Department for April.\n\nA household survey from the Census Bureau released Wednesday suggested that the pain was widespread: 47 percent of adults said they or a member of their household had lost employment income since mid-March. Nearly 40 percent expected the loss to continue over the next four weeks.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate on Tuesday, the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, emphasized how devastating prolonged joblessness can be for individual households and for the economy.\n\n\"There is clear evidence that when you have a situation where people are unemployed for long periods of time, that can permanently weigh on their careers and their ability to go back to work,\" he said.\n\nLatest Updates: Economy Jobless claims reach 38.6 million in nine weeks.

See more updates Updated 9m ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nEmergency relief and expanded unemployment benefits that Congress approved in late March have helped tide households over. Roughly three-quarters of people who are eligible for a $1,200 stimulus payment from the federal government have received it, according to the Treasury Department.\n\nWorkers who have successfully applied for unemployment benefits are getting the extra $600 weekly supplement from the federal government, and most states have begun to carry out the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which extends benefits to freelancers, self-employed workers and others who don't routinely qualify.\n\nMany states are still struggling to keep up with the overwhelming demand, however, drawing desperate complaints from jobless workers who have been waiting two months or more to receive their first benefit check. Indiana, Wyoming, Hawaii and Missouri are among the states with large backlogs of incompletely processed claims. Another is Kentucky, where nearly one in three workers are unemployed.\n\nThe $600 supplement has become a point of contention, drawing criticism from Republican politicians who object to the notion that some workers -- particularly low-wage ones -- are getting more money in unemployment benefits than they would on the job. But many have also lost their employer-provided health insurance and other benefits.\n\nSami Adamson, a freelance scenic artist for theater, events and television shows, received the letter with her login credentials to collect benefits from New Jersey only Monday, more than two months after she first applied.\n\nShe said her partner, who is in the same line of work, had filed for jobless benefits in New York and quickly received his payments.\n\nBy the time she heard from New Jersey, a design studio had called her for a temporary assignment. She plans to eventually reclaim the lost weeks of benefits, but for now she is helping to make face shields in a large warehouse where assembly-line workers are spaced apart, handling plastic, foam and elastic.\n\n\"I don't think I'll need aid for the next two or three weeks,\" Ms. Adamson said, \"but I'm not sure too far ahead of that.\"\n\nNearly half of the states have yet to provide the additional 13 weeks of unemployment insurance that the federal government has promised to those who exhausted their state benefits. Workers in Florida -- which provides just 12 weeks of benefits, the fewest anywhere -- are particularly feeling this pinch. And while several states, including those that pay the average of 26 weeks, have offered additional weeks of coverage during the pandemic, Florida has not.\n\nSmall-business owners who were hoping the Paycheck Protection Program would enable them to keep their workers on the payroll contend the program is not operating as intended.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nRoy Surdej, who owns Peaches Boutique in Chicago, applied for a loan after he was forced to close and the pandemic eliminated the season's wave of proms, quincea\u00f1eras and graduation celebrations were canceled.\n\nUnder the program, the loan turns into a grant if he rehires the 100-person staff he had built up in February in anticipation of selling thousands of ruffled, sequined and strappy dresses during the spring rush. But he said that would be impossible, given the income he had lost and the restrictions that continue to pre-empt social gatherings.\n\n\"No way can I qualify for full forgiveness,\" said Mr. Surdej, who said revenue had dried up. \"It's devastating for us,\" he added, saying he had no clue when he would be able to reopen and begin rehiring. \"If the government can't adjust the dates to allow us to use it properly so we can survive, then I won't use it.\"\n\nAt the same time, the Congressional Budget Office warned that businesses able to use the Paycheck Protection Program might end up laying off workers when the program expires at the end of June.\n\nSeveral states have warned workers that they risk losing their benefits if they refuse an offer to work. Federal rules enacted during the pandemic say that workers are not compelled to return to unsafe working conditions, but just what constitutes such conditions is not necessarily clear.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democratic senators sent a letter to Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to \"clarify the circumstances\" so that workers are not \"forced to choose between going back to work in unsafe conditions, or continuing to social distance and losing their only source of income.\"\n\nWorkers with child care responsibilities can stay on unemployment if public schools are closed, but once the term ends, a lack of day care or summer programs is not considered a legitimate reason. Nor are self-imposed quarantines.\n\nOfficials can lift stay-at-home and business restrictions, but then what happens? \"There are lingering concerns about health, family situations, kids not in school, relatives who are sick and needing care,\" said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. \"There's going to be a very slow and gradual process of reopening and restoring employment beyond just a declaration from the statehouse or the county seat.\"\n\nTiffany Hsu contributed reporting.",

        "body": "ATLANTA -- As the nation edges away from lockdown and people once again share public spaces in the middle of a pandemic, wearing a face mask -- or refusing to -- has become a flash point in a moment when civic rules are being rewritten, seemingly on the fly.\n\nThe result has been dirty looks, angry words, raw emotions and, at times, confrontations that have escalated into violence.\n\nIn Flint, Mich., a security guard at a Family Dollar store was fatally shot on Friday afternoon after an altercation that the guard's wife told The New York Times had occurred over a customer refusing to wear a face covering, which is required in Michigan in any enclosed public space.\n\nPolice officials declined to comment on details of the case, but are still looking for the suspect, who fled. A vigil was planned for Sunday night, and a news conference for Monday.\n\nIn Stillwater, Okla., an emergency proclamation mandating face coverings led to so much verbal abuse in its first three hours on Friday -- and a threat involving a gun -- that officials swiftly amended it. Masks became encouraged, not required.\n\n\"The City of Stillwater has attempted to keep people safe by the simple requirement to wear a face covering to protect others,\" Norman McNickle, Stillwater's city manager, said in a statement posted on the city's website. \"It is unfortunate and distressing that those who refuse and threaten violence are so self-absorbed as to not follow what is a simple show of respect and kindness to others.\"\n\nThe decision not to wear a mask has, for some, become a rebellion against what they regard as an incursion on their personal liberties. For many others, the choice is a casual one more about convenience than politics. The choice can also be a reflection of vanity, or of not understanding when or where to wear one. Some people said they found masks uncomfortable, and thus a nuisance they were unwilling to tolerate. Others were skeptical how much difference they made outside on a sunny day.\n\n\"I hate it,\" groused Ammiel Richards, 27, who said that he had twice been ejected from New York City buses for not wearing a mask.\n\nBut public health experts have reacted in horror both at the sight of public places where people have crowded without masks, and at demonstrations, like those in Michigan and California, where protesters without masks have been jammed together and at times yelled in the faces of police officers. Experts described wearing a face covering as a considerate act meant more to protect others than the person wearing it.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, the White House coordinator for the coronavirus task force, said she was alarmed at the sight of protesters huddled together without masks, such as those at the Michigan State Capitol this week.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Experts worry that the coronavirus will go on spreading in a 'slow burn' in the U.S. Los Angeles rolled out a testing website. It was quickly swamped. The Pandemic appears to be claiming its first big retail casualty: J. Crew See more updates Updated 1m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"It's devastatingly worrisome to me personally,\" Dr. Birx said on \"Fox News Sunday,\" \"because if they go home and infect their grandmother or their grandfather who has a co-morbid condition, and they have a serious or unfortunate outcome, they will feel guilty for the rest of our lives.\"\n\n\"We need to protect each other,\" she went on, \"at the same time we're voicing our discontent.\"\n\nEven as governors imposed orders and public health experts dispensed their professional guidance, the effort to thwart the coronavirus nevertheless amounted to a grand national experiment in cooperation that hinged on the individual decisions of millions.\n\nGov. Mike DeWine of Ohio had included a face-covering mandate as part of plans to reopen businesses, but he changed course. \"It became clear to me that that was just a bridge too far,\" Mr. DeWine, a Republican, said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"People were not going to accept the government telling them what to do.\"\n\nAs many states have moved toward reopening but have also set their own pace in doing so, an elaborate patchwork of orders and restrictions has emerged that differs from state to state, even municipality to municipality.\n\nThose guidelines vary just as much with masks, which public health officials have encouraged people to wear, along with adhering to social distancing measures. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises the \"use of simple cloth face coverings to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.\"\n\nThe shift toward reopening businesses reflects a larger recalibration in the balance that officials have tried to strike between aggressively curbing the virus and avoiding further economic devastation.\n\n\"We have a public health crisis in this country, there's no doubt about it,\" Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi said in an appearance this week on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"But we also have an economic crisis.\"\n\nPolls have found broad public support for stay-at-home measures, with many Americans willing to accept a trade-off of lost wages, disrupted routines and an incalculable series of inconveniences to curb the virus. Public health experts expressed concern that easing restrictions could lead to a second, worse wave of the pandemic and weaken the nation's vigilance.\n\nIndeed, as many spilled outside, officials acknowledged a sense of restlessness as the measures dragged on.\n\n\"It's painful,\" Gov. Philip D. Murphy of New Jersey, who also appeared on \"Fox News Sunday,\" said of the frustration over the isolation, noting it as a factor in his decision to allow parks to open statewide. \"This stay-at-home reality has been with us for many, many weeks.\"\n\nRafael Palma, 43, does not wear a mask, and he and his wife, a health worker, have been going out in public and to church. They also participated in a protest this weekend in Sacramento to push California's governor, Gavin Newsom, to reopen more of the state.\n\n\"It's not like I'm hugging people and kissing them or anything like that,\" he said.\n\nHe said guidelines were confusing, pointing to earlier guidance that masks should be reserved for health care workers and could only protect those who had the virus from spreading it. \"People argue that we're careless and not thinking about others -- that we're spreading the disease,\" Mr. Palma said. \"But in order to do that, you have to have it.\"\n\nPublic health experts note that people can be infected and spread the disease without showing any symptoms or being aware they have it.\n\nElsa Aldeguer waved a Trump flag as she gathered with others protesting in Huntington Beach, Calif. The economy, she said, was the genuine crisis. She said the pandemic had claimed her job as a home health worker.\n\n\"I'm sure the virus is real,\" Ms. Aldeguer, 46, said, but she also contended that the danger it posed had been overblown. \"Why do we have the beaches closed?\" she said. \"Why the parks? This is like a punishment to us. We the people need these things to keep our sanity.\"\n\nThe allure of pleasant weather in much of the country on Sunday drew many people from their isolation to beaches, parks, walking trails or anywhere else that was not their home.\n\nIn Brooklyn, most of the people spending the afternoon in Prospect Park wore masks. Others had them -- but they were pulled down to their chin, or in their hands for strategic deployment.\n\nAlong a segment of Atlanta's BeltLine, a walking and biking trail cutting through the city, David Johnson wore a colorful masked pulled up to his nose as he rode his bike. He noticed that it looked like more people had their faces covered. \"People give you the stink if you don't have a mask on,\" he said.\n\nStill, that was not enough of a deterrent, it seemed, for the many others without one.\n\nJay Sokloski sipped beer with a friend on the outskirts of the BeltLine and said he did not feel comfortable in a mask, nor entirely see the need for one.\n\n\"I just don't see the big thing about it,\" he said. \"If I were riding an elevator for 12 hours a day with people coughing and sneezing, I'd probably feel different. But we're outside, so it's fine with me.\"\n\nIn Huntington Beach, Colin Abbo said he would put on a mask in the grocery store or in a crowded space. But his effort, he admitted, had not been consistent.\n\n\"I shared my joint the other day with a buddy, so I haven't been the best at it,\" Mr. Abbo said. \"I guess I'll just give all my friends the benefit of the doubt.\"\n\nRosana Lashlay, 60, was much more vigilant. \"It's very important to use the mask,\" Ms. Lashlay, a teacher who lives in the Clinton Hill neighborhood of Brooklyn, said on Sunday afternoon.\n\nIt was only in \"special\" moments when she left her face bare, she said, such as that one as she sat in Prospect Park safely separated from others and tried to clear her mind and meditate.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" she said, \"I need to take it off to feel the air.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Sean Keenan from Atlanta; Louis Keene from Huntington Beach, Calif.; and Rebecca Halleck, Melina Delkic and Nate Schweber from New York.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWorkers at a Smithfield Foods pork plant in Milan, Mo., say that for years they have endured repetitive stress injuries on the meat processing line -- and urinary tract infections because they had so few bathroom breaks.\n\nBut as the coronavirus pandemic has emerged, workers say they have encountered another health complication: reluctance to cover their mouths while coughing or to clean their faces after sneezing, because this can cause them to miss a piece of meat as it goes by, creating a risk of disciplinary action.\n\nThe claims appear in a complaint filed Thursday in federal court by an anonymous Smithfield worker and the Rural Community Workers Alliance, a local advocacy group whose leadership council includes several other Smithfield workers.\n\nThe complaint also seeks to test a novel legal question: whether health hazards at the plant present a public nuisance.\n\nCoronavirus infections have emerged as a significant problem at meatpacking plants around the country, with some closing and many others operating well below capacity. At least 10 workers in meatpacking and three workers in food processing have died of Covid-19, leaders of the United Food and Commercial Workers union said on Thursday. About 6,500 employees either have contracted the virus, missed work because they had to self quarantine, or are waiting for tests or show symptoms, they said.\n\nOfficials of the union, which represents a vast majority of the workers in the pork and beef industries, said recent plant closings had reduced national beef production 10 percent and pork production 25 percent.\n\nThe court complaint about the Smithfield pork plant in Missouri, which is not unionized, says workers are typically required to stand almost shoulder to shoulder, must often go hours without being able to clean or sanitize their hands, and have difficulty taking sick leave.\n\nLatest Updates: Markets and Business Taking cues from Wall Street, markets in Asia decline. Wall Street loses steam but oil prices continue their rebound. Early May is too soon to reopen auto factories, the U.A.W. says. See more updates Updated 4h ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\n\"Since before the Covid-19, there was a problem with bathroom breaks,\" said Axel Fuentes, the executive director of the workers alliance. But beginning in March, he said, \"day after day, more people are concerned and scared about getting infected with the coronavirus.\"\n\nMr. Fuentes said that some workers at the plant had shown symptoms like cough and fever but that few, if any, had been tested.\n\nSmithfield said the complaint was without merit. \"The health and safety of our employees is our top priority at all times,\" said Keira Lombardo, the company's executive vice president for corporate affairs and compliance. She cited a policy of not commenting on pending litigation, but she said the accusations \"include claims previously made against the company that have been investigated and determined to be unfounded.\"\n\nSmithfield has shuttered a plant in Wisconsin and a plant in Martin City, Mo., in addition to a South Dakota slaughterhouse that employs hundreds of workers who have been infected by the virus. Tyson Foods has closed plants in Indiana, Washington and Iowa, one of which has reopened, and plants owned by other companies in Minnesota and Illinois have experienced outbreaks.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which toured the South Dakota facility last week, recommended Thursday that Smithfield establish more social distancing barriers and possibly slow down the production line there to create more space between workers.\n\nBeyond seeking to make workers safer, the complaint about the plant in Milan, Mo., is testing whether public nuisance law dating back hundreds of years can be used to protect workers on the job. The plaintiffs argue that Smithfield, by failing to take adequate safety measures, risks a coronavirus outbreak that could quickly spread to the entire community.\n\n\"It exists in any state -- the idea of bringing the public nuisance,\" said Karla Gilbride, a lawyer with Public Justice, a legal advocacy group that has worked with the Smithfield workers in Milan for several years and is helping to bring the complaint.\n\n\"If, whether it's a private company or a private citizen, they're operating something on their property and whatever they're doing is unsafe and poses a danger to the entire community,\" Ms. Gilbride said, \"then the public has a right to safety and health.\"\n\nThe lawsuit seeks to force Smithfield to change its practices at the plant but asks no monetary penalties or compensation. The case includes a second count under Missouri common law that requires employers to provide safe workplaces, but is being brought in federal court primarily because the parties to the complaint reside in different states. A public interest legal group called Towards Justice is also involved.\n\nThomas McGarity, a professor at the University of Texas Law School, said the public nuisance doctrine had been successfully applied more recently in environmental cases, including those where animal runoff or chemicals had polluted the local water supply. He said nuisance cases involving pathogens had historically been successful as well, though they typically involved pathogens that could be spread through insects or other animals.\n\nIn a Colorado case from the early 20th century, a judge ordered a defendant to stop operating a ranch in which he fed garbage and discarded meat to hogs, sickening them and risking the spread of disease throughout the community.\n\n\"The vector is not a mosquito, it's a worker -- that's what distinguishes this case from a classic nuisance case,\" Mr. McGarity said. \"But if you think about the nature of this coronavirus and the fact that it you can be shedding the coronavirus without displaying any of the symptoms, it's not so far different from a mosquito.\"\n\nHe said that if the suit against Smithfield was successful, a judge would probably require the company to use the best available technology to reduce the risk of contagion, such as better protective equipment and spacing.\n\nMr. Fuentes, the director of the local alliance, said that before the pandemic, the question of bathroom breaks had been a top concern of workers.\n\nSince the pandemic arrived, Mr. Fuentes said, the concern has shifted almost entirely to the risk of exposure and infection, especially once schools closed in the area. \"After that, a lot of workers got really scared,\" he said. \"The workers said, 'The kids are not going to school, but they're making us go to work.\"'\n\nSeveral dozen workers signed a letter that was delivered to plant management during the week of March 30 complaining of cramped conditions and a lack of protective equipment and accommodations for sick leave. It cited the company's policy of assigning workers a disciplinary point -- a tally that can lead to dismissal -- if they took a day off.\n\nThe letter asked the company to address these concerns and to slow down processing lines so that workers had time to cover their mouths while coughing or to clean their nose after sneezing.\n\nThe company later installed barriers between some workers on the line, but the complaint says the barriers, which hang from above, often aren't low enough to shield their faces. The company also began providing masks last week and has carried out temperature checks. Its chief executive has said that Smithfield is following guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and urged employees: \"Do not report to work if you are sick or exhibiting Covid-19 symptoms. You will be paid.\"\n\nBut according to the complaint, plant managers discourage workers from taking sick leave, and Smithfield has done little to address the other problems described in the letter.\n\nAnd some company policies have added to safety concerns. In March, Smithfield announced that workers in Milan would receive a $500 bonus if they worked every shift they were scheduled for from April 1 to May 1. According to the complaint, this has given workers an incentive to show up \"even when they are experiencing symptoms,\" though the company later said that workers who missed time because of Covid exposure would still receive the money.\n\n\"Heroes come in many forms,\" the company wrote in a poster advertising the bonus, a translation from the poster's Spanish version. \"At Smithfield we accept responsibility in everything we do. And we reward those who accept responsibility.\"",

        "body": "The company said a test in 8 healthy volunteers found its experimental vaccine was safe and provoked a strong immune response. It is on an accelerated timetable to begin larger human trials soon.\n\nThe first coronavirus vaccine to be tested in people appears to be safe and able to stimulate an immune response against the infection, the manufacturer, Moderna, announced on Monday, offering a glint of hope to a world desperate for ways to stop the pandemic.\n\nThe preliminary findings, in the first eight people who each received two doses of the experimental vaccine, must now be repeated in far larger tests in hundreds and then thousands of people, to find out if the vaccine can work in the real world. Moderna's technology, involving genetic material from the virus called mRNA, is relatively new and has yet to produce any approved vaccine.\n\nThe promising early news sent Moderna's stock soaring by more than 25 percent on Monday afternoon and helped drive Wall Street to its best day in six weeks. Stocks were also lifted by statements from the Federal Reserve chair, Jerome H. Powell, that the central bank would continue to support the economy and markets.\n\nTrading on Monday had all of the characteristics of a rally focused on prospects for a return to normal: The S&P 500 rose more than 3 percent; stock benchmarks in Europe were 4 percent to 6 percent higher; and oil prices also jumped. Among the best performers in the S&P 500 were travel-related companies, like United Airlines, Expedia Group and Marriott International.\n\nWith the weather warming and state after state starting to lift lockdown restrictions, Americans are eager to regain their freedom to shop, go to the beach and enjoy bars and restaurants. Still, more than 1,000 people died most days last week in the United States.\n\nVaccines are now seen as the best and perhaps only hope of stopping or even slowing a disease that has sickened nearly five million people worldwide, killed 315,000 and locked down entire countries, paralyzing their economies.\n\nDozens of companies and universities are rushing to create coronavirus vaccines, and human trials have already started for several manufacturers, including Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, the Chinese company CanSino and the University of Oxford, which is working with AstraZeneca.\n\nExperts agree that it is essential to develop multiple vaccines, because the urgent global need for billions of doses will far outstrip the production capacity of any one manufacturer. But there is widespread concern among scientists that haste could compromise safety, resulting in a vaccine that does not work or even harms patients.\n\nThe potential strength of Moderna's mRNA approach to vaccine making is that it uses a genetic framework that can be quickly adapted for each new viral threat. The company has said that it is proceeding on an accelerated timetable, with a second phase of tests involving 600 people to begin soon, and a third phase to begin in July involving thousands of healthy people. The Food and Drug Administration gave Moderna the go-ahead this month for the second phase.\n\nIf those trials go well, some doses of a vaccine could become available for widespread use by the end of this year or early 2021, Dr. Tal Zaks, Moderna's chief medical officer, said in an interview. \"We're doing our best to make it as many millions as possible.\"\n\nPresident Trump said last week that a vaccine would be available before the end of this year. His prediction was supported by Moncef Slaoui, the newly appointed leader of Operation Warp Speed, the administration's effort to speed vaccine development. At a briefing last week, Mr. Slaoui, a former member of Moderna's board of directors who resigned when he took up his new government post, said he had seen preliminary research data that convinced him that a vaccine could be created by the end of the year. He did not identify the data.\n\nAlso on Monday, Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, confirmed that Mr. Slaoui would divest his Moderna stock options, valued at about $10 million, on Tuesday morning. Ms. Oakley added that Mr. Slaoui would donate to cancer research the increased value his shares had accrued from last Thursday until Tuesday's sale. The share price closed at $80 on Monday, up from $64.56 last Thursday, adding $2.4 million to the value of his options.\n\nAt a round table with restaurant executives at the White House on Monday, Mr. Trump said, \"This was a very big day, cure wise and vaccine wise,\" and noted that the markets were lifted by drug news.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The U.S. will reconsider its W.H.O. membership, president says. Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine, an unproven drug against the virus. Steven Mnuchin and Jerome Powell will face the Senate over emergency lending programs. See more updates Updated 6m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nModerna produced the vaccine in collaboration with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the institute that is headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci and has been leading the clinical trials. Part of the National Institutes of Health, the agency is involved in research on other experimental coronavirus vaccines. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson have each received roughly half a billion dollars from the U.S. government, to speed development of a vaccine.\n\nThe people vaccinated in Moderna's Phase 1 study described on Monday were healthy volunteers ages 18 to 55. Their immune systems made antibodies that were then tested in infected cells in the lab, and were able to stop the virus from replicating -- the key requirement for an effective vaccine. The levels of those so-called neutralizing antibodies matched or exceeded the levels found in patients who had recovered after contracting the virus in the community.\n\nDr. Mark J. Mulligan, director of the N.Y.U. Langone Vaccine Center, called the Moderna findings \"very encouraging.\" He added, \"It's a small number of participants, but it appears to be a really good start.\" Dr. Mulligan was not involved in the early testing but expected to participate in a later phase of the Moderna vaccine research.\n\nModerna's early stage of testing, Phase 1, is continuing, Two more age groups -- 55 to 70 and 71 and over -- are now being enrolled to test the vaccine. The company did not mention plans to include children in its studies and did not respond to an inquiry about it in time for publication. But Dr. Mulligan said that tests in children were often delayed until a vaccine was shown to be safe in young adults.\n\nThe actual data from the preliminary tests has not been published or shared publicly, but has been submitted to the Food and Drug Administration, which does not comment on trials still in progress. The company said it hoped to make data publicly available this summer.\n\nTwo shots, four weeks apart, are likely to be needed, meaning that however many doses are produced, only half that number of people can be vaccinated.\n\nModerna said that additional tests in mice that were vaccinated and then infected found that the vaccine could prevent the virus from replicating in their lungs, and that the animals had levels of neutralizing antibodies comparable to those in the people who had received the vaccine.\n\nThree doses of the vaccine were tested: low, medium and high. These initial results are based on tests of the low and medium doses. The only adverse effects at those doses were redness and soreness in one patient's arm where the shot was given.\n\nBut at the highest dose, three patients had fever, muscle pains and headaches, Dr. Zaks said, adding that the symptoms went away after a day.\n\nBut the high dose is being eliminated from future studies, not so much because of the side effects, but because the lower doses appear to work so well that the high dose is not needed.\n\n\"The lower the dose, the more vaccine we'll be able to make,\" Dr. Zaks said.\n\nHe added, \"Demand is going to far outstrip supply so I think there is an ethical obligation to go with the lowest dose you can so you can make as much vaccine as possible.\"\n\nThe company, based in Cambridge, Mass., has a vaccine-making facility nearby in Norwood, and recently announced a 10-year collaboration with the Swiss contract drugmaker Lonza to manufacture up to one billion doses a year for worldwide distribution, if the vaccine proves successful. Dr. Zaks said Moderna was also working with other vaccine makers in the United States to scale up production.\n\nModerna uses genetic material -- messenger RNA -- to make vaccines, and the company has nine others in various stages of development, including several for viruses that cause respiratory illnesses. But no vaccine made with this technology has yet reached the market.\n\nWork on the new coronavirus started in January, as soon as Chinese scientists posted its genetic sequence on the internet. Researchers at Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases identified part of the sequence that codes for a spikelike protein on the surface of the virus that attaches to human cells, helping the virus to invade them.\n\nThe idea behind Moderna's vaccine is to inject the mRNA for part of the spike protein and have it slip into the cells of a healthy person, which then follow its instruction and crank out the viral protein. That protein should act as a red flag for the immune system, stimulating it to produce antibodies that will prevent infection by blocking the action of the spike if the person is exposed to the virus.\n\n\"The new technologies for genetic immunization are rapid and produce a product that is highly potent at producing immune responses,\" Dr. Mulligan said. \"Today's RNA results confirm that there is great potential.\"\n\nAnnie Karni and Sheila Kaplan contributed reporting from Washington.",

Gavin Newsom.\n\nGood morning.\n\n(Here's the sign-up, if you don't already get California Today delivered to your inbox.)\n\nOver the last few months the drumbeat has been steady: We need more testing capacity, leaders in California and across the nation have said. It will help public health officials better understand where Covid-19 outbreaks are happening. And that, in turn, will help determine when to reopen businesses and public spaces.\n\nRecently, the mayors of Los Angeles and San Francisco both announced, with some fanfare, that the cities were offering testing to anyone, regardless of whether they have Covid-19 symptoms.\n\n[Track every coronavirus case in California by county.]\n\nLast week, my colleague Brian X. Chen reported that in San Francisco, at least, that wasn't strictly true; the tests were still supposed to be for essential workers and people with symptoms.\n\nA few readers emailed us with similar questions about Los Angeles, where I live. It was something I'd been wondering about, too.\n\nSo this week, I asked Los Angeles city and county officials about whether people who don't have symptoms and aren't essential workers should sign up to get tested.\n\nThe answer here wasn't quite straightforward either.\n\nIt is true that anyone who lives in Los Angeles County can make an appointment to be tested, regardless of symptoms.\n\nHowever, if you don't have symptoms and you're not an essential worker, you'll be directed to one of 10 city-run testing sites. Next-day appointments will be prioritized for people with symptoms, essential workers and others who are at higher risk.\n\n\"Testing is critical to fighting this virus and saving lives,\" Andrea Garcia, spokeswoman for Mayor Eric Garcetti, said in an emailed statement. \"The mayor took action to become the first big city in the country to offer free testing to anyone who wants it, so that more people in L.A. and surrounding communities could better protect their own well-being, and the health of the people around them.\"\n\nShe said the city had the capacity to test up to 21,000 people per day.\n\nTests at 27 county-run sites are allotted based on state guidelines that lay out which groups should get priority, such as people who work at skilled nursing facilities or hospitals.\n\nStill, Dr. Christina Ghaly, the county's director of health services, told me that just because any Los Angeles County resident can sign up to be tested, it doesn't mean they should.\n\n\"It doesn't provide information that would be actionable,\" she said. \"It's just providing interesting information and potentially false reassurance.\"\n\nDr. Ghaly emphasized that test results could take a few days to be returned -- time during which someone could become infected. Tests could turn up false negative results, or the virus simply could fail to show up.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The C.D.C. releases guidance that the White House had rejected.

Andrew M. Cuomo said on Saturday, an alarming rise in a phenomenon that was first publicly identified earlier this week.\n\nThe syndrome, a toxic-shock inflammation that affects the skin, the eyes, blood vessels and the heart, can leave children seriously ill, with some patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Many of the symptoms bear some resemblance to a rare childhood illness called Kawasaki disease, which can lead to inflammation of the blood vessels, especially the coronary arteries.\n\n\"The illness has taken the lives of three young New Yorkers,\" Mr. Cuomo said during his daily briefing in Manhattan. \"This is new. This is developing.\"\n\nUntil now, parents and public health experts had found some solace in the notion that the coronavirus virus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, largely spared children the worst effects of an illness that has claimed more than 21,000 lives in New York State alone. But any sense of relief was shattered this week when a 5-year-old in New York City died from the syndrome, which doctors described as a \"pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\"\n\nA handful of cases have been reported in other states, including Louisiana, Mississippi and California. At least 50 cases have been reported in European countries, including Britain, France, Switzerland, Spain and Italy.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Tracking the high coronavirus toll in U.S. nursing homes.

Mr. Cuomo said the state was working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to determine whether the confounding illness had been affecting children infected with the virus before this week.\n\n\"It is very possible that this has been going on for several weeks and it hasn't been diagnosed as related to Covid,\" Mr. Cuomo said.\n\nOn Monday, the New York City Health Department issued a bulletin asking doctors to report any cases of the syndrome. At the time, the health authorities said they knew of 15 such cases, involving patients ages 2 to 15, who had been in intensive care units since April 17.\n\nEarlier this week, one Long Island hospital, Cohen Children's Medical Center, said it had treated 25 children with symptoms of the syndrome that ranged from reddened tongues to enlarged coronary arteries.\n\nWhile some of the symptoms are similar to Kawasaki disease, including fever, abdominal pain and sometimes a raised rash, doctors who have treated hospitalized children in recent weeks said there appeared to be differences in how the coronavirus-related condition affects the heart.\n\nToxic shock is a rare complication of Kawasaki disease, but many of the children affected with the coronavirus-related syndrome were in shock with very low blood pressure and an impaired ability to circulate oxygen and nutrients to vital organs. Whereas Kawasaki disease can produce coronary aneurysms when left untreated, the new syndrome seems to mostly involve inflammation of coronary arteries and other blood vessels.\n\nDoctors in New York have noted that cases of the new syndrome began to appear a month or so after a surge of Covid-19 in the region. That timing, experts say, suggests that the illness may be a post-infectious immune response to infection with the virus.\n\nTreatments have included steroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, high-dose aspirin and antibiotics, as well as supportive oxygen through the nose, a mask or, in the most serious cases, a ventilator. Most children who are intubated can be removed from the ventilators within a few days, doctors said.\n\nAlthough much about the illness remains unclear, experts believe children may be at greater risk for the syndrome because their immune systems are not fully developed. But there are no clues yet as to why some children get sick and not others. Many of the children have been previously healthy, and the syndrome does not appear to run in families.\n\nDoctors have turned to genetic testing to see whether there is a predisposition or genetic reason one child falls ill even as siblings seem unscathed.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "body": "About half of the league's 30 teams were allowed to open their facilities Friday, but only two did. Players and teams wonder if it's worth the risk.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers and the Portland Trail Blazers were the only clubs to unlock their practice facilities Friday, reflecting the cautious approach many franchises and players adopted on the first day that roughly half of the N.B.A.'s 30 teams had clearance to reopen after a shutdown of nearly two months.\n\n\"It was wonderful,\" said Cleveland's Larry Nance Jr., who spent roughly 90 minutes lifting weights and shooting while his teammates Kevin Love, Cedi Osman and Ante Zizic each worked at separate baskets.\n\n\"It was more for mental health than physical, to be honest with you,\" Nance said in a telephone interview.\n\nThe league office told teams this week that they could open facilities for at most four players at any time but only in states where shelter-in-place restrictions had been eased, such as Florida, Georgia and Texas. Several teams have indicated that they will wait until at least next week, because of the N.B.A.'s considerable restrictions and a widespread inability to test facility entrants for the coronavirus.\n\nNumerous league and team officials have stressed that the reopening of practice facilities is designed mostly to give players an outlet to shoot again, as well as to lift spirits during the sudden and lengthy interruption to the season. Many players have had no access to a basket since the league suspended the season on March 11 because of the pandemic.\n\nThe Denver Nuggets had intended to join Cleveland and Portland in opening their doors Friday, but a team spokesman said no Nuggets players planned to use the facility to work out until at least Monday.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The F.D.A. approved the first home saliva test for the coronavirus. The U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the worst month since at least the Great Depression. Pence's press secretary tested positive on Friday, as the White House ramped up staff testing. See more updates Updated 6m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe Orlando Magic, who also could have opened Friday, announced that they had received written authorization from the Orange County Department of Health, as well as special approval from the N.B.A., to test facility entrants for the coronavirus starting next week, because there is robust testing in their area. The league instructed teams last week not to test asymptomatic players and staff members, labeling it \"inappropriate in the current public health environment\" given the scarcity of testing kits in much of the country.\n\n\"We have been assured we are not taking any tests from healthcare workers, first responders or anyone, whether they are experiencing symptoms or asymptomatic,\" a Magic spokesman said.\n\nOn Friday, N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver was scheduled to join Michele Roberts, the National Basketball Players Association's executive director, on a 6 p.m. N.B.P.A. conference call open to players to pose questions and discuss concerns. The league has prohibited players from using unauthorized gyms, but it is widely believed that several players are ignoring that restriction.\n\n\"Some people have been working out, if we're being honest,\" Portland's CJ McCollum told Yahoo Sports earlier this week.\n\nMcCollum, who is an N.B.P.A. vice president, said he planned to go to the Blazers' practice facility Saturday.\n\n\"I am worried like the rest of the world, but I like that it is optional and I'm pleased with the caution, structure and measures the Blazers organization has put in place to ensure the safest environment possible for all parties involved,\" McCollum told Yahoo.\n\nNance, of the Cavaliers, submitted to a temperature and symptoms check before his workout Friday; league rules say anyone with a temperature above 99.1 degrees must be denied entry. Nance's return was notable because he has Crohn's disease, an inflammatory bowel disease that is typically treated with immunosuppressive medication. This can make people with Crohn's more vulnerable to infections, but Nance said he was confident about his medication.\n\n\"They did a really good job of making sure we all felt great about being there,\" Nance said of the Cavaliers. \"They could make it at 4 in the morning and I would be there.\"\n\nOn April 27, N.B.A. teams received a 14-page memo detailing protocols to sanitize their facilities and encourage up to 12 feet of social distancing during workouts. Head coaches, front-row assistants and front-office personnel can't attend or watch workouts, and each team can have only four staff members (wearing masks and gloves) in its building at any time.\n\nThe Toronto Raptors announced even stricter measures, saying they will limit entry to just one player and one coach at any time when they open Monday.\n\nMark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, said in multiple interviews this week that the Mavericks would not open even though Texas was one of the first states to ease stay-at-home orders. Cuban maintained that \"the risk is not worth the reward\" for teams that, unlike Orlando, are not able to administer coronavirus tests to those entering facilities.\n\n\"That means we can't assure anybody's safety,\" Cuban said Friday.",

        "body": "The player, who was not named in the suit, said the woman sitting next to him on a redeye flight from Los Angeles to Newark also ripped off the face mask that he was wearing to protect against the coronavirus.\n\nA National Football League player contends in a lawsuit filed Wednesday against United Airlines that he was sexually assaulted by a female passenger on a redeye flight in February from Los Angeles International Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport.\n\nThe football player and a second plaintiff did not give their names in the lawsuit, which was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\nThe plaintiffs, both African-American men, were sitting in the middle and aisle seats in the same row during United Flight 415 on Feb. 10 when a middle-aged white female passenger in the window seat made unwanted sexual advances toward them, the lawsuit said.\n\nThe football player and the other man complained several times to the flight attendants, according to the suit, which contends that United employees initially failed to intervene and that the woman became belligerent. She had turned particularly confrontational over a face mask worn by the player, who was identified as John Doe 1 and a New Jersey resident, the lawsuit said.\n\n\"While touching John Doe 1's face, assailant grabbed John Doe 1's penis and ripped off his face mask,\" the lawsuit said.\n\nThe men are suing United Airlines for sexual assault and battery, as well as for intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The suit contends that the airline refused to provide the names of the female passenger, the flight attendants and potential witnesses to lawyers for the two men.\n\nA spokeswoman for the airline said in an email on Wednesday that the passenger involved was moved to a different seat, which the lawsuit also noted.\n\n\"The safety and well-being of our customers is always our top priority,\" said the spokeswoman, Rachael L. Rivas, who declined to comment further because of the lawsuit.\n\nLawyers for the player and the other man did not say on Wednesday why the suit was filed anonymously.\n\nThe lawsuit said that the unruly passenger had been under the influence of alcohol and drugs during the flight and that she began harassing the player about his face mask as soon as she boarded the plane in Los Angeles.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Disease modelers find that tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented with earlier lockdowns.

One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks relief and damages for \"past, present and future lost earnings,\" but does not specify an amount.\n\n\"As you know, with sexual assault, or any assault for that matter, it is hard to quantify the harm suffered,\" Darren D. Darwish, a lawyer for the two men, wrote in an email on Wednesday. \"At this time, we do not have a dollar amount available for comment, but will say that we are seeking justice and compensation, including punitive damages, for what our clients had to endure.\"\n\n\"Accountability and responsibility are at the core of our justice system,\" he said. \"We seek to hold accountable those who have harmed our clients through their direct or indirect actions.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nA new study of thousands of hospitalized coronavirus patients in the New York City area, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, has found that nearly all of them had at least one major chronic health condition, and most -- 88 percent -- had at least two.\n\nThough earlier research has shown chronic conditions like obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes are common risk factors for severe Covid-19, the ubiquity of serious medical conditions in these patients was striking: Only 6 percent of them had no underlying health conditions.\n\n\"The number of patients who had chronic comorbidities surprised us,\" said Karina Davidson, a senior vice president at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research, who was the paper's senior author.\n\nThe paper, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, analyzed data about 5,700 Covid-19 patients admitted between March 1 and April 4 to a dozen hospitals in New York City, Long Island and Westchester County that are part of the Northwell Health system. Scientists at the Feinstein Institutes, the research arm of Northwell, used electronic health records and other demographic information to analyze the characteristics of the patients.\n\nDozens of children and teenagers got sick but survived, the researchers found. Women had a clear edge: Fewer were hospitalized to begin with, and they were more likely to survive.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As states face a downturn worse than the Great Recession, McConnell suggests they consider bankruptcy. The House convenes for votes on a $484 billion aid plan and the formation of a special oversight committee. 4.4 million more workers file for unemployment. See more updates Updated 4m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nOne in five of the hospital stays ended with the patient dying, but more than half of the patients studied were still hospitalized when the study ended. In total, 553 of the patients died.\n\nAbout a fifth of the patients -- 1,151 -- were put on ventilators, and most of those -- 831 -- were still on the machines when the study ended.\n\nOf the other 320 intubated patients, 282 died and 38 were discharged from the hospital. Their mortality rate, 88 percent, is higher than some other early case reports, which found death rates for coronavirus patients on ventilators ranging from 50 percent to close to 70 percent. Given that the length of hospital stay for these Northwell cases was relatively short, four days on average, it's possible that those who died were mainly patients who were so ill that they were unlikely to be helped by any treatment.\n\nWhile the study provided a valuable granular look at the characteristics of an early onslaught of patients in the United States, Dr. Davidson cautioned that it was observational in nature, and that there was no comparison group with which to contrast frailties or outcomes.\n\n\"We're simply describing the patients who came in and required hospitalization,\" she said. \"We are not comparing them to those who were positive and stayed out of the hospital, or who didn't get infected, or to patients with any other disease.\"\n\nThe researchers reported that when patients first came to the hospital and were triaged, 17 percent had an abnormal respiratory rate of more than 24 breaths per minute, and 28 percent received supplemental oxygen.\n\nBut fewer than one third of the patients had a fever, even though they were sick enough to be hospitalized, a similar observation to one noted by a large Chinese study. That has important policy implications, indicating that taking people's temperatures in order to screen them for the coronavirus -- a measure that was used on cruise ships and as a way to detect illness in returning travelers at airports, and that has also been proposed for use in the workplace -- is likely to miss many people who are not only asymptomatic but also acutely ill.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nNearly 60 percent of those hospitalized at the Northwell facilities had high blood pressure, 40 percent were obese, and about one-third had diabetes. Smaller numbers of patients suffered from other chronic illnesses, such as heart disease, kidney disease and chronic respiratory illnesses.\n\nOther smaller reports from New York City area hospitals have also highlighted obesity as a complicating risk factor. One hypothesis is that obesity causes chronic, low-grade inflammation that can lead to an increase in circulating, pro-inflammatory cytokines, which may play a role in the worst Covid-19 outcomes.\n\nDr. Leora Horwitz, an associate professor at NYU Langone Health whose recent study of Covid-19 patients found that obesity was the most significant predictor of disease severity after age, said that the new paper described similar rates of chronic disease and obesity, but that it was descriptive, so \"it is hard to tell the relative importance of the various comorbidities.\" She noted that the obesity rate on Long Island is 24 percent, suggesting the hospitalized patients \"are disproportionately obese.\"\n\nThe report adds new evidence of the greater susceptibility of men to the coronavirus: Men represented 60 percent of the hospitalized patients in the Northwell system, and an even greater share -- 66 percent -- of the patients treated in the intensive care unit.\n\nThe risk of dying increased with age for all patients but it climbed faster and higher for men. The risk of dying for male patients was in the single digits through their 40s, and then climbed steadily with each decade, with 60 percent of men in their 80s dying. Women's death rates were in the single digits through their 50s, but reached 48 percent for women in their 80s.\n\nAnother counterintuitive finding was that adults aged 18 to 65 were more likely to be treated in the intensive care unit or to receive mechanical ventilation than those over 65. The reasons were unclear, but may have reflected a reluctance to seek medical care until the condition was exacerbated.\n\nAdditional analyses of the data will try to identify the clusters of symptoms that are most predictive of a patient developing severe coronavirus disease, and of experiencing a cytokine storm, a harmful immune response in which the immune system attacks the body's own cells, Dr. Davidson said.\n\nPam Belluck contributed reporting.",

        "body": "Researchers compared 10 cases in Italy with previous cases of a similar childhood illness, Kawasaki disease. The rate of the new cases was much higher, and the conditions were more serious.\n\nAs concerns mount over children with a serious and potentially deadly inflammatory condition, a new study sheds light on the illness's distinctive characteristics and provides the strongest evidence yet that the syndrome is linked to the coronavirus.\n\nThe condition, called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, has been reported in about 100 children in New York State, including three who died, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said this week. Cases have been reported in other states, including Louisiana, Mississippi and California, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will soon issue an alert asking doctors to report cases of children with symptoms of the syndrome.\n\nThere have also been at least 50 cases reported in European countries, including in France, Switzerland, Spain and Britain, where at least one death has been attributed to the syndrome.\n\nIn the new study, published on Wednesday in the journal Lancet, doctors in Italy compared a series of 10 cases of the illness with cases of a similar rare condition in children called Kawasaki disease.\n\nThe authors found that over the five years before the coronavirus pandemic -- January 2015 to mid-February 2020 -- 19 children with Kawasaki disease were treated at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, which has an advanced pediatric department, in the Bergamo province.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump pushes to reopen schools, and criticizes Fauci's testimony.

See more updates Updated 4m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nBut during the two months from February 18 to April 20 alone, the hospital, which is at the epicenter of Italy's coronavirus outbreak, treated 10 children with similar hyper-inflammatory symptoms.\n\nTen cases in two months -- about 30 times the rate of the Kawasaki disease cases, which occurred at a pace of about one every three months -- suggests a cluster that is driven by the coronavirus pandemic, especially since overall hospital admissions during this time were much lower than usual, the authors said.\n\nNevertheless, the authors noted that the number of cases was small, suggesting that the new syndrome was unlikely to be widespread among children, who have generally been less hard hit by the virus than adults.\n\nNone of the 10 children died, but their symptoms were more severe than those experienced by the children with Kawasaki disease. They were much more likely to have heart complications, and five of them exhibited shock, which did not occur in any of the Kawasaki disease cases. They had lower counts of platelets and a type of white blood cell, typical of Covid-19 patients defending against the infection. And more of the children with the new syndrome needed treatment with steroids in addition to the immunoglobulin treatment that both they and the Kawasaki patients received.\n\nLike the cases in the United States and elsewhere, the 10 children were generally significantly older than the patients with Kawasaki disease, which tends to strike infants and preschoolers. The average age of the Kawasaki patients was 3. All but one of the children with the new syndrome were older than 5 and their average age was 7 \u00bd.\n\nEight of the 10 children tested positive for coronavirus antibodies. The researchers suggested that negative test results for the other two children might reflect the fact that the tests were not perfectly accurate and that one of the children had just been treated with a large dose of immunoglobulin, which could have interfered with the test's ability to detect antibodies.\n\nThe presence of antibodies suggests that the Italian children, like many of the cases in the United States, were infected with the virus weeks earlier. Experts say the new inflammatory syndrome appears to be a delayed reaction driven by a child's immune system response to the infection, in contrast to the primary way that the virus affects patients by attacking the cells in their lungs.",

Brady, the U.S. attorney for the Western District of Pennsylvania. Mr. Brady warned on Thursday that law enforcement officers were on the lookout for virus-related fraud.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Latinos in many places are disproportionately affected by the virus.

He appeared briefly in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh on Thursday and was released on $50,000 bond.\n\nMr. Gindt, who has not yet entered a plea, did not immediately respond to phone and email messages seeking comment on Thursday. It was not immediately clear if he had a lawyer.\n\nA U.S. Secret Service special agent said in the criminal complaint that Mr. Gindt had identified himself as a \"White House official\" on the online open platform Medium.\n\nThe special agent, Chase A. Clowser, said that he had bought a home test kit from Mr. Gindt for $195 and that he had traced the kit to a lab in Georgia through its lot number. The company's chief executive told Mr. Clowser that a former lab executive had been fired for the unauthorized selling of test kits and had taken 50 of the kits without authorization, according to the complaint.\n\nThe former lab executive was identified by his initials, a phone number and an email address in the complaint, which said that he had been the lab's chief operating officer. He had been quoted in news reports on the development of home test kits for the coronavirus, according to the complaint.\n\nThe same person was also listed on a FedEx account that was used to send the test kits people ordered from Mr. Gindt, and that person received two bank deposits in March that were connected to the lab scheme, the complaint said.\n\nReached on Thursday night, the former executive said he had no knowledge of any tests that had been stolen or sold without authorization. He did not respond to further questions.\n\nNo one else has been charged in the case. A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Pittsburgh said on Thursday that it was an ongoing investigation.\n\nThe chief executive of the lab in Georgia, who was referred by his initials in the criminal complaint, did not immediately respond to phone and email requests for comment on Thursday night.\n\nThe charges against Mr. Gindt are among the latest allegations of illegal conduct related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLast month, two Southern California men were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud after they sought $4 million for a stockpile of face masks that didn't exist, according to the authorities, who said the men had even gone as far as to put fake 3M labels on empty boxes.\n\nIn March, a Brooklyn man was charged with lying to federal agents about price gouging. The authorities said the man, Baruch Feldheim, 43, had stockpiled 192,000 N95 respirators, 130,000 surgical masks and nearly 600,000 medical-grade gloves, which were redirected to medical workers in New York and New Jersey.\n\nAnd two Tennessee brothers who stockpiled 17,700 bottles of hand sanitizer avoided prosecution and a fine but won't recoup the thousands of dollars they spent on the supplies under the terms of a price-gouging settlement that the state attorney general announced last month.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWhen Robert Rowe Jr. was discharged from the hospital this month after testing positive for the coronavirus, he needed a place to stay so he would not put his 84-year-old father at risk. New York City health officials put him up at a three-star hotel in Midtown Manhattan.\n\nThe room was provided under a city program that was intended to protect recovering patients' families and roommates. Case workers are supposed to check on the patients twice a day by telephone.\n\nBut on Saturday, Mr. Rowe, 56, was found dead in his room at the Hilton Garden Inn on West 37th Street, nearly 20 hours after a city worker last phoned him, though it unclear whether he picked up.\n\nTwo other men sent to the same hotel -- Julio Melendez, 42, and Sung Mo Ping, 64 -- also died last weekend, and a fourth man in the program died early this month at a Queens hotel.\n\nThe deaths exposed holes in the way the city monitors isolated patients and underscored the difficulty in containing the outbreak in New York City: how to keep people who have been infected or exposed to the coronavirus from passing it on.\n\n\"This was his city, and it failed him,\" Mr. Rowe's sister, Andrea Rowe Crittenden, said. \"New York failed him.\"\n\nBorrowing from the experiences of some Asian cities, health officials in New York have made isolating infected people, especially those who live in cramped homes and homeless shelters, a critical part of their plan to combat the virus.\n\nSince the three deaths at the Hilton Garden Inn, Mayor Bill de Blasio has stepped up efforts to monitor people staying at the hotels, placing security guards and emergency medical technicians in inns with five or more patients and screening guests to determine if they need a higher level of care. He also announced plans to hire a chief medical officer to oversee the program.\n\nIn addition, the mayor promised an inquiry to determine how the victims wound up dead after receiving the all-clear from doctors at three different hospitals and while being monitored by the city.\n\n\"Something doesn't make sense here,\" he said on Monday. \"Why are these people -- why have they lost their lives?\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York More than one in five people who were tested for virus antibodies in N.Y.C. had them. The death toll among homeless New Yorkers reached 51. Cuomo denounced McConnell over \"blue-state bailout\" comment. See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nOn Thursday, the mayor went further. \"What we are still trying to understand is what happened in the discharge process that would have led someone to end up being discharged to a hotel if there was still any kind of danger,\" he said.\n\nThe formal cause of death for Mr. Rowe and Mr. Melendez was heart failure, the city's medical examiner's office said. But the coronavirus was a factor in the death of Mr. Rowe, who was diabetic, and possibly Mr. Melendez, who had kidney disease, the office said.\n\nThe third man at the Hilton Garden Inn died of something other than the virus, the mayor said, without providing details.\n\nSince the outbreak began, research has shown the disease spreads rapidly through families, and in China and South Korea, officials had success in containing the virus by aggressively screening people for fever and then isolating the sick from their relatives.\n\n\"People who are in close proximity to others are going to be at an increased risk of getting infected themselves,\" Dr. Raymond Niaura, the interim chairman of the Department of Epidemiology at New York University. \"So families are, in a way, ground zero.\"\n\nCity health officials have noted the similarities between New York and large East Asian cities, where many people live in apartments with several family members.\n\n\"The experience from around the world has been that until you can stop transmission from one person to another, you're never going to get a hold of this,\" said Dr. Jay Varma, a former health department official who is advising Mr. de Blasio. \"And a lot of that transmission does occur in homes.\"\n\nThe city has leased more than 11,000 hotel rooms during the crisis to do something similar, offering health care workers and patients an alternative to going home or to shelters, where they could put others at risk.\n\nMore than 4,000 patients have been checked into the hotel rooms, and more than a third of them have completed their stays, officials said. They were discharged under city health guidelines that recommend waiting three days after a fever or seven days after other symptoms.\n\nThe patients were selected from a pool of people being treated for the virus at hospitals and clinics, whose doctors indicated on a questionnaire that they could be discharged to a hotel. Those who still required medical attention were sent to hotels managed by the New York City's Health and Hospitals Corporation.\n\nThe vast majority, however, were determined to not need care and were sent to rooms managed by the city's Emergency Management office. City Hall has declined requests to release a list of the hotels where the city has secured rooms, citing federal disability and medical-privacy laws.\n\nIn addition to providing food delivery and laundry services, Emergency Management assigned workers from a temp agency to call the patients twice a day.\n\nCrewfacilities.com, a Texas company that provides logistics for housing large groups on short notice, was awarded the $250 million contract to secure the hotel rooms, outbidding two competitors, but it was not asked to monitor the guests who had been discharged from hospitals and clinics, city officials said.\n\nThat job was given to Penda Aiken Inc., a temporary employment agency in Brooklyn. Workers recruited by the agency were told to have hotel staff members check on the patients if they did not answer the telephone and to summon medical help if the patients' symptoms worsened, officials said. But those protocols were not tightly followed.\n\nAfter the deaths, the city ordered Penda Aiken to remove one of its employees who was not following \"proper escalation protocols\" from working on the hotel program. Penda Aiken did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company remains in charge of the wellness calls, but another firm, Hudson River HealthCare, based upstate in Peekskill, has been brought in to monitor the patients on-site, city officials said.\n\nPenda Aiken and Hudson River HealthCare are working under letters of intent, and city officials said contracts were still being negotiated.\n\nBefore the deaths over the weekend, Mr. de Blasio suggested that the city had not anticipated the need for closer monitoring. \"You'd think if someone has been discharged from the hospital, it's an all clear and the reason they're in a hotel is simply transitional,\" he said.\n\nDr. Niaura said it was not uncommon for people recovering from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, to suddenly deteriorate. \"We're seeing that a lot with this disease, where people seem fine and then they just go downhill,\" he said.\n\nIn Mr. Rowe's case, a temp worker called him around 5 p.m. on Friday. It remains unclear if he picked up the telephone, the police said, but he was found dead at 1:15 p.m. the next day by hotel workers.\n\nMs. Crittenden said her brother had not answered her calls to his room since he left Harlem Hospital Center and checked in at the hotel about two weeks ago. \"He told me he was on the way there,\" Ms. Crittenden said. \"And then I never heard from him at all.\"\n\nThough her brother had health issues, he had no virus symptoms when she last spoke to him. Mr. Rowe's father, Robert Rowe Sr., was also diagnosed with Covid-19 a few days after his son and was on a ventilator, she said.\n\nMr. Melendez, a native New Yorker, had worked as a driver before going on disability because of kidney failure about seven years ago, his aunt, Yvonne Col\u00f3n, said. He was admitted to Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx on March 30 after he spiked a fever just before a dialysis treatment.\n\nHe left the hospital on April 7 and expected to leave the hotel after 14 days. \"He was in good spirits,\" said Ms. Col\u00f3n, who lives in Florida. \"He was just waiting for his quarantine to be over.\"\n\nBut on Saturday afternoon, his case worker reported he had not answered the phone and hotel workers noticed he had not taken the food left for him, the police said. He was found dead a half-hour later.\n\n\"I just feel somebody dropped the ball and just sent him to this hotel to die,\" Ms. Col\u00f3n said. \"We shouldn't have lost him.\"\n\nMr. Sung had returned to New York in recent years after a long stay in Taiwan, where he was married, said his nephew, Declan Sung.\n\nHe had not answered a case worker's call on Sunday morning, according to the police, and was found dead 20 minutes later by hotel security.\n\nMr. Sung's daughter, Linda Sung, said she was estranged from her father, who was a diabetic, and last spoke to him three years ago.\n\n\"He can't have a proper funeral and I won't be able to see him for the last time because of everything that's going on now,\" Ms. Sung, 30, said. \"So it just hit me like a ton of bricks, really.\"\n\nJeffery C.

        "body": "Among the most important unanswered questions about the coronavirus is this: What role do children play in keeping the pandemic going?\n\nFewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do have mild symptoms, if any. But do they pass the virus on to adults and continue the chain of transmission?\n\nThe answer is key to deciding whether and when to reopen schools, a step that President Donald Trump urged states to consider before the summer.\n\nTwo new studies offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. Neither proved it, but the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said.\n\nMany other countries, including Israel, Finland, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom have all either reopened schools or are considering doing so in the next few weeks.\n\nIn some of those countries, the rate of community transmission is low enough to take the risk. But in others, including the United States, reopening schools may nudge the epidemic's reproduction number -- the number of new infections estimated to stem from a single case, commonly referred to as R0 -- to dangerous levels, epidemiologists warned after reviewing the results from the new studies.\n\nIn one study, published last week in the journal Science, a team analyzed data from two cities in China -- Wuhan, where the virus first emerged, and Shanghai -- and found that children were about a third as susceptible to coronavirus infection as adults were. But when schools were open, they found, children had about three times as many contacts as adults and three times as many opportunities to become infected, essentially evening out their risk.\n\nBased on their data, the researchers estimated that closing schools is not enough on its own to stop an outbreak, but it can reduce the surge by about 40% to 60% and slow the epidemic's course.\n\n\"My simulation shows that yes, if you reopen the schools, you'll see a big increase in the reproduction number, which is exactly what you don't want,\" said Marco Ajelli, a mathematical epidemiologist who did the work while at the Bruno Kessler Foundation in Trento, Italy.\n\nThe second study, by a group of German researchers, was more straightforward. The team tested children and adults and found that children who test positive harbor just as much virus as adults do -- sometimes more -- and so, presumably, are just as infectious.\n\n\"Are any of these studies definitive? The answer is 'No, of course not,' \" said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who was not involved in either study. But, he said, \"to open schools because of some uninvestigated notion that children aren't really involved in this, that would be a very foolish thing.\"\n\nThe German study was led by Christian Drosten, a virologist who has ascended to something like celebrity status in recent months for his candid and clear commentary on the pandemic. Drosten leads a large virology lab in Berlin that has tested about 60,000 people for the coronavirus. Consistent with other studies, he and his colleagues found many more infected adults than children.\n\nThe team also analyzed a group of 47 infected children between ages 1 and 11. Fifteen of them had an underlying condition or were hospitalized, but the remaining were mostly free of symptoms. The children who were asymptomatic had viral loads that were just as high or higher than the symptomatic children or adults.\n\n\"In this cloud of children, there are these few children that have a virus concentration that is sky-high,\" Drosten said.\n\nHe noted that there is a significant body of work suggesting that a person's viral load tracks closely with their infectiousness. \"So I'm a bit reluctant to happily recommend to politicians that we can now reopen day cares and schools.\"\n\nDrosten said he posted his study on his lab's website ahead of its peer review because of the ongoing discussion about schools in Germany.\n\nMany statisticians contacted him via Twitter suggesting one or another more sophisticated analysis. His team applied the suggestions, Drosten said, and even invited one of the statisticians to collaborate.\n\n\"But the message of the paper is really unchanged by any type of more sophisticated statistical analysis,\" he said. For the United States to even consider reopening schools, he said, \"I think it's way too early.\"\n\nIn the China study, the researchers created a contact matrix of 636 people in Wuhan and 557 people in Shanghai. They called each of these people and asked them to recall everyone they'd had contact with the day before the call.\n\nThey defined a contact as either an in-person conversation involving three or more words or physical touch such as a handshake and asked for the age of each contact as well as the relationship to the survey participant.\n\nComparing the lockdown with a baseline survey from Shanghai in 2018, they found that the number of contacts during the lockdown decreased by about a factor of seven in Wuhan and eight in Shanghai.\n\n\"There was a huge decrease in the number of contacts,\" Ajelli said. \"In both of those places, that explains why the epidemic came under control.\"\n\nThe researchers also had access to a rich data set from Hunan province's Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials in the province traced 7,000 contacts of 137 confirmed cases, observed them over 14 days and tested them for coronavirus infection. They had information not just for people who became ill, but for those who became infected and remained asymptomatic, and for anyone who remained virus-free.\n\nData from hospitals or from households tend to focus only on people who are symptomatic or severely ill, Ajelli noted. \"This kind of data is better.\"\n\nThe researchers stratified the data from these contacts by age and found that children between the ages of 0 and 14 years are about a third less susceptible to coronavirus infection than those ages 15-64, and adults 65 or older are more susceptible by about 50%.\n\nThey also estimated that closing schools can lower the reproduction number -- again, the estimate of the number of infections tied to a single case -- by about 0.3; an epidemic starts to grow exponentially once this metric tops 1.\n\nIn many parts of the United States, the number is already hovering around 0.8, Ajelli said. \"If you're so close to the threshold, an addition of 0.3 can be devastating.\"\n\nHowever, some other experts noted that keeping schools closed indefinitely is not just impractical but also may do lasting harm to children.\n\nJennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University's Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the decision to reopen schools cannot be made based solely on trying to prevent transmission.\n\n\"I think we have to take a holistic view of the impact of school closures on kids and our families,\" Nuzzo said. \"I do worry at some point, the accumulated harms from the measures may exceed the harm to the kids from the virus.\"\n\nE-learning approaches may temporarily provide children with a routine, \"but any parent will tell you it's not really learning,\" she said. Children are known to backslide during the summer months, and adding several more months to that might permanently hurt them, and particularly those who are already struggling.\n\nChildren also need the social aspects of school, and for some children, home may not even be a safe place, she said.\n\n\"I'm not saying we need to absolutely rip off the Band-Aid and reopen schools tomorrow,\" she said, \"but we have to consider these other endpoints.\"\n\nNuzzo also pointed to a study in the Netherlands, conducted by the Dutch government, which concluded that \"patients under 20 years play a much smaller role in the spread than adults and the elderly.\"\n\nBut other experts said that study was not well-designed because it looked at household transmission. Unless the scientists deliberately tested everyone, they would have noticed and tested only more severe infections -- which tend to be among adults, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\n\"Assumptions that children are not involved in the epidemiology, because they do not have severe illness, are exactly the kind of assumption that you really, really need to question in the face of a pandemic,\" Hanage said. \"Because if it's wrong, it has really pretty disastrous consequences.\"\n\nA new study by the National Institutes of Health may help provide more information to guide decisions in the United States. The project, called Heros, will follow 6,000 people from 2,000 families and collect information on which children get infected with the virus and whether they pass it on to other family members.\n\nThe experts all agreed on one thing: that governments should hold active discussions on what reopening schools looks like. Students could be scheduled to come to school on different days to reduce the number of people in the building at one time, for example; desks could be placed 6 feet apart; and schools could avoid having students gather in large groups.\n\nTeachers with underlying health conditions or of advanced age should be allowed to opt out and given alternative jobs outside the classroom, if possible, Nuzzo said, and children with underlying conditions should continue to learn from home.\n\nThe leaders of the two new studies, Drosten and Ajelli, were both more circumspect, saying their role is merely to provide the data that governments can use to make policies.\n\n\"I'm somehow the bringer of the bad news, but I can't change the news,\" Drosten said. \"It's in the data.\"",

        "body": "\"At home, it seems to be a bit easier to focus on all the work,\" said one eighth grader who was struggling in school. \"Everything in general is easier.\"\n\nSalah-Deen Fouathia, an eighth grader at Voice Charter School in Queens, was struggling in school. It was hard to pay attention. Math was a challenge. His grades in health class weren't great.\n\nSo when the pandemic closed all schools, reducing his classes to the size of a screen, his parents feared Salah-Deen would struggle even more. To their delight, the opposite has happened.\n\nWith fewer distractions and the help of his parents and teachers, his schooling has been going better, and his grades reflect that.\n\n\"At home, it seems to be a bit easier to focus on all the work I'm getting and it's almost like we're one on one with the teacher,\" Salah-Deen said. \"Everything in general is easier.\"\n\nFor the vast majority of students, remote learning is a poor substitute for being in the classroom. Not everyone has a laptop or reliable internet at home, and the socialization that happens in school can't be replicated online. There is widespread concern that many students, especially the most vulnerable, will fall behind.\n\nBut one unexpected silver lining of the shutdown has been an improved learning experience for certain students, including some who struggle to pay attention in class and even some high-achieving self-starters. Enough students are benefiting from this crash course in remote learning that parents and educators are wondering if, when buildings reopen, there are aspects that can be continued for these students, as well as lessons that can apply to everyone else.\n\nFor some, the avoidance of distractions like disruptive classmates, or simply not being in a room filled with other children, has been a boon. Others have taken advantage of the ability, when offered by their teachers, to work at their own pace and take breaks when they want.\n\nSome students have found it easier to participate in remote classes without the social pressures of a physical classroom. Introverts who are the last to volunteer an answer in class, even when they know it, are now making themselves heard.\n\n\"Kids who would not have put a hand up at the end of a lesson are now emailing me,\" said Mike Drosos, a seventh-grade math teacher at Voice Charter. He said that it seemed to help those students \"when the teacher isn't making direct eye contact six inches from their desk.\"\n\nMiari Roberts, a special education teacher at Brooklyn Academy High School, a transfer school for students who have not been successful elsewhere, said that she had seen something similar. One student in particular had not even been coming to school, Ms. Roberts said. Now she is turning in all her assignments.\n\n\"Because her attendance was so poor, some teachers didn't know her,\" Ms. Roberts said. \"Now those teachers are like, 'Wow, who's this girl?' It's this big turnaround.\"\n\nAnd the work she is handing in is good, Ms. Roberts said. When she asked the student why this works better for her, the girl said that her anxiety made going to school difficult.\n\nFor motivated students who don't need a lot of help from their teachers, learning from home means they can set their own pace. Kaleb Stumpenhorst, who is in sixth grade at a public school in suburban Chicago, wakes up every morning around 6:30 or 7 and gets right to work. He tackles one or two classes, usually starting with math, before stopping for breakfast. By 9:30 a.m., he is done for the day.\n\n\"I like doing work this way better because I can do it in my own time,\" he said, adding that it was by no means heaven. \"I like going to school because I can see all my friends.\"\n\nHis father, Josh Stumpenhorst, a middle school librarian in a nearby district, said that among his students, another group that has found some relief is children who are picked on by their classmates.\n\n\"Some of those kids are really liking it at home because they're not dealing with the social anxiety of being quote-unquote different,\" he said.\n\nEducators say behavior issues appear to be less of a problem in general. With many schools not offering \"live\" instruction, instead sending out assignments to complete each day or week, there is no class to disrupt. Even when a class takes place on Zoom, if a student has a tendency to goof off for attention, there's only so much attention that child can get while sitting at home, especially when the teacher has the power to mute a student's microphone.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Reopening begins in Connecticut. Religious services with up to 10 people can resume in N.Y. More than a third of residents in some poor N.Y.C. areas tested positive for virus antibodies. See more updates Updated 23m ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nOf course, those students, and many others, may not be doing well under remote instruction; Ms. Roberts said that a lot of her students are just not completing their work.\n\nEducational consultants at Teaching Matters, an organization focused on increasing teacher effectiveness, say the teachers they work with in New York City public schools each have at least one or two students who are thriving remotely. That leaves another 20-plus students who are not.\n\nFor nearly two decades, some education policymakers, tech titans and philanthropists have wanted to integrate computers more fully into education, with hybrid instruction that mixes online and in-person learning, letting students move at their own pace. But given the anxieties about screen time among parents and the potential for job loss among teachers, the idea has been tried in just a few schools.\n\nThe current experiment with digital schooling shows the promise of the approach for a subset of students, if by no means the majority.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nWhat should I do with my 401(k)?\n\nWatching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions -- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that \"free money.\"\n\n\"I hope if we learn anything from this,\" Mr. Stumpenhorst said, \"it's that this does work for some kids and could be a viable option, some kind of hybrid model, when we go back to normal.\"\n\nSome of what works for these children about remote learning, however, will not translate well to the schoolhouse, like the freedom from classroom distractions or bullying. Still, Lynette Guastaferro, the chief executive of Teaching Matters, says her organization will counsel teachers to keep using what they have learned remotely -- indeed, she expects they are going to have to, because school is unlikely to snap back to normal in September.\n\nThe way some teachers are incorporating videos and other multimedia into lessons is encouraging, she said, and could especially benefit so-called visual learners. Teachers could also let students use multiple ways of demonstrating they have mastered material -- some are allowing students to make videos or podcasts, for example, to show that they know how to construct an argument.\n\nTeachers could also lay out what they plan to teach, and how the students will be assessed, in a visual manner that students can refer back to, Ms. Guastaferro said.\n\n\"Why don't they give the kids a video they can watch over and over again at their own pace,\" she said. \"When they're learning the Pythagorean theorem, why not give them some multimedia that they can go backward and forward and watch over and over?\n\n\"There's no reason for all learning to be built for extroverted, socialized kids.\"\n\nJahaira Santiago, Salah-Deen's mother, said the way schoolwork is mapped out and sent home allows her and her husband to keep an eye on her son's assignments.\n\n\"I did struggle with, 'OK, what do you have to do today?'\" she said. \"Now I can just look at it, I don't have to wait until he tells me.\"\n\nMs. Santiago said that she and her husband check on Salah-Deen probably once every other hour to see if he needs help, give him encouragement and make sure he's doing his work.\n\nRemote learning has not just required adjustments for students, but for teachers as well. Administrators say that while some of their most successful teachers have struggled to connect with students this way, other educators have shown surprising results. Some teachers may work better alone. And for younger teachers, learning the technology wasn't such a stretch.\n\nSusan Enfield, the superintendent of Highline Public Schools near Seattle, said a principal recently told her about a teacher who had a tendency to be silent in meetings with colleagues and had trouble delivering effective lessons.\n\nBut as the teacher and her co-workers rewrote their playbook on the fly, she contributed innovative ideas, tutored parents so they could help their children, and reached the students with creative lessons. From her living room, she has blossomed.\n\nThe principal was planning to put the teacher on a remediation plan, Ms. Enfield said, \"but she's knocking it out of the park on remote learning.\"\n\nDana Goldstein contributed reporting.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nMANILA -- There were seven nurses in the Buendia family. One of them, Jhoanna Mariel Buendia, got a call from the Philippines on March 28, just before the start of her shift at an intensive care unit in a British hospital.\n\nIt was her father, with the news that her beloved aunt -- an ICU nurse, in Florida -- had died of complications from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nMs. Buendia, 27, went to work. She suited up, strapping on her N95 mask, face shield, gown and apron and taping down her gloves, too numb to process the fact that her aunt had lost her life doing what she was about to do. It wasn't until a few hours later, as she tended to a patient suspected to have the virus, that it became real and she burst into tears.\n\nNurses from the Philippines and other developing countries have long made up for shortages in wealthier Western nations. They now find themselves risking their lives on the front lines of a pandemic, thousands of miles from home.\n\nMs. Buendia's aunt, Araceli Buendia Ilagan, 63, was an associate supervisor in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. She was remembered as a nurses' nurse, turning down administrative promotions that would have taken her away from patients' bedsides.\n\n\"I guarantee you. She was in every single room helping every single nurse with every single patient,\" said Martha Baker, a registered nurse and president of Jackson Memorial's union for doctors and nurses, who had known Ms. Ilagan since the 1980s.\n\n\"That was probably her doom,\" Ms. Baker said. \"To be such a good leader, and such a hands-on leader. She exposed herself, perhaps at that time to patients we didn't even know were Covid-positive.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak President Bolsonaro cheers an anti-quarantine protest that called for military rule.

See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the world has six million fewer nurses than it needs. One result is that nurses in places like the Philippines have long gravitated toward wealthier countries for higher-paying opportunities.\n\nAlmost 16 percent of nurses in the United States are immigrants, and nearly a third of those -- the largest share -- are Filipinos. Many also come from Nigeria, India, Jamaica and Mexico, among other places. In Britain, Ms. Buendia is one of about 18,600 Filipino nurses working for the National Health Service, its second-largest contingent of migrant nurses, after Indians.\n\nLike other medical professionals, they are at high risk of exposure. At least seven Filipino employees of the NHS, including nurses, porters and a nurse's assistant, have died from Covid-19, according to news reports. In the United States, the virus has claimed the lives of at least five nurses and a doctor from the Philippines.\n\n\"The common denominator is that we're all scared,\" Ms. Buendia said of herself and her three housemates, who are also Filipino nurses. They all work at the same hospital in York and have been in England since September.\n\nHoward Catton, chief executive of the International Council of Nurses, a federation of national nurse associations, said migrant nurses had been \"massively important\" in helping countries like Britain, Spain and Italy fight the virus.\n\nBut he said the crisis underscored the need for developed countries to train their own nurses rather than relying so heavily on migrants.\n\nThis month, the Philippines, which says it needs about 300,000 more health care workers than it has, barred them from leaving the country, citing the need to protect them from infection and to ensure they were available to fight the virus at home.\n\nMigration is woven into the Philippines' culture. As much as 10 percent of the population works overseas, sending money home, and nursing is one of the most popular options. On average, 13,000 nurses go abroad each year. Nursing recruitment agencies pave the way for visas and certifications so they can find jobs overseas.\n\nEven some Filipino migrants who work in other fields have had training in nursing. Last month in Madrid, the Filipino chief nurse at Hospital Hestia, Edzel Lopez, posted an urgent call on Facebook asking her compatriots to apply for nursing jobs there. Much of the hospital's staff had been infected by the coronavirus, and bureaucratic obstacles to hiring new nurses were being swept away.\n\nThe Spanish hospital hired John Matthew Eusebio Villapol, a 26-year-old from the city of Tagaytay, who was working as an English teacher but had experience training Philippine Army medics and working for private ambulance services. \"It was a battlefield promotion, so to speak,\" Mr. Villapol said.\n\nAfter a day of training, Mr. Villapol said, he was assigned half a floor's worth of patients. He planned to report for work on his second day off, knowing they would be short-staffed however many people showed up. \"I'll work if they'll have me,\" he said.\n\nMs. Buendia's family, whose roots are in the northern Philippine city of Baguio, has sent nurses to hospitals in Florida, California, Britain and Saudi Arabia.\n\nMs. Buendia joined the profession to follow in her aunt's footsteps. Ms. Ilagan helped her through college, sending money and guiding her through tough times in nursing school. She mentored Ms. Buendia from a distance as the young nurse began her career in Saudi Arabia, later moving to Britain.\n\nMs. Ilagan called Ms. Buendia late last month, as the gravity of the pandemic was becoming apparent in both of the countries where they worked. Coronavirus cases had begun turning up at their hospitals.\n\nIt was a conversation of familial concern, couched in the language of their shared profession. They chatted about basic infection protocol; Ms. Ilagan gave her niece tips, like how to disconnect patients from tubing in a way that would keep fluids from spattering her. They reassured each other that they were fine.\n\nIt was the last time they spoke. Soon afterward, Ms. Ilagan developed flu-like symptoms and began self-isolating at home. Four days later, her husband found her unconscious and struggling to breathe. He rushed her to the hospital, but she died before they could intubate her.\n\n\"I was so shocked,\" Ms. Buendia said. Since then, her uncle, a nurse in California, has tested positive for the virus and been hospitalized.\n\nMs. Buendia's parents have been calling her from the Philippines every day, often in tears. \"They can't sleep at night,\" she said. \"I reassure them that I'm fine.\"\n\nIn truth, she is afraid. But she has no thoughts of giving up the work. \"That's the reason why I'm here, to be a nurse,\" she said.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nGood morning and welcome to On Politics, a daily political analysis of the 2020 elections based on reporting by New York Times journalists.\n\nSign up here to get On Politics in your inbox every weekday.\n\nWhere things stand\n\nWith Republicans and Democrats at loggerheads in Washington, state governments may have to wait awhile to see if Congress will send them the new aid package that many governors say they need. But in the meantime, governors say they are having trouble getting access to even the relatively modest $139 billion that Congress allocated to the states last month as part of its $2 trillion CARES Act. At issue are new rules set by the Treasury Department stipulating that states can use this money only to cover costs directly related to coronavirus response. Many governors say they don't need the cash for that -- they need help covering budget shortfalls resulting from lost revenues, which themselves have been caused by the virus. \"It is clear the revenue loss is going to be coronavirus related; it is just that the expenditures are not specifically for coronavirus,\" said Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who joined 45 other Democratic senators in signing a letter over the weekend urging the Trump administration to loosen restrictions on funding for the states.\n\nThe Supreme Court issued three rulings on Monday, including an 8-to-1 decision that effectively prevented Republicans in Congress from undermining a key part of the Affordable Care Act. The court ruled that Congress must make good on the law's promise to reimburse insurers who sustained losses because of their participation in the health care exchanges set up under the 2010 legislation. In a separate case, the justices took a pass on issuing what would have been their first decision in over a decade on the scope of the Second Amendment. They decided that the case, which pertained to a gun control measure in New York City, was moot because the city had already repealed the law in question.\n\nIn a third case, with seemingly esoteric but nevertheless far-reaching implications, the court ruled that Georgia could not copyright its entire legal code, which includes state laws and the official annotations explaining them. \"If everything short of statutes and opinions were copyrightable, then states would be free to offer a whole range of premium legal works for those who can afford the extra benefit,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. \"With today's digital tools, states might even launch a subscription or pay-per-law service.\" About 20 other states have similarly sought to copyright parts of their code and will now be forced to change course.\n\nNancy Pelosi's endorsement on Monday of Joe Biden for president came as a surprise to absolutely no one. But the language that the House speaker used may offer some clues as to how Biden plans to position himself as he pivots toward a general-election campaign upended by the pandemic. Biden has been conspicuously absent from the public eye of late, but those around him say he has been keenly focused on preparing to take charge of a country in crisis, should he win November's election. In her remarks, Pelosi sought to portray Biden's lack of visibility as a positive, arguing that he has been hard at work preparing for the office he hopes to assume. \"As we face coronavirus, Joe has been a voice of reason and resilience, with a clear path to lead us out of this crisis,\" she said. \"I want to tell you about the Joe Biden I've seen working behind the scenes, hammering out solutions for the American people -- a leader with the humility to seek expertise in science and the competence to act upon it,\" she said, drawing an implicit contrast between Biden and President Trump.\n\nPhoto of the day\n\nPresident Trump appeared at a news conference in the Rose Garden of the White House on Monday.\n\nHere's why Bernie Sanders denounced the cancellation of New York's primary.\n\nBy Nick Corasaniti\n\nBernie Sanders's suspended presidential campaign issued a scorching statement on Monday depicting the decision by the New York Board of Elections to cancel the state's presidential primary election as nothing short of disenfranchisement.\n\nThough he officially ended his campaign this month, Sanders has indicated that he wants every remaining primary to still be held, and for his supporters to still vote for him.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The C.D.C. expands the list of symptoms, and the W.H.O. warns of a long road ahead. President Trump unveils a plan to help states expand testing. Experts say it is not enough. States have different strategies for restarting the economy. Trump suggests opening some schools. See more updates Updated 13m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nHis reasoning? For one, he wants to accrue more delegates before the Democratic National Convention, so he can use them as leverage in policy discussions with Biden.\n\nBut Sanders and his legion of loyalists also share another fear: The Vermont senator is a uniquely galvanizing force in progressive politics, and having his name atop the ticket was expected to turn out many liberal voters for New York's June 23 election who otherwise might not come out to vote. That, in turn, could help put wind in the sails of progressive candidates in down-ballot races.\n\nThe New York elections board did not call off the state and local elections that will be held on June 23 -- only the presidential primary.\n\nOne of the progressive candidates worried that New York voters have lost one of their greatest motivators is Jamaal Bowman, a middle school principal in the Bronx who is challenging Representative Eliot Engel in the 16th Congressional District.\n\n\"I'm worried that this could depress turnout among younger voters in my primary challenge,\" Bowman said in a statement. \"This is terrible for our democracy and our party. My heart goes out to all the organizers who were part of the Bernie campaign and movement.\"\n\nOn Politics is also available as a newsletter.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- About a week after the first report of a Covid-19 case at a meatpacking plant in southwest Kansas in early April, the state's governor, Laura Kelly, issued a pointed warning to President Trump: Without test kits to separate the well from the sick, a fast-moving outbreak could idle facilities that produce roughly one quarter of the nation's meat supply.\n\nWithin three days, 80 blue-and-white boxes of test kits and testing machines arrived, and two Black Hawk helicopters from the Kansas National Guard whisked them to the afflicted region. As the test results came in last week, the costs of the delay became clear: 250 workers in six plants were already infected.\n\nIn Albany, Ga., a hot spot for the disease, a hospital finally figured out a way to run its own coronavirus tests, rather than relying on limited state capacity or outsourcing the work to slow-moving private labs. But it still struggles to run as many tests as it would like because of a shortage of components.\n\nIn Ohio, a research institution in Columbus is partnering with a plastics company to churn out nasal swabs on 3-D printers for use in the state. But when Mysheika W. Roberts, the city's health commissioner, offered test kits to local health centers, she learned they lacked the protective gear they needed to put them to use.\n\nAs governors decide about opening their economies, they continue to be hampered by a shortage of testing capacity, leaving them without the information that public health experts say is needed to track outbreaks and contain them. And while the United States has made strides over the past month in expanding testing, its capacity is nowhere near the level Mr. Trump suggests it is.\n\nThere are numerous reasons. It has proved hard to increase production of reagents -- sensitive chemical ingredients that detect whether the coronavirus is present -- partly because of federal regulations intended to ensure safety and partly because manufacturers, who usually produce them in small batches, have been reluctant to invest in new capacity without assurance that the surge in demand will be sustained.\n\nSome physical components of test kits, like nasal swabs, are largely imported and hard to come by amid global shortages. Health care workers still lack the protective gear they need to administer tests on a wide-scale basis. Labs have been slow to add people and equipment to process the swelling numbers of tests.\n\nOn top of all that, the administration has resisted a full-scale national mobilization, instead intervening to allocate scarce equipment on an ad hoc basis and leaving production bottlenecks and shortages largely to market forces. Governors, public health officials and hospital executives say they are still operating in a kind of Wild West economy that has left them scrambling -- and competing with one another -- to procure the equipment and other materials they need.\n\n\"You are using a free-market model in a public health emergency,\" Governor Kelly, a Democrat, said an interview, \"and I'm not sure those two go together particularly well.\"\n\nThe United States conducted about 1.2 million tests from April 16 to April 22, up from about 200,000 tests between March 16 and March 22, according to data from The Covid Tracking Project.\n\nBut as states begin to reopen, the nation is far from being able to conduct the kind of widespread surveillance testing that health experts say would be optimal. Many states are still struggling to conduct much more urgent testing of patients with symptoms, or those in high-risk groups. Few have the money or the personnel to also check on the presence of the virus in the general population or to reach out to people who have been in contact with those confirmed to be ill.\n\n\"We are not in a situation where we can say we are exactly where we want to be with regard to testing,\" Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's leading infectious disease expert, said this week in an interview with Time.\n\nThe three-phase White House plan, Opening Up America Again, does not detail a national testing strategy or provide numerical benchmarks for how much testing is necessary. It says states should have a \"downward trajectory of positive tests\" or a \"downward trajectory of documented cases\" over a period of two weeks, while conducting robust contact tracing and \"sentinel surveillance\" testing of asymptomatic people in vulnerable populations, such as nursing homes.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Three states are moving to reopen. But the path ahead is far from simple. Trump's remarks on disinfectants prompt a scramble from doctors, manufacturers, and his party. The pandemic has put international students and Americans abroad in a tough spot. See more updates Updated 51m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nCongress is pushing the administration to give states more guidance. The $484 billion relief package passed last week included $25 billion to expand testing and required the administration to come up with a strategic testing plan to support the states.\n\nIn the meantime, a flurry of research groups, professors and other experts have stepped in with proposals. On the low end, the liberal Center for American Progress estimates that eight-tenths of one percent of the national population must be tested each week to contain the virus. On the high end, a group from Harvard has put the figure at as much as 21 percent.\n\nMost states -- including Georgia, where nonessential businesses have been allowed to start reopening -- fall far short of even the lowest estimates.\n\nIn Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine announced on Friday a deal with Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher Scientific that will begin providing the state with 7,200 tests a day by Wednesday and scale up by the end of May to 22,000 a day. That trajectory is enough, he said in an interview, to make him feel comfortable about taking the first steps toward reopening businesses on Monday.\n\nThat type of entrepreneurial response by some states is all well and good, said Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it does not help other states that are still struggling.\n\n\"It's great to have innovation from academia and the private sector to come up with new ways to do things as efficiently as possible,\" he said, \"but on the other hand we do need national coordination.\"\n\nMr. Trump continues to insist that the current approach is adequate.\n\n\"America's testing capability and capacity is fully sufficient to begin opening up the country, totally,\" he said at one point this month. At another, he said that \"we are doing more testing I think than probably any of the governors even want.\"\n\nThat is not true.\n\nKansas: 'There Will Be Death.'\n\nAfter getting 2,000 tests kits to southwest Kansas and assessing the scale of the outbreak there, Ms. Kelly decided it was not necessary to close the meatpacking plants.\n\nBut she said the tortuous path to freeing up even minimal supplies for testing remains the biggest reason she is reluctant to lift the stay-at-home order she imposed on March 28.\n\n\"We are nowhere near where we need to be with testing supplies,\" she said on Thursday. \"I'm looking down a lot of rabbit holes trying to figure out how we are going to get those test kits here. It's imperative if we are going to be able to lift that stay at home order.\"\n\nKansas has one of the lowest Covid-19 testing rates in the nation. Dr. Lee A. Norman, the state's top health official, estimated that Kansas needed tens of thousands more testing kits.\n\nThe state is so short of plastic test swabs that he has appealed to dentists to manufacture them in their offices by modifying 3-D printers used to make dental models.\n\nSince March 20, Kansas has sent the Federal Emergency Management Agency nine requests for medical supplies, including for 235,000 testing swabs, 60,000 kits to transport samples and 178,200 kits to analyze them. As of Wednesday, the agency had sent \"nothing,\" said Jonathan York, the state's coordinating officer. Federal officials told him that other states were in more desperate shape.\n\nIn mid-April, the federal government delivered 273,000 surgical masks, the kind needed to protect medical workers who administer tests. But Dr. Norman said the masks, which had been privately donated, \"were so substandard they wouldn't even make a good coffee filter.\"\n\nLate on Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has helped the state obtain some supplies, told officials it intended to ship at least 25,000 of the 80,000 test kits it had requested.\n\nState officials have had no luck trying to buy supplies themselves. Dr. Norman said Kansas had standing requests with private suppliers for $43 million in equipment, a \"staggering\" sum equivalent to nearly a third of his department's annual public health budget.\n\n\"But the pipelines have pretty much dried up,\" he said.\n\nKansas is still dealing with the hangover of seven years of draconian budget cuts under former Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican. Ms. Kelly said the state health department \"had been pretty much decimated\" by the time she became governor in 2018, with the laboratory that now processes many Covid-19 tests resembling \"something out of the past.\"\n\nThe state plans to rely heavily on volunteers to create a corps of 400 workers to monitor the contacts of people who test positive.\n\nAlthough the state is far from meeting the broad guidelines for testing capacity the White House has recommended for reopening, Ms. Kelly is under growing pressure to allow her stay-at home order to expire as scheduled on May 3. The Republican-controlled state legislature has moved to curb her emergency powers, and protesters gathered on Thursday on the statehouse grounds.\n\n\"What is an acceptable level of risk?\" Dr. Norman asked. \"We cannot get it down to zero, so how can we guarantee that people won't get sick?\"\n\nWhatever the course of action, he said, \"there will be death.\"\n\nGeorgia: 'It's Not Gone.'\n\nAs Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany, Ga., began filling up last month with gasping patients, Scott Steiner, the hospital system's president, immediately encountered the ways in which a lack of testing capacity left the region vulnerable.\n\nHe wanted to test as many patients and staff members as he could, but the state's laboratory had set criteria so strict that few people qualified. When he turned to LabCorp, a private company, results took as many as 10 days to come back. With no way to know if patients were positive, doctors and nurses burned through precious protective equipment until the results came in.\n\nSo Mr. Steiner decided the hospital had no choice but to develop the capacity to test on its own. He and his staff considered buying a testing machine from Abbott Laboratories, a company that had been praised by Mr. Trump, but worried about competing with the federal government over scarce supplies.\n\nFinally, they decided to buy $400,000 worth of equipment from Cepheid, a California-based diagnostic company.\n\nNow, the hospital tests every patient who is admitted, even those coming in for unrelated procedures, as well as outpatients who have symptoms. The number of cases has fallen, as has the percentage of patients testing positive, from about 40 percent in March to 25 percent in April.\n\nBut doctors can't run as many tests as they would like. Mr. Steiner said he requested enough materials from Cepheid for 1,500 tests a week, but the company has only sent enough to do between 400 and 900.\n\n\"We didn't get any last week,\" he said. \"We heard that there were other government agencies that took the supply.\"\n\nSo far he has been unable to get tests for antibodies, which help to show how many people have already contracted the virus, and the county health department's efforts to conduct contact tracing are at a very early stage.\n\nMr. Steiner has seen both the devastation of the virus and also the increasing risks of the shutdown for patients who have had to delay surgeries, including breast cancer patients awaiting mastectomies. The hospital, which gets most of its income from elective surgeries, could resume those procedures in a few weeks.\n\nBut nearly 100 Covid-positive patients remain in the hospital. And on a single day this week, eight more patients were admitted.\n\n\"It's not gone,\" Mr. Steiner said.\n\nOhio: 'Are We Testing Enough People?'\n\nAlthough Mr. DeWine, a Republican, has been one of the most aggressive governors in addressing the crisis, testing has been a concern from the start.\n\nOn April 1, the state's health director, Amy Acton, ordered hospitals to stop sending coronavirus tests to private laboratories because a huge backlog had created delays of up to 10 days in processing. (This week, Mr. DeWine lifted the order, saying the labs had caught up.)\n\nBut by March 31, Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center and Battelle, a nonprofit research institute, had developed their own test that produced results within five hours. Ohio State now processes slightly more than 1,000 tests a day, with a capacity of 4,500 per day, said Harold L. Paz, the Wexner Medical Center's chief executive.\n\nFacing a shortage of nasal swabs, the medical center teamed up with a plastics maker to produce swabs on 3-D printers; it has received 15,000 swabs, with another 100,000 expected soon.\n\nYet the health commissioner in Columbus, Dr. Roberts, was struggling to keep up with the demand. While she supervises a staff of 450 people with a budget of $45 million, she said she and her team probably spent 20 percent of their time searching for necessary test kits and supplies.\n\nA little over a week ago, the state shipped her 1,000 test kits. She will distribute them judiciously, she said, focusing on nursing homes and other hot spots or high-risk groups.\n\n\"I worry, are we testing enough people?\" she said. \"And how do we get the tests to the right people and make sure that we don't have something brewing that we failed to pay enough attention to and it becomes a huge fire.\"\n\nOhio's testing capacity has been limited by a shortage of reagents, the compounds needed to process the tests. Mr. DeWine complained privately to Vice President Mike Pence that the Food and Drug Administration was moving too slowly to approve a new reagent made by Thermo Fisher Scientific. Last Sunday, Mr. DeWine repeated his plea for faster action on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nThe pressure campaign worked; on Tuesday, Mr. DeWine announced the F.D.A. had granted approval, clearing the way for his announcement on Friday about expanded testing.\n\nMr. DeWine said Ohio would now have enough capacity to do intensive testing in hot spots and to test the contacts of those infected, helping to guide him through \"gut-wrenching decisions\" about the balance between getting the economy going again and keeping people from spreading the virus.\n\n\"Frankly,\" he said, \"I feel a lot better than a few days ago when I didn't have this.\"\n\nSheryl Stolberg and Sharon LaFraniere reported from Washington, and Farah Stockman from Cambridge, Mass.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIt has been hours since the 71-year-old man in Room 3 of the intensive care unit succumbed to Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. His body has been cleaned, packed in an orange bag and covered in a white sheet, but the overextended transport team from the morgue has yet to arrive.\n\nThe nurses on duty have too many other worries. University Hospital of Brooklyn, in the heart of the city hit hardest by a world-altering pandemic, can seem like it is falling apart. The roof leaks. The corroded pipes burst with alarming frequency. On one of the intensive care units, plastic tarps and duct tape serve as flimsy barriers separating patients. Nurses record vital signs with pen and paper, rather than computer systems.\n\nA patient in Room 2 is losing blood pressure and needs an ultrasound. A therapist is working to calm a woman in Room 4 who is intubated and semiconscious and who tried to rip out her breathing tube when her arm restraints were unfastened.\n\nGenevieve Watson-Grey, the head nurse on duty, says she relies on faith and prayer to fill the gap between need and reality. \"Knowing there is a higher force above,\" she says, gives her hope.\n\nEvery hospital in New York has struggled to cope with the pandemic, but the outbreak has laid bare the deep disparities in the city's health care system. The virus is killing black and Latino New Yorkers at about twice the rate of white residents, and hospitals serving the sickest patients often work with the fewest resources.\n\nWealthy private hospitals, primarily in Manhattan, have been able to marshal reserves of cash and political clout to increase patient capacity quickly, ramp up testing and acquire protective gear. At the height of the surge, the Mount Sinai health system was able to enlist private planes from Warren E. Buffett's company to fly in coveted N95 masks from China.\n\nUniversity Hospital, which is publicly funded and part of SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, has tried to raise money for protective gear through a GoFundMe page started by a resident physician.\n\nMost of the hospital's patients are poor and people of color, and it gets more than 80 percent of its revenue from government programs like Medicare and Medicaid.\n\nDr. Robert Foronjy, the hospital's chief of pulmonary and critical care medicine, oversees the unit with the plastic tarps and duct tape. He said that he did not believe that any patients were lost because of inadequate resources. But the \"aged and crumbling\" facilities, he said, had made the job of caring for such patients much harder.\n\n\"Why shouldn't an African-American have facilities that are at the same level of other patient populations?\" he said.\n\nWhen George James, a 60-year-old former public housing superintendent arrived at University Hospital in March to have an infection unrelated to the coronavirus treated, he did not have Covid-19 symptoms. Within days, though, he tested positive for the disease. As he gasped for breath one night in his hospital bed, he panicked when he was unable to call a nurse.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York All pharmacies in New York will be able to test for Covid-19, Governor Cuomo says. Governor Murphy says New Jersey will soon have details on a plan for reopening. The mood in New York City darkens as the pandemic begins to feel endless. See more updates Updated 6h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\n\"I didn't go to sleep the whole night because I was scared,\" he said. \"I couldn't breathe.\"\n\nInstead of a modern call button or intercom system, all he had was a silver bell, the kind used in hotels decades ago to summon the concierge.\n\n'We need a new hospital'\n\nIt was late February and Dr. Wayne J. Riley, president of SUNY Downstate Health Sciences University, was at a conference in Atlanta when his phone began to ping with ominous messages. It was becoming clearer that the novel coronavirus, which had ravaged parts of China and Italy, had begun to spread rapidly in the United States.\n\n\"I said, 'My gosh, if this thing really does take root in the United States then, here in Brooklyn, we're going to have a problem,'\" he recalled.\n\nNot only did Dr. Riley worry about the resources that would be needed to provide care during a pandemic, he feared that the hospital's patients would be particularly susceptible to the disease.\n\nThe central Brooklyn neighborhoods where most of University Hospital's patients live, East Flatbush and Prospect Lefferts Gardens, have higher-than-average concentrations of chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension and obesity, which preliminary studies have shown make Covid-19 most deadly.\n\nThe hospital opened in 1963 and it was meant to accommodate about 60,000 visits a year. Despite having almost no physical improvements, it now handles about 200,000 visits annually. The bunkerlike concrete building is crumbling from within. Earlier this year, a leaky roof forced a temporary evacuation of premature babies from a neonatal intensive care unit.\n\n\"It is too, too old compared to other hospitals across the water,\" Dr. Riley said. \"We need a new hospital to be prepared for the next pandemic and to better serve our community.\"\n\nSigns inside the hospital are written in English, Spanish and Creole, a reflection of the large number of immigrants in the area, particularly from the West Indies.\n\nMany of the patients work but are poor or receive government assistance. Many are uninsured and use the hospital for emergencies and primary care. They come from a men's shelter up the street or from a nearby home for domestic violence survivors to fill prescriptions or to have their diabetes checked.\n\n\"The day-to-day stress on these communities is just incredible, and that is driving these conditions,\" said Dr. Moro Salifu, the chairman of the hospital's department of medicine.\n\nThe hospital has been in financial disarray for years. A 2013 audit by the state comptroller's office found that it was on a path toward insolvency. It was bleeding millions of dollars every week, the audit found, and only infusions of state money were keeping it afloat. It has also been poorly managed. Subsequent audits found that hospital leaders had used government money on a lavish birthday celebration in Bermuda for a consultant who was paid tens of millions of dollars, but who did very little to improve the hospital's finances.\n\nDr. Riley, who became president in 2017, after the Bermuda birthday celebration, insisted that the limited resources had not affected the quality of care. The hospital, though, has at times been accused of violating safety standards.\n\nLast July, the hospital suspended its transplant program after a review uncovered high mortality rates and serious safety concerns. Two doctors, the surgery department's former chairman and another surgeon, filed wrongful termination lawsuits, accusing hospital officials of firing them as retaliation for their complaints about lax safety standards. The program has since been reactivated.\n\nEven so, the hospital is vital to the community. Together with its affiliated teaching university, it is Brooklyn's fourth-largest employer. The university, which is part of the State University of New York system, is the largest medical college in New York City, and it produces a large percentage of the doctors working here.\n\nWhen the pandemic first hit the city, Andrew M. Cuomo, New York's governor, ordered the hospital to take only patients who had the virus. The decision rankled medical workers and others, who complained about having to shoulder the heavy burden with limited resources.\n\n\"We're now in a situation where an under-resourced hospital is being asked to manage the epicenter of the crisis,\" said Zellnor Myrie, a Democratic state senator whose district includes University Hospital. \"The dollars that we failed to invest years ago are affecting life-and-death decisions now.\"\n\n'This is someone's mother'\n\nThe first patient with Covid-19 at University Hospital, a 74-year-old woman on dialysis with hypertension and diabetes, was identified on March 12.\n\n\"I got the first call at 5:51 p.m. that we had our first case,\" said Dr. Salifu, the department of medicine chairman. \"I remember exactly where I was on 9/11, and I knew exactly where I was when I got this call.\"\n\nWithin days, the cramped emergency room, which looks much the same as it did when the hospital first opened, was inundated. At times, more than 100 coughing, feverish patients were packed into hallways and side rooms, or clustered around the nursing station, spewing virus into the air.\n\nThe hospital came close to running out of ventilators. Julie Eason, the director of respiratory therapy, said she had to \"get a little bit creative\" as she tried to ration resources while keeping up with all of the Code 99s, the term used when a patient needs to be intubated.\n\n\"It was just endless,\" she said. \"Code 99s would come in three, four different rooms all within a few minutes of each other, all day long.\"\n\nMedical workers began to get sick, and several nurses ended up intubated in the hospital's I.C.U.\n\n\"We were stewing in it,\" an emergency room doctor, Lorenzo Paladino, said.\n\nDoctors and nurses complained that the conditions put them at greater risk than colleagues at other hospitals.\n\nDr. Foronjy, the I.C.U. physician, said he knew a doctor at a well-funded Manhattan hospital who walked around without a mask, assured that the sealed-off negative-pressure rooms there would protect him from the virus-infected patients inside.\n\nNot so at University Hospital.\n\n\"Having to work with such an antiquated infrastructure is incredibly stressful,\" Dr. Foronjy said. \"You have to worry more about your own safety.\"\n\nThe city and state health departments have not released data on mortality rates by hospital, but given the high instance of pre-existing conditions among patients at University Hospital, doctors there estimated that its mortality rates must be among the highest in the city.\n\nAs the death toll began to mount, the bodies overwhelmed the hospital's small, 10-person morgue. Then they filled not one, but two refrigerated tractor-trailers parked outside.\n\nThe hospital's mortician, Michael McGillicuddy, had to hire six additional staff members to help manage the morgue. Recently, a steady stream of black hearses has arrived at the hospital each day to pick up bodies, but new ones soon replace those that are taken away.\n\n\"I'm doing it with dignity, trying not to pile the bodies up,\" Mr. McGillicuddy said. \"This is someone's mother or grandmother.\"\n\n'We don't have a lot of money'\n\nAlthough the rate of new infections is dropping in New York, the intensive care units at University Hospital are full. Nearly 50 patients remain in serious condition, attached to ventilators. Some have been hospitalized for weeks, their limbs nestled in yellow foam cushions to prevent bed sores. (Reporters with The New York Times spent two days at the hospital but did not have access to patient information because of privacy regulations.)\n\nNurses on the units said they were overworked and understaffed. In normal times, their jobs are so demanding that they are required to care for no more than two patients at once. Now, they are tending to three or four at a time, increasing the risk of mistakes.\n\nVentilators, which take over for virus-battered lungs and have been crucial in the pandemic, require constant calibration to keep patients' oxygen levels just right. Nurses must monitor endotracheal tubes, which can get clogged and block airways. In Covid-19 patients, the heart or the kidneys can fail without warning.\n\nA lack of protective gear remains a problem. Much of what the nurses are wearing is mismatched, donated from friends and neighbors or brought from home. One nurse complained that she had bought her mask herself and had been wearing the same bootees on her feet for the past three days.\n\n\"As you know, we are a state facility. We don't have a lot of money,\" said Rose Green, a nurse who was helping to staff the unit on her day off.\n\nThe hospital has begun to celebrate some successes. Recently, a nurse and a nursing assistant were taken off ventilators. On April 16, the hospital posted a video on Twitter of another nurse who had been intubated after coming down with Covid-19. She was being wheeled out of the emergency room to applause from colleagues.\n\nOn a recent day, a man in his 50s who had just come off a ventilator was sitting up in his room drinking a bottle of juice.\n\nA nurse passed by and waved excitedly.",

        "body": "Young, healthy people like me are getting very, very sick from the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nThe day before I got sick, I ran three miles, walked 10 more, then raced up the stairs to my fifth-floor apartment as always, slinging laundry with me as I went.\n\nThe next day, April 17, I became one of the thousands of New Yorkers to fall ill with Covid-19. I haven't felt the same since.\n\nIf you live in New York City, you know what this virus can do. In just under two months, an estimated 24,000 New Yorkers have died. That's more than twice the number of people we lost to homicide over the past 20 years.\n\nNow I worry for Americans elsewhere. When I see photographs of crowds packing into a newly reopened big-box store in Arkansas or scores of people jammed into a Colorado restaurant without masks, it's clear too many Americans still don't grasp the power of this disease.\n\nThe second day I was sick, I woke up to what felt like hot tar buried deep in my chest. I could not get a deep breath unless I was on all fours. I'm healthy. I'm a runner. I'm 33 years old.\n\nIn the emergency room an hour later, I sat on a hospital bed, alone and terrified, my finger hooked to a pulse-oxygen machine. To my right lay a man who could barely speak but coughed constantly. To my left was an older man who said that he had been sick for a month and had a pacemaker. He kept apologizing to the doctors for making so much trouble, and thanking them for taking such good care of him. I can't stop thinking about him even now.\n\nFinally, Dr. Audrey Tan walked toward me, her kind eyes meeting mine from behind a mask, goggles and a face shield. \"Any asthma?\" she asked. \"Do you smoke? Any pre-existing conditions?\" \"No, no, none,\" I replied. Dr. Tan smiled, then shook her head, almost imperceptibly. \"I wish I could do something for you,\" she said.\n\nI am one of the lucky ones. I never needed a ventilator. I survived. But 27 days later, I still have lingering pneumonia. I use two inhalers, twice a day. I can't walk more than a few blocks without stopping.\n\nI want Americans to understand that this virus is making otherwise young, healthy people very, very sick. I want them to know, this is no flu.\n\nEven healthy New Yorkers in their 20s have been hospitalized. At least 13 children in New York state have died from Covid-19, according to health department data. My friend's 29-year-old boyfriend was even sicker than I was and at one point could barely walk across their living room.\n\nMaybe you don't live in a big city. Maybe you don't know anybody who is sick. Maybe you think we are crazy for living in New York. That's fine. You don't have to live like us or vote like us. But please learn from us. Please take this virus seriously.\n\nWhen I was at my sickest, I could barely talk on the phone. I'd like to say that I caught up on some reading, but I didn't. I'm a newswoman, but I couldn't look at the news.\n\nInstead, I closed my eyes and saw myself running along the New York waterfront, healthy and whole, all 8.5 million of my neighbors by my side. I pictured myself doing the things I haven't gotten to do yet, like getting married, buying a house, becoming a mother, owning a dog.\n\nI stared at the wall of photographs beside my living room window and promised the people in them over and over again that we would see each other soon.\n\nI watched movies, dozens of them. I rediscovered \"Air Force One\" and fantasized about what it would be like if Harrison Ford were actually president right now. I stayed up late at night doing breathing exercises and streaming episodes of \"Longmire,\" a show about a Wyoming sheriff in which the good guys always win.\n\nOne thing I learned is how startlingly little care or advice is available to the millions of Americans managing symptoms at home.\n\nIn Germany, the government sends teams of medical workers to do house calls. Here in the United States, where primary care is an afterthought, the only place most people suffering from Covid-19 can get in-person care is the emergency room. That's a real problem given that it is a disease that can lead to months of serious symptoms and turn from mild to deadly in a matter of hours.\n\nThe best care I received came from my friends. Fred, an emergency room resident treating patients at a New York hospital, called me on his bike ride to work, constantly checking in and asking about my symptoms. Chelsea, my college roommate and a physician assistant, has largely managed my recovery from pneumonia. Zoe, my childhood friend and a nurse, taught me how to use a pulse oximeter and later, the asthma inhaler I now use.\n\nThrough them, I became an amateur expert. This is the advice they gave me. Here's what I'm telling my family and my friends: If you can, get an oximeter, a magical little device that measures your pulse and blood oxygen level from your fingertip. If you become sick and your oxygen dips below 95 or you have trouble breathing, go to the emergency room. Don't wait.\n\nIf you have chest symptoms, assume you may have pneumonia and call a doctor or go to the E.R. Sleep on your stomach, since much of your lungs is actually in your back. If your oxygen is stable, change positions every hour. Do breathing exercises, a lot of them. The one that seemed to work best for me was pioneered by nurses in the British health system and shared by J.K. Rowling, author of the Harry Potter series.\n\nNearly a month later, I'm still sleeping on my stomach and still can't go for a run. But I will be able to do those things, and much more. For now, every conversation with an old friend brings a new rush of love. Every sunny day feels like the first time I saw the ocean as a child and wanted to leap right in.\n\nMany of my neighbors didn't make it. I know because I heard the ambulances come for them late at night. The reports from the city's heroic E.M.T. force suggest that for many of these New Yorkers, it was already too late.\n\nWhy are more people dying of this disease in the United States than in anywhere else in the world? Because we live in a broken country, with a broken health care system. Because even though people of all races and backgrounds are suffering, the disease in the United States has hit black and brown and Indigenous people the hardest, and we are seen as expendable.\n\nI wonder how many people have died not necessarily because of the virus but because this country failed them and left them to fend for themselves. That is the grief for me now, that is the guilt and the rage.\n\nAs I began to recover, others died.\n\nThere was Idris Bey, 60, a U.S. Marine and New York City Fire Department E.M.T. instructor who received a medal for his actions after the Sept. 11 attack.\n\nThere was Rana Zoe Mungin, 30, a New York City social studies teacher whose family said she died after struggling to get care in Brooklyn.\n\nThere was Valentina Blackhorse, 28, a beautiful young Arizona woman who dreamed of leading the Navajo Nation.\n\nTheirs were the faces I saw when I lay on my stomach at night, laboring for every deep breath, praying for them and for me. Those are the Americans I think about every time I walk outside now in my tidy Brooklyn neighborhood, stepping slowly into the warming spring sun amid a crush of blooming lilacs and small children whizzing blissfully by on their scooters.\n\nI hope the coronavirus never comes to your town. But if it does, I will pray for you, too.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

        "body": "When I heard that a co-worker had died from Covid-19 -- the first in the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- on March 27, I thought, \"It's starting.\" More deaths followed in quick succession, frequently more than once a day. Some of those people I used to see every day and fist bump.\n\nOn Facebook, when bad news comes, my co-workers and I express grief and offer condolences to the families. But our spontaneous response is the numb curiosity of an onlooker. We knew this was coming. We knew many among us wouldn't make it through the pandemic.\n\nEvery day I see posts on the M.T.A. workers' group pages striking a jaunty tone: \"Oh Lord, here we go. I got the symptoms, see you all in 14 days. Or not.\"\n\nWe work at the epicenter of the epicenter, with a fatality rate substantially higher than that of first responders. Common sense tells you that subway trains and platforms are giant vectors of this virus. We breathe it in along with steel dust. As a conductor, when I stick my head out of the car to perform the required platform observation, passengers in many stations are standing 10 inches from my face. At other times, they lean into the cab to ask questions. Bus drivers, whose passengers enter right in front of them, are even worse off.\n\nMy co-workers want doors locked on the two cars where the crew rides. Bus drivers want to let passengers enter through the back doors. We want hazard pay and family leave for child care.\n\nIn mid-March, a bulletin came out mandating that conductors make an announcement every 15 minutes. Wash hands, soap and water, sanitizer, elbow-sneeze. \"Together we can help keep New York safe.\"\n\nThe irony was that we didn't have soap and water. At my terminal at that time, the restrooms were closed for three days after a water main break. Most employee restrooms are in similarly bad shape. Crew rooms are packed.\n\nThe M.T.A. takes stern action against workers seen without goggles or cotton knit safety gloves. Yet we had to work without protection against the coronavirus.\n\nAt first we were warned not to wear masks. The M.T.A. said it would panic the public. It said masks were dangerous for us. Later it said we could wear masks we bought ourselves. But by then there were few masks for sale.\n\nOne week after the pandemic was declared, a vice president of TWU Local 100 came to my terminal to give a talk. I rose to my feet in outrage and asked why we weren't receiving masks. I was told healthy people didn't need masks and that doctors needed them more. Aren't doctors healthy? No answer. How about rubber gloves and hand sanitizer? No answer.\n\nFinally, the M.T.A. agreed to supply us with personal protective equipment. When signing in, we get an N95 mask and three small packets of wipes the size of those used before a shot at the doctor's office. This is meant to last three days. We also get a small container to fill with hand sanitizer from a bottle in the dispatcher's office.\n\nThe masks are cheaply made. My co-workers complain that the masks pinch their noses. The straps break easily. Many masks must be secured with duct tape.\n\nOr so I have heard. Two days after the vice president's visit, I developed severe body aches, chills and a dry cough. On March 27, I woke up at 6 a.m. to go to the bathroom and collapsed. I made a quick call to a close friend and then dialed 911. An ambulance took me to NYU Langone Medical Center, where I was treated and discharged. I stayed isolated for 14 days, after which I felt better. My co-workers told me about a place where I could get tested. On April 15, I tested positive. Further quarantine. My direct-deposit statement shows $692: less than half my wages for the first pay period and nothing thereafter. (I had used up all of my sick days).\n\nThe third death I heard about was a black co-worker I used to see every day who once saw me reading Michelle Alexander's \"The New Jim Crow.\" He wanted to know why a woman from India was interested in the condition of black people. From then on, whenever we ran into each other we hugged and cheek-kissed.\n\nI used to talk to another co-worker across the platform when his N train and my R train reached Atlantic Avenue. He was one of only two Orthodox Jews in the rapid transit operation. A train buff, he once noticed that a cable that connects one car to another had come loose and was hanging dangerously near the third rail. He may have saved lives that day. Now he's dead, too.\n\nWe are stumbling upon dead bodies. I know of two cases. A train operator nearly tripped over one while walking between cars. The other person was sitting upright on a bench right outside the conductor's window and discovered to be dead only at the end of an eight-hour shift after my co-workers kept noticing the person on each trip.\n\nThe conditions created by the pandemic drive home the fact that we essential workers -- workers in general -- are the ones who keep the social order from sinking into chaos. Yet we are treated with the utmost disrespect, as though we're expendable. Since March 27, at least 98 New York transit workers have died of Covid-19. My co-workers say bitterly: \"We are not essential. We are sacrificial.\"\n\nThat may be true individually, but not in our numbers. Hopefully this experience will make us see clearly the crucial role we play in keeping society running so that we can stand up for our interests, for our lives. Like the Pittsburgh sanitation workers walking out to demand protective equipment. Like the G.E. workers calling on the company to repurpose plants to make ventilators instead of jet engines.\n\nI took my second test on April 30. It was negative. Tomorrow, I will go back to work.\n\nSujatha Gidla, an M.T.A. conductor, is the author of \"Ants Among Elephants: An Untouchable Family and the Making of Modern India.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "As a war veteran, I know that trauma survivors can emerge with a deeper, richer appreciation of life.\n\nMy wife teases me sometimes. She calls me Sobchak, as in Walter Sobchak, John Goodman's character in the film \"The Big Lebowski,\" the veteran who equates everything with Vietnam. My wars were Iraq and Afghanistan, and life during the coronavirus pandemic does keep reminding me of them. The way each day bleeds into the next. The threat that stalks outside. The surrealness of it all. Before heading to the grocery store, as we inspect our masks and lay out sets of rubber gloves, I tell my wife that our meticulous preparation feels like precombat checks before a patrol. When we're in the grocery store and she reminds me to keep six feet apart, I tell her she sounds like my old platoon sergeant reminding Marines to check their \"fives and twenty-fives,\" the meter distances from the road where insurgents typically plant I.E.D.s.\n\nI don't think I'm finding similarities where none exist. On deployment, you see the same people every day and crave a fresh face. After a few weeks of quarantine, my wife and I set up a Zoom call with some friends. Among our tiled faces on the screen there's lots of laughter, but an hour after the call, we feel newly isolated and depressed. I'm reminded why I swore off Skype during the wars.\n\nThen one of our children comes down with a sore throat and fever. It winds up not being the virus, but God, those few days are tense. At night, we talk about the stress. \"This whole situation seems easier on you,\" she says. I don't know if this is true but consider it. Everyone metabolizes stress differently. I tell her, \"I just feel like I've done this before.\"\n\nThere is now lots of talk of America reopening. If self-isolation has been like a miniature deployment, is what comes next redeployment? Shortly after returning from Iraq, the Marine Corps had me complete a form used to detect post-traumatic stress. It was a long list of symptoms. I ticked \"No\" on every box. My friends and I -- a group of infantry lieutenants in our early 20s -- didn't feel depressed or traumatized. We felt alive. The months after our return were a celebration. We traveled to Fleet Week in New York City. We rented a beach house. When one of us got engaged, we ran with the bulls in Pamplona for the bachelor party.\n\nWe had come so close to death that we wanted to fling open the doors of life and crowd everyone and everything inside. But that joy soon yielded to its opposite: grief. The nights of partying began to end tearfully, with questions that began: Why? There weren't answers, only the names of the guys who weren't there, no matter how hard we tried to party them back to life. By that fall one of us, a lieutenant who'd had a promising career, was arrested for D.U.I. He'd flipped his car after a night of heavy drinking. By the following summer, our friend who we'd celebrated in Pamplona had filed for divorce. Celebrating was a way to take our lives out of the darkness and hold them to the light. But in the light we saw how life had become unalterably different. When America emerges from quarantine -- even if that process is gradual -- people will want to celebrate. Every filled bar, movie theater, or stadium will be a reclamation of life.\n\nExcept life won't be what it was before. Almost everyone will have experienced some kind of loss. A job. A loved one. As America reopens and we assert that life goes on we will also be acknowledging the ways life has forever changed. At that point public celebrations will yield to private grief.\n\nThe mental health crisis that has been predicted focuses on the medical professionals bearing the brunt of this pandemic and the post-traumatic stress they will surely experience. The rest of us will likely experience it, too. But there is a silver lining, one not widely discussed. The traumas that create post-traumatic stress also create conditions for post-traumatic growth -- broadly defined as a \"positive change experienced as a result of the struggle with a major life crisis or a traumatic event.\"\n\nAlthough post-traumatic growth has long been a theme in religious and spiritual teachings, it is only in the past 25 years that mainstream psychology has acknowledged that those who survive trauma might benefit from a stronger personal makeup and greater capacities for compassion. Clinicians have identified general areas where they see post-traumatic growth, including a change in relationships with others and increased connection with those who suffer; an enhanced sense of one's own strength; and a greater appreciation for life. The wars taught me that we appreciate life through a lens. To enjoy all that is best -- love, friendship, adventure -- we have to widen the aperture; but when you widen your aperture it won't only expose the good, it also makes you vulnerable to the bad. When loss comes, how will we react? Will we leave our lens open? Or will we constrict it?\n\nThe people I went to war with were the greatest friends I ever had. When some were killed, the pain felt irreversible. Aaron, Doug, Dan, Garrett and the others -- they would never come back and friendship with anyone else would never be like it was with them. This wasn't entirely true, of course. But it felt true then. It took years to understand that what those friends had given me wasn't only friendship but also the capacity for friendship, a capacity that informs relationships I hold dearest today. In expressing the relationships I have now, my old friends return to me.\n\nOur modern understanding of post-traumatic stress is rooted in the incidents of \"shell shock\" from the First World War, a conflict with few redeeming attributes. Of its psychological cost, the author and soldier Wilfred Owen wrote in his poem \"Mental Cases\": \"Treading blood from lungs that had loved laughter / Always they must see these things and hear them.\" However, amid the carnage, cases of post-traumatic growth still existed. These challenged the \"always\" of Owen's poem. A different take comes from Ernst J\u00fcnger, an infantry officer who fought all four years on the Western Front and was wounded seven times. He wrote of his experiences, \"Hardened as scarcely another generation ever was in fire and flame, we could go into life as though from the anvil; into friendship, love, politics, professions, into all that destiny had in store.\"\n\nTrauma can consume a society or elevate it. With our economy on the ropes and our politics toxic, it is easy to feel despair, anger, cynicism. On a recent night, as I sat watching the news, an anchor thanked a hollow-eyed E.R. nurse for her service. The nurse answered, \"You're welcome,\" with a self-aware awkwardness that felt acutely familiar, having myself stumbled through similar exchanges with strangers. I switched the channel to find another anchor telling a doctor, \"I can't possibly imagine what you've been through.\" I felt like shouting at the screen, \"Why don't you try!\"\n\nWhen my wife caught me grumbling at the television, she called me Sobchak again. She sat next to me on the sofa and suggested we turn off the news. \"Let's watch something funny,\" she said. I suggested \"The Big Lebowski.\" With the film flickering on the darkened screen in our living room, I turned to her and asked if she really thought I was like Sobchak. \"Only at your worst,\" she said. \"At your best, you're like The Dude, happy-go-lucky.\" She fell asleep next to me on the sofa. I watched the movie until its end. The Dude's final line was one I craved to hear: \"The Dude abides.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "I have been practicing emergency medicine for 30 years. In 1994 I invented an imaging system for teaching intubation, the procedure of inserting breathing tubes. This led me to perform research into this procedure, and subsequently teach airway procedure courses to physicians worldwide for the last two decades.\n\nSo at the end of March, as a crush of Covid-19 patients began overwhelming hospitals in New York City, I volunteered to spend 10 days at Bellevue, helping at the hospital where I trained. Over those days, I realized that we are not detecting the deadly pneumonia the virus causes early enough and that we could be doing more to keep patients off ventilators -- and alive.\n\nOn the long drive to New York from my home in New Hampshire, I called my friend Nick Caputo, an emergency physician in the Bronx, who was already in the thick of it. I wanted to know what I was facing, how to stay safe and about his insights into airway management with this disease. \"Rich,\" he said, \"it's like nothing I've ever seen before.\"\n\nHe was right. Pneumonia caused by the coronavirus has had a stunning impact on the city's hospital system. Normally an E.R. has a mix of patients with conditions ranging from the serious, such as heart attacks, strokes and traumatic injuries, to the nonlife-threatening, such as minor lacerations, intoxication, orthopedic injuries and migraine headaches.\n\nDuring my recent time at Bellevue, though, almost all the E.R. patients had Covid pneumonia. Within the first hour of my first shift I inserted breathing tubes into two patients.\n\nEven patients without respiratory complaints had Covid pneumonia. The patient stabbed in the shoulder, whom we X-rayed because we worried he had a collapsed lung, actually had Covid pneumonia. In patients on whom we did CT scans because they were injured in falls, we coincidentally found Covid pneumonia. Elderly patients who had passed out for unknown reasons and a number of diabetic patients were found to have it.\n\nAnd here is what really surprised us: These patients did not report any sensation of breathing problems, even though their chest X-rays showed diffuse pneumonia and their oxygen was below normal. How could this be?\n\nWe are just beginning to recognize that Covid pneumonia initially causes a form of oxygen deprivation we call \"silent hypoxia\" -- \"silent\" because of its insidious, hard-to-detect nature.\n\nPneumonia is an infection of the lungs in which the air sacs fill with fluid or pus. Normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with breathing and other breathing problems. But when Covid pneumonia first strikes, patients don't feel short of breath, even as their oxygen levels fall. And by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest X-rays). Normal oxygen saturation for most persons at sea level is 94 percent to 100 percent; Covid pneumonia patients I saw had oxygen saturations as low as 50 percent.\n\nTo my amazement, most patients I saw said they had been sick for a week or so with fever, cough, upset stomach and fatigue, but they only became short of breath the day they came to the hospital. Their pneumonia had clearly been going on for days, but by the time they felt they had to go to the hospital, they were often already in critical condition.\n\nIn emergency departments we insert breathing tubes in critically ill patients for a variety of reasons. In my 30 years of practice, however, most patients requiring emergency intubation are in shock, have altered mental status or are grunting to breathe. Patients requiring intubation because of acute hypoxia are often unconscious or using every muscle they can to take a breath. They are in extreme duress. Covid pneumonia cases are very different.\n\nA vast majority of Covid pneumonia patients I met had remarkably low oxygen saturations at triage -- seemingly incompatible with life -- but they were using their cellphones as we put them on monitors. Although breathing fast, they had relatively minimal apparent distress, despite dangerously low oxygen levels and terrible pneumonia on chest X-rays.\n\nWe are only just beginning to understand why this is so. The coronavirus attacks lung cells that make surfactant. This substance helps keep the air sacs in the lungs stay open between breaths and is critical to normal lung function. As the inflammation from Covid pneumonia starts, it causes the air sacs to collapse, and oxygen levels fall. Yet the lungs initially remain \"compliant,\" not yet stiff or heavy with fluid. This means patients can still expel carbon dioxide -- and without a buildup of carbon dioxide, patients do not feel short of breath.\n\nPatients compensate for the low oxygen in their blood by breathing faster and deeper -- and this happens without their realizing it. This silent hypoxia, and the patient's physiological response to it, causes even more inflammation and more air sacs to collapse, and the pneumonia worsens until their oxygen levels plummet. In effect, the patient is injuring their own lungs by breathing harder and harder. Twenty percent of Covid pneumonia patients then go on to a second and deadlier phase of lung injury. Fluid builds up and the lungs become stiff, carbon dioxide rises, and patients develop acute respiratory failure.\n\nBy the time patients have noticeable trouble breathing and present to the hospital with dangerously low oxygen levels, many will ultimately require a ventilator.\n\nSilent hypoxia progressing rapidly to respiratory failure explains cases of Covid-19 patients dying suddenly after not feeling short of breath. (It appears that most Covid-19 patients experience relatively mild symptoms and get over the illness in a week or two without treatment.)\n\nA major reason this pandemic is straining our health system is the alarming severity of lung injury patients have when they arrive in emergency rooms. Covid-19 overwhelmingly kills through the lungs. And because so many patients are not going to the hospital until their pneumonia is already well advanced, many wind up on ventilators, causing shortages of the machines. And once on ventilators, many die.\n\nAvoiding the use of a ventilator is a huge win for both patient and the health care system. The resources needed for patients on ventilators are staggering. Vented patients require multiple sedatives so that they don't buck the vent or accidentally remove their breathing tubes; they need intravenous and arterial lines, IV medicines and IV pumps. In addition to a tube in the trachea, they have tubes in their stomach and bladder. Teams of people are required to move each patient, turning them on their stomach and then their back, twice a day to improve lung function.\n\nThere is a way we could identify more patients who have Covid pneumonia sooner and treat them more effectively -- and it would not require waiting for a coronavirus test at a hospital or doctor's office. It requires detecting silent hypoxia early through a common medical device that can be purchased without a prescription at most pharmacies: a pulse oximeter.\n\nPulse oximetry is no more complicated than using a thermometer. These small devices turn on with one button and are placed on a fingertip. In a few seconds, two numbers are displayed: oxygen saturation and pulse rate. Pulse oximeters are extremely reliable in detecting oxygenation problems and elevated heart rates.\n\nPulse oximeters helped save the lives of two emergency physicians I know, alerting them early on to the need for treatment. When they noticed their oxygen levels declining, both went to the hospital and recovered (though one waited longer and required more treatment). Detection of hypoxia, early treatment and close monitoring apparently also worked for Boris Johnson, the British prime minister.\n\nWidespread pulse oximetry screening for Covid pneumonia -- whether people check themselves on home devices or go to clinics or doctors' offices -- could provide an early warning system for the kinds of breathing problems associated with Covid pneumonia.\n\nPeople using the devices at home would want to consult with their doctors to reduce the number of people who come to the E.R. unnecessarily because they misinterpret their device. There also may be some patients who have unrecognized chronic lung problems and have borderline or slightly low oxygen saturations unrelated to Covid-19.\n\nAll patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus should have pulse oximetry monitoring for two weeks, the period during which Covid pneumonia typically develops. All persons with cough, fatigue and fevers should also have pulse oximeter monitoring even if they have not had virus testing, or even if their swab test was negative, because those tests are only about 70 percent accurate. A vast majority of Americans who have been exposed to the virus don't know it.\n\nThere are other things we can do as well to avoid immediately resorting to intubation and a ventilator. Patient positioning maneuvers (having patients lie on their stomach and sides) opens up the lower and posterior lungs most affected in Covid pneumonia. Oxygenation and positioning helped patients breathe easier and seemed to prevent progression of the disease in many cases. In a preliminary study by Dr. Caputo, this strategy helped keep three out of four patients with advanced Covid pneumonia from needing a ventilator in the first 24 hours.\n\nTo date, Covid-19 has killed more than 40,600 people nationwide -- more than 10,000 in New York State alone. Oximeters are not 100 percent accurate, and they are not a panacea. There will be deaths and bad outcomes that are not preventable. We don't fully understand why certain patients get so sick, or why some go on to develop multi-organ failure. Many elderly people, already weak with chronic illness, and those with underlying lung disease do very poorly with Covid pneumonia, despite aggressive treatment.\n\nBut we can do better. Right now, many emergency rooms are either being crushed by this one disease or waiting for it to hit. We must direct resources to identifying and treating the initial phase of Covid pneumonia earlier by screening for silent hypoxia.\n\nIt's time to get ahead of this virus instead of chasing it.\n\nDr. Richard Levitan, an emergency physician in Littleton, N.H., is president of Airway Cam Technologies, a company that teaches courses in intubation and airway management.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nOn Tuesday, as the number of reported deaths from Covid-19 in the United States topped 70,000, the Trump administration declared \"mission accomplished\" for Phase 1 of its fight against the coronavirus.\n\nSpecifically, President Trump and Vice President Mike Pence announced that the coronavirus task force, which Mr. Pence oversees, had been so successful in getting the pandemic under control that the group would most likely disband within the month, to be replaced by a new panel focused on getting America back to work.\n\n\"We will have something in a different form,\" Mr. Trump explained during his tour of a mask manufacturing plant in Phoenix, at which he did not wear a mask despite signs requesting that one be worn \"at all times.\" He said that America had moved on to \"the next stage of the battle\" and that \"now we are reopening our country.\"\n\n\"It really is all a reflection of the tremendous progress we've made as a country,\" Mr. Pence told reporters at the White House.\n\nBy Wednesday morning, Mr. Trump had changed the contours, though not the essence, of his plan. In a tweet thread, he said the coronavirus task force would, in fact, \"continue on indefinitely\" but shift its efforts -- and most likely some of its members -- to \"focus on SAFETY & OPENING UP OUR COUNTRY AGAIN.\" He closed with, \"The Task Force will also be very focused on Vaccines & Therapeutics. Thank you!\"\n\nWhether dissolved or repurposed, the White House Task Force focused on coordinating the administration's public-health response to the pandemic is soon to be no more. To which we can only say: No big loss.\n\nIn theory, bringing together a collection of experts to oversee a coordinated federal response to a national emergency makes perfect sense. In practice, the first phase of Mr. Trump's coronavirus task force was its own form of disaster.\n\nFor starters, the president made clear early on that he wasn't interested in marshaling a coordinated response. Time and again, he ducked responsibility, pushing it off on the governors. On challenges ranging from acquiring critical medical supplies to coordinating and expanding testing (which remains a problem) to managing social-distancing restrictions, the task force has provided consistently uneven guidance and insufficient assistance.\n\nMr. Trump often has undermined the recommendations it has made. Whether pushing dangerous treatments of unproven efficacy or urging his supporters to protest the basic social distancing guidelines put forward by the task force, the president has repeatedly scrambled the public-health message.\n\nComplicating matters, multiple factions within the task force emerged with their own plans and priorities. These include a group of health officials overseen by the head of the White House Domestic Policy Council; a smaller group of medical doctors focused strictly on health matters; and yet another shadow task force led by Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law.\n\nIt's little wonder the task force's communication often has obscured more than it has clarified.\n\nThe public manifestation of the task force has been a series of rambling briefings, at which assembled experts from in and outside government have wound up as little more than political props. The briefings often have descended into a blend of therapy sessions and campaign rallies, with the president spending hours each week airing his many grievances, praising himself, parading out business executives and public officials to laud his leadership and spreading misinformation about the virus and the administration's handling of it.\n\nWhere is the website developed by Google that the president, back in March, promised would soon enable people nationwide to check their symptoms and \"facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location\"? The sprawling, easily accessible network of drive-through testing sites in the parking lots of retailers that Mr. Trump also promised in March is still struggling to ramp up. All too often, the president has overpromised and underdelivered -- if he delivered at all. On April 28, Mr. Trump boasted that the United States would \"very soon\" be able to conduct five million diagnostic tests a day. The next day, he had to walk back that claim -- insisting, of course, that he had never made it.\n\nThe briefings obviously have been a poor use of time for task force members, who help prepare the president's talking points and then must stand around for hours during his performances. In addition to fielding questions from the media, they also need to respond to (and diplomatically shoot down) Mr. Trump's more dangerous nonsense, such as when he mused about possibly injecting Covid-19 patients with disinfectant. That surreal suggestion led the makers of Clorox and Lysol to plead with Americans not to drink or inject their products.\n\nSo reconfiguring the task force is unlikely to have many concrete negative effects. It seems mostly to be a P.R. move, a way for Mr. Trump to push his message -- untethered from the consensus view of public health officials or public opinion -- that the worst of the pandemic has passed.\n\nIn its coming incarnation, the task force is expected to have a partially new cast of characters, with less emphasis on scientists and more on economic advisers. On Tuesday, Mr. Pence noted that administration officials already have been discussing how to transition the response down to the agency level. If this means that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies will be empowered to take greater control, and suffer less meddling from Mr. Trump, all the better.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "The Yanomami people are no strangers to fatal epidemics, and yet on April 9, many around the world were shocked to learn that Covid-19 had taken its first victim among this relatively isolated Indigenous people of the Amazon rainforest along the Brazil-Venezuela border.\n\nAlvaney Xirixana was a 15-year-old boy from the Helepe community of the Rio Uraricoera river basin in the Brazilian state of Roraima, a region afflicted by a huge invasion of illegal gold miners. Malnourished and anemic from successive bouts of malaria, the teenager began showing characteristic respiratory symptoms in mid-March.\n\nFor 21 days he was admitted four times to a local health care facility, three times receiving treatment for other diseases and the fourth time being discharged. He was finally given a coronavirus test on April 3, when he was hospitalized yet again, this time in critical condition. He died three days later. A victim of the absurd negligence of local health services, he probably infected numerous other members of his community as well as health care workers during those three wasted weeks before he was tested. This appalling episode has raised the specter of a major new health disaster among the Yanomami people. And it is a warning for other Indigenous people of the Amazon.\n\nToday, we are all frightened about Covid-19. What we're feeling is perhaps not unlike what the Yanomami have historically experienced when faced with the mysterious and lethal epidemics that our world has inflicted on them.\n\nSince their initial contacts with outsiders beginning in the 1940s, the Yanomami have lived through wave after wave of deadly viral epidemics, notably the measles and flu.\n\nThe expansion of the internal colonization frontier intensified in the 1970s when Brazil's military dictatorship opened the Perimetral Norte highway in Yanomami territory. Since the late 1980s, Yanomami lands have suffered from regular invasions by illegal gold miners, who have unleashed epidemics of malaria, flu, tuberculosis and sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nOver 20,000 garimperos, or illegal miners, are currently devastating Yanomami lands. These invaders, who are nearly as numerous as the Yanomami themselves (current population 26,780), are most likely responsible for introducing the coronavirus to the region. Even amid the pandemic, illegal mining operations have continued to expand. More generally, rainforest destruction throughout the Brazilian Amazon has accelerated, with deforestation alerts for the first three months of 2020 increasing 51 percent over the same period last year.\n\nIn this context of increasing lawlessness and invasion, Indigenous people throughout Brazil face an intensified risk of infection. So far, over 80 Indigenous people in Brazil have been found to have Covid-19, and seven have died -- Mr. Xirixana, three other members of different ethnic groups in the Amazon interior, as well as three residents of the city of Manaus, including an Indigenous health care worker. Yet given the precarious state of Indigenous health care, there are most likely many more cases.\n\nThe disease appears to be spreading quickly in poor Indigenous ghettos on the outskirts of large Amazonian cities like Manaus and Bel\u00e9m, which were already overburdened by an influx of Venezuelan Indigenous refugees. The impact of the coronavirus pandemic on such urban Indigenous people has been overlooked in the general flood of data.\n\nThe roughly 900,000 Indigenous people are among the most vulnerable to this epidemic in Brazil. Abandoned by weak, underfunded national institutions, some Indigenous communities have taken it upon themselves to close off their villages or isolate themselves in town as best they can, suspending social and political activities and distributing prevention materials in their native languages.\n\nThe Yanomami, one of the largest and most well-known Indigenous communities of the Amazon, continue to suffer from inadequate health care and a persistent climate of indifference, negligence and lawlessness concerning the invasion of their lands by miners.\n\nThe press, the global scientific community and Indigenous peoples themselves must continue to expose such negligence and denounce violations of constitutionally guaranteed rights. And yet given the chaotic response of President Jair Bolsonaro's administration to the pandemic throughout Brazil, on top of its open hostility to science, Indigenous peoples and the environment, there seems little hope of significant policy change in the short term.\n\nBut something fundamental has changed: We are all united by a tragedy that is unfolding around the world.\n\nWe still know little about this disease. We do know that the origins of the new virus appear related to habitat destruction and the commercialization of wild animals. But we don't yet have immunity, drugs or vaccines to stop it. We are reduced to confining ourselves at home with our families in the hope of evading infection. In some way it reminds me of the stories the Yanomami elders have told me about times when they fled to the forest in small groups to hide from the cannibalistic \"Epidemic Spirit,\" Xawarari.\n\nHowever this time, we have become our own victims by loosing on ourselves the epidemiological consequences of this predatory hubris, just as Indigenous leaders like Yanomami shaman and philosopher Davi Kopenawa have been warning us for decades. In today's hyperconnected industrial world, ecological imbalances or diseases vectors that might once have affected only one corner of the planet now threaten us all.\n\nAnd perhaps now, as we are all now exposed to an invisible new enemy for which we have no defenses, this harrowing experience of our shared fragility may stir global society to rethink its current course.\n\nBruce Albert, an anthropologist, has worked among the Yanomami in Brazil since 1975. He is a co-author with Davi Kopenawa of \"The Falling Sky: Words of a Yanomami Shaman.\" This essay was translated from the French by Glenn H. Shepard Jr.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

        "body": "Dr. McClelland is an obstetrician on the clinical faculty at Lenox Hill Hospital/Northwell Health in Manhattan.\n\n\"Two of us enter the hospital, three of us leave, and you tell us how it's done safely.\"\n\nThis was the birth plan of one of my patients. Not from now, during the Covid-19 epidemic, but in the good old days of 2018. I have quoted this to my patients frequently since then, but no more so than in the past month.\n\nAnxiety about having a baby in New York City, and about whether it would be better to leave the city, spiked when several city hospitals barred partners from attending deliveries. With news of asymptomatic women in labor testing positive in the hospital and a Covid-19 patient meeting her baby via video chat from the neonatal intensive-care unit, the feeling grew that having a baby in a New York City hospital was not just less safe than it used to be, but patently unsafe.\n\nSo let me add my perspective as an obstetrician delivering in a hospital that like every other in the city is filled with Covid-19 patients. I'm not a public health official or a hospital administrator. I can't comment on the nuances of what's happening all across the city. I am one doctor, in one practice, with a knowledge of my patients, my partners and the universe that is my hospital.\n\nAnd I will say this: If you planned on delivering in a New York City hospital, don't change your plans.\n\nFor every terrifyingly ill pregnant woman featured in a news story, there are beautiful, normal, uncomplicated deliveries taking place, even among infected women. And present at these good and normal moments, there are doctors and midwives, nurses and other staff members, coming to the hospital, staying up through the night, comforting their patients and smiling through it all -- even if you can't tell because of the N95 masks we have on.\n\nI have had many patients decamp to sites outside the city, after calculating that it was safer elsewhere. First of all, such last-minute changes of plans, whether moving outside New York or switching to a home birth, are privileges of a certain class of New Yorker. Many pregnant women are limited, whether by income, insurance status or other circumstances, to stay, often at a specific hospital. So all New York City women need to know what is stable and safe and intrinsically reliable about having a baby here during the pandemic.\n\nThere is much more to labor and delivery than the specter of the coronavirus. Giving birth is inherently risky. Hemorrhage, infection, pulmonary embolism, pre-eclampsia, even death are risks pregnant women face and the things for which doctors and midwives are always on the watch. And these risks remain much more likely for pregnant women in New York than the risk of falling seriously ill with Covid-19 while delivering a baby.\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the best data we have on Covid-19 in pregnancy for New York City, from Columbia University Medical Center, which show that 1.9 percent of women have symptomatic coronavirus in labor, only a subset of whom have severe disease. And the most recent city Department of Health data show that 2.6 percent of women will suffer life-threatening complications during labor unrelated to Covid-19. With this in mind, having a doctor you trust in a hospital that is equipped for the most common emergencies is key. If you move, will your care be the same as before? Does your hospital have the capacity for emergency C-sections? Is there a blood bank on site, in case you need a transfusion? If your baby suffered a complication, is there a neonatal I.C.U., or would your baby be transferred?\n\nThere could also be a paradoxical benefit of being in a hot spot. Hardship breeds expertise, and New York hospitals have become experts not only in treating Covid-19 but also in how to handle the disease during pregnancy.\n\nMy hospital was early to mandate masks for all staff members, limit visitors while having partners present during deliveries and adopt universal testing for patients. This has let us operate as close to normal as possible.\n\nMore important, New York City hospitals may have braved the recent peak of this disease, weathering the acid test of its ability to keep essential services for labor and delivery running essentially unchanged in the midst of a storm. (Much as we kept things going during a literal storm in our past: Hurricane Sandy in 2012.) This means that we will have a better sense of what to do if this peaks again. It's unclear when the peaks will happen elsewhere across the country, or how bad they will be. Will smaller areas with fewer hospitals see greater stress on their hospital systems than New York City did?\n\nRecent articles cite the high number of pregnant women who have tested positive for the coronavirus -- especially the high proportion of asymptomatic women -- and this too is making women afraid. That fear is based on the fallacy of thinking that testing changes the reality of what's being tested. It only reveals what has been there all along. Universal testing in labor and delivery units will make everyone safer, even if it makes us feel less safe by peeling back the curtain. Knowing who is infected allows staffs to isolate women during labor to minimize risk to other patients and to staff members, to monitor those patients more carefully for symptom onset or disease progression for their own health and to apply different protocols to babies born to mothers with Covid-19 to limit their risk.\n\nSo it makes no sense to clamor for universal testing in the community and then recoil from the results when testing is successfully applied in a specific environment. Nor is it right to assume that hospitals outside the city would have fewer infected women in their midst. Until enough testing rolls out universally, nobody knows.\n\nAmong other trends, concern about asymptomatic spread at hospitals has led to a surge in women seeking home births, even though home birth is not for everyone. It's a viable option for low-risk women, when clear criteria for home birth candidacy are followed. But even in the best of circumstances, it comes with certain risks, like the potential need for emergency transfer to a hospital. The complications that come in such an eventuality may be increased right now, because of factors like slower ambulance response times as a result of Covid-19 delaying a needed transfer.\n\nMore important, thinking of home birth as a way to mitigate coronavirus exposure risk is problematic. Letting someone into the home who doesn't adhere to rigorous practices may place a woman at higher risk than being in a hospital. A midwife prominently featured in a recent New York Times article about home births said that wearing a mask \"is not part of my belief system.\" I shuddered when I read that.\n\nSo if we're going to talk about belief systems, this is what I believe: The process of delivering a child is wonderful but inherently risky. Doctors and midwives who shepherd that process take our responsibility very seriously. That includes an understanding of all the factors involved in safely increasing the members of a family by, the coronavirus being only one of these factors. Women benefit from having doctors and midwives who know them well and have an established relationship with them, in delivery settings that are trusted and tested.\n\nPatients have to make the choice of what is right for them. But a change of plans mid-pregnancy may not be in a woman's or her baby's best interest. While this is a world-shaking time, we will take the same care of you as we always have.\n\nSo if you choose to stay here with us, we will be here for you.\n\nSpencer W.

        "body": "The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo of New York offered a blunt and troubling summary of America's coronavirus predicament on Friday. To revive the economy, he said, \"You have to develop a testing capacity that does not now exist.\"\n\nThere are promising signs that the spread of the virus is slowing, at least across large chunks of the United States. But that fragile victory has been won only by placing much of the nation in suspended animation, at great expense.\n\nWidespread testing is critical to allow a sustainable resumption of economic activity.\n\nIt isn't a panacea. Precautions like wearing masks and avoiding large gatherings will help limit the spread of the virus. Even with testing, states need to build systems for tracing the contacts of those who fall ill; people required to stay home need economic support. And a vaccine that is not yet known to exist still offers the best hope for a return to something approximating normal life.\n\nBut testing permits the substitution of targeted quarantines for general shutdowns, because it lets public health authorities identify people who fall sick, and in turn those who have been exposed to the virus. It lets people start returning safely to work, to school, to stores.\n\nAnd, notwithstanding the Trump administration's boosterish assurances, the United States still lacks the means to perform enough tests.\n\nOver the past week, about 151,000 Americans per day were tested for the coronavirus, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Perhaps even more concerning is that the average volume of daily tests has been at roughly the same level for two weeks.\n\nHow much more is needed? To sustain a resumption of activity, estimates range from 500,000 tests per day to five million per day, and beyond. The uncertainties are considerable; what is clear is that the current level is not enough.\n\nTo ramp up testing, the United States needs to centralize procurement of the necessary supplies, maximize the use of existing laboratory capacity and encourage innovation.\n\nDoing so will require leadership, and money.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Rockefeller Foundation published a useful road map for the United States to reach three million tests per week by late June. The foundation's expert panel estimates that would be sufficient to test people with coronavirus symptoms, people identified as coming into contact with those who have the virus and people at high risk if they get the virus. That, in turn, would allow for a limited return to normal activity across much of the country.\n\nThe core of the foundation's plan is the conscription of laboratory facilities that currently perform other kinds of tests, including university labs and small private labs. The foundation estimates that two-thirds of the nation's molecular testing capacity is used for other purposes and could be easily redirected.\n\nThe report calls for states to oversee this comprehensive mobilization, but the money would come from the federal government, in the form of a fixed $100 fee for each completed test. It estimates the total cost around $100 billion -- a huge bargain compared to the economic toll of continuing or recurring economic shutdowns.\n\nRockefeller also is proposing to create a nonprofit to place bulk orders for needed supplies, backed by a foundation guarantee of payment.\n\nLabs across the country report that they could conduct more tests but for shortages of critical supplies -- swabs to gather nasal samples, containers to transport samples, chemicals to test samples. Moreover, a lack of coordination has forced labs to compete for available supplies, creating huge inefficiencies: Some places have plenty of swabs but not enough containers, or containers but not chemicals. Dr. Nirav Shah, the director of Maine's Center of Disease Control and Prevention, said he would not disclose what kind of testing equipment the state was buying for fear others would hoard necessary supplies.\n\nVice President Mike Pence called on governors last week to \"simply activate\" machines sidelined by shortages. This has the quality of putting a man in shackles and then urging him to run. There is a crying need for coordination.\n\nFinally, the Rockefeller report calls on states to hire at least 100,000 people to perform the work of testing and contact tracing. This, too, most likely requires federal funding -- and has the virtue of doubling as a jobs program during this period of extremely high unemployment.\n\nAll of this, however, falls well short of what is needed. To maintain a more normal level of economic activity, the Rockefeller report says, the United States needs to aim for the capacity to perform 30 million tests every week by the fall.\n\nGetting there will require innovation. The United States has a strong ecosystem of for-profit companies, university labs and foundations. The government has a critical role to play in validating and disseminating the best ideas.\n\nThere are some green shoots. The Food and Drug Administration, leaning on new research performed by UnitedHealth Group and backed by the Gates Foundation, approved changes last week intended to simplify collection and transportation of nasal samples.\n\nBut more remains to be done. The government's decision last month to let labs develop new tests for the coronavirus is producing a wave of new approaches. Last week, for example, scientists at the University of Minnesota unveiled a test that does not require the chemicals used in the most common current tests, a potentially important breakthrough. But the Trump administration's insistence that states fend for themselves means the government is not trying to identify the best approaches, or to encourage production on a national scale.\n\nA tenfold increase in testing also requires a huge increase in the production of necessary supplies. The White House has demonstrated a clear reluctance to issue orders to companies, preferring to beg for cooperation. On Sunday, after weeks of delay, President Trump finally said he would require Puritan Medical Products, a Maine company, to ramp up production of swabs. More is needed. There is no time for deference in the midst of an emergency. Better to issue the necessary orders and then congratulate companies on compliance.\n\nMr. Trump and his lieutenants have instead preferred to pretend the challenges do not exist. Brett Giroir, the administration's testing coordinator, said Friday that the nation needed no more than 4.5 million tests per month to begin reopening the economy -- meaning that the present level of testing is enough, if it can be sustained.\n\nThis is a claim that state officials and scientific experts regard with incredulity.\n\nVirginia's governor, Ralph Northam, a Democrat, on Sunday described as \"just delusional\" the administration's claims that the nation's existing testing capacity is sufficient. In Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, called the claim \"absolutely false.\"\n\nOne marker of the inadequacy of the current level of testing is that the share of positive tests has held steady, at about one in five, even as the total number of tests has expanded. In South Korea, which has used widespread testing to keep the coronavirus under control, establishing a model for other countries, the positive test rate is about 2 percent.\n\nMr. Trump has proclaimed his absolute authority while nearly in the same breath disclaiming responsibility. \"The states have to step up their TESTING!\" he tweeted Friday.\n\nWhat the nation needs is the opposite -- a leader who accepts the responsibility to do the utmost, within the limits of his constitutional authority, to increase testing.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.\n\nMore than 20,000 people have died from the coronavirus in each of these European countries: France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom. More than 17,000 have died in New York City.\n\nBut in Germany -- which is home to more people than any one of those other European countries and 10 times as many as New York -- only about 6,000 have died.\n\nHow could that be? There are multiple reasons, but the biggest is probably the country's approach to testing.\n\nAs Katrin Bennhold of The Times has written:\n\nBy the time Germany recorded its first case of Covid-19 in February, laboratories across the country had built up a stock of test kits ... Early and widespread testing has allowed the authorities to slow the spread of the pandemic by isolating known cases while they are infectious. It has also enabled lifesaving treatment to be administered in a more timely way.\n\nTesting is the key to every effective strategy for fighting the virus. It allows the sick to be treated effectively. It enables government officials and hospitals to focus their resources on the areas that need it most. And it makes sure that people who have the virus without symptoms -- and can unknowingly spread it to others -- can be isolated.\n\nThe troubled response to the virus in the United States began with testing failures, and there are still not nearly enough tests being conducted. As Michael Osterholm and Mark Olshaker write in a new Op-Ed: \"Far too few tests are available in the United States. Some are shoddy. Even the ones that are precise aren't designed to produce the kind of definitive yes-no results that people expect.\"\n\nThe testing problem will need to be solved before states can return to normal -- as some are now taking early steps toward -- without sparking new outbreaks.\n\nFor more ...\n\nScott Gottlieb, of the American Enterprise Institute: \"If we can develop a point of care, swabable stick that gives a readable result in the doctor's office it can dramatically increase screening.\"\n\nShan Soe-Lin and Robert Hecht, Yale University: \"What's needed is widespread testing of people with no known symptoms ... We need to aggressively search for asymptomatic carriers, particularly among people who have frequent contact with the public and among vulnerable populations. This includes those who are infectious but will never develop symptoms and those who will develop them days after the test.\"\n\nAnd more from Osterholm, an infectious disease expert, and Olshaker, a writer: \"Governments throughout the world and the research, medical-supply and clinical-lab industries must unite to vastly increase global production of reagents and sampling equipment. Achieving this will take months and require building new capacity, presumably with public subsidies. The time and costs involved will be considerable, but such an effort is the only way to test large populations for this infection (and for others in the future).\"\n\nIf you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

They don't know whether it's safe for their kids to go.\n\nFor many, it will be. But not for all.\n\nIt's important to understand from the start that's it's impossible to reduce risk to zero. Our goal should be to reduce the risk of infection low enough that the benefits outweigh the harms.\n\nThere are many benefits to camp. Outside of the joy it brings, it's good for kids to socialize, to play and to grow independently of their parents, especially after being cooped up inside for so long. It's also good for parents, who might be freer to work. Perhaps most important, camps give us a chance to kick the tires on interventions that may be necessary for schools in the fall. Because of that, it's critical that as camps move forward, we monitor them and collect data on what works and what doesn't.\n\nCamps that want to be safer should consider the following advice. Parents can consider it to decide how dedicated a camp is to safety.\n\nThe prevalence of disease in the area should be low.\n\nA recent bipartisan plan put forward by the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard argued that the country could be divided into red, yellow and green zones by how much disease existed locally. If almost no disease exists (one case per 36,000 people), a zone is green. If less than 1 percent of the population is infected, it's yellow; and if more than 1 percent is infected, it's red.\n\nVery few places in America are green right now. That's too bad, because a camp in a green area could likely operate almost close to normally, just watching out for kids who get sick. Camps should not operate in red areas. But only 30 million people are thought to live in red zones, and most of them are in a few well-known hot spots.\n\nThe rest of the country is yellow. With proper planning and preparation, camps could consider opening in those areas.\n\nDecisions must be made locally.\n\nIf outbreaks start to occur (taking the area from yellow to red), it's likely that everyone, including camps, will need to shut down and go back into stricter social distancing. Still, it's possible that some places will have so little disease that life inside a camp will look pretty normal. Others will need to distance and constantly be on guard.\n\nSome kids will have health conditions that will give their parents pause. Others will live with adults who do, and the same concerns will apply.\n\nTesting should be ubiquitous.\n\nExperts will disagree on exact numbers, but the Safra Center plan argues that to help move from yellow to green, an area needs to be able to conduct 2,500 tests per death from Covid-19 every day. This is absolutely doable with investment. Areas also need to have available infrastructure to trace and quarantine those who've come into contact with the disease -- driving down the number of infected further.\n\nLocal areas will have to decide whether testing has been adequate to ensure that the prevalence of infections is low enough to merit opening camp. They will also have to recognize that tests aren't perfect. Repeated testing would be best. If they wanted to be extra careful, camps should test staff regularly.\n\nIt's possible that antigen testing, which will hopefully be available soon, will be cheaper and faster. Camps should make use of it.\n\nScreen everyone, every day.\n\nKids and staff should be screened regularly for disease, likely at drop-off outside. This would involve asking families about symptoms, exposures and perhaps even checking temperatures. If anyone reports anything positive, or if they have a fever, they should stay home. If anyone believes that someone they are living with is ill or has been exposed, they should stay home. Kids and parents should be asked regularly, even daily, about all of this.\n\nBut screening is imperfect. We know that between 15 percent and 45 percent of people are asymptomatic even when infected, making screening necessary but not sufficient. It will reduce risk, but not eliminate it.\n\nStay outdoors all the time.\n\nOutdoor activities appear to be much less likely to result in virus transmission than indoor activities. This means that camps should spend as much time as possible, if not all time, outdoors. Activities that used to be done indoors -- like arts and crafts -- should be moved outside. If it rains, camps might want to think about canceling unless they feel comfortable about their ability to socially distance kids inside with masks.\n\nMinimize potentially infectious contacts.\n\nThe groups to which kids are assigned may need to be reduced in size. More staff may be necessary to do so. Kids should stay together all day with their assigned groups and not intermingle with others as much as possible. Games and activities that allow distancing are best. Masks should be encouraged for all, at all times. I know this will get a lot of pushback. It's all about minimizing risk.\n\nAll-camp meetings should be avoided, as should dining halls. As much as possible, meals should be eaten outdoors, and hand washing should become a regular activity, especially before eating. Hand sanitizer should be available pretty much everywhere.\n\nClean and disinfect facilities regularly, with set schedules.\n\nEven more than usual, camps will need to clean. This includes all facilities, including bathrooms and food service buildings. Any buses will need to be disinfected, as will anything that's touched often. Identifying surfaces and areas that require continual care and then setting and following a schedule will make sure that the chance of infection is minimized.\n\nGuidance will be needed on how this is properly done. If the C.D.C. won't issue it, local public health departments must, relying on scientific expertise and successful interventions in other countries.\n\nWhat happens outside of camp is just as important as what happens within it.\n\nIn normal times, how people spend their evenings and weekends really wouldn't matter. Now it does. Counselors and staff will need to be rigorously safe on off-hours so that they don't bring danger in. The same applies to campers' families. Everyone will be in this together, so everyone will need to be able to trust one another's actions outside to feel safe inside.\n\nOvernight camp is different. It's both safer and riskier.\n\nIn some ways, you can imagine how a four- or eight-week overnight camp could be run very safely. Every camper could self-quarantine before arriving. The camp could test upon arrival and encourage social distancing the first week, require everyone to wear masks and have everyone eat apart.\n\nAfter that time, they could test everyone again. If no one was positive, they could be assured that no virus was in the camp; if they strictly kept the camp closed to all visitors for the rest of the session, kids and counselors could do almost anything they wanted without risk of getting the disease.\n\nOr course, they couldn't go outside of camp on trips. And letting new kids arrive later, or having a visiting day, would require everything to restart.\n\nWhat makes overnight camp potentially safer also makes it riskier. Many children travel quite far to get there, and there's no release valve. If some kids develop symptoms or test positive, there's nowhere to send them quickly. Kids who showed up infected would likely need to go right back home. If things didn't settle out quickly into a noninfected routine, much of the summer could be wasted trying to get things in order.\n\nMy children's overnight camp runs in two-week intervals. Kids always seem to be arriving or leaving, and counselors and staff don't always commit to an eight-week stint: The above plan wouldn't work. It looks like their camp is going to be canceled this summer. But other camps might still try.\n\nWe should subsidize camps to make them safer and available.\n\nAll this assumes that parents are able to send their kids to camp and are merely making a choice. Too many families will not be able to afford camp, especially if making it safer increases the cost.\n\nWe could easily wind up in a situation where those who can afford it achieve safety, and those who can't face greater danger. We don't want camp to increase disparities further. We should pledge public funds to camps, as we hopefully will to schools, so that everyone can benefit.\n\nCamps may even help the economy by letting more parents return to work. The investment is likely to be worth it -- especially because camps can serve as a test for schools in the fall. If we don't find out what works now to keep kids safe together in groups, we'll be flying even more blind then.\n\nWe should do as much as we can to make camps succeed. By doing so, we're also making school much more likely to happen. That's even more important than camp.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values. It is separate from the newsroom.\n\nOne evening in mid-March, looking to scratch a creative and social itch, the photographer John Martin texted his neighbors in Grosse Pointe Park, Mich., to come outside for a socially distanced photo shoot. The street, he said, seemed to light up with cheer.\n\nOne family dressed up with sequined tops and pajama bottoms. Another posed for a take on \"American Gothic.\" Mr. Martin posted the series online, titling it \"Porchraits.\" He charged the families a small fee, which he donated to local restaurants to provide meals for health care workers. Within days he heard from other photographers around the country, including from Atlanta and Cincinnati, asking to replicate the idea.\n\nMr. Martin's initiative offers a snapshot of the creative thinking needed amid the pandemic. It taught him, he said, that fostering connection in a time of distance demands ingenuity.\n\nAs the days grow longer and hotter, Americans will begin craving the rites of summer -- afternoons at the pool or boating on lakes and rivers, evenings spent dancing, listening to music and eating outdoors. Those customs can't look the same in a period of social distancing, but that doesn't mean they should be abandoned.\n\nWith the fate of summer camp still up in the air, it's all the more crucial to ensure people have opportunities for recreation. That, however, will require imagination on the part of community leaders and ordinary people. Bonus points if frozen daiquiri delivery is part of the plan.\n\nOpen Up the Beaches\n\nFor millions of Americans, a principal way to stay cool in summer heat is a day at the beach or out on the water, whether that means swimming, fishing or water-skiing. Far too many well-meaning public officials, though, have cut off access to these important pastimes.\n\nNew York City, for example, recently announced that its public pools will stay closed this summer, and while the fate of the beaches remains uncertain, Mayor Bill de Blasio recently said the parks department has no plan to open them.\n\nBut keeping bodies of water off limits bears its own public health risks. The former city parks commissioner Adrian Benepe warned that New York could see an increase in drownings, especially for children. If residents don't have access to safe places where they can cool down, they may take to swimming in unguarded bodies of water like the East River. He noted that the number of drownings in the city was cut by more than 25 percent in the three years after the city opened 11 public pools in 1936.\n\nAnd the more people turn to the most obvious alternative -- opening up fire hydrants -- the higher the risk of lowering water pressure and hampering the capacity of firefighters to do their work.\n\nEpidemiologists said that local officials can explore ways of safely opening beaches and pools by controlling density and enforcing social distancing.\n\nBeaches would be safer if limited to one-third or one-half of their typical density and if visitors wear masks, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, an infectious disease specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital. (Obviously, anyone who has Covid-19 symptoms should stay home.)\n\nOfficials might consider keeping the beaches closed on windier days, Dr. Walensky added, when aerosol droplets can travel more easily. She said pools, too, could be opened to small groups, especially since chlorine kills most germs and viruses, as long as the changing areas and surfaces around them are closely monitored or remain closed altogether.\n\nSure, keeping the crowds down at both pools and beaches would be a challenge -- but it's hardly impossible. The key would be admitting people in shifts and managing those crowds, and a logical solution could be hiring monitors to ensure the social-distancing rules are followed.\n\nIn New York, that could mean redeploying some of the parks department employees who typically work at the now-closed indoor recreation centers and providing protective gear to them as well as to the police officers and lifeguards who'd be on duty any summer.\n\nKeep Gardens and Parks Accessible\n\nHundreds of parks, gardens, dog-runs and playgrounds across the country have been off limits in recent weeks. Dallas, for instance, briefly closed all 397 of its public parks. But Ned Friedman, director of the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard University, said he determined early on that he would keep the arboretum open and ensure the safety of its visitors by crowdsourcing recommendations from infectious disease experts.\n\nDr. Friedman said the arboretum has made a number of operational changes to prevent the spread of the virus. His staff has prohibited people from sitting on benches and has rented emergency highway signs that display messages about social distancing and wearing face covers.\n\nThe goal of these measures, Dr. Friedman said, is to ensure the arboretum can remain a welcoming place for Boston residents during a challenging time. The country's green spaces have a history of serving public health interests: Frederick Law Olmsted, who designed the arboretum as well as Central and Prospect Parks in New York, even served as the head of the U.S. Sanitary Commission.\n\nNumerous studies have shown that being outdoors or near green spaces can reduce stress, fatigue and aggression and improve attention capacity and cognitive development.\n\nDr. Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist, said that as local officials weigh the risks of opening up outdoor spaces they should consider the health benefits of access to nature. \"Vitamin D matters for respiratory virus resistance,\" he said in an interview on Thursday. \"Fresh air is in my experience very good for the spirit. And exercise matters for health in general.\"\n\nThe National Park Service has determined closures on a park-by-park basis; about 60 percent of its sites remain open. David Vela, the park service's deputy director, said his agency was working with the secretary of the interior and public health officials on a plan to gradually increase access this summer. One solution: Some parks have turned two-way trails into one-ways, to limit the possibility of run-ins between hiking groups.\n\nGolf courses are often some of the largest green spaces communities have. More states should follow the lead of Texas and open them up to walkers (and perhaps with the proper precautions, even golfers).\n\nClose Down the Streets\n\nHas there ever been a better time to experiment with street closures? Recent smartphone location data compiled by Streetlight Data showed that traffic has declined 83 percent in San Francisco, 77 percent in Washington, D.C., and 67 percent in New York.\n\nIn Oakland, Calif., Mayor Libby Schaaf is taking up the challenge. Oakland's open streets initiative -- which opened 74 miles of streets to pedestrians and cyclists this month -- was particularly easy to carry out because the city used traffic data already collected for the creation of its bike lanes.\n\n\"Traffic is wildly reduced and people are behaving in a kinder way, so it's an ideal moment to roll out an initiative that's about joy, repurposing the commons and health,\" Ms. Schaaf said in an interview Thursday.\n\nBut more walking and biking is just a start. Could street closures allow for al fresco dining, as one Twitter user suggested last week? Or how about a way to convene outdoor concerts from apartment windows, stoops or porches? Or closing down broad avenues to add shade pavilions to help urban residents sit and enjoy the shade -- at a proper distance?\n\nThat's a strikingly different tone than what New Yorkers have heard from Mayor de Blasio. In Manhattan, where 36 percent of the land is dedicated to streets, the mayor briefly piloted an \"open streets\" program but didn't extend the program beyond the initial 11 days, saying it was not a priority. It should be. The city should be opening up whole avenues and blocks in Manhattan -- and in Queens, the Bronx and Brooklyn, too.\n\nGo Fish!\n\nFew businesses beyond Amazon and toilet paper manufacturers are booming right now -- but in Memphis, Eric Beene, the owner of Catch'em Lakes and Walnut Grove Bait and Tackle, has found that the lake and bait shop are busier than ever.\n\n\"Fishermen don't like to sit next to each other anyway,\" Mr. Beene said. He said that a local policeman recently came out to observe the social distancing at the lake and was pleased to see people fishing 50 feet apart.\n\nMost current state public health guidelines don't interfere with people's ability to fish, so long as they wear masks and refrain from sharing equipment. Several states have even waived licensing requirements and fees for anglers.\n\nFun on the Cheep\n\nSome Americans have turned to board games or baking sourdough. But what about something a bit more active -- like bird-watching? Bird enthusiasts have long touted their passion as a solitary way to enjoy the outdoors. At least some people appear to be embracing the idea: The Chicago Audubon Society reported that activity in its Facebook group is up 134 percent this month.\n\nIt's an optimal moment to pick up the pastime -- billions of birds from the warblers to the flycatchers are now migrating north from South America and the Caribbean as they prepare to nest for the summer. David Ringer, chief network officer of the National Audubon Society, advised New Yorkers to look for scarlet tanagers, birds so brightly colored they \"look like they're emitting their own light.\"\n\nDance Parties and Drive-Ins\n\nIt started as a personal need to dance off quarantine angst, but quickly became social: Since the start of New York's lockdown, Radha Agrawal has been DJing on her roof in Brooklyn while dozens of her neighbors come outside to dance.\n\nMs. Agrawal is the founder of Daybreaker, an organization that promotes early morning sober dance parties. Amid the pandemic, the group has turned to hosting live-streamed dances. But as cities like Berlin start to loosen their strictures on group gatherings, Daybreaker has envisioned the rollout of socially distanced parties. Attendance will be capped, staff members will be employed to ensure six-foot gaps between dancers, and staffers who used to greet visitors with hugs will instead offer compliments.\n\nFor those less inclined to dance, drive-in movie theaters offer a source of retro summer fun. Spencer Folmar is a filmmaker constructing what he believes is the country's largest drive-in theater, a venue outside Orlando, Fla., set to accommodate 500 cars across five screens. Mr. Folmar recommended local leaders consider using the country's 305 drive-in theaters for other community gatherings, like church services and school graduations.\n\nAs the toll of the coronavirus's spread became evident, Americans stepped up to stay indoors and flatten the curve. They canceled public and personal events, from festivals to weddings and conferences to commencements. Those cancellations brought their own emotional toll.\n\nBut local officials, public health experts and everyday Americans can still work together to salvage some of summer's joys.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "Mr. Osterholm is an infectious disease expert. Mark Olshaker is a writer and documentary filmmaker.\n\nIn the world's ongoing quest to respond to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, one of the tools most often invoked and hailed is testing -- testing for current infections, to determine who is ill and contagious, and testing for antibodies, a sign of past infection and possibly, too, of future immunity.\n\nThe goal is to identify people who might spread the virus and isolate them, and to allow anyone protected from reinfection to resume an active social and professional life.\n\nDemocrats in the United States Senate have proposed a plan for \"fast, free testing in every community.\" At a recent news briefing, Andrew M. Cuomo, the governor of New York State, declared: \"The more testing, the more open the economy.\" President Trump's new business advisory council has warned that the American economy will not rebound until wide-scale screening takes place.\n\nBut there are major problems with this approach. Far too few tests are available in the United States. Some are shoddy. Even the ones that are precise aren't designed to produce the kind of definitive yes-no results that people expect.\n\nThe first type of test, the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test, diagnoses SARS-CoV-2 infections by analyzing cells collected from the nose or back of the throat. It converts the cells' RNA into DNA and then, using polymerase enzymes, duplicates the DNA again and again, so that there's enough of the virus that it can be detected, if it is present at all. This process is known as \"amplification.\"\n\nAs of April 27, about 5,593,000 such tests had been performed in the United States, according to the COVID Tracking Project. That's far less testing, per capita, than in many other advanced countries, and it's not nearly enough, especially since people will need to be screened repeatedly: Anyone who tests negative for SARS-CoV-2 today could be exposed to it tomorrow, particularly in areas where the virus is spreading rapidly.\n\nYet for all the calls and recommendations to get many more tests done, there is a more fundamental problem that is far less recognized: The accuracy of RT-PCR tests is inherently limited. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends 40 cycles of amplification, but even after those, too little of the virus's genetic material might be present to be detectable.\n\nOne consequence is that even when diagnostic tests aren't faulty and they are performed properly, some people who test negative for SARS-CoV-2 actually are infected -- a reading known as a \"false negative.\" In a recent study by researchers at the Cleveland Clinic of five commonly used diagnostic tests, nearly 15 percent of the results were false negatives. Chinese scientists published a study in February that found the false negative rate of some tests conducted at the Third People's Hospital in Shenzhen, southern China, between Jan. 11 and Feb. 3 was as high as 40 percent.\n\nAn article published earlier this month in Mayo Clinic Proceedings cautioned that \"even with test sensitivity values as high as 90 percent\" (really rather precise), the danger posed by false negative results -- that is, the health risk created by infected people mistakenly being told they are infection-free -- was significant and that it would only increase as testing increases overall.\n\nThe second kind of test is serology, which detects the presence of antibodies to the virus in the bloodstream. Antibodies are evidence of the body's reaction to an infection, of the fact that a person was previously infected; their presence might also suggest that the person is now immune to the virus. We say \"might\" and \"suggest,\" not \"prove,\" because the notion that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 can be acquired through infection is only, for now, an assumption based on past experience with other viruses. No scientific studies have confirmed this hypothesis yet.\n\nScientists worldwide are working to determine if in the case of SARS-CoV-2, too, infection confers immunity, and if so, how effectively and for how long. But the first serological studies made public to date have been flawed or too easy to misinterpret.\n\nIn a much-discussed study of 3,330 residents of Santa Clara County, Calif., conducted in early April, 2.5 percent to 4.2 percent of the subjects tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 -- a finding suggesting that some 50 to 85 times more people in the community had been infected than the official figures stated. The study, which had not been peer-reviewed before publication, came under fire for various methodological flaws, including selection bias: Recruitment for the study was conducted via social media, and some subjects might have volunteered in order to get tested because they had reason to believe they had been infected.\n\nOne question that debate has highlighted is whether a study conducted in a suspected hot spot of infection -- in Santa Clara County or anywhere -- can hope to say something useful about the population as a whole or any other group beyond its own subjects. Consider also this serological study conducted in the town of Gangelt, Germany: Some 15 percent of residents tested were found to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies -- but the town was the site of a carnival thought to have been a super spreader of infection.\n\nAs for the blood work itself, serological tests, like RT-PCR tests, have inherent limitations to do with accuracy. Even the most precise antibody tests don't produce neat, binary results.\n\nMeasuring antibodies isn't like determining if a light has been switched on or off; it's more like gauging the intensity of a bulb controlled by a rheostat. One example: In the early days of an infection, while a patient's immune system is still revving up, their antibody levels might be too low to detect.\n\nSerological tests also suffer from an internal contradiction, a structural tension. A very precise test is able to correctly identify both the presence of any antibodies if they are present (this is known as \"sensitivity\") and the absence of antibodies when they are not there (this is \"specificity\"). But sensitivity and specificity are somewhat at odds with each other, and they compete. For instance, the characteristics that make a test more sensitive, or better at turning out true positives, also make it more likely to yield false positives instead of what should be true negatives.\n\nAt the same time, it is also a principle of epidemiology that the lower the prevalence of an infection in a studied population, the greater the chance that testing for antibodies will yield false positive results. (That's because when testing in a population with few total cases of infection, the number of false positives will make up a larger share of all positive results.) And the consensus among the leading epidemiologists and clinical-lab experts we talk to regularly is that, to date, only between 5 and 15 percent of the population of the United States has been infected with SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThese features are one reason an April 17 advisory from the F.D.A. recommending the use of serological tests simultaneously warned that the agency \"does not expect that an antibody test can be shown to definitively diagnose or exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection.\" Last Friday, the World Health Organization released a scientific brief that said, \"There is currently no evidence that people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection.\"\n\nGiven these limitations, what, then, can be done to put in place an effective, large-scale testing program in the United States?\n\nAfter the outcry over the initial failure of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to develop reliable RT-PCR tests, the F.D.A. invoked emergency provisions to allow the use of Covid-19 test kits without their needing to undergo the agency's standard review for accuracy. As a result, coronavirus testing in the United States is a Wild West, with at least 61 new RT-PCR tests and more than 136 unvetted antibody tests currently in use.\n\nThe F.D.A. must bring order to this chaos and determine which tests work well. It should stick to its normal review process but expedite it by giving it top priority with its clinical reviewers and bringing in more reviewers as necessary.\n\nThe rush for widespread testing has also created unprecedented global demand for essential test components, like the reagents needed to process RNA and the swabs used to collect samples for RT-PCR tests. Major shortages could persist for months in the United States and elsewhere: Demand is likely to outstrip even increased production, as more and more countries try to test an ever-larger share of their populations.\n\nGovernments throughout the world and the research, medical-supply and clinical-lab industries must unite to vastly increase global production of reagents and sampling equipment. Achieving this will take months and require building new capacity, presumably with public subsidies. The time and costs involved will be considerable, but such an effort is the only way to test large populations for this infection (and for others in the future).\n\nA blue-ribbon panel of public health, laboratory and medical experts, ethicists, legal scholars and elected officials should be convened immediately to set out a road map with realistic goals for testing and contact-tracing. It should also develop a national strategy for monitoring hot spots of cases and the cycles of troughs and spikes in infections that will almost certainly continue until an effective vaccine is widely available or much of the population has become immune to the virus.\n\nIn the meantime, and for as long as testing for SARS-CoV-2 is too limited or unreliable, the United States must ramp up what public health professionals call \"syndromic surveillance\": the practice by medical personnel of observing, recording and reporting telltale patterns of symptoms in patients so that local health authorities, mayors and governors can anticipate and plan for the likely spread of a disease.\n\nThis system, supported by funding and technical assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has been put in place for seasonal infectious diseases like influenza and are currently being used to track Covid-19 symptoms. It should be expanded to include even more reporting locations.\n\nGetting a handle on this pandemic will take many more months, and in the United States, as elsewhere, the effort will only succeed with the public's cooperation. Much resolve will be needed to endure physical-distancing measures over the long haul, including through the next waves of infection that are bound to hit. And people cannot be expected to accept the great economic and social costs required if they do not also understand the limitations of this campaign.\n\nInforming the public involves clearly acknowledging what is still not known about this virus, and it involves stating what tests simply cannot do. It also means accepting this painful paradox: We turn to testing in the hope of managing the pandemic, but testing won't get better until the pandemic gets worse.\n\nMichael T.

        "body": "Ms. Brown is a nurse and author of \"The Shift: One Nurse, Twelve Hours, Four Patients' Lives.\"\n\nNurses crying. That's what I hear from the front lines treating Covid-19 patients. A nurse will begin the shift crying and end it crying. Crying. And we are not a profession that cries easily.\n\n\"Untenable\" is how the sister of Dr. Lorna Breen, a physician in New York who died by suicide in late April, described her sister's work situation. She was right. In hospitals with Covid-19 patients, understaffed clinicians often lack sufficient personal protective equipment and tests for the virus, and they fear for their own lives. These conditions would wear on anyone. But they amount to a staggering burden for doctors, nurses and health workers of all kinds whose deeply ingrained duty is to save the lives of their patients.\n\nThese medical workers remain devoted to curing and easing the pain of the desperately ill. But what can be done about their pain? Their feelings of failure? Frontline clinicians all over the country are experiencing anxiety, insomnia, a sense of acute inadequacy, and feelings of being betrayed by hospital administrators. Many will likely end up with PTSD. Helplessly watching so many people die, especially when many of them die without their loved ones present, is professionally \"untenable.\"\n\nWe know there is no universally effective treatment for the sickest Covid-19 patients. But their deaths are clearly not the fault of their caregivers. Is it possible to ease clinicians' burdens so that they feel less personally responsible when these patients die? I believe that another type of care situation, that of a hospice, may offer some lessons.\n\nThe most fragile Covid-19 patients are not unlike hospice patients: There is no cure for their condition. While they differ from hospice patients -- their deaths often come on suddenly and cannot be foreseen -- clinicians might more easily make peace with their deaths by viewing them through a hospice lens.\n\nEven though we are all going to die, death fits uneasily into the world of health care. Fundamentally, health and healing apply to the living, not the dying or the dead, and helping the living get better is why most nurses and doctors got into this work. When I worked in oncology, I saw this principle acted out by physicians who viewed death as failure, and nurses who equated talking honestly about bad prognoses with destroying patients' hope.\n\nHospice care approaches death very differently. Practicing as a nurse in home hospice, I understood that patients were going to die. The goal was for them to have the best life possible for as long as possible and to die with minimal distress. Some people associate hospice with \"giving up\" on dying patients, but that is mistaken. Hospice staff do not hurry death along. Rather, hospice clinicians concede that curative treatment either does not exist for, or has been declined by, the patient, and accept that patients will die under hospice care.\n\nAs a hospice nurse, I managed symptoms -- pain, trouble breathing, delirium -- treated wounds, listened to stories from the past and acknowledged hopes and fears for the future. My intention was that all of my patients would leave this earth without suffering, and though that wasn't always possible, I tried.\n\nPeople often say that hospice nurses are angels. I tended to demur and say, \"Nope, I'm human.\" What the praise shows, I think, is that being comfortable with death is unusual. \"Comfortable\" is the wrong word: I accept death. I accept its inevitability, but also its importance. Death is the end of each person's time on earth; it is a privilege to care for people in that moment. I embrace the cycle of life while recognizing the sadness of every death.\n\n(That acceptance is somewhat conditional, though. Two and a half years ago, when I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I chose to take a leave from hospice work. My diagnosis brought the cycle of life a little too close.)\n\nWhat's more, a century ago, all of us would have been much more familiar with death than we are now. There were no high-tech emergency departments or I.C.U.s; most people died at home. Modernity made it possible to hide death in hospitals, behind beeping machines and snaking tubes and wires. But now that the entire world is threatened by a previously unknown virus, death has once again come closer.\n\nI am not suggesting that health care workers become indifferent to Covid-19 deaths, or that a certain amount of death from this disease should be callously dismissed as inevitable. No. Instead, I'm urging nurses and doctors to feel less overtly responsible when Covid-19 patients die. As a hospice nurse, I never experienced a patient's death as failure. Some deaths seemed unjust in a universal sense, like a young mother succumbing to cancer or a dying patient saying she was denied the full scope of cancer treatments because she was black. But the trajectory toward death -- I accepted it.\n\nWhen a patient dies on home hospice, a hospice nurse legally pronounces the death by calling the medical examiner and getting the body released. At pronouncements I did the required paperwork, and I also helped hold, or emotionally contain, the death for everyone gathered. I witnessed the ending of a cherished life and honored loved ones' grief.\n\nHospital staff caring for Covid-19 patients need someone to help them hold all the deaths. It is too much to feel responsible for so many imperiled lives, day after day, to rub up against one of the most challenging and often unacknowledged paradoxes of modern health care: Even though we work very hard to heal people, sometimes they still die.\n\nIt might be possible to plant a hospice nurse in every Covid-19 I.C.U., but frontline clinicians can also do the work of acceptance by admitting that despite their training, intelligence, tenacity and technology, patients will continue to die of Covid-19. That fact is tragic, and knowing that the mortality rate has been compounded by the failings of our health care system doesn't help. But it is still possible that the sum of human suffering in this situation can be lessened if nurses and doctors put the blame for their patients' deaths where they belong -- on the virus, not on themselves.\n\nTheresa Brown (@TheresaBrown) is a nurse and author of \"The Shift: One Nurse, Twelve Hours, Four Patients' Lives.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "The America We Need is a Times Opinion series on emerging from this crisis with a fair, resilient society.\n\nOn Feb. 23, a 25-year-old black man named Ahmaud Arbery left his home in Brunswick, Ga., to go for a Sunday afternoon run. As he entered a nearby subdivision, he was followed and later shot dead by a father and son while their neighbor recorded the incident on his phone.\n\nMr. Arbery's crime of running while black speaks to a history of racial surveillance and containment enforced by the American state and supported by white people with the means and opportunity to cause great harm.\n\nLately, the coronavirus has got me thinking a lot about the racial dynamics of containment. Under the quarantine, much has been made of Americans' regulated lack of mobility. But our cities have long kept their black residents contained and at the margins. Populations trapped in place are easier to price-gouge and police. Capitalism and immobility work hand in hand.\n\nThe American state has restricted black people's mobility at least since the time of slavery. These regulations included convict leasing, Black Codes, loitering laws, redlining, racial zoning, redistricting (legal and illegal), the prison-industrial complex and increased surveillance. This history has given us entire cities built to shepherd black labor and presence.\n\nOne might even consider the black experience as a kind of never-ending quarantine -- and indeed Jim Crow laws that grew partly out of concerns that black people spread \"contagion,\" like tuberculosis and malaria, affirmed as much. The eugenics movement, popular in the early 20th century, led many doctors and scientists to attribute the precarious state of black health to physiological, biological and moral inferiority, instead of structural causes like poverty and racism.\n\nNearly a century ago, my grandparents fled the Jim Crow South, joining the millions of black families that moved north and west as part of the Great Migration. No matter how many thousands of miles they crossed, they met the same thing: not freedom, but constraint. Even in some of America's most \"progressive\" cities like San Francisco, where my family ended up, black people were relegated to parts of town with limited housing, overcrowded schools and low-paying jobs. The police were everywhere.\n\nSo black folks have been educated in a kind of quarantine since Day 1.\n\nYet mobility remains a big part of America's narrative about freedom. The tone and complexion of the anti-quarantine protests shouldn't surprise us when white people have been accustomed to boundless freedom of movement.\n\nConsider the glaring contrasts between the architecture and development of the large-scale public housing units and suburban bedroom communities of the 1950s. Two very different outcomes -- one black, one white -- from one ostensibly shared aim of creating affordable housing.\n\nBlack people were trapped in poorly maintained towers, like the notorious Pruitt-Igoe homes in St. Louis, that kept them far away from the city's arteries and public transportation. The 33 buildings of the complex were so uninhabitable that they had to be destroyed after only two decades.\n\nMeanwhile, all-white suburbs like Levittown, N.Y., which also received government subsidies, were designed expansively with front lawns, public parks and wide sidewalks.\n\nMore from \"The America We Need\"\n\nThe same freeways and boulevards that made it easy for suburbanites like those from Levittown to zoom in and out of cities destroyed black neighborhoods, either by cutting them off or by bulldozing them entirely.\n\nNow many of these roads are being retooled in the spirit of \"new urbanism\" to make way for more bike lanes and wider sidewalks. But who will these benefit the most? A wealthier and whiter population that wants better access to a walkable, gentrified city.\n\nWhen black people can move freely about the city, that movement is often controlled by housing location, surveilled by the police and private security measures and allowed only in the service of providing cheap labor.\n\nToday cities are asking, demanding and even coercing black people to shoulder the burden of work that is fundamental to their functioning, but without protecting those people in return. Whatever mobility people have is largely for executing low-wage jobs, which are now recognized as \"essential\" because they directly benefit white infrastructures.\n\nThis, in addition to the crowding in black neighborhoods, is one reason we see an overrepresentation of black people among the Covid-19 dead in places like Detroit; Chicago; St. Louis; Richmond, Va.; and Washington, D.C. Another reason is racial disparities in testing and treatment. In Illinois, just under 10 percent of those tested for the coronavirus are black. But among those who test positive, 18 percent are black. And among those who die, a stunning 32 percent are black.\n\nFurthering the problem, some hospitals have turned black residents away, only for them to die, despite their showing the same symptoms as white people who receive testing and treatment. This suggests that bias is playing a role. If cities were to test all residents, treatment would not depend on any preconceived notions about who is deserving of care and who is not.\n\nThe historian Nikhil Pal Singh recently observed that the \"pandemic will not create the social transformation we need, but it will set the terms for it.\" The history of black quarantine provides us with our plan in reverse. Colorblind responses only make the problems worse.\n\nRather than corporate bailouts, we need a public bailout, one that involves an increase in public spending to support equal access to education, affordable housing and transportation. One that provides paid sick leave and health insurance for all.\n\nThe Department of Housing and Urban Development has declared a temporary moratorium on foreclosures of Federal Housing Administration-insured mortgages and evictions from public housing units. Several cities have offered similar solutions for their most vulnerable residents, and more should follow. Evictions disproportionately burden black people, especially black women, who experience homelessness at alarming rates.\n\nCities and the federal government should also come up with a plan for comprehensive debt forgiveness. This will make it easier for essential workers to pay for the increasing costs of education, food and transportation. Measures like these would actually contribute to the growth of our economy by freeing up capital for people to lead healthy lives.\n\nWe ask our cities to be smart, but are we asking them to be just? We talk about access in symbolic ways, but don't think about the core geographies of inequality that emerge in the making of a mobile, technologically driven city. The creative, progressive city -- with its fine dining, bike shares and crowded parks -- relies on the same workers of color that it relegates to the margins.\n\nWe can even take a lesson from the protesters demanding, wrongly, an end to the quarantine. We can fight for opening our cities -- politically, economically and racially -- with the same energy they are putting toward opening our streets. We must create solutions that benefit the masses, not a select few. A true end to quarantine demands ending the quarantining city. It may not be the best we can do, but it's the least we can ask.\n\nBrandi T.

        "body": "Mr. Roth is the executive director of Human Rights Watch. Dr. Sparrow is a medical school professor of population health science.\n\nOne of us tested positive for the coronavirus. The other one probably had it, too -- we are married and live together -- although symptoms were mild. We both were fortunate to recover.\n\nSome public health experts suggest that if we could show that our blood has antibodies to the coronavirus, we could be given a \"certificate of immunity\" that would enable us to resume normal lives. Chile is already taking this step, and officials in other countries, including Italy, France, Germany and Britain, have considered it. We would welcome knowing whether we had antibodies and, of course, would be happy to be able to resume something like normal life. But we worry about the effects such certificates could have on people's rights to privacy, work and freedom of movement.\n\nAntibody testing is certainly a useful thing. If research shows that people with antibodies have significant immunity, medical personnel with antibodies could choose to be on the health care front lines, taking on such dangerous tasks as intubating or resuscitating seriously ill Covid-19 patients. Other people with immunity might offer to assume riskier jobs facing the public in retail, transport or services. That would help to protect people who are currently taking great personal risks in these sectors.\n\nAnd as more people felt safe to venture from their homes, they would be more likely to help revive the economy. We are nowhere near the herd immunity that would enable us to avoid a second or third round of the virus. And a vaccine is still far away. Masks, social distancing, testing and contact tracing will be parts of our lives for some time. If we are going to try to gradually restart our stalled economy, people who know they are probably immune to further contagion from the coronavirus could play a part.\n\nMoreover, studies using antibody testing would give us a good idea of the percentage of a given population that remains vulnerable to infection -- an important factor in deciding how rapidly to ease social distancing.\n\nBut using antibody tests for the purpose of issuing certificates or \"passports\" is another matter. The threats to people's rights posed by a system that distinguishes between those with and without coronavirus antibodies should make governments considering such systems proceed with caution.\n\nTo begin with, we should rarely force someone to take an antibody test or reveal the result. Like all health matters, the decision whether to know one's antibody status should be presumptively voluntary and confidential. There may be the rare employer that can justify insisting on its workers having antibody certificates -- such as to work with people who are especially at risk -- but these should be the exception, not the rule.\n\nIt's too easy to imagine antibody tests becoming a new form of discrimination: Employers might insist on antibody certificates simply to minimize absenteeism or medical costs among their workers; employees might find it easier to work with colleagues who have antibody certificates rather than to continue with face masks and social distancing. Workers in grocery stores and other essential services have already taken risks by working throughout the crisis; imagine if they lost their jobs for want of an antibody certificate.\n\nIt would be one thing for an antibody certificate to, say, exempt a person from the need to wear a mask, but quite another to allow employers to insist on a certificate as a cheaper alternative to testing, enforced social distancing and other preventive measures. An antibody certificate should not relieve businesses of their duty to ensure the safety of their staffs and customers. Nor should it be used to restrict travel and other liberties when less discriminatory precautions are available.\n\nThe norm should be for one's antibody status to be a tool for enhancing the risks that a person voluntarily feels comfortable assuming rather than a mark to limit the possibilities that government allows. Yes, it might be easier and even safer to permit only people with antibody certificates to re-enter society, but do we really want such a two-tiered society? The cost for a large majority of people who have not been exposed to the coronavirus could be enormous.\n\nThere are some situations today in which vaccinations are required, for measles for a child to attend school, for example, and for yellow fever to visit certain countries. But requiring people to have been exposed to a dangerous virus is an entirely different matter. It raises worrying possibilities, like people trying to catch the coronavirus to develop the antibodies needed to obtain a certificate. That would not only put those individuals at risk bit also could undermine efforts to \"flatten the curve\" of infection, potentially creating a dangerous surge of patients and prolonging the isolation of older and other at-risk people.\n\nIf an antibody certificate were to become a prerequisite for work or travel, it could spawn a black market in counterfeits. And because we are likely to encounter shortages of antibody tests similar to the shortages of the coronavirus test itself, the difficulty of obtaining access might exacerbate inequality for people in poverty, undocumented immigrants, prisoners, older people and people with disabilities. Equitable, low-cost availability would be important.\n\nIf proved effective, antibody testing is likely to be seen by governments and the public as an important part of the path toward resuming normal lives before a coronavirus vaccine is widely available. But before anyone rushes to issue certificates or passports -- and require them for work, travel or other activities -- we need to stop and ask ourselves if we're ready for a society divided between new classes of \"haves\" and \"have-nots.\"\n\nKenneth Roth is the executive director of Human Rights Watch.

        "body": "BRISTOL, Conn. -- My family has owned an assisted living home in this town for over 44 years. Both of my grandmothers have lived in it, and my mother might soon need its care. As much as I admired my parents, I did not think I would someday lead it. I went to Yale, served three tours in Iraq as a Marine infantry officer and earned a Ph.D. in political science from Harvard. I had planned to turn my dissertation into a book.\n\nBut in 2016, after my father's health took a turn for the worse, I bought the home, Shady Oaks, and moved in next door. The home is now my life, and that means I am consumed with one thing: trying to protect our elderly residents -- and the people who care for them -- from Covid-19. As is the case with so many homes for the elderly across the country, it is a battle we are not yet winning.\n\nAs of late April, more than two-thirds of nursing homes in Connecticut have had one or more residents with Covid-19. Confirmed and probable nursing home deaths from the disease represented more than half of the state's total number of Covid-19 deaths. If we include assisted living homes like mine, the share of deaths in care homes for senior citizens is even higher.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. With adequate funding from government and charitable sources, we could pay caregivers to live on-site at the nursing homes and assisted living centers where they work. This would ensure that they do not interact with infected people and then bring the virus into our centers. I instituted this policy on March 22.\n\nThe result has been promising; we have yet to have a confirmed case of Covid-19 among our residents or staff. But I cannot afford it for much longer, and many other senior care centers could not afford to even start such a program.\n\nCurrently, most senior homes rely on checkpoints to screen staff as they arrive to work, mainly by asking them questions and taking their temperatures. But these checkpoints can easily fail, because people without symptoms can carry and transmit the coronavirus. Moreover, many staff members work at multiple homes or have family members who work at other facilities. Many senior homes also have been preparing for the pandemic by hiring extra staffers. So it is hardly surprising that the contagion has spread like a chain reaction in senior care homes.\n\nA better approach is to pay front line aides and nurses to live on-site through the period when the disease is surging -- meaning right now. This is hardship work, requiring staff to work 60 to 80 hours a week without seeing family members. But it could be the best way to protect our elderly. Lowering the number of infections at our senior homes would also allow us to conserve protective equipment, reduce the need for hospital beds and prevent the spread of the disease into communities where staff members live.\n\nBack when 17 of my staff and I moved into Shady Oaks in late March, I offered significant incentives so caregivers would agree to live on-site and their families would not be angry with them for being away. I am paying $15,000 monthly to on-site aides and $20,000 to nurses. My business cannot afford this. Altogether, I have drawn loans from my personal savings of about half a million dollars. We have also been approved for $343,243 from the Payroll Protection Program.\n\nWe should view on-site caregiving as an essential public good and invest funds so more senior homes can do it. If Connecticut pays $25,000 per week in matching payroll funds to all of its roughly 365 nursing homes and assisted living centers for six weeks, this would cost taxpayers nearly $55 million. Not every home or caregiver will agree to do it, but we should provide the financial support to make it financially viable for all.\n\nThis is not a small investment. But it will keep our homes safer and reduce health care and legal costs in the long run.\n\nSome officials assert that it is already too late for senior homes to do on-site caregiving because the disease has spread so widely. But many senior homes do not yet have Covid-19 cases, so these homes can still have clean starts. Homes with a few Covid-19 residents can act now and have staff live in the uninfected parts of their homes and care for residents in those areas.\n\nAt homes overwhelmed by Covid-19, having caregivers live on-site would prevent them from bringing the virus home to their families or spreading it through communities, particularly when they commute.\n\nLooking ahead, Covid may recede for much of the country this summer, but I fear that senior homes will remain vulnerable to a new wave of infection. We can prepare for that by having our staff live in our homes.\n\nI feel a particular responsibility to our veterans. About 70 percent of men over 80 are veterans, and a significant number of women over 80 are surviving spouses of veterans. In their youth, they defended America. Now, as their strength falters, we should defend them. Checkpoints are not enough.\n\nTyson Belanger is a former Marine Corps infantry officer who owns Shady Oaks Assisted Living in Bristol, Conn.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "My youngest daughter has told me that Annabelle, her baby doll, might have the coronavirus. We talk about it as we take a daily walk up the road. She's not sure yet whether it is diabetes or the virus. Annabelle's symptoms vary, but she has not left the small cradle by the side of my daughter's bed in days. I have been told I can babysit for Annabelle, but only if I promise to hold her gently and not give her candy. My daughter holds my hand as we walk. She wants to talk about her doll's sickness every day. Not surprisingly, she's not sure when or if Annabelle will get a test.\n\nI ask whether she's anxious about Annabelle. She says not really. She thinks she will recover and maybe just need a shot. We walk on in the sloppy spring snow. The days are getting longer and the walks are getting longer, our conversation looping like piles of old garden hose.\n\nIn addition to Annabelle, we have talked about rocks and crystals and a pretend set of sisters (of which she, my youngest, is the oldest). One of the sisters is pregnant and one is traveling in Europe. My daughter tells me that she is married and her husband is a \"good guy\" but has left that morning by plane for Florida. He is apparently a reporter in Sanibel. We pick up some rocks and put them in our pockets. Later I will have to give her my hat to hold all her treasures, and later still, I will put my cold hands in my pockets and find dirt.\n\nI have told her that her grandpa has cancer, a surprise to her. It's not serious, I say, and that sounds insane. I clarify that it's the best form of cancer one could possibly hope for -- a highly inactive form of leukemia. She is now nodding at me in the same way I nodded at her before.\n\nWe are walking along a path made of wood chips. It cuts through the forest along lines created by fallen oaks in a tornado that ripped through Connecticut in May of 2018. That spring I came to this same place and sat among the shattered trees. Many of the trunks exploded eight or 10 feet up from the ground in the shape of splattered palms. Others lay prone in piles. Several split in the middle, leaving gaping shapes that framed the disaster like keyholes into a broken world. Now the area is clear and open and flooded with sun.\n\nWhile we walk, I have to remind my daughter to keep moving. The faster she talks, the slower she goes. I am trying to listen to her, but half of my mind is thinking about other things. If I am quiet for too long, she tugs at my hand, pulling me back into conversation. It is hard to keep in focus the reality of her mittened fingers and the reality of the world at once, both of them vying for my attention.\n\nSuddenly I am reminded of William James's essay \"On a Certain Blindness in Human Beings,\" in which he writes about the difficulty of being present to another person's life. James uses a Robert Louis Stevenson story of young boys who form a secret club of \"lantern bearers,\" hiding small tin lanterns under their heavy coats as a secret emblem of participation. From the outside they look just like anyone else hurrying by in the cold night. But when they meet one another, they lift the edge of their coats to reveal a hot burning light hanging from a belt loop. I have always loved the image of these kids hiding fire, their faces momentarily illuminated to one another in lamplight, triumphant in their allegiance to the game.\n\nJames was writing about how hard it is to see someone else's inner light -- the thing that keeps them illuminated in dark times -- especially when we are fixated on our own lives. We pass one another, intent on ourselves and our own problems, never imagining the burning fire under the dark coat.\n\nI am thinking about James and remembering being in Italy last summer, watching the lights across the valley in Assisi coming on in a dotted dance as the sun went down, a smatter of earthly stars. And then I try to recall something the philosopher Emmanuel Levinas wrote in an essay after the Holocaust, something about how difficult it would be to teach children born after the war the lessons they would need, and especially, the strength required to survive in isolation. I would like to hold that text and read it again. It was written in French but called \"Nameless\" in the English translation.\n\nWe are cresting a small hill and my daughter suddenly sits down. She is hungry and tired and doesn't want to walk anymore. I sit beside her, still wondering about what Levinas said. It was something about the courage required to be alone, about a fragile consciousness, and the importance of the inner life. Yes, that was it. The lanterns shining under the coats of those young boys, the rocks in our pockets, the inner life that cannot be seen or guessed or known from the outside and that therefore cannot be so easily extinguished or taken away. The inner life that kept Levinas alive after being captured by the Nazis and sent to a prison camp in France in 1940, separated from his wife and daughter, apart from the world. Something secret to hold on to that cannot perish or crack or fall, something private and still at the core of a life.\n\nAs we sit at the edge of the trail, the snow glints and I think of those across the globe who are dying alone in rooms closed off to the outside, left with their inner lives, tending their own fires. Snow is falling slowly in fat flakes. The ground is cold, even as daffodils have pushed up early this year. We may look for a Jack-in-the-Pulpit later today, hoping to find the purple and green leaf curled around the tiny white spadix, nestled there like a prayer.\n\nAll is quiet in the woods except for the clatter of a woodpecker somewhere nearby. As if answering the rhythm, bits of songs begin replaying in my head, linking together the inner life and the weak lights -- the duo September 67: \"you once called me a lantern ...\"; Nick Drake: \"The sun went down and the crowd went home, I was left by the roadside all alone, I turned to speak as they went by, but this was the time of no reply\"; Leonard Cohen: \"Hold on, hold on my brother, my sister hold on tight. I've finally got my orders, and I'll be marching through the morning, marching through the night, moving through the borders of my secret life.\" I am inadvertently humming the tune when I hear her say, \"Mom, stop it.\"\n\nWe are walking again, a little stiff and grumpy, ready to be home. I am listening to something about another baby doll. This one is named Zoe. She is having a birthday party later and I am invited. Annabelle is too sick to attend. We talk about the decorations and the cake. Now we are picking up speed, discussing the guest list and games, coming down the hill in the sharp wind. To simply reply as if this is what matters is the best I can do. It is her world and these are her tiny lights, her babies tucked in their beds, the rocks and crystals in her fists, all of it fiercely real and important as the world seems to fall apart around us.\n\nSomeday, if she finds herself in isolation and I am not there, she will have her own songs and some courage based in these walks and this circuitous make-believe (as good as any philosophy), a rhythm of talking and walking etched in her memory to repeat on her own, an inner life rich with voices and creatures and the remembered pressure of our hands. I hope so. Her grip suddenly drops mine as she begins to run toward home.

        "body": "This is what I learned during 10 days of treating Covid pneumonia at Bellevue Hospital.\n\nI have been practicing emergency medicine for 30 years. In 1994 I invented an imaging system for teaching intubation, the procedure of inserting breathing tubes. This led me to perform research into this procedure, and subsequently teach airway procedure courses to physicians worldwide for the last two decades.\n\nSo at the end of March, as a crush of Covid-19 patients began overwhelming hospitals in New York City, I volunteered to spend 10 days at Bellevue, helping at the hospital where I trained. Over those days, I realized that we are not detecting the deadly pneumonia the virus causes early enough and that we could be doing more to keep patients off ventilators -- and alive.\n\nOn the long drive to New York from my home in New Hampshire, I called my friend Nick Caputo, an emergency physician in the Bronx, who was already in the thick of it. I wanted to know what I was facing, how to stay safe and what his insights into airway management with this disease were. \"Rich,\" he said, \"it's like nothing I've ever seen before.\"\n\nHe was right. Pneumonia caused by the coronavirus has had a stunning impact on the city's hospital system. Normally an E.R. has a mix of patients with conditions ranging from the serious, such as heart attacks, strokes and traumatic injuries, to the non-life-threatening, such as minor lacerations, intoxication, orthopedic injuries and migraine headaches.\n\nDuring my recent time at Bellevue, though, almost all the E.R. patients had Covid pneumonia. Within the first hour of my first shift I inserted breathing tubes into two patients.\n\nDebatable: Agree to disagree, or disagree better? Broaden your perspective with sharp arguments on the most pressing issues of the week.\n\nEven patients without respiratory complaints had Covid pneumonia. The patient stabbed in the shoulder, whom we X-rayed because we worried he had a collapsed lung, actually had Covid pneumonia. In patients on whom we did CT scans because they were injured in falls, we coincidentally found Covid pneumonia. Elderly patients who had passed out for unknown reasons and a number of diabetic patients were found to have it.\n\nAnd here is what really surprised us: These patients did not report any sensation of breathing problems, even though their chest X-rays showed diffuse pneumonia and their oxygen was below normal. How could this be?\n\nWe are just beginning to recognize that Covid pneumonia initially causes a form of oxygen deprivation we call \"silent hypoxia\" -- \"silent\" because of its insidious, hard-to-detect nature.\n\nPneumonia is an infection of the lungs in which the air sacs fill with fluid or pus. Normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with breathing and other breathing problems. But when Covid pneumonia first strikes, patients don't feel short of breath, even as their oxygen levels fall. And by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest X-rays). Normal oxygen saturation for most persons at sea level is 94 to 100 percent; Covid pneumonia patients I saw had oxygen saturations as low as 50 percent.\n\nTo my amazement, most patients I saw said they had been sick for a week or so with fever, cough, upset stomach and fatigue, but they only became short of breath the day they came to the hospital. Their pneumonia had clearly been going on for days, but by the time they felt they had to go to the hospital, they were often already in critical condition.\n\nIn emergency departments we insert breathing tubes in critically ill patients for a variety of reasons. In my 30 years of practice, however, most patients requiring emergency intubation are in shock, have altered mental status or are grunting to breathe. Patients requiring intubation because of acute hypoxia are often unconscious or using every muscle they can to take a breath. They are in extreme duress. Covid pneumonia cases are very different.\n\nA vast majority of Covid pneumonia patients I met had remarkably low oxygen saturations at triage -- seemingly incompatible with life -- but they were using their cellphones as we put them on monitors. Although breathing fast, they had relatively minimal apparent distress, despite dangerously low oxygen levels and terrible pneumonia on chest X-rays.\n\nWe are only just beginning to understand why this is so. The coronavirus attacks lung cells that make surfactant. This substance helps the air sacs in the lungs stay open between breaths and is critical to normal lung function. As the inflammation from Covid pneumonia starts, it causes the air sacs to collapse, and oxygen levels fall. Yet the lungs initially remain \"compliant,\" not yet stiff or heavy with fluid. This means patients can still expel carbon dioxide -- and without a buildup of carbon dioxide, patients do not feel short of breath.\n\nShare Your Stories From the Front Lines We want to hear from doctors, nurses and health care workers around the world.\n\nPatients compensate for the low oxygen in their blood by breathing faster and deeper -- and this happens without their realizing it. This silent hypoxia, and the patient's physiological response to it, causes even more inflammation and more air sacs to collapse, and the pneumonia worsens until oxygen levels plummet. In effect, patients are injuring their own lungs by breathing harder and harder. Twenty percent of Covid pneumonia patients then go on to a second and deadlier phase of lung injury. Fluid builds up and the lungs become stiff, carbon dioxide rises, and patients develop acute respiratory failure.\n\nBy the time patients have noticeable trouble breathing and present to the hospital with dangerously low oxygen levels, many will ultimately require a ventilator.\n\nSilent hypoxia progressing rapidly to respiratory failure explains cases of Covid-19 patients dying suddenly after not feeling short of breath. (It appears that most Covid-19 patients experience relatively mild symptoms and get over the illness in a week or two without treatment.)\n\nA major reason this pandemic is straining our health system is the alarming severity of lung injury patients have when they arrive in emergency rooms. Covid-19 overwhelmingly kills through the lungs. And because so many patients are not going to the hospital until their pneumonia is already well advanced, many wind up on ventilators, causing shortages of the machines. And once on ventilators, many die.\n\nAvoiding the use of a ventilator is a huge win for both patient and the health care system. The resources needed for patients on ventilators are staggering. Vented patients require multiple sedatives so that they don't buck the vent or accidentally remove their breathing tubes; they need intravenous and arterial lines, IV medicines and IV pumps. In addition to a tube in the trachea, they have tubes in their stomach and bladder. Teams of people are required to move each patient, turning them on their stomach and then their back, twice a day to improve lung function.\n\nThere is a way we could identify more patients who have Covid pneumonia sooner and treat them more effectively -- and it would not require waiting for a coronavirus test at a hospital or doctor's office. It requires detecting silent hypoxia early through a common medical device that can be purchased without a prescription at most pharmacies: a pulse oximeter.\n\nPulse oximetry is no more complicated than using a thermometer. These small devices turn on with one button and are placed on a fingertip. In a few seconds, two numbers are displayed: oxygen saturation and pulse rate. Pulse oximeters are extremely reliable in detecting oxygenation problems and elevated heart rates.\n\nPulse oximeters helped save the lives of two emergency physicians I know, alerting them early on to the need for treatment. When they noticed their oxygen levels declining, both went to the hospital and recovered (though one waited longer and required more treatment). Detection of hypoxia, early treatment and close monitoring apparently also worked for Boris Johnson, the British prime minister.\n\nWidespread pulse oximetry screening for Covid pneumonia -- whether people check themselves on home devices or go to clinics or doctors' offices -- could provide an early warning system for the kinds of breathing problems associated with Covid pneumonia.\n\nPeople using the devices at home would want to consult with their doctors to reduce the number of people who come to the E.R. unnecessarily because they misinterpret their device. There also may be some patients who have unrecognized chronic lung problems and have borderline or slightly low oxygen saturations unrelated to Covid-19.\n\nAll patients who have tested positive for the coronavirus should have pulse oximetry monitoring for two weeks, the period during which Covid pneumonia typically develops. All persons with cough, fatigue and fevers should also have pulse oximeter monitoring even if they have not had virus testing, or even if their swab test was negative, because those tests are only about 70 percent accurate. A vast majority of Americans who have been exposed to the virus don't know it.\n\nThere are other things we can do as well to avoid immediately resorting to intubation and a ventilator. Patient positioning maneuvers (having patients lie on their stomach and sides) open up the lower and posterior lungs most affected in Covid pneumonia. Oxygenation and positioning helped patients breathe easier and seemed to prevent progression of the disease in many cases. In a preliminary study by Dr. Caputo, this strategy helped keep three out of four patients with advanced Covid pneumonia from needing a ventilator in the first 24 hours.\n\nTo date, Covid-19 has killed more than 40,600 people nationwide -- more than 10,000 in New York State alone. Oximeters are not 100 percent accurate, and they are not a panacea. There will be deaths and bad outcomes that are not preventable. We don't fully understand why certain patients get so sick, or why some go on to develop multi-organ failure. Many elderly people, already weak with chronic illness, and those with underlying lung disease do very poorly with Covid pneumonia, despite aggressive treatment.\n\nBut we can do better. Right now, many emergency rooms are either being crushed by this one disease or waiting for it to hit. We must direct resources to identifying and treating the initial phase of Covid pneumonia earlier by screening for silent hypoxia.\n\nIt's time to get ahead of this virus instead of chasing it.\n\nRichard Levitan, an emergency physician in Littleton, N.H., is president of Airway Cam Technologies, a company that teaches courses in intubation and airway management.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "BOSTON -- Behind a closed door, an elderly man hopes a test will show that he no longer has an active coronavirus infection so that he can return home to his wife of six decades. Until then, he gazes out the window where he can see the trees. Sometimes his mind wanders to the lurid, delirious nightmares of the intensive care unit. He tries to distract himself with poetry.\n\nDown the hall, a younger man works to get stronger so that he too can get back to his family. He feels better, he tells me, but he is so bored, and the Covid cough still bothers him, along with a burning in his hand -- likely a nerve injury from the days spent lying on his chest when he was intubated. His face bears the scars of that lifesaving maneuver, blackened ulcers on his cheeks, nose and forehead. He too looks out the window. Waiting.\n\nThis is life for the growing number of patients who have survived severe Covid-19 but have not yet recovered. As a critical-care doctor, I could easily avoid seeing this part of the story; it would be almost preferable to think that the removal of a breathing tube or a long-awaited discharge from the I.C.U. is the victorious end to the narrative. But that is not the case. Even as hospitals continue to care for the surge of critically ill patients, it is time to prepare for what comes after.\n\nIn a way, it's strange that Covid-19 survivors must recover in places that look a bit like nursing homes, the very facilities that have been ravaged by this virus. In my own hospital's intensive care units, we have too often cared for patients transferred from nursing homes, coronavirus-positive and dying. It is little surprise, then, that many skilled nursing facilities refuse to take coronavirus patients after hospital discharge -- even when these patients are their own long-term residents. Until they have cleared the virus, these survivors are unable to go home again.\n\nWhich is why, in recent weeks, dedicated Covid-19 \"post-acute care facilities\" have sprung up throughout the country. Here in Boston, I recently started a rotation as the pulmonary consultant at a long-term acute care hospital that has shifted to care for recovering Covid sufferers. While some of our patients are nursing home residents, many are younger and previously healthy, debilitated now after days to weeks of deep sedation and mechanical ventilation. They need to learn to walk again. To dress themselves. We have more than 50 admissions already and a waiting list that is pages long.\n\nAt the same time, we are still caring for those without Covid too, transplant recipients and cancer patients, frail and vulnerable. To limit exposure, the Covid patients do not leave their rooms. And as in the acute care hospital, families cannot visit. Physical exams are kept to a minimum and most encounters take place via iPad.\n\nOn one recent afternoon, I sat at the central nurses' station with a headset on while my patient, just a few paces away down the hall, talked to me through the iPad next to his bed. The machine was at an odd angle, it was nearly impossible to look at him head-on, and behind me the alarms blared and I could barely hear, but when I tried to sign off he asked me please not to go. An adult man with his hospital gown askew, socks halfway off, asking me to keep talking just a bit longer.\n\nI told him how it was finally getting warmer outside and agreed that there really is never anything on television during the day. I did not hang up until a physical therapist in full personal protective equipment entered. It was time for his daily session in the room. The rehab gym down the hall remains empty.\n\nAt least we know how to track and treat the physical consequences of our patients' prolonged I.C.U. stays. These outcomes are visible. More insidious are the potential psychiatric and cognitive dysfunction that some former I.C.U. patients describe -- anxiety and depression; hyperarousal and flashbacks to delirium-induced hallucinations that are characteristic of post-traumatic stress; poor planning skills and forgetfulness that might make it hard to remember medications or appointments.\n\nThese are far trickier to screen for and to treat. Of course, it is early still, and we do not yet know the burden of these outcomes in our Covid-19 survivors. But given their protracted critical-care stays and the persistent isolation that so many of them endure, these issues will be widespread.\n\nAt our hospital, before the coronavirus, we built a clinic for I.C.U. survivors. There, I worked with another critical-care doctor, a psychiatrist and a social worker to screen our patients for common post-I.C.U. problems and to offer them a referrals.\n\nPatients asked us to fill in missing details: What happened to me? How long was I on the vent? This scar, what was it from? On a few occasions, we even accompanied patients back to the intensive care unit. I remember how their expressions would shift, fear fading into relief, as they realized that this was just a place that they could now enter by choice and then leave again.\n\nWe do not have rigorous studies to tell us that these clinics help our patients. And it will be hard to set them up now, with so many of us critical- care doctors still doing the work of keeping our patients alive, keeping ourselves safe. I do not pretend to have the answers here. But we owe it to our survivors to try.\n\nWe have come to recognize that for many patients with coronavirus, the disease follows a characteristic pattern. For them, there is an initial constellation of symptoms -- fever and cough -- followed by a period of improvement and then a catastrophic decline. A disease with two waves. I think of us now, as a nation, at the end of our own first wave. We breathe a bit easier. Perhaps we will be OK, after all.\n\nBut the second wave is coming -- not of death this time, but of survival.\n\nThat afternoon at the long-term care hospital, I was startled in the middle of writing my notes by an unintelligible announcement on the overhead. I turned to one of the respiratory therapists. \"A Covid patient is being discharged,\" he explained. \"Want to go see?\"\n\nWe rushed down the stairs to join the group that had already gathered, all of us in scrubs and masks, waiting. Someone turned the music on and \"Here Comes the Sun\" filled the small lobby. Behind me, the patient's two adult sons radiated excitement. When they last saw their father, he could not breathe.\n\nI watched as the elevator doors opened and a nurse emerged, pushing a small man in a wheelchair. He scanned the crowd, spotted his sons and gave us all this proud little wave, like royalty. I clapped as loud as I could for him, mouthing the song's refrain, \"It's all right,\" behind my mask, not knowing what this virus would leave him with or what kind of life he would re-enter, but hoping the words were true.\n\nDaniela J.

        "body": "Ms. Soe-Lin is managing director of Pharos Global Health Advisors and a lecturer at the Jackson Institute for Global Affairs at Yale University. Mr. Hecht is a professor of clinical epidemiology at Yale University and the president of Pharos Global Health Advisors.\n\nAlmost the only people who are being tested for the coronavirus are those who have symptoms of Covid-19, an approach endorsed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provides guidance for states.\n\nThat has probably revealed just a fraction of the people infected, putting thousands of American in danger, because most of those who carry the virus do not know it.\n\nWhat's needed is widespread testing of people with no known symptoms.\n\nA small set of blood tests for antibodies indicated that as many as 2.7 million New Yorkers may have been infected without realizing it, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on Thursday. That's in line with other findings. A recent study showed that up to one-third of residents in Chelsea, a hot spot in Massachusetts, may have been infected, and only half of them could recall having a single symptom over the past four weeks. Another small study, of pregnant women in New York City, found that 15 percent tested positive for the virus, and 80 percent of them had no symptoms. Of the 840 cases on the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, 60 percent were asymptomatic.\n\nSo Covid-19 seems much more prevalent than our meager amount of testing has indicated, and millions of infected people may be innocently spreading the disease.\n\nWe need to aggressively search for asymptomatic carriers, particularly among people who have frequent contact with the public and among vulnerable populations. This includes those who are infectious but will never develop symptoms and those who will develop them days after the test.\n\nThose in high-risk asymptomatic groups who must be urgently targeted include health workers, especially those in long-term care facilities; the homeless and those working in shelters; grocery store employees and delivery drivers, taxi drivers, emergency workers, employees in high density workplaces like delivery warehouses and meat processing plants; and anyone who has had close contact with a known Covid-19 patient. These high-risk groups need to be tested as often as every five days, given what we know about the time it takes to develop symptoms after becoming infected, and those found to be infected should self-isolate immediately while their contacts should be quarantined for 14 days.\n\nTesting will need to be expanded at least fivefold and made as accessible and convenient as possible, without the need for a doctor's referral, and free of charge. Right now about 200,000 people a day are being tested for the virus across the country. We need this to grow to around a million tests or more daily. Testing will be sufficient when fewer than 5 percent of the tests come up positive. In New York, 38 percent of those tested were found to be infected as of Wednesday. The number of new tests is also far too low. Louisiana, another hot spot, reported only 481 new Covid-19 tests last Thursday.\n\nTo do this, states must expand mobile testing programs so workers like those in grocery stores and high-density workplaces can be tested repeatedly and on-site. They should also set up neighborhood testing sites to encourage everyone else to get tested without hassle.\n\nScaling up testing will require a surge in strategic planning and supply chain management. The Food and Drug Administration recently approved new polyester-based swabs that can be swiftly manufactured domestically and don't have to be inserted as far up the nose. It also approved the use of sterile saline solution for transporting samples for testing if the medium that is normally used is unavailable. Newly approved testing platforms can deliver results in 15 minutes.\n\nThese recent advances should ease supply chain bottlenecks and increase the availability of tests. But states will still need to build a vast testing infrastructure using community health centers, pharmacies and private providers. The results of this hugely expanded testing will need to be digitally coordinated so infected people can be connected to the larger system of counseling, contact tracing and supportive services. Massachusetts has started an ambitious collaboration between the Department of Public Health, the Commonwealth Health Insurance Connector Authority and Boston-based Partners in Health to contact trace all infected cases.\n\nExpanded testing would let states more aggressively suppress the disease.\n\nThose with active infection could get support for self-isolation and contact tracing to identify others at risk who can be quarantined. To help those who cannot self-isolate safely we need a chain of care, adapted to American conditions, that includes safe places for self-isolation, supported by tens of thousands of community workers who can perform testing and contact tracing and make it easier for people to quarantine. Already, some states have converted empty university dorm rooms and hotels for this purpose, but so far the effort has been patchwork.\n\nIf we can't prevent the spread of Covid-19, the economy will not be able to reopen. Rapidly finding and isolating all infected patients, focusing particularly on the large pool of infected asymptomatic people, and quarantining their close contacts before they have had a chance to infect others is the only way that the pandemic can be controlled until an effective Covid-19 vaccine is found.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "SOUDERTON, Pa. -- On a normal day, work at a meatpacking plant is not easy. The slaughterhouse is boiling hot. People who aren't used to the temperature can feel as if they are experiencing high blood pressure. The freezer is super cold and will amplify any flulike symptoms. Workers wear as many layers as they can to stay warm, but it is difficult.\n\nIn the past month, two of my co-workers died from Covid-19. The company instituted protective measures, but it was too late. The virus spread quickly through our communities. I work in a plant with 1,400 employees. A majority of us are immigrants. Companywide communications are translated into Spanish, Arabic and Haitian Creole.\n\nOur work is essential to feeding the nation, yet plants like mine have become hot spots for the virus. On Tuesday, President Trump said that he would declare meat processing plants \"critical infrastructure\" to avoid a shortage in the supply chain. Already, thousands of meatpacking workers across the country have become sick at work.\n\nOur union, the United Food & Commercial Workers, demanded at the national level that meatpacking plants restructure themselves to accommodate safety measures and provide personal protective equipment to all employees. Our plant temporarily closed on April 2, before the deaths. At that time, 19 people had tested positive. JBS remodeled the floor in line with coronavirus safety measures secretary of health for Pennsylvania, Dr. Rachel Levine, ordered. The doors reopened on April 20.\n\nBefore this closure, people had started to panic. Social distancing was limited. Employees didn't cover their mouths. In meatpacking plants, workers are piled up on top of one another, often touching because there are so many of us. Many decided to stay at home on leave because they were afraid of becoming infected or of spreading the coronavirus to their families.\n\nIn this pandemic we have to live day to day. Now we feel a bit more secure. Employees' temperatures are taken the moment they walk inside to start their shift. Each person is given a mask and a face shield to wear. There are more hand sanitizer stations, and workers are given time to wash their hands. In the cafeteria, the tables are separated so that people don't have contact. On the floor there are guides so that people know how far apart they should be from one another. There are signs in multiple languages, reminding people to wash their hands often, wear a mask and stay at least six feet apart. Supervisors monitor the flow of employees to make sure there is distancing in the hallways and break areas.\n\nThe two people we lost to the coronavirus were most likely exposed to the virus at work before the factory shut down. One, Wilbert Rivera, 49, was already fighting cancer and was on leave. The other was our principal union steward, a 70-year-old Haitian man named Enock Benjamin. He worked at the plant for 12 years and did so much to defend the rights of his colleagues. He was diabetic and suffered from asthma. He loved to work, and he worked until the last moment he could. They will not be forgotten.\n\nDuring this pandemic, we are living day to day. We don't know the new dangers that we will face in the future. We have to act quickly to protect our essential workers.\n\nMs. Dominguez is a union steward at the JBS beef plant in Souderton, Pa.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "BOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Recently, as I drove home from a long day of work as a home health aide, a police cruiser appeared behind me with lights flashing. It was 10 p.m. and the roads were nearly empty. As I pulled to the side of the road, my heart was pounding.\n\nAs a black man from Uganda, I was nervous. Charlie Baker, the governor of Massachusetts, had just issued a 9 p.m. curfew across the state. In the three excruciatingly long minutes it took for the officer to approach my car, I tried to sort out why I was being stopped and what would happen next.\n\nWhen the officer appeared at my window, he asked just one question: \"Essential worker?\" I quickly replied that I was. He waved me off without asking for my driver's license -- my skin color told him everything he needed to know.\n\nMany black people in America are on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, working as caregivers, health care professionals, grocery store workers, delivery people and other essential service providers. In rural areas around the country, hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants work as field hands and in factories and warehouses to ensure the nation's food chain continues to function.\n\nThe work immigrants do has always been essential -- it's just not often recognized as such. After the public health crisis is over, will we find the political will to change things, or will populist politicians return to demonize immigrants as dangerous criminals, job stealers or parasites feeding on tax-funded public assistance?\n\nFor the moment, essential workers have mostly been spared unjustifiable scrutiny by law enforcement. And many are finally able to enjoy work-related benefits that their employers have long resisted. In Massachusetts, employment agencies are advertising jobs for caregivers that pay between $25 and $30 an hour, well above the pre-pandemic hourly rate of $12 to $15. There have also been plenty of overtime opportunities, with the hourly rate one and a half times the normal wage.\n\nEven as the benefits have doubled, the challenges of working on the front lines have multiplied. My younger brother, Wahab, works as a licensed practical nurse in a nursing home. He has seen an increasing number of patients testing positive for the coronavirus. Several have died.\n\nMy brother mourns for these patients. He cared for some of them for over a year and had formed close bonds. My brother's background is in health care. He graduated as a radiologist in Uganda and practiced for a few years before migrating to the United States. Never before has he seen so many patients dying.\n\nDuring the pandemic, he has become withdrawn and talks less when he returns home. Relatives keep calling me to ask why he doesn't answer their calls or return their messages. I tell them not to worry, even as I see the pandemic taking a toll on him. I ask them to wait until things get better.\n\nOne day Wahab returned to our one-bedroom apartment with news that so many health care workers fear. He had tested positive for Covid-19 and was required to stay home for at least two weeks. I, too, had to quarantine for two weeks because, as his roommate, I had been exposed.\n\nDuring his quarantine, my brother's supervisor, who was working remotely at her home, called to see how he was doing. She asked Wahab if he had developed any symptoms and if there was anything he needed. Each call ended with her reminding him that he would be retested and if the results were negative, he would be able to return to work immediately, especially as the nursing home was short on staff.\n\nAfter every call, my brother said, in a half-joking way, that he had never seen his boss act so caring. He returned to work after two weeks.\n\nThe pandemic, as tragic as it has been, underscores the importance of the work contributions of immigrants. It is disheartening to see that there are still plenty of people who portray us as enemies or social parasites, especially when we are visible in every industry and workplace that has been designated as essential during our current crisis.\n\nWe are caring for the sick, the elderly, the disabled, children and babies. We're delivering your food and packages, working on your farms, in your factories and warehouses. Pandemic or not, this work has always been essential.\n\nWe need the political will to enact compassionate, realistic and decent reforms that mitigate, reduce and ultimately eliminate the barriers that prevent so many of us from making a living wage. We must think about those who are underpaid and exploited, including immigrants who flee terrible situations in their homelands, come here to make an honest living and are grateful to pay taxes.\n\nMigrants like me and my brother are here because we want to work and provide for our families, just like you. We are proud to be a part of the essential work force. We are even prouder to work on behalf of all American workers in the common effort to secure income equality and economic parity for everyone.\n\nYasin Kakande is a journalist and author from Uganda currently working as a home health aide.

        "body": "We are flying blind in the fight against Covid-19. The number of cases is surely much greater than what we see and what is being relied on to provide direction for devising and implementing policy.\n\nBut is the true number two to three times higher, as some experts say? More like 10 times, as other analysts calculate? Or perhaps as much as 50 to 100 times higher, as indicated by early random testing in Iceland; a population study of V\u00f2, Italy; and some recent results in California?\n\nEvery day, national leaders, governors, mayors and public health officials are making decisions that are among the most consequential of our lives, with the agony compounded by the magnitude of the unknowns. If we knew more, we could markedly improve health resource allocation and decisions about where, when and how we can safely reopen parts of the economy.\n\nRandom population testing is the key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding Covid-19. The quantity of current testing still does not tell us what we need to know. Think about it this way: No one would rely on a poll of the Trump-Biden race, even of a large number of individuals, if everyone was queried at a Trump rally. With the coronavirus, most current testing is skewed toward the symptomatic and the sickest -- those who show up in E.R.s or otherwise seek tests, a group significantly, perhaps wildly, unrepresentative of the population.\n\nGiven our current capacity, random testing is the quickest, most feasible and most effective means of assessing the U.S. population. Ideally, we could test every American today, or over the next month, but even tens of millions of test kits would not accomplish this. We could triple the current number of tests under existing protocols, but we would remain in the dark about future hospital needs and when and how to relax restrictions on economic activity.\n\nRandom testing uses but a sliver of that capacity to deliver immense value. And it can be done now, using incremental new capacity or at hospitals and universities that have capacity that remains idle because it is not yet authorized. It is the only way to get a true picture of prevalence, hospitalization and fatality rates and more.\n\nThe recent Nobel in economic science went to Abhijit Banerjee, Esther Duflo and Michael Kremer, researchers using random control trials, the mainstay of scientific medicine. Their work dramatizes how misleading it can be, for example, to measure disease prevalence by reference to those who seek treatment at rural health clinics, omitting the multitudes who have no access.\n\nLocal random tests should be undertaken immediately. University researchers, working with local governments or operating independently, could conduct simple randomization, testing perhaps 5,000 or 10,000 individuals. We would quickly learn whether total cases were five times or 50 times current estimates in those areas.\n\nResearchers comparing the results across jurisdictions could learn about the effects of distancing and other factors on prevalence. For example, is the true number of cases in places that acted earlier a third lower or a tenth as high? And how large are differences across occupations?\n\nLarge-scale national random testing should also be started, with the goal of covering 200,000 individuals. Here, the aim is to be more systematic, comprehensive and strategic. Stratified random sampling -- which would assure a representative cross section -- could be refined using census data to help match the demographic and geographic composition of the U.S. population.\n\nBoth the local and national programs should follow individuals who test positive for two weeks. Because these follow-ups would be on random population samples, we would have the first significant, direct evidence of hospitalization, intensive care and fatality rates attributable to Covid-19. Keep in mind that all current measures are limited to those who are tested, a highly unrepresentative -- and, in particular, much sicker -- sample.\n\nThese random tests should be repeated periodically. Seeing how the true number of cases changes over time, particularly as states vary the intensity of their distancing policies, would be highly informative about both the disease and the policies. Indications that it is safe to proceed or that relaxation has overshot the mark and will once again inundate health facilities would be obtained sooner -- in the latter case before as much damage has been done.\n\nRandom tests should also be accompanied by questionnaires. Subjects should be asked about symptoms, pre-existing conditions, occupation, demographics and their recent distancing experience. This would indicate the true asymptomatic rate, who is at what risk, the effectiveness of distancing policies by occupation (highly relevant for deciding who may safely return to work) and more.\n\nIt is also essential that the data (in anonymized form) be made publicly available. Government agencies and health facilities should also post what they can -- consistent with privacy and resource constraints -- about testing intensities, test results, hospitalizations and outcomes by date, location, shutdown intensity, occupation, age and preconditions. Researchers today are frustrated by the difficulty in obtaining the data behind most empirical claims about the disease. Making public all the data from the random population studies and much existing data would unleash a torrent of epidemiologists, social scientists and data professionals throughout the world, a powerful battalion whose ammunition is data.\n\nRandom testing would provide invaluable policy guidance. First, it would enable far better prediction of peak health care needs. We have seen frequent, dramatic revisions of projections that run only a week ahead. Yet much planning -- ramping up supplies, transforming facilities, moving thousands of patients -- requires more advanced and accurate notice. Widely used prediction models diverge and have inherent limitations, but they all suffer from a lack of reliable data. Knowing the true state of prevalence and the associated medical resource requirements would enable planners to avoid gross underprovision in some places and unnecessary but huge disruptions in others.\n\nIn addition, the information from random testing would allow decision makers to calibrate shutdowns and reopenings, recognizing that the present and future livelihoods of a large part of the population is at stake and that there is a crushing, disproportionate impact on the most vulnerable.\n\nTo illustrate, suppose we were to learn that true cases are 10 times currently reported totals. This finding would imply that Covid-19 fatality rates and hospitalization and I.C.U. rates are a 10th as high as reported. Moreover, such differentials are probably far greater (even than is currently believed) for younger adults because their predominantly asymptomatic and less severe cases are much less likely to be tested. Data from Imperial College London already indicate that symptomatic individuals in their 20s and 30s have roughly a one-in-1,000 need for critical care. If random testing revealed that the true number of total cases for this age group -- symptomatic plus infected but not symptomatic -- is actually 10 times greater than just the symptomatic cases, their acute care needs would be under one in 10,000 -- so perhaps these tens of millions could be sent back to work safely, without inundating hospitals. If 50 million working Americans in their 20s and 30s eventually became infected, 5,000 across the entire country would need critical care, and not all at once.\n\nRight now, we do not know the true number of total cases even approximately. Nor the true hospitalization or fatality rates. We do not have a good sense of how current shutdowns affect the totals or how infection rates differ across occupations, including those deemed essential, where work continues.\n\nRandom population data, including knowledge of age, pre-existing conditions, occupation and current isolation, would greatly illuminate these and other important questions. No military general willfully fights blindly. Surgeon Generals shouldn't either.\n\nLouis Kaplow is a professor of law and economics at Harvard.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "Dr. Kessler, a medical doctor, was commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration from 1990 to 1997.\n\nEveryone wants to get the country back to work, school, and together again as soon as possible. On Friday, the Trump administration announced it wants to do that in phases and allow each governor to make the decision when and how to reopen. Even then, the virus will continue to lurk in people who are unaware they are carrying and spreading it to others who will become ill with Covid-19.\n\nWe need to face this fact: Returning to our old reality will be a slow and frustrating process that will take many months and require deep wells of patience. We will not be fully free until we have a vaccine. So how will we navigate this perilous terrain?\n\nA team of infectious disease epidemiologists led by Dr. Gerardo Chowell of Georgia State University has calculated that we must reduce our social contacts by 65 percent from what they were before the virus started spreading. By doing this, they believe, we will reach the point at which each existing infection causes less than one new infection. This is what epidemiologists call R (for reproduction) below one. Only then will the number of infections begin to fall, and we can get the epidemic under control.\n\nAchieving this degree of social protection will require a new clause in our social contract that will mean fewer contacts with others and wearing protective gear. Just as we obey the most basic laws in order to protect all of us, everyone needs to accept responsibility for not only our circle of friends, family and colleagues, but for the wider community. Our collective behavior will be the primary determinant of whether we can keep this virus in check. We each hold the health of our neighbors in our hands.\n\nIn broad strokes, here's what we should do. We should reduce our usual contacts by two-thirds, if our jobs permit. This reduction will help sustain what we have accomplished by staying at home. Some of us can reduce our contacts further if we can continue to be able to work at home. Those who are at higher risk may need to reduce their contacts even more to stay safe.\n\nWhen we go out, we should wear a face mask, distance ourselves, and if we are touching surfaces on public transportation and stores, we need to consider wearing gloves and wash our hands frequently. People whose jobs require them to be in contact with others, like cashiers and Transportation Security Administration employees, will need plastic barriers, masks and gloves. Any worker with fever or respiratory symptoms must refrain from going to work.\n\nWe can't cram people into buses, trains, subways and airplanes like we once did, and those loads must be cut without creating long lines of people waiting to board. Mass transit agencies and airlines will require subsidies to run more buses, trains and planes with fewer people on board. Strict protocols for cleaning these conveyances must be put in place. Conductors and flight attendants will need proper face masks.\n\nReopening our world must be done gradually. Businesses need to rethink their workplaces to minimize contacts between people. Telecommuting should continue for those who can do their jobs at home. This will allow others who can't work from home to work in a less crowded environment. At workplaces, the number of workers on shifts should be reduced and spaced out. Meetings should be held remotely or limited to a handful of people. Common areas where people congregate should be closed. Nonessential business travel should be curtailed. If an increase in infections occurs, we'll need to scale back.\n\nIf we are successful at keeping the number of new infections low, we can consider expanding our new normal. Restaurants can reopen if they take steps to provide adequate social distancing for workers and customers. If we aren't seeing new cases, theaters, sports venues and concerts can resume, provided patrons wear face masks and are spaced out.\n\nWe all hope we can reopen schools and colleges this fall, but only if the number of new infections is extremely low and controlled. But the rules of limited engagement will still apply. Students must reduce their contacts by staying in the same small group, limiting interaction outside that group, and wearing face masks in close quarters. That's critical.\n\nBefore we can even consider entering this new world, a new testing strategy must be put into place. Priority needs to be given to areas where we think the virus is most likely circulating, based on surveillance testing. We need millions of tests a day, not the hundreds of thousands of tests being done now. This is achievable, but will require commandeering the large laboratory testing facilities in the country and invoking the Defense Protection Act to assure swabs, reagents, testing equipment and other supplies are at the ready.\n\nMany seniors and vulnerable individuals are wondering when they can go out again. A mass testing program will go a long way to ensure their safety by identifying and isolating individuals in their communities who are transmitting the virus. Even then they need to wear masks, reduce contacts and prioritize when they go out. We also need a public health infrastructure up and running to contact, trace, isolate and prevent infected people from spreading the virus. This will be an enormous undertaking. Hiring and training people to do this contact tracing must begin now.\n\nLikewise, we must muster a wartime effort with the private sector to manufacture enough protective personal gear for all health workers and others who need it, and effective masks for the public. American factories should be using their collective productivity 24/7 to do this.\n\nNone of this can be put in place until we see the number of new cases and hospital admissions low enough to give us confidence that we've gotten the transmission rate under control and we have the hospital, intensive care and ventilator capacity to handle further outbreaks.\n\nAnd all this goes away when we have a safe and effective vaccine. Until then, our behavior will control our fate.\n\nDavid A. Kessler, M.D., is a professor of epidemiology, biostatistics and pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco.

        "body": "We are emergency and I.C.U. doctors who have worked in three hothouses of the Covid-19 pandemic: Northern Italy, New York City and Miami. Treating scores of critically ill patients, we all observed similar patterns: Many of the patients we saw in our emergency rooms had advanced cases of Covid-19 pneumonia when they arrived -- and many of those critically ill patients came from nursing homes.\n\nMore often than not, these older pneumonia patients wound up on ventilators. This is almost always a bad outcome. In New York City, an astronomical 80 percent of patients who required a ventilator at the height of this pandemic died, according to city and state officials. (In our experience, the death rate among patients not requiring a ventilator has been relatively low.) Similarly, we see evidence that the incidence of blood clots and renal failure in patients on ventilators is significantly greater than in patients who were less sick and didn't need a ventilator.\n\nThis data does not mean that the machines themselves are killing people, just that by the time those patients are being hooked up to ventilators, they are already in dire condition.\n\nHow then do we identify patients with Covid-19 pneumonia earlier so that they can be treated before requiring a ventilator? As one of us, Dr. Levitan, noted in an earlier Op-Ed in these pages, clinicians have a universally available, quick and remarkably effective tool to detect the attack on the lungs caused by Covid-19 pneumonia: pulse oximetry.\n\nThe pulse oximeter is a small device that attaches to the tip of a finger, and in 15 seconds measures oxygen saturation of the blood. Invented by Takuo Aoyagi and Michio Kishi in 1974, it is now considered one of the vital signs in medicine (along with pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature and blood pressure). Mr. Aoyagi, who died on April 18, has had an incalculable impact on patient safety worldwide -- and his contribution is especially significant in this pandemic.\n\nIn an analysis of more than 4,000 Covid-19 patients evaluated between March 1 and April 7 at NYU Langone Health facilities, one of the strongest predictors of critical illness -- defined as involving I.C.U. care or mechanical ventilation -- was the patient's oxygen saturation on arrival at the hospital.\n\nIt is time, then, for the federal government, led by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to mandate that all nursing homes and long-term-care facilities -- tied to a third of the Covid-19 deaths -- do pulse oximetry monitoring at least daily. In facilities with known coronavirus infections, we suggest this be checked twice a day.\n\nCovid-19 pneumonia generally develops between five and 10 days after infection. It does not cause shortness of breath in most patients. Oxygen levels drop over days, and patients gradually increase their respiratory rate. The low oxygen saturation happens silently -- silent hypoxia, we call it -- and patients do not realize it. By the time patients feel shortness of breath or have evident trouble breathing and head to the hospital, they already have alarmingly low oxygen saturations.\n\nA majority of Covid-19 pneumonia patients that we treated or observed during the surges in New York City and Italy had severe lung injury on first presentation. They were, in other words, arriving at the hospital too late, and many were winding up on ventilators.\n\nIn all medicine -- whether in patients who have traumatic injury, cancer, diabetes or an infectious disease -- earlier identification and treatment leads to better outcomes. Covid-19 is no different. We must continue improving the I.C.U. care of patients with advanced Covid-19 pneumonia. But we will have the greatest public health impact if we prevent it from occurring in the first place.\n\nThe value of early detection has become apparent in northern Italy, once the epicenter of the pandemic. The surge there has abated, and patients are no longer afraid to come to the emergency department. That means patients with symptoms of Covid-19, such as fever, muscle aches and cough, are coming to the hospital earlier -- and their illness is less severe.\n\nThere is some heartening evidence -- admittedly inconclusive -- that earlier treatment makes a difference. In a small pilot study of 250 Covid-19 cases conducted by Dr. Cosentini in Italy, half were found to have mild pneumonia -- but their oxygen saturation was not yet compromised. All of these patients were able to be discharged from the E.R., and they were sent home with pulse oximeters. Only 5 percent returned and were hospitalized when their oxygen saturation levels declined slightly. None of these patients required a ventilator. And none of these 250 patients died.\n\nWhile there is no specific cure for Covid-19 and we have nothing that directly kills the virus, we do have treatments that help patients and prevent the need for a ventilator. These include various noninvasive methods of delivering oxygen, patient positioning maneuvers that open up parts of the lungs, and close monitoring and treatment of inflammation. There is no panacea; some patients will still have the disease worsen, and there are some patients who will still have serious injury from Covid-19 unrelated to the lungs.\n\nUntil now the manner in which our health care system has addressed this crisis has failed. But doctors, nurses and respiratory therapists want to win. We want to tell families their loved ones are recovering and not dying. Everyone hopes new therapies and ultimately a vaccine will help defeat Covid-19. But until the magic bullets arrive, we must engage this disease differently -- that is, earlier -- if we are going to save lives and reduce the immense cost of care.\n\nFor our country to benefit from this strategy, we need to completely change public health messaging and create a new standard of care -- and that messaging must come from the federal government. If the C.D.C. leads, health agencies around the world will follow.\n\nDr. Richard Levitan is an emergency doctor at Littleton Regional Health in Littleton, N.H.

        "body": "As the world waits for a coronavirus vaccine, tens of thousands of people could die. But some scientists believe a vaccine might already exist.\n\nSurprising new research in a niche area of immunology suggests that certain live vaccines that have been around for decades could, possibly, protect against the coronavirus. The theory is that these vaccines could make people less likely experience serious symptoms -- or even any symptoms -- if they catch it.\n\nAt more than 25 universities and clinical centers around the world, researchers have begun clinical trials, primarily in health care workers, to test whether a live tuberculosis vaccine that has been in use for 99 years called the bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin, or B.C.G., vaccine, could reduce the risks associated with the coronavirus.\n\nAnother small but esteemed group of scientists is raising money to test the potential protective effects of a 60-year-old live polio vaccine called O.P.V.\n\nIt's counterintuitive to think that old vaccines created to fight very different pathogens could defend against the coronavirus. The idea is controversial in part because it challenges the dogma about how vaccines work.\n\nBut scientists' understanding of an arm of immunology known as innate immunity has shifted in recent years. A growing body of research suggests that live vaccines, which are made from living but attenuated pathogens (as opposed to inactivated vaccines, which use dead pathogens) provide broad protection against infections in ways that no one anticipated.\n\n\"We can't be certain as to what the outcome will be, but I suspect it'll have an effect\" on the coronavirus, said Jeffrey Cirillo, a microbiologist and immunologist at Texas A&M University who is leading one of the B.C.G. trials. \"Question is, how big will it be?\"\n\nScientists stress that these vaccines will not be a panacea. They might make symptoms milder, but they probably won't eliminate them. And the protection, if it occurs, would most likely last only a few years.\n\nStill, \"these could be a first step,\" said Dr. Mihai Netea, an immunologist at Radboud University in the Netherlands who is leading another one of the trials. \"They can be the bridge until you have the time to develop a specific vaccine.\"\n\nThe first evidence to suggest that live vaccines could be broadly protective trickled in nearly a century ago, but no one knew what to make of it. In 1927, soon after B.C.G. was rolled out, Carl Naslund of the Swedish Tuberculosis Society observed that children vaccinated with the live tuberculosis vaccine were three times less likely to die of any cause compared with kids who weren't.\n\n\"One is tempted to explain this very low mortality among vaccinated children by the idea that B.C.G. vaccine provokes a nonspecific immunity,\" he wrote in 1932.\n\nThen, in clinical trials conducted in the 1940s and '50s in the United States and Britain, researchers found that B.C.G. reduced nonaccidental deaths from causes other than tuberculosis by an average of 25 percent.\n\nAlso in the 1950s, Russian researchers, including Marina Voroshilova of the Academy of Medical Science in Moscow, noticed that people who had been given the live polio vaccine, compared with people who hadn't, were far less likely to fall ill with the seasonal flu and other respiratory infections. She and other scientists undertook a clinical trial involving 320,000 Russians to more carefully test these mysterious effects.\n\nThey found that among individuals who had received the live polio vaccine, \"the incidence of seasonal influenza was reduced by 75 percent,\" said Konstantin Chumakov, Voroshilova's son, who is now an associate director for research in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's Office of Vaccines Research and Review.\n\nRecent studies have produced similar findings. In a 2016 review of 68 papers commissioned by the World Health Organization, a team of researchers concluded that B.C.G., along with other live vaccines, \"reduce overall mortality by more than would be expected through their effects on the diseases they prevent.\"\n\nThe W.H.O. has long been skeptical about these \"nonspecific effects,\" in part because much of the research on them has involved observational studies that don't establish cause and effect. But in a recent report incorporating newer results from some clinical trials, the organization described nonspecific vaccine effects as \"plausible and common.\"\n\nDr. Stanley Plotkin, a vaccinologist and emeritus professor at the University of Pennsylvania who developed the rubella vaccine but has no involvement in the current research, agreed. \"Vaccines can affect the immune system beyond the response to the specific pathogen,\" he said.\n\nPeter Aaby, a Danish anthropologist who has spent 40 years studying the nonspecific effects of vaccines in Guinea-Bissau, in West Africa, and whose findings have been criticized as implausible, is hopeful that these trials will be a tipping point for research in the field. \"It's kind of a golden moment in terms of actually having this taken seriously,\" he said.\n\nThe possibility that vaccines could have nonspecific effects is brow-furrowing in part because scientists have long believed that vaccines work by stimulating the body's highly specific adaptive immune system.\n\nAfter receiving a vaccine against, say, polio, a person's body creates an army of polio-specific antibodies that recognize and attack the virus before it has a chance to take hold. Antibodies against polio can't fight off infections caused by other pathogens, though -- so, based on this framework, polio vaccines should not be able to reduce the risk associated with other viruses, such as the coronavirus.\n\nBut over the past decade, immunologists have discovered that live vaccines also stimulate the innate immune system, which is less specific but much faster. They have found that the innate immune system can be trained by live vaccines to better fight off various kinds of pathogens.\n\nFor instance, in a 2018 study, Dr. Netea and his colleagues vaccinated volunteers with either B.C.G. or a placebo and then infected them all with a harmless version of the yellow fever virus. Those who had been given B.C.G. were better able to fight off yellow fever.\n\nResearch by Dr. Netea and others shows that live vaccines train the body's immune system by initiating changes in some stem cells. Among other things, the vaccines initiate the creation of tiny marks that help cells turn on genes involved in immune protection against multiple pathogens.\n\nThis area of innate immunity \"is one of the hottest areas in fundamental immunology today,\" said Dr. Robert Gallo, the director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and co-founder of the Global Virus Network, a coalition of virologists from more than 30 countries. In the 1980s, Dr. Gallo helped to identify H.I.V. as the cause of AIDS.\n\nDr. Gallo is leading the charge to test the O.P.V. live polio vaccine as a treatment for coronavirus. He and his colleagues hope to start a clinical trial on health care workers in New York City and Maryland within six weeks.\n\nO.P.V. is routinely used in 143 countries, but no longer in the United States. An inactivated polio vaccine was reintroduced here in 1997, in part because one out of every 2.7 million people who receive the live vaccine can actually develop polio from it.\n\nBut O.P.V. does not pose this risk to Americans who have received a polio vaccine in the past. \"We believe this is very, very, very safe,\" Dr. Gallo said. It's also inexpensive at 12 cents a dose, and is administered orally, so it doesn't require needles.\n\nSome scientists have raised concerns over whether these vaccines could increase the risk for \"cytokine storms\" -- deadly inflammatory reactions that have been observed in some people weeks after they have been infected with the coronavirus. Dr. Netea and others said that they were taking these concerns seriously but did not anticipate problems. For one thing, the vaccines will be given only to healthy people -- not to people who are already infected.\n\nAlso, B.C.G. may actually be able to ramp up the body's initial immune response in ways that reduce the amount of virus in the body, such that an inflammatory response never occurs. It may \"lead to less infection to start with,\" said Dr. Moshe Arditi, the director of the Infectious and Immunological Diseases Research Center at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who is leading one of the trial arms.\n\nThe science on this is still early days. Several pre-prints -- scientific papers that have not yet been peer-reviewed -- published over the past few months support the idea that B.C.G. could protect against the coronavirus. They have reported, for instance, that death rates are lower in countries that routinely vaccinate children with B.C.G. But these studies can be fraught with bias and difficult to interpret; it's impossible to know whether the vaccinations, or something else, provided the protection.\n\nSuch studies are \"at the very bottom of the evidence hierarchy,\" said Dr. Christine Stabell Benn, who is raising funds for a Danish B.C.G trial. She added that the protective effects of a dose of B.C.G given to adults decades ago, when they were infants, may well differ from the protective effects the vaccine could provide when given to adults during an outbreak.\n\n\"In the end,\" said Dr. Netea, \"only the clinical trials will give the answer.\"\n\nThankfully, that answer will come very soon. Initial results from the trials that are underway may be available within a few months. If these researchers are right, these old vaccines could buy us time -- and save thousands of lives -- while we work to develop a new one.\n\nMelinda Wenner Moyer is a science and health writer and the author of a forthcoming book on raising children.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nIf you're a parent stuck at home with young children -- or, hypothetically speaking, if you're a childless millennial stuck in a dictionary-size Brooklyn apartment below another dictionary-size Brooklyn apartment in which said parent is having trouble keeping said young children quiet -- you are probably wondering when they can go back to school.\n\nAs my colleague Katrin Bennhold reports, restarting classes is essential not only to parents' mental health and children's development, but also to reviving the economy, which is why several countries have already done so. When will the United States?\n\nSince the severity of the outbreak varies so widely across the country, there isn't likely to be one answer, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government's top infectious disease expert, in testimony before Congress on Tuesday. But here are some of the core questions that could affect the timeline no matter where you live.\n\nHow do you make schools pandemic-proof?\n\nAbsent a vaccine, experts say mass testing is the only surefire way to keep the reopening of schools from becoming a disaster, according to Ms. Bennhold. But mass testing remains the exception. Instead, some countries, such as Japan and Australia, are opening in phases by staggering classes on different days. In China, students' temperatures are checked before they can enter schools, and cafeteria tables are outfitted with plastic dividers. In Germany, class sizes have been halved, hallways have one-way traffic and teachers wear masks (in Taiwan, so do students).\n\n[Related: 9 Ways Schools Will Look Different When (and if) They Reopen]\n\nBut whether these measures will be enough to prevent cases from surging remains to be seen. Even if they are, applying them in the United States is \"going to be a scheduling nightmare, a logistical nightmare,\" Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, told NPR. After all, how do you socially distance on a school bus?\n\nMs. Weingarten heads one of the nation's two biggest teachers unions, both of which have said they will consider strikes or major protests if schools reopen without proper safety measures in place or against the advice of medical experts. And as Kalyn Belsha reports for Chalkbeat, some older or medically vulnerable teachers may not return at all unless there is a vaccine.\n\nHow dangerous is the coronavirus for children?\n\nAnother obstacle to reopening is that the coronavirus may be more harmful to children than initially believed, Pam Belluck reports for The Times. Until recently, there was a tentative consensus among public-health experts that the coronavirus largely spared children its worst effects. But last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced an alarming rise in a mysterious coronavirus-related inflammatory syndrome that has sickened at least 100 children in New York and killed three.\n\nThe disease is serious, but appears to be rare and treatable. \"It's not like the fear of Covid-19 where we know there are no treatments and it's a matter of luck,\" according to Dr. Charles Schleien, the chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health in New York, who said he has seen about 40 cases of the illness since mid-April. \"It is highly likely that, with treatment, they're going to be fine.\" And more generally, it continues to be true that children are hit far less hard by the coronavirus than adults.\n\nCould children become superspreaders?\n\nScientists still haven't reached a consensus about what role children play in spreading the coronavirus. Dr. Fauci has confirmed that very few children have become sick with Covid-19 compared to adults. But is that because children are resistant to infection, or because they are infected but don't develop symptoms? We still don't know.\n\nSome evidence does suggest that children may not pose a large transmission risk, as David Zweig writes for Wired. A study of a cluster of cases in the French Alps, for example, found that a 9-year-old with mild symptoms failed to infect anyone else despite visiting three schools while sick. Similarly, a co-author of one Icelandic study of children under 10 said that his team didn't find a single instance of a child infecting parents.\n\nBut there have also been two studies that point the other way, my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli reports. While neither was dispositive, assumptions that children won't spread the virus because they are less prone to severe illness \"are exactly the kind of assumption that you really, really need to question in the face of a pandemic,\" said Dr. Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. \"Because if it's wrong, it has really pretty disastrous consequences.\"\n\nHopefully, scientists will have more clarity on the matter by the fall: Last week, the National Institutes of Health announced a study that will follow 6,000 people from 2,000 families over the next six months, collecting information on which children get infected with the virus and whether they pass it on to other family members.\n\nWhen will keeping schools closed do more harm than opening them?\n\nAs long as schools remain closed, the economy will continue to sputter, Kerry Cavanaugh writes for The Los Angeles Times. Unsurprisingly, she says, the political push in the United States to reopen the economy has almost completely overlooked the plight of working parents with nowhere to put their kids: \"If the political leaders of the country are serious about rebooting businesses, they have to recognize that child care is an essential piece of the country's economic infrastructure.\"\n\n[Related: \"The Men Pushing to Open the Economy Clearly Don't Need Child Care\"]\n\nSchool closures are also taking a toll on children's development:\n\nThe learning setbacks that occur over a summer vacation can easily wipe out one or two months of academic growth, The Times's editorial board writes, so those caused by the pandemic could be generationally catastrophic by comparison.\n\nThe shift to online learning is almost certainly worsening educational inequality, as Anna North writes in Vox. About a fifth of students nationwide -- disproportionately those in low-income families and families of color -- lack a computer and broadband internet access at home. Many also work in small, shared spaces, all while having to deal with the trauma of living in a pandemic without the protections wealth affords.\n\nThere are serious health consequences to keeping schools closed, too, as Dr. Nina Agrawal, a pediatrician, writes in The Times. \"When there is household dysfunction -- domestic violence, parental substance abuse or a mental disorder -- the risk of child abuse goes up, and there's reason to believe all of these things will increase during this pandemic,\" she says. And as the Times columnist Charles Blow notes, millions of children have lost the lifeline of school meals, one of the country's most important defenses against hunger.\n\nAll of these considerations complicate the calculus of reopening: How do you weigh the broad public-health benefits of keeping schools closed against the acute harms it does to children, who, needless to say, are also part of the public? \"I don't have an easy answer to that,\" Dr. Fauci told Congress on Tuesday. \"I just don't.\"\n\nDo you have a point of view we missed?

        "body": "In response to our query, readers discuss how they have marked the deaths of loved ones: struggling with not saying goodbye, not being comforted in person, but also finding some solace in the collective virtual grieving.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI am now sitting shiva for my 91-year-old mother, who passed away alone in her assisted living facility. She was not able to be surrounded by her only living child, grandchildren or great-grandchildren.\n\nMy mother survived four adolescent years with her parents, hiding from the Nazi plague in Polish forests. Five days before her death, she said to me, sadly, that she could not live this way. She felt that she was back in Poland, isolated, in hiding. The thought of being in hiding once again was simply unbearable.\n\nWe were permitted only 10 people at her burial. Not even my entire immediate family was there to say the mourner's prayer at her grave. Now, I am an official mourner, following the traditions of my religion: sitting in my low chair, alone with my husband in our apartment, mirrors covered, my shirt ceremoniously rent, the mourning candle burning. No prayer services are being held in my home, and no family or friends are allowed to visit.\n\nIt feels as if I have been mourning forever, and the last images of my mother's dying face are burnished forever in my mind's eye. The human isolation that tormented my mother's last days has descended upon me.\n\nSandy April\n\nNew York\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nIn rural France, where my parents live, death from Covid-19 has become very simple. My father was taken from us overnight -- from none of the usual virus symptoms to dying, all within 24 hours. My mother wasn't allowed to go with him to the hospital. She could only tell him she loved him and hug him for what would be the last time. And when he died, she wasn't allowed to go with him to the crematory. Bodies are taken by funeral directors for direct cremation or burial. The cemeteries are closed to mourners. My father's ashes now sit on a shelf in the funeral director's chapel, waiting.\n\nBut this drastic simplicity has been a relief and a blessing. No decisions, no arrangements, no need for my sick mother to leave the safety of her house. For now, my mother video chats with family and reads us her many condolence cards. She plays my father's jazz records. Sometimes she feels him in the house, and it brings her great calm. My father would be glad. Plenty of time later to gather with friends and family to celebrate his life. Alan Phillips, Aug. 12, 1935 - March 22, 2020.\n\nHelen Simonson\n\nBrooklyn\n\nThe writer is a novelist.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nI tested positive for H.I.V. when the test became available in 1985, four years after we heard of the first cases. During the 15 years that hundreds of thousands of people died in a steady stream, we each were coping with the loss of loved ones en masse while we saw others dying. We couldn't really properly grieve for an individual, because we were grieving for all those others gone and those going.\n\nThere had never been a plague of that magnitude since the beginning of modern psychotherapy, and psychologists were figuring out how to help us cope. Mine called it \"collective grief syndrome,\" which meant that we were already overwhelmed by grieving for people we had lost that the death of someone new did not really get its proper due. We were numb.\n\nIf you are losing more than one person at a time, stay strong, and give yourself permission to just let the waves of grief wash over you.\n\nJohn Powell\n\nPalm Springs, Calif.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nMy friend Judy died a couple of weeks ago. One daughter was at her side when she died. No one else was allowed to visit. It wasn't Covid-19. Even during this pandemic, people still get sick and die for many reasons. Times aren't normal, but we still need to mourn.\n\nA scant handful of close family members was at her funeral, but her shiva, via Zoom, was attended by more than 100 people from all over the country. Judy's daughters shared pictures of their mother as a young woman. Friends, some of whom had known her for over 60 years, shared memories.\n\nSeeing those pictures and hearing those memories, I felt as if I was really getting to know Judy for the first time. Separated by miles, all of us talked together and prayed together and we were comforted. It was a beautiful experience. Judy would have approved.\n\nBarbara Lipkin\n\nNaperville, Ill.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nMy brother Germ\u00e1n Luis was alone in his room in the house for the elderly he had lived in for the past four years when he passed away, on March 29. He was 70 and in a wheelchair, with diabetes, but otherwise -- or apparently -- in good health. He was found unresponsive. I was later informed that he had experienced cardiac arrest.\n\nThis happened exactly two weeks after the stay-at-home curfew mandated on March 15 by the governor of Puerto Rico. I never saw his body. A week ago I was handed the urn containing his ashes while inside my car by a woman who came out to the parking lot. Mask on, respectfully trying to stay the farthest away from me. Everything else except that moment has been handled through emails and phone conversations.\n\nI miss the balm of hugs and embraces. I miss a roomful of family members crying with me. I have gotten plenty of loving phone calls, and text and Facebook messages. But no service is possible. Nobody knows when it will be.\n\nCoronavirus didn't take my brother away, but it planted itself, blunt and uninvited, in the space of grief that I need and my brother deserves.\n\nCarlos Bas-Huertas\n\nCarolina, P.R.",

        "body": "This article is part of David Leonhardt's newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.\n\nI wrote recently about some of the companies that have been mistreating their employees and customers during the pandemic, and I want to tell you today about another case study. It comes from the cruise industry.\n\nIf you've ever been on a cruise, you've probably heard the captain and crew claim that their top priority is the safety of their passengers. It's a staple of the announcements that go over a ship's loudspeakers. But the recent actions of several major cruise lines aren't consistent with those claims: The companies put a higher priority on continuing to operate their ships -- and make money -- than on protecting their passengers and employees.\n\nI'm going to focus on a single ship in today's newsletter: the Eclipse, which is operated by Celebrity Cruises, part of the Royal Caribbean Cruise company. But the pattern extends to some other ships and companies, as well. To read more on the subject, check out recent coverage in The Times, The Guardian and The Miami Herald.\n\nAs The Herald has written, the cruise industry \"downplayed the dangers to consumers and kept sending out ships despite outbreaks on board and warnings from public health officials.\" Since then, industry officials have \"largely stayed silent about the toll.\"\n\nBelow is a timeline of the events involving the Eclipse, based largely on a story in The Washington Post, which has been doing excellent investigative work on this subject:\n\nFebruary: It becomes clear that the virus can spread very quickly on cruise ships. An outbreak on the Diamond Princess receives worldwide attention. \"People on a large ship, all together, at the same time, all the time -- you couldn't ask for a better incubator for infection,\" Anthony Fauci, the immunologist, says.\n\nMarch 1: The Eclipse departs on its voyage from Buenos Aires.\n\nMarch 7: Executives in the cruise industry meet with Vice President Mike Pence and argue that they can contain the virus while continuing to sail.\n\nMarch 8: Fauci warns older people and anyone with a medical issue to stay away from cruise ships. The State Department goes further: \"U.S. citizens, particularly travelers with underlying health conditions, should not travel by cruise ship.\"\n\nMarch 13: The cruise industry agrees to stop operations in the United States for 30 days.\n\nMid-March: All the while, the Eclipse sails on, with the ship's officers telling passengers that there are no virus cases on board. The ship's captain uses the phrase \"healthy ship,\" according to one passenger. In fact, multiple passengers are reporting flulike symptoms, which the ship's medical staff tells them are not serious.\n\nMarch 21: The Eclipse holds a packed celebration on its pool deck. (You can see a photo by scrolling down just a bit here.) Amazingly, the celebration was meant to honor health care workers battling the virus around the world. The ship holds multiple other packed events, as well. \"They actually made more activities, to keep people occupied,\" Vivian Miller, 77, a passenger, said.\n\nMarch 30: The ships docks in San Diego. It's now clear that dozens of people on it have the coronavirus. At least one will die, according to KUSI in San Diego. \"If they honestly thought that all these people who were getting sick had colds and bronchitis and pneumonia,\" David Nystrom, 75, whose wife got sick on the ship, told The Post, \"I don't know what to say.\"\n\nAs The Post story -- which is by Rosalind S. Helderman, Hannah Sampson, Dalton Bennett and Andrew Ba Tran -- concludes: The Eclipse was \"among scores of ships that continued voyages even after early outbreaks on other vessels, carrying thousands of international passengers to far-flung ports and helping seed the virus around the globe, health officials say.\"\n\nIf you are not a subscriber to this newsletter, you can subscribe here.

        "body": "The activists popped into frame a few at a time, the shadowy rectangles of the videoconferencing app Zoom opening grainy windows into their kitchens, bedrooms and livelihoods. A chat icon at the bottom of the screen glowed orange as they said hello.\n\nHeld on a recent Tuesday evening, the Zoom call resembled the teleconferences many Americans have grown accustomed to during the pandemic. But at the second online monthly meeting of a New York hub of the Sunrise Movement, a phalanx of young climate activists, something more consequential was on the agenda.\n\n\"This is a really scary and kind of catastrophic moment for many people, in this country and within our hub,\" said Berenice Tompkins, who hosted the call. \"Part of the intention of this meeting is for all of us to be here for each other and talk about some of the ways we can support each other. And in addition to that, we're going to be talking about power-building.\"\n\nMs. Tompkins is part of a vanguard of grass-roots activists who have boiled onto the streets, organized locally and put pressure on elected officials in the Trump era, reviving a tradition of widespread civic participation that lay dormant on the political left for decades.\n\nThis \"resistance\" of volunteer organizers, many of them new to activism, is ideologically and geographically diverse, spanning progressives, moderate liberals and even some anti-Trump conservatives. And while the resistance includes youth-led groups like Sunrise, many of its most committed and longest-active organizers are middle-aged or older. Many, also, are women.\n\nSpurred by the shock of Donald Trump's election, thousands of these citizens formed local groups around the country dedicated to resisting his agenda. Drawing on grass-roots tactics used by the Tea Party, they rallied in defense of the Affordable Care Act, flooded congressional phone lines and picketed Republican lawmakers. They also registered voters and canvassed for Democratic candidates, helping the party to retake the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections. Much of this standing activist army has remained engaged since, eager to tap those same tactics to defeat Mr. Trump this November.\n\nBut now the coronavirus crisis is threatening the civic resurgence the Trump presidency inspired, transforming marches, town halls and door-knocking from the building blocks of liberal organizing into potential vectors for disease. So until social distancing lifts, Zoom meetings like Sunrise NYC's have emerged as the idling engines of pent-up activist energy.\n\n\"It's a huge setback in terms of actually playing to what were our strengths, which is going out in person and having rallies and protests and these big, growing, in-person meetings,\" said Ted Bogin, another Sunrise NYC organizer who helped facilitate the call. \"It's forced us to adopt a fully digital strategy.\"\n\nActivists nationwide have pivoted to online meetings, Slack trainings and a renewed focus on social media. \"We were planning on knocking on doors and talking with people about the census, checking on their voter registration and giving them a calendar of election dates,\" said Martha Shockey, 65, who founded an Indivisible group in the Atlanta suburbs. \"It took a couple of weeks for us to figure out how we would do any of that work in this environment.\"\n\nTwitter, Facebook and other platforms can help sustain vital links between organizers and their communities, said Theda Skocpol, a Harvard political scientist and co-editor of \"Upending American Politics: Polarizing Parties, Ideological Elites, and Citizen Activists From the Tea Party to the Anti-Trump Resistance.\"\n\n\"Crises like this cause people to double down on the relationship they already have. So if there are strong ties going into a crisis, they can be adapted,\" she said.\n\nBut some fear that too much online activism risks depersonalizing -- or defanging -- their work. \"Organizing is an in-person activity,\" said Liat Olenick, an elementary school science teacher who co-founded a Brooklyn-based Indivisible group that's moved its canvassing and planned Earth Day protests online. \"It's much more challenging to put people through those activities when they're at home alone.\"\n\nMs. Tompkins first got involved with Sunrise at a demonstration the group organized outside Senator Chuck Schumer's apartment. For now, though, there can be no in-person events. That may not discourage longtime organizers, but it could the uninitiated. At its height, the Sunrise Zoom call had 36 participants, a few of them new recruits. But in-the-flesh monthly meetings usually drew twice that, Mr. Bogin said.\n\nActivists are also confronting the sense of isolation social distancing can breed. For those stressing over vulnerable loved ones, lost jobs or cabin fever, remote organizing has become therapeutic as well as strategic. This month, Sunrise NYC held a community care workshop over Zoom aimed at easing anxiety. \"We're all learning to be patient with ourselves and each other,\" said Ms. Shockey, the Georgia Indivisible group founder. \"Our motto is to organize with a generous spirit, and this is a time for that, for sure.\"\n\nAnd while normal life still seems far off, activists remain hopeful that the virus-induced holding pattern will break before November. \"I kind of think of social distancing as a pressure cooker, where all of the organizing that we continue to do during this time helps to build up that pressure,\" Ms. Tompkins said over Zoom.\n\nSix and a half months from the general election, that determination remains aspirational, as does the power of the resistance to shape a campaign shadowed by the coronavirus. Sunrise NYC is planning digital town halls and phone banking to aid progressive challengers to establishment Democrats in New York's primary election, which has been delayed until June, but the crisis could further reduce already-low turnout rates among younger voters.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Biden's emergence as the presumptive Democratic nominee for president is a reminder that most of the party's midterm gains were made by relative moderates in swing districts, often with resistance activists' help. But for now, members of Ms. Shockey's center-left group -- who helped one of those Democrats, Lucy McBath, flip a Republican-held House seat in 2018 -- are focused more on helping Georgians navigate remote voting than on boosting candidates. Some have started sewing masks for local health care workers.\n\nAnd even as the coronavirus has given many resistance organizers a renewed sense of purpose, restrictions to combat it have spurred some people on the right -- organized by conservative groups and egged on by Mr. Trump and Fox News -- to flout social-distancing rules and protest by the hundreds in Michigan, Wisconsin and other states.\n\nFor Ms. Tompkins, whose mother has been sick with the symptoms of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, the crisis has intensified impulses that undergird her activism.\n\n\"This has really driven home the fact that our country doesn't have an adequate social safety net or an adequate means to take care of people in normal circumstances,\" she said. \"Or when a crisis like this hits.\"\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

        "body": "It was, it seemed, the end of the world -- and that was before the plague came. In the first decade of the 14th century, the climate was changing, and not for the good. \"A physical chill settled on the 14th century at its very start, initiating the miseries to come,\" Barbara W. Tuchman wrote in her 1978 book \"A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century.\" \"The Baltic Sea froze over twice, 1303 and 1306-07; years followed of unseasonable cold, storms and rains, and a rise in the level of the Caspian Sea.\" Known as the Little Ice Age, the shift in weather was mysterious in cause but clear in its devastating effects: Colder weather meant a curtailed growing season, which in turn meant less food, which in the last resort meant people starved to death.\n\nThen came the rains, which in 1315 washed out what crops there were, and famine, Tuchman reported, \"the dark horseman of the Apocalypse, became familiar to all. ... Reports spread of people eating their own children, of the poor in Poland feeding on hanged bodies taken down from the gibbet.\"\n\nAnd then, at last, as if ice and cold and famine weren't enough, came the bubonic plague. Rats were long believed to be the culprit, but the Black Death is now thought to have largely spread by fleas, lice and through the air -- transmitted, in other words, from human to human. As Tuchman described it, the sailors who brought the contagion to Europe from the Black Sea in October 1347 \"showed strange black swellings about the size of an egg or an apple in the armpits and groin. The swellings oozed blood and pus and were followed by spreading boils and black blotches on the skin from internal bleeding. The sick suffered severe pain and died quickly within five days of the first symptoms.\" Soon the road from apparent infection to death shortened considerably. \"These victims coughed and sweated heavily and died even more quickly, within three days or less, sometimes in 24 hours. ... Depression and despair accompanied the physical symptoms, and before the end 'death is seen seated on the face.'\"\n\nThus began the deadliest pandemic in human history. The Black Death killed an estimated third of the world's population, leading to fundamental social, economic and political shifts. It's too early to know where our own battle against Covid-19 will lead us -- the fight is far from over -- but the nonfiction literature of plague reveals that pandemics, while ending individual human lives, can mark the beginnings of new ways of being and of thinking.\n\nWrongly believed to have come from China, the Black Death was everywhere. \"Father abandoned child, wife husband, one brother another, for this plague seemed to strike through air and sight,\" a chronicler of Siena wrote. \"And so they died. And no one could be found to bury the dead for money or friendship.\" The economically vulnerable suffered the most. \"The rich fled to their country places,\" Tuchman wrote; Boccaccio reported that the wealthy of Florence found refuge in palaces \"removed on every side from the roads\" with \"wells of cool water and rare wines.\" When the poor died, it was reported, \"only the stench of their bodies informed neighbors of their death.\"\n\nThe failure to socially distance exacerbated matters. Early on the pope authorized \"penitent processions ... some attended by as many as 2,000, which everywhere accompanied the plague and helped to spread it.\" And health care workers died doing their duty. In Paris, the nuns \"having no fear of death, tended the sick with all sweetness and humility.\" As Tuchman observed, \"New nuns repeatedly took the places of those who died, until the majority 'many times renewed by death now rest in peace in Christ as we may piously believe.'\"\n\nHow did it end? For a long time it didn't. There were numerous recurrences; scientists and historians still debate how the plague was brought under control. Some believe quarantine (the word derives from a 40-day period of confinement) and improved sanitation did the trick.\n\nThe plague made no sense, and in making no sense, it helped reorder how human beings understood the world. The changes took time; as Tuchman remarked, \"The persistence of the normal is strong.\" Yet the Black Death undermined received authority. The shift from faith in institutions -- monarchies, aristocracies, papacies -- to an emphasis on the individual would be accelerated in the years of the Protestant Reformation and the scientific revolution, but Tuchman posited that the roots of modernity can be traced to the disease-bearing fleas and rats of the 14th century. \"Survivors of the plague, finding themselves neither destroyed nor improved, could discover no Divine purpose in the pain they had suffered,\" Tuchman wrote. \"God's purposes were usually mysterious, but this scourge had been too terrible to be accepted without questioning. If a disaster of such magnitude, the most lethal ever known, was a mere wanton act of God or perhaps not God's work at all, then the absolutes of a fixed order were loosed from their moorings. Minds that opened to admit these questions could never again be shut. Once people envisioned the possibility of change in a fixed order, the end of an age of submission came into sight; the turn to individual conscience lay ahead. To that extent the Black Death may have been the unrecognized beginning of modern man.\"\n\nIn 1721, an outbreak of smallpox in Boston furthered modernity's cause. As Stephen Coss argued in \"The Fever of 1721: The Epidemic That Revolutionized Medicine and American Politics\" (2016), the epidemic led Cotton Mather, the Puritan minister who had, since the Salem witch trials, become an advocate for science, to urge Dr. Zabdiel Boylston to undertake a then-revolutionary series of inoculations.\n\nThe science had its origins in China 700 years earlier, in A.D. 1000, Coss wrote, \"when the Chinese had procured immunity by snorting finely ground smallpox scabs through a thin, hollow tube made of bone.\" The practice reached Britain and North America early in the 18th century, but many established medical authorities were skeptical that what were seen as barbarous peoples could contribute anything to medical knowledge.\n\nBoylston was anxious to try whatever he could; he himself had suffered from smallpox, which he described as \"Purple spots, the bloody and parchment Pox, Hemorahages of Blood at the Mouth, Nose, Fundament, and Privities; Ravings and Deliriums; Convulsions, and other Fits; violent inflammations and Swellings in the Eyes and Throat; so that they cannot see, or scarcely breathe, or swallow anything, to keep them from starving.\"\n\nBy embracing the new methods coming from another part of the world, Boylston was able to help change medicine -- and life -- forever. Thus did smallpox open minds to the efficacy and power of science itself.\n\nAmid the Black Death, Petrarch wrote, \"Oh happy posterity who will not experience such abysmal woe and will look upon our testimony as a fable.\" Seven centuries on, our woes may not be as abysmal as theirs, but the pain of the past is a fable all too close to fact.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Mayo Clinic, the renowned medical center in Minnesota, has a clear policy in place during the coronavirus outbreak that any visitor should wear a protective face mask.\n\nBut when a delegation of Trump administration officials arrived at the clinic on Tuesday to thank the doctors there for their work on the virus, one person decided to flout the rule: Vice President Mike Pence, the chairman of the White House coronavirus task force.\n\nStephen M. Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, wore a mask as did other administration officials and members of the clinic's staff. Mr. Pence stood out as the only person with his face uncovered as he toured the virology laboratory's labeling area and spoke to a clinic staff member who had recovered from the coronavirus. Mr. Pence also participated in a round table with local officials and Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, who were also wearing masks.\n\nAfter his visit, the Mayo Clinic posted on Twitter that it had \"informed @VP of the masking policy prior to his arrival today.\" The clinic then deleted the tweet, with no explanation.\n\nIt was the latest example of Mr. Pence's refusal to don a face mask even as he travels the country representing the administration. This month, he was photographed arriving in Colorado Springs and being greeted by the Democratic governor of Colorado, Jared Polis, who wore a face mask emblazoned with images from his state flag. Mr. Pence tapped elbows, but kept his face bare.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump would like schools to reopen before the summer. Few states seem to be considering it. The U.S. surpasses 1 million known coronavirus cases. A mask for thee, but not for me: Pence declines a face covering at the Mayo Clinic. See more updates Updated 6m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nMr. Pence later defended his maskless appearance at the Mayo Clinic to reporters.\n\n\"As vice president of the United States, I'm tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus,\" he said. He added that he was following guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which indicate that a face mask is effective in preventing the spread of the virus by those who have it.\n\nHis aides in the past have said the guidelines were meant to protect people from asymptomatic spread. Because Mr. Pence is tested regularly, they said, he is not asymptomatic. Mr. Pence did not explain why he chose not to honor the Mayo Clinic's own guidelines for its facility.\n\nBut public health experts dismissed his argument for skipping a face mask as faulty.\n\nEven in coronavirus patients who show symptoms, diagnostic tests may detect the virus only 75 percent of the time, said Dr. Mark Loeb, a microbiologist and infectious disease specialist at McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, and it is unclear how sensitive the tests are in asymptomatic cases.\n\nMr. Pence also drew immediate criticism from the administration's critics.\n\nAmerican Bridge, a progressive group, called for Mr. Pence to be removed from the coronavirus task force, which he oversees. \"He just didn't care enough about the health and safety of doctors, nurses, and patients to follow their guidance,\" said Kyle Morse, a spokesman for the group. \"Pence, like Donald Trump, thinks the rules don't apply to him.\"\n\nBut he has one an important ally -- President Trump.\n\nMr. Trump has traveled only once since his administration released its federal guidelines advising against unnecessary travel. But he has made it clear, both in public and in private, that he believes face masks are not necessary and does not plan to use one himself.\n\n\"Wearing a face mask as I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens -- I don't know,\" he has said. \"Somehow, I don't see it for myself.\"",

        "body": "Having worked for nearly 30 years at City Fresh Market in Bushwick, Brooklyn, perched on her stool at cash register No. 4, Cecilia Nibbs knew customers by the things they bought, keeping a mental list of their spending habits, much like taking stock of the store's inventory.\n\nIn March, some of them started disappearing, one by one. They had died, other residents told her. The news got grimmer: They had fallen victim to a new and incurable disease.\n\n\"People came to tell me: 'Oh Ceci, remember that guy? He died,'\" Ms. Nibbs said. \"'Oh Ceci, remember that one? He died.'\"\n\nTheir deaths were ominous early signs of the arrival of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSuddenly, going to work felt like walking into a war zone where the enemy was invisible and could be carried by any person whose groceries she packed and into whose hands she placed change.\n\nWhat used to be a mundane job became fraught with anxiety, nearly overnight.\n\n\"When you're working in the store, you interact with a lot of people. You don't know which one is the sick one,\" Ms. Nibbs, 58, said. \"You don't know which one is the good one.''\n\n\"I tell you, it's scary,\" she added.\n\nSupermarkets do not usually stand out as providers of essential services like hospitals, police precinct houses or fire stations do. But they have emerged as vital to the city, keeping New Yorkers fed and communities together. At the same time, they are places of danger for workers because of the waves of customers shuffling in and out.\n\nAt City Fresh -- like at most grocery stores -- workers' rituals have changed in ways they never could have imagined.\n\nThere are the usual tasks -- turning on cash registers, stocking the cereal aisle, setting up the cold cuts at the deli counter. But now they protect themselves behind plastic shields and cloth masks, slipping on gloves and carrying disinfectant wherever they go. When the store ran out of Lysol, they had to make their own disinfectant out of alcohol, eucalyptus oil and aloe vera.\n\nBefore social distancing requirements were imposed, customers clogged the aisles, sparring over toilet paper, disinfectant and frozen pizza. At City Fresh, which is open 24 hours, the number of customers quintupled in March from the previous month, including a surge in shoppers after midnight.\n\n\"They were panicked,\" said Dulce Simono, 32, who works as a cashier and in the back office. \"That's when we realized there were too many people and we started wearing face masks and gloves.\"\n\nThe fear of the virus has even led workers to turn to unusual and unscientific remedies.\n\nEvery morning, before starting their shifts, the staff members gather in the basement and crowd around an enormous pot of boiling tea with a dozen spices that Wilson Ortiz, one of the store's workers, prepares with great care.\n\nThe employees, mostly from Central and South America, normally drink coffee, but they began the tea-sipping ritual began in early March with hope that it would boost their immunity.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York More than 1,600 previously undisclosed deaths were reported at nursing homes in N.Y. Judge orders New York to hold its Democratic presidential primary. An Amazon worker on Staten Island has died of coronavirus complications. See more updates Updated 6h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nMr. Ortiz was so concerned about contracting the virus at work that he had dusted off a book on natural medicine he had received years before as a gift. \"Now my first task every day is to make the tea,\" he said.\n\nThe tea ritual underscores the way the pandemic has upended the supermarket's routines and the emotional toll it has taken on workers, whose jobs have become longer, harder and more stressful.\n\nMs. Nibbs said that she had counted at least 10 customers who had died. But so far only one worker is believed to have gotten the virus.\n\nDespite the health risks, workers continue to show up, in part because they consider their colleagues to be family, but also out of a sense of duty.\n\n\"We need to make people feel good,\" Ms. Nibbs said, describing how she listens attentively to customers, who, in the throes of a cooking frenzy because of the city's stay-at-home order, demand out-of-season ingredients, like chestnuts.\n\n\"You want to be here, you want to be with the customers, you want to help,\" she said. \"It's like a service. If you don't live to serve, you lose. Some people be a doctor, some people be a teacher, and some people be like me, a worker.\"\n\nWhile no precise data is available, at least 32 grocery workers have died of Covid-19 across the United States, according to estimates by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. At least 4,687 have tested positive for the virus or missed work because they have self-quarantined.\n\nBut those numbers are believed to be higher because major chains like Wal-Mart and Whole Foods have not made infection data public, the union said.\n\nAt City Fresh Market, part of a small chain with a dozen stores in New York City, some workers have been there for decades, instilling a sense of camaraderie among the staff.\n\nAs the store's oldest female employee and a neighborhood fixture, Ms. Nibbs is affectionately known as \"Ceci the Matriarch,\" the go-to person for virtually everything from advice on vitamins to gossip to, more recently, grim updates on who in the community had died of the coronavirus.\n\nShe marshals the other workers like a drill sergeant, trying to boost morale.\n\n\"When I arrive in the morning, I say hi to everybody, I laugh a little, and then I say 'Let's do it.' 'Ya llegu\u00e9!'\" she said. \"When I say 'Let's do it,' everybody knows I'm ready to go.\"\n\nJuan-Pablo Polanco, also known as Pablito, a tall and taciturn 66-year-old from Santo Domingo, has worked at City Fresh for 20 years after harvesting coffee in the Dominican Republic.\n\nHis wife pleaded with him to stop working. \"I told her that the rent and bills didn't pay themselves,\" he said.\n\nThe staff was terrified when Ricardo Caiche, 65, who has worked at the supermarket for 34 years, caught what everyone thought was the coronavirus. \"I was so scared,\" said Arturo Payamps, 38, the manager, clutching his chest. \"I was calling him every day.\" (Mr. Caiche had the flu and tested negative for Covid-19.)\n\nMs. Simono, one of the store's younger employees, says she misses being able to see customers' facial expressions. \"We don't get to see their smile, they don't get to see our smile,\" she said. \"Everybody is so sad.\"\n\nKenneth Santana, 34, an assistant manager, prefers staying at the supermarket longer than he needs to because, he says, it's better than the boredom of being alone at home. \"I like hanging out here,\" he said. \"At least I get to see and talk to people.\"\n\nCity Fresh sits on Knickerbocker Avenue, which threads through Bushwick and Ridgewood along Brooklyn's border with Queens. It has been a neighborhood mainstay, even as the mostly black and Latino community has started to attract newcomers moving into some of the more expensive housing that is sprouting up.\n\nGourmet butchers and coffee shops now stand on the same street as Salvadoran eateries and Mexican vendors selling steaming, homemade tamales from sidewalk carts.\n\nThe supermarket reflects some of those changes, with more organic produce and vegan items than it used to carry.\n\nIts staff of about 50 is largely immigrants, with workers from the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Honduras. Their wages start at $15 per hour and increase with more years of experience.\n\nThey said that the pandemic has made them less invisible and more appreciated, a sentiment echoed by customers like Koory Mirz, 31, a web developer.\n\n\"They're amazing. Normally we don't think of thanking people in supermarkets,\" he said as he walked the store's aisles around 1 a.m.\"I couldn't do it if my boss called me to do a shift here.\"\n\nAside from maintaining a healthy environment, a major challenge for the supermarket is keeping its shelves stocked amid increased demand. Toilet paper and disinfectants are in short supply, as well as other products that were not popular in normal times, like eucalyptus oil.\n\nOne hurdle has been getting new stock, as vendors say some of their drivers have gotten sick from the coronavirus.\n\n\"We're trying to do our best, but now it's getting complicated,\" Mr. Payamps said.\n\nA distributor recently canceled a weekly delivery of $50,000 worth of goods, including canned food and frozen items, Mr. Payamps said, because of a lack of drivers.\n\nSeveral times he has had to ask workers to drive to warehouses themselves to transport supplies, like crates of milk, because they were not being delivered.\n\nBread had also been hard to keep on the shelves, Ms. Simono said. \"It would come, but we ran out,\" she said. \"We weren't expecting so many customers getting bread.\"\n\nMr. Santana, the assistant manager, said that a month ago the store was able to get 80 percent of its orders. \"Now, it's like 40 percent.\"\n\nMr. Payamps worries what the closing of several meat plants across the county will mean for his supply of beef, chicken and pork.\n\n\"It's crunchtime,\" he said. \"The hardest stuff is about to come.\"\n\nStill, the store has hired more workers to keep shelves filled because of the influx of customers. \"If you restocked every other hour, you're restocking every 30 minutes,\" Mr. Santana said.\n\nWell before the virus started overwhelming New York, store managers got a sense of how serious the disease was from the chatter in some of the Chinese-owned stores on the block.\n\nChinese workers were sending large packages of face masks to their families in China to protect against the growing outbreak.\n\n\"If the one country that provides masks to the world has a shortage, there was going to be a shortage everywhere,\" Mr. Santana said.\n\nCity Fresh managers, in turn, began ordering them, and Mr. Payamps told his workers they had to wear masks and gloves weeks before the city made it a requirement. \"In the beginning, everybody took it as a joke,\" he said.\n\nHe also gathered workers one day in early March and urged them \"not to cough on anybody or let anybody cough on you.\"\n\nNow a professional cleaning company disinfects the store every day, and employees regularly wipe down shopping baskets. Tape has been put on the floor to turn aisles into one-way corridors and space out customers.\n\nMr. Payamps put up plastic barriers, costing at least $200 each, to separate cashiers from customers. Workers wear plastic shields in addition to face masks. And the piped-in music that usually plays is regularly interrupted by announcements admonishing customers to maintain social distancing.\n\nThe early intervention, Mr. Payamps believes, helped shield his workers even as the virus was coursing through the neighborhood.\n\nStill, one cashier, Susly Jimenez, did get sick. Though she was unable to get tested, she said she had all the symptoms of Covid-19, including a fever that started on March 25 and remained very high for several days.\n\nShe said she believes she got infected outside the supermarket because that was the only time she did not wear gloves or a mask. She regularly took a bus and the subway back and forth from her home in Maspeth, Queens.\n\n\"I panicked because I was alone and sick,\" said Ms. Jimenez, who does not have any health insurance. \"I had to keep my phone in one hand because if something happened I would have to call the emergency.\"\n\nBut her conditions eased. She was back to work this week.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWe walk the dogs across the meadow in the rain. We don't talk much. We say the same things over and over, and yet somehow there's comfort in the repetition. Yesterday someone wrote on the town listserv that certain dog owners had been spotted in the meadow less than six feet away from each other. Suddenly, everybody's a cop, yardsticks in their minds.\n\nPeople are scared, and with good reason. But distance -- the idea of distance. Were we so close to begin with? How far will we be from each other after this over? The dogs, off leash, circle back to us. I've got the sense they know what's going on, if not the particulars. But something is most definitely up. For starters, how come we're all home all the time?\n\nOther rituals emerge, some old, some new. Sitting on the porch in Phoenix. Picking the citrus trees of once-anonymous neighbors in Los Angeles. The poles are built-in social distancing. No need for the measuring tape.\n\nBelow are 13 American scenes, snapshots of neighbors finding original ways to reconnect.\n\nIt's good to walk in this rain. I'm not saying everything has become so precious these strange days. Only that you notice more, how the winter grass comes in so many shades of brown, the netless soccer goals upside down like lonely parallelograms (badly, I try and teach my kid math). And the way our talk goes nowhere but even empty words have a little more weight now, like the stones we throw when we pause at the brook.\n\n-- Peter Orner, from Norwich, Vt.\n\nLos Angeles, California\n\nThe Gleaners\n\nMichele Grey began noticing them in early April: citrus trees ripe for the picking but out of arm's reach. They studded front lawns and backyards in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, where Ms. Grey, 53, has lived for 20 years, and which she, her husband, Joaquin, and son, Lucas, have been exploring on daily walks since stay-at-home orders closed many local parks and trails.\n\nSurely, they thought, someone could benefit from this bounty of oranges and lemons, if the owners of the trees didn't want them themselves. They bought two 12-foot fruit pickers -- think back scratchers, but bigger -- and Ms. Grey went on Nextdoor, an online community message board.\n\nShe wrote that her family \"would be happy to pick your fruit,\" at no cost, \"supply you with some, donate to neighbors, and then provide some to nearby food banks.\" \"We would wear masks and gloves and keep strict social distancing,\" she added.\n\nOver the past month, the Greys have collected about 1,000 pounds of fruit, most of which they've donated to food banks. Their newfound hobby has had an unexpected byproduct -- regular meet-ups with strangers turned friends, like the Nilsson family, who live near the Greys.\n\n\"They kept to themselves, and we never socialized much with them,\" besides an occasional \"hi,\" Ms. Grey said. \"We asked if we could pick their very full tree of tangerines, they said yes, and now we're talking about seeing more of each other after this is all finished.\"\n\nThen there's the young woman who lives up the hill from the Greys. She was walking down the street when Ms. Grey drove by, oranges practically falling off the back of her pickup truck. \"I could tell that she was super-sad,\" Ms. Grey said. She pulled over and found out the woman was fresh off a breakup.\n\n\"We started talking and now we're taking oranges to her house,\" Ms. Grey said. \"We've become friends.\"\n\nThough the Greys initially used the internet to connect the citrus haves with the have-nots, they're increasingly having more luck offline. \"On our walks, I'm having massive interaction,\" said Joaquin Grey, plucking mandarins off a 30-foot tree belonging to another new acquaintance, Naomi Wong, on a recent Saturday. Before, he said, \"I never would've gone up to someone and asked if I can pick their tree.\"\n\nThe chance meetings take many forms. While her husband and son tackled the mandarin tree, Ms. Grey sorted oranges into buckets and bags on the back of the truck, pausing anytime someone walked by. \"Take as many as you want,\" she said to a man in a white face mask (he took three).\n\n\"They're a little sour, I've been told,\" she said to a man with a purple bandanna around his mouth, \"so maybe con tequila.\" He left with a bag.\n\n-- Sheila Marikar\n\nWichita, Kansas\n\nThe Slow Cruise\n\nOn a cool Saturday evening during Easter weekend, car enthusiasts and other stir-crazy Kansans resurrected an old-fashioned drag route through the middle of town.\n\nDuring the late 1800s, Douglas Avenue was the final dusty stretch of the Chisholm Trail, along which cowboys drove cattle from Texas to Kansas stockyards and railroad hubs. In the 1950s, teenagers drove Fords and Chevrolets back and forth over the same flat road through downtown and the historic Delano District, where outlaws and houses of ill repute once raised hell.\n\nThat custom fell out of fashion in the 1990s, but in recent years local breweries, boutiques, restaurants and commercial storefronts have reinvigorated the thoroughfare. Now they sit closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, casting quiet upon the economic lifeline that turned Wichita into a boomtown 150 years ago.\n\nAs the sun set on April 11, though, a procession of cars, trucks and motorcycles packed the old cruise route. Muscle-car engines revved, fire truck horns honked and small packs of bikers throttled their Harleys.\n\nHundreds of humble sedans, minivans and S.U.V.s rolled along quietly with their windows down, drivers and passengers of all ages waving at one another and shouting \"hi\" from a safe distance. At least one pair of spectators emerged from their apartment on Douglas to set up lawn chairs on the sidewalk and drink Bud Light.\n\nIt all started with a public post to a Facebook group devoted to bringing back \"dragging Douglas\" -- an isolated yet communal form of entertainment perfect for the times. \"SOCIAL DISTANCING CAR CRUISE?\" the post read. People in neighboring small towns had recently done just that, circling their own streets as if they were teenagers free after the last school bell.\n\nA Facebook event, \"Cruise Douglas -- Quarantine Edition,\" soon circulated, encouraging the community to \"go old school.\" Organizers emphasized public health: \"Due to COVID-19 we need to maintain social distancing so everyone MUST stay in their cars.\"\n\nThe event went smoothly in that regard, and Wichita police officers reportedly abstained from handing out tickets when a handful of riders aboard high-speed motorcycles illegally popped wheelies. Police ultimately blocked the street after a handful of bad actors street-raced and did burnouts.\n\n\"Everyone is scattered out now,\" someone posted to social media as the crowd dispersed just before 8 p.m. \"No well known new spot.\"\n\n-- Sarah Smarsh\n\nHouston, Texas\n\nThe Home Zoo\n\nAll too often, the condition known as \"mom brain\" gets a bad rap. Sure, it's a survival technique that can cause sensory overload, a result of too much multitasking. But sometimes it comes in really handy, like when a parent is trying to work and raise a family during a pandemic.\n\nTake as Exhibit A: Christina DeHaven, 40, who found herself trying to keep her video producing business afloat from home while also overseeing Jack, 9, and Annie, 7, while giving her husband, Matthew, who works in videoconference engineering, space and time to get his work done, too. (Anyone who asks why this was Christina's task has been living in self-isolation long before the coronavirus struck.)\n\nThe idea that gave her family much-needed breathing room came from cardboard boxes -- the ones her children often use for school projects. And from their multiple stuffed animals. And the fact that the family lives in Woodland Heights, a kid-friendly and slightly eccentric Houston neighborhood where it was virtually impossible to stay inside when the sky was crystalline and the air was still cool and jasmine-scented.\n\nWhat Ms. DeHaven came up with was: \"Hey kids, why don't you build a zoo for all our neighbors to visit?\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As many businesses open their doors around the country, some governors face growing resistance. Labs across the U.S. join a federal initiative to study the virus genome. Texas moves aggressively to restart businesses, with restaurants, malls and movie theaters all open. See more updates Updated 17m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe result took about three days. Jack and Annie researched their animals and posted signs containing five facts next to every display box hanging from the fence in their front yard.\n\nThere are cardboard cages for furry, glassy-eyed foxes, cats, dogs (\"Three dogs survived the Titanic sinking!\"), horses, penguins, bunnies, bobcats, wolves, leopards, cows and kangaroos. (\"Kangaroos are strict herbivores, however they release methane like most cattle.\")\n\nThere is also a live exhibit: tadpoles swimming in a plastic storage bin, gathered from puddles after one of Houston's typical downpours. \"People keep coming back to check on the tadpoles,\" Ms. DeHaven said. \"They want to know if they have legs yet.\"\n\nSo far, the visitors have been enthused but also well-behaved, observing social distancing. An art board for drawing more animals has been added, with disinfected Sharpies provided. \"We don't leave things out because of germs,\" Jack explained.\n\nThere was mild distress when one of the bunnies went missing. \"Let's make signs,\" Ms. DeHaven told her children.\n\nThere was some discussion about the word \"stolen\" -- Jack wanted to use it, but his mother thought that was a little harsh. \"They settled on 'Missing, Escaped or Poached,'\" Ms. DeHaven said. The original bunny never turned up, but a neighbor brought a replacement.\n\n\"He and his girlfriend put it in the bunny habitat and didn't even say anything,\" Ms. DeHaven said.\n\n-- Mimi Swartz\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFornia\n\nThe Underground Barber\n\nBehind a series of steel gates and doors sits a solitary barber's chair. The wall is covered in Los Angeles Lakers memorabilia and U.S. Marines swag like a missile launcher and some medals from the War on Terror. There are mirrors and tool boxes that have been converted to hold hair clippers.\n\nFor Angel M. and his loyal customers, this tiny trap house barbershop deep in the heart of Southeast Los Angeles makes do. Since the pandemic hit, the income helps Angel, 34, pay his mortgage and the rent on his boarded-up neighborhood shop.\n\n\"I do a client every hour, and it takes about half an hour per haircut,\" he said. \"The hour gives me enough time to take my time with the haircut but also to clean and disinfect the whole area, my tools and everything that they touch.\" He works in a mask and gloves, which might slow most people down but not a former Marine who served in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\"As a Marine, you can always adapt to anything on any level,\" he said. \"You're just used to that. So that's the easy part.\"\n\nHe said the hard part has been making the makeshift barbershop \"welcoming and comfortable\" for his clients.\n\nThree days before the official orders came down, closing all nonessential businesses, he was already planning for the worst-case scenario. He started taking parts of his barbershop home.\n\n\"I had this man cave I liked to hang out in when I wanted to get away from the house,\" said Angel, who lives with his wife and 9-year-old son. \"So I just took out my couches and put in my barber chair. And then I put in two LED lights so I can get some good lighting in there. I got an air purifier to make sure there's constant clean air.\"\n\nThough he began with select clients, Angel has expanded his list as the shutdown lingers. The more clients, the more income.\n\nMost of them are his most loyal -- what he calls \"my weeklies.\" And even though he trusts them with the secret location of his converted man cave, he makes sure to ask them if they've had any coronavirus symptoms. A few times he's had people cancel because of a cough or fever.\n\n\"It's no big deal,\" he said. \"In the military, 99 percent of the time you're doing things without knowing what you're really doing.\"\n\n-- Erick Galindo\n\n\u2767\n\nUntil routines and lives were upended, these were the people who smiled and waved from inside cars that disappeared behind automatic garage doors.\n\nphoenix, Arizona\n\nThe Porch\n\nThey emerge as the sun dips in the horizon, ushering in the cool air that tempers the spring heat in Phoenix; the first 100-degree day is only days ahead. At the foot of the hill, two sisters, ages 8 and 11, draw angels on the sidewalk outside their home. Next door, a real estate agent sips a beer from the stone bench around a fire pit that isn't lit.\n\nAt the next house over, Kathi Marston, an educator, and her partner, Mike Neill, the chief financial officer at a credit union, celebrate their back-to-back birthdays. They just turned 51 and 54. A couple -- he is Mr. Neill's best friend -- joined them on the front porch, on foldout chairs that Ms. Marston had carefully placed eight feet apart. She left the measuring tape on the floor to prove it.\n\nA neighbor up the hill rolled past the birthday party on her bike. \"Happy birthday,\" she said, a guest in an intimate party that the coronavirus pandemic has forced into full view.\n\nUntil routines and lives were upended, these were the people who smiled and waved from inside cars that disappeared behind automatic garage doors. Widespread shutdowns and social distancing have forced them out -- on to front yards and sidewalks that double as canvas and playground for their children and themselves.\n\nNeighbors get to meet neighbors they had seen before but with whom they'd exchanged few if any words. There is the couple with two daughters, known until recently by only the sparsest of details: They'd moved into the big house that replaced the old house that was razed after its original owner died.\n\nThe bike-riding neighbor pulled up outside the real estate agent's home and walked to the spot where the sidewalk meets her yard. That line of demarcation, once comfortably breached by familiar faces, is now a line that everyone knows not to cross.\n\nThey make small talk; the drawing girls' mother next door joins in from the other side of the knee-high wall that divides their properties. \"Let me go grab a drink,\" she said, returning shortly with a glass of white wine.\n\nThe neighbors sipped their drinks, talked and track the financial adviser who walked by holding his younger daughter's hands. The bike-riding neighbor introduced everybody; they'd never seen one another until then. Nobody comes near. Nobody shakes hands. That's OK.\n\nA few houses over, the birthday party carried on. Mr. Neill's best friend brought his own paper plates and cutlery in a picnic basket. Ms. Marston provided plastic cups. They raised their glasses in the air, far from one another, in a neighborhood that now feels closer than ever.\n\n-- Fernanda Santos\n\nCarrboro, North Carolina\n\nThe Cookout\n\nDowntown Carrboro is an especially strange place to be so quiet. Crowds of families, friends and co-workers aren't gathering outside the food co-op or hanging out at the coffee shop to say hello, to catch up, to make plans.\n\nThe town may be a little sleepier than neighboring Chapel Hill, home to the usually bustling University of North Carolina, but Carrboro has noise in its bones. The venerable Cat's Cradle, a regular tour stop for indie bands and bigger acts, is here. And Merge, the influential indie rock label founded by the Superchunk bandmates Mac McCaughan and Laura Ballance, once had its office in town, before relocating down the road to Durham.\n\nIf you drive away from downtown, toward Route 54, and turn off the main road down a busy side street, you'll find a smaller road called Glosson Circle. It's hidden away, lined with ranch houses shaded by just-bloomed trees. A street sign says it is a dead end.\n\nThe neighbors there are close, and many keep in touch on a group text named \"Awesome Glosson.\" When it turned out several on the street had upcoming birthdays, the neighborhood decided to find a way to celebrate.\n\nSeemingly before anything had been fully decided, on a particularly beautiful afternoon, the Awesome Glosson Block Party began. \"I'm not sure whose idea it was,\" said John Harrison, a 47-year-old musician who lives on the street. \"But like most things with us it just sort of happened.\"\n\nPeople dragged tables and chairs out to the edge of the street on both sides. In each yard, the seats spread out the way seating spreads out now: as near as can be while still safe. Grills were lit.\n\nMusic played from speakers, but then people couldn't hear each other talking across the road, so they shut it off. People ate and drank and caught up. Neighbors filtered in and out. Dogs ran in front yards. Everyone stayed close to the road so that if others happened onto their block party, they could join in.\n\nAs night came on, people set up fire pits. The party continued. The road that connected these neighbors kept them safely apart. \"There was talk of doing it again,\" Mr. Harrison said. \"We are all pretty close, but also not very organized or predictable, so who knows?\"\n\n-- Matthew Fiander\n\nChicago, Illinois\n\nThe Fishmonger\n\nSeveral weeks back, an argument broke out by the halibut at Dirk's Fish, a Chicago seafood store.\n\nChris Bray, the manager, recalled that it began when a longtime customer openly flouted the protocols of social distancing. And he didn't wear a mask.\n\nAn elderly woman, another longtime regular, let the man have it. \"'Listen, we're trying to stay six feet apart!'\" Mr. Bray remembered the woman saying, rather brusquely.\n\nThe man dismissed it: \"'We're all going to get the virus anyway!'\"\n\nSaid the woman: \"'Well, I don't want to get it from you!'\"\n\nMr. Bray rang out both customers as quickly as he could.\n\nLuckily, that situation was an anomaly for the shop, which has operated in the Lincoln Park neighborhood since 2003. Back on March 21, the state of Illinois shut down all nonessential businesses. (Seafood shops were deemed essential.) In the nearly six weeks since, Dirk's Fish has done more business than in any previous six-week period.\n\nDirk Fucik, the owner, is a gregarious presence who could pass for the Empire Carpet man. He said there have been two stages of customer behavior. During the early days of the pandemic, it was the Hoarding Phase, in which 20-pound orders of salmon weren't uncommon.\n\nFrozen tubs of lobster bisque and tuna chili were snatched up as if they were toilet paper. Customers would ask: \"How long can I keep fish?\" (Fresh salmon and halibut could stay in the fridge for up to four days; skate lasts 24 hours before it becomes ammoniated, Mr. Fucik said.)\n\nThen the Hoarding Phase gave way to the Indulgence Stage. Customers who'd order the same fish each time branched out to more exotic species. \"There aren't any restaurants open, and customers must think, 'Life's too short, let's eat well,'\" Mr. Fucik, 63, said.\n\nOn a recent morning, a steady stream of customers in masks flowed through. No fisticuffs were witnessed.\n\nMany regulars who frequented the shop said they now visited more regularly. All said supporting mom-and-pop businesses was a big reason, but there's also the routine and pre-pandemic normalcy in coming here. Here was a place to see familiar faces, chitchat about the calamitous end-times and pick up cod fillets.\n\n\"People like to say, 'Let's travel to this exotic place, let's try this new restaurant,\" said Michelle de Vlam, 60. \"In the end, you want something familiar. Something that makes you feel safe and secure during this whole horribleness.\"\n\nAnother customer, Kristyn Caliendo, 51, originally planned to have her grouper and Atlantic salmon delivered. At the last minute, she decided to take her 7-year-old, Jack, and their shepherd mix, Uma, to pick up their fish curbside.\n\n\"I've not been to a place of business since March 17,\" Ms. Caliendo said. \"I felt we needed to get out and see human faces.\"\n\n-- Kevin Pang\n\n\u2767\n\n'We asked for\n\nmasks to give to people\n\nliving outside\n\nor hurting otherwise.'\n\nCharleston, West Virginia\n\nThe Community Organizers\n\n\"When we say we're going to meet for a drop-off at a gas station, people just suddenly appear. It's like a flash mob,\" Joe Solomon said. \"We haven't seen these kind of numbers in a while.\"\n\nMr. Solomon, 37, was talking about his work with Solutions Oriented Addiction Response (SOAR), which he described as a \"ragtag community group\" that uses harm reduction -- primarily getting Narcan into the hands of those who need it -- to combat the opioid epidemic in and around Charleston, W.Va. (A native of Long Island, Mr. Solomon went to West Virginia first to fight mountaintop removal and stayed to work with addicts.)\n\nStacy Kay, 49, a harm reduction specialist with the group, said that when she drives up to the drop-off with supplies -- masks, hand sanitizer, generic Narcan, and occasionally food -- people see her and they're \"ready for a hug.\" \"We can't do that right now,\" she said. \"We're doing a lot of waving. Joe has a piece of chalk. He makes clear what six feet is.\"\n\nIn addition to their regular work, SOAR has been distributing masks donated by the West Virginia Mask Army, a group that sews masks primarily for health care workers. \"We asked for masks to give to people living outside or hurting otherwise,\" Mr. Solomon said. \"We even found an herbalist to make hand sanitizer, crucial for those without running water.\"\n\nMany people who suffer from addiction experience homelessness. And those who are homeless, Mr. Solomon pointed out, may have underlying health conditions, like diabetes and heart disease, that make them particularly susceptible to Covid-19. Not to mention that the shelters, which can be packed, were not designed with social distancing in mind.\n\nMs. Kay said she and the other outreach workers are also providing information to a population who may be unaware of the latest public health directives. Weeks after the stay-at-home order was issued, she said, \"I talked to people who didn't know.\"\n\nBoth she and Mr. Solomon noted how West Virginia is often called \"resilient.\" \"And we're called strong,\" he said. \"But those are just code words for 'nobody has our back.' So we have to have our own.\"\n\n-- Michael Parker\n\nPort Angeles, Washington\n\nThe Parking Lot\n\nMost mornings, Carrie McCaleb, a kindergarten teacher in Port Angeles, Wash., still gets dressed for school, but her classroom, for now, is her home: a fifth-wheel trailer parked in one of the more beautiful parts of the country, just outside of Olympic National Park.\n\n\"It makes for an interesting work space,\" Ms. McCaleb said. Weather permitting, she sets up a table on a level patch of grass and spreads out her work materials. Using her phone as a hotspot, she may attend a staff video call on her laptop. Then she'll log onto ClassDojo, an educational platform, to begin checking in with her students and their parents.\n\nShe attended Dry Creek, the elementary school where she works, and lives eight minutes away by car, on a horse farm owned by her mother, who is also a teacher.\n\nBefore the pandemic, she liked to be in her classroom by 6 a.m. to square away her teaching prep and lesson planning. After school, she might have gone to the gym for a long weight lifting session, or taken a hike; on weekends she'd explore more of the outdoors. On an average weekday, minus time sleeping, she guessed she spent an hour at home.\n\nNow, Ms. McCaleb, 36, is lucky to spend an hour away from it. \"It's the weirdest draining workday,\" she said. She's been able to check in with all of her students, though many of them, like her, don't have the sort of fast, unlimited internet access needed for videoconferencing.\n\nLast week, she said, was the hardest, knowing that there were at least eight more like it ahead. \"You're trudging forward into darkness,\" she said.\n\nShe occasionally gets glimpses of life before. Twice this week, she drove to Dry Creek to work from her car in the school parking lot. It's the easiest place for her to upload the videos she records for her students: roll call, word lessons, book readings.\n\nThe local library offers free Wi-Fi, turning its parking lot into an ad hoc office during the day, but it's not as speedy as the school's. Sometimes she sees other colleagues working in their cars; depending on the time of day, families may be queuing up to pick up meals.\n\nFor a while now, teachers at the school have had the option, with the principal's permission, and with careful distancing, to enter their classrooms alone. Ms. McCaleb has done so just twice: once to get school supplies ready for delivery to children at home and once to gather her own materials. \"Being in a classroom without my kindergartners in there is overwhelming still,\" she said. The times she re-entered, \"it was pretty emotional,\" she said, \"realizing you're not going to hear their laughter anymore.\"\n\n-- John Herrman\n\n\u2767\n\n'I try not to get too close\n\nbut having dogs\n\nkind of makes you\n\ninteract with people.'\n\natlanta, Georgia\n\nThe Dog Walkers\n\nFor the millions of Americans who own dogs, regular walks are one of the few parts of life untouched by the coronavirus. For Kara Welstead, who lives in a dog-filled condo building in downtown Atlanta (where I also live), taking her 12-year-old Boston terrier and 5-year-old Chihuahua mix outside allows her to stay in touch with people she may not see otherwise.\n\n\"I walk them three times a day,\" Ms. Welstead, 54, said. \"I try not to get too close but having dogs kind of makes you interact with people.\"\n\nShe's been sheltering in place since mid-March but has still been able to see neighbors like Gretchen and Billy Watts when the two are walking their dogs, a 1-year-old Great Pyrenees and a 12-year-old Lab-shepherd mix.\n\n\"I think it's nice when you have your dogs together and you can be socially connected and talk to someone and not feel awkward because you're worried about the virus,\" Mrs. Watts said.\n\nStill, the current climate doesn't come without its anxieties. An advisory issued last week by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people extend social distancing measures to their pets.\n\nMs. Welstead, an aesthetician, said it's not uncommon for strangers to approach her wanting to pet her dogs. Early last month, she and Mrs. Watts were walking their dogs to a nearby park when a man came running up.\n\n\"He was behind us and obviously wanted to talk about the dogs,\" Ms. Welstead said. \"I said 'Look, buddy. I don't know you, and I'm trying to social distance.' I felt bad, but I was trying to be responsible.\"\n\nIt turns out that she had reason to be cautious. The very next day she started feeling ill, with minor aches. Soon she was having trouble breathing. A visit to the doctor a few days later confirmed that she was fighting Covid-19.\n\nThe Wattses helped by taking her dogs for walks.\n\n\"Billy and Gretchen were so great,\" she said. \"They'd just come to the door and take the dogs out for me, then bring them back.\"\n\nEventually, Ms. Welstead got so sick that she had to completely isolate herself and board her dogs. \"It was so weird not having them here for 10 days,\" she said.\n\nShe is on the mend now with only a cough and the occasional shortness of breath, and her dogs are back home.\n\nMs. Welstead is self-quarantining just to be safe; she wears a mask in public, and avoids her building's elevator. \"I don't want to be too close to anyone just yet,\" she said.\n\n-- Donovan X. Ramsey\n\nWise River, Montana\n\nThe River\n\nThere is perhaps no outdoor pastime better suited to isolation than early-spring fly fishing on Montana's thousands of miles of rivers and streams. The waters these days are often high and muddy, and it's frequently too cold for fish to rise, but that hasn't stopped people.\n\nOld-timers will tell you the sport itself is built around solace and done best alone. The last thing you want when fly fishing is another person right next to you, trying to fish the same hole.\n\nKeeping space is rarely an issue, said Craig Fellin, 73, who opened the Big Hole Lodge in Wise River in 1984. His preferred distance from others while fly fishing? Half a mile. He's not kidding.\n\nOf course there are moments where people meet, at boat ramps and passing as they float down the water, stopping to chat about the weather and the bug hatch. It's not an antisocial sport, but it is far removed from the daily news churn, distant and focused on the task at hand.\n\nMr. Fellin prefers to wade in the water rather than fish from a boat, so he can take his time, read the fish and see what they may be feeding on.\n\n\"I like to feel the current against my legs, and I like to study the water and figure out where I think the fish are and try to match the hatch,\" he said. \"I like to get my insect net out and catch some of those little guys and try to imitate them.\"\n\n\"When you catch one that way, it gives you a little more satisfaction of what you're doing and makes the whole day.\"\n\nFishing such a part of the culture in Montana, the state's wildlife agency released social \"fishtancing\" guidelines early on in the crisis, measured in some of the most recognizable species.\n\nSix feet in this state equals four trout, two shovelnose sturgeon, one paddlefish or a fishing rod.\n\nThe governor of Montana recently announced plans to lift stay-at-home orders and gradually reopen businesses, but there's no date on when he may cancel a mandatory 14-day quarantine on out-of-state visitors, who make up a large part of Mr. Fellin's business.\n\nStill, Mr. Fellin described a perfect outing this week with his son and future daughter-in-law. Nobody caught a fish.\n\n-- Kathleen McLaughlin\n\nSavannah, Georgia\n\nThe Driveway\n\nDawn Brown hunched over her walkway and sketched the boundary lines with a piece of orange chalk.\n\nSix feet apart, the lines complemented the cones lining the footpath. The multicolored markers led from the curb above East 57th Street in Savannah, Ga., to the BowTie Barbecue Co. food truck parked in her driveway.\n\nSince March 23, Ms. Brown, a fourth-grade teacher, has hosted food trucks 13 times, she said a half-hour later, flipping through a calendar inside her home.\n\n\"Six different trucks now,\" said Ms. Brown, 48. \"I'm getting better at it every time I do it.\" She's learned to host a truck once every four days -- to give neighbors time to use up their groceries and tire of cooking -- and to allow a couple of weeks before inviting the same truck back, because people need variety.\n\nOutside, Grayson Lowenthal, of BowTie, sat on a bar stool in the shade of the truck. Masked, he wielded an iPad, taking orders from customers, some holding plants.\n\nAcross the street, pots of elephant ears, crinum lilies and Lucifer's Tongue lined the curb in front of Stephanie Hendrick's home. A paper sign taped to the bed of a truck directed questions to her and Ms. Brown.\n\n\"We were brainstorming and we're like, 'What if we do a plant swap, and maybe that'll bring more people here,'\" Ms. Hendrick said. \"And they'll be like, 'Well, I'm already here, I don't want to cook tonight,' because who isn't sick of cooking?\"\n\n\"Get a plant and a sandwich,\" said Ms. Hendrick, 37, a restaurant manager. \"And then you go home, and you've got a project for the next day.\"\n\nBy 5:15 p.m., the shadow of the tall palm in Ms. Brown's yard stretched farther to the east. The wind had picked up, occasionally scattering the cones near the food truck. In less than 24 hours, Georgia restaurants would be allowed to host eat-in customers, part of Gov. Brian Kemp's push to reopen the state's economy -- a decision that worries local leaders like Van Johnson, the mayor of Savannah.\n\nMr. Lowenthal, 24, who grew up bottling barbecue sauce, said he'd done about $500 worth of sales. During the past month, he'd taken the food truck wherever he could, up the road to Pooler, out to Whitemarsh Island, over to Isle of Hope.\n\nThe truck, he said, is a \"game changer\": promoting social distancing while helping keep the business afloat.\n\nIt was his third time in Ms. Brown's driveway. \"I love this spot,\" he said.\n\n-- Wade Livingston\n\n\u2767\n\nAn 'act of social solidarity'\n\non darkened streets.\n\nmillburn, New Jersey\n\nThe Porch Lights\n\nOn April 3 Millburn, N.J., reported its first known coronavirus-related death, a person the township described as \"a resident in their 80s.\"\n\nThat day was also the start of an initiative to help move the town away from its lockdown gloom: \"Light Up the Night.\" In a letter to the community, Mayor Jackie Benjamin Lieberberg urged residents to turn on their front porch lights, shine a flashlight or illuminate whatever is at their disposal. \"It will be an act of social solidarity,\" she wrote.\n\nWhether the solidarity she was encouraging caught fire was hard to determine on a recent Friday night. Many of the township's majestic colonials and historic Tudors were lit, beacon-like, from top to bottom, but that may have been their everyday lighting. Other houses stood dark on streets hushed by quarantine. A pair of dog walkers hadn't heard of the initiative, but said they liked the idea.\n\nOn winding Meadowbrook Road and several other streets in the township's affluent Short Hills section, a few attempts to Light Up the Night seemed obvious. One stately home set a single lit candle in its picture window; at another, fairy lights twinkled through two front-yard trees.\n\nNear Elmwood Place, a triple strand of white Christmas lights hung above a front door. Around the corner, one home shined an up light on an American flag, while another set a slender lit lamp in an upstairs window.\n\nDowntown, along the once bustling and now desolate Millburn Avenue, restaurant and shop lights hinted at dinners and outfits to look forward to once the public health threat subsides and restrictions are eased.\n\nLandscape lighting at nearby residences illuminated rainbow lawn signs thanking health care and other essential workers. A marquee outside Millburn High School that might normally display prom reminders at this time of year had been repurposed. \"Keep calm, keep cool, keep collected,\" it read.\n\n-- Tammy La Gorce",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe first female federal prisoner to die after contracting the coronavirus was a 30-year-old mother who had just weeks earlier given birth while on a ventilator.\n\nThe woman, Andrea Circle Bear, of Eagle Butte, S.D., was sentenced in January to serve 26 months in prison for using a residence on the Cheyenne River Indian Reservation to sell drugs in 2018. She admitted that she had sold $850 worth of methamphetamine to a buyer who was later revealed to be a confidential informant, according to court documents.\n\nOn March 20, Ms. Circle Bear was transferred from a jail in Winner, S.D., to Federal Medical Center Carswell, a prison that holds about 1,625 female prisoners in Fort Worth. She was immediately placed into quarantine, the federal Bureau of Prisons said in a statement, in line with the agency's new policy to reduce the risk of inmates contracting the virus from a new arrival.\n\nBecause of concerns about her pregnancy, Ms. Circle Bear was admitted to a hospital about a week later, on March 28, but she was sent back to the prison later that day.\n\nThree days later, Ms. Circle Bear developed a fever, a dry cough and more possible coronavirus symptoms, and was taken back to the hospital, where she was placed on a ventilator, a sign that she was struggling to breathe on her own. The next day, on April 1, her baby was born by cesarean section. The judge who sentenced Ms. Circle Bear had said in court documents that her baby was due in early May.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Wall Street and White House embrace optimism as death toll continues to rise.

She died on Tuesday, more than three weeks later.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons said Ms. Circle Bear had a pre-existing medical condition that could worsen coronavirus symptoms. Her family and her former lawyer did not immediately return calls seeking comment, but advocates of prison reform questioned why she was being held in a prison in the first place.\n\n\"Not every prison death is avoidable, but Andrea Circle Bear's certainly seems to have been -- she simply should not have been in a federal prison under these circumstances,\" Kevin Ring, president of Families Against Mandatory Minimums, said in a statement. \"Her death is a national disgrace, and I hope it is a wake-up call.\"\n\nThe coronavirus has ravaged prisons across the United States, and eight of the nation's 10 largest coronavirus clusters were in prisons or jails as of Wednesday evening, according to The New York Times's tally of cases.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons, which oversees the imprisonment of about 142,000 people, has reported that 1,534 inmates and 343 staff members have tested positive for the coronavirus, and that 31 inmates have died. But a vast majority of incarcerated people are held at state prisons and local jails. At least 12,000 inmates have tested positive in state prisons, and more than 150 people have died.\n\nSenator Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said in a statement that Ms. Circle Bear's death showed the need for federal authorities to do more to keep prisoners from getting the coronavirus. Mr. Durbin and other lawmakers have urged officials at the Justice Department, which oversees the Bureau of Prisons, to allow some sick and older inmates to serve their terms in home confinement.\n\n\"Andrea Circle Bear committed a low-level nonviolent drug offense, but she did not deserve to die,\" Mr. Durbin said, adding that her child did not deserve to lose a mother.\n\nVice News reported on Wednesday night that the president of the union for correctional officers at the Fort Worth prison had filed a whistle-blower complaint this month, in which she wrote that the medical center \"knowingly and willingly misled the public,\" placing inmates and staff members at risk.\n\nThe letter, addressed to Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, came just after Ms. Circle Bear tested positive, and it claimed that the Bureau of Prisons had provided \"a false perception to the American people\" about the steps it was taking to keep inmates and correctional officers safe.\n\nTimothy Williams contributed reporting.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nHobbled by government scandal and dysfunction at the start of the pandemic, Puerto Rico has done tests to diagnose the coronavirus at a far lower rate than anywhere else in the United States, a situation that public health experts fear could leave the island uniquely vulnerable once it attempts to reopen.\n\nPuerto Rico has performed an average of 15 coronavirus tests a day for every 100,000 people, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a rate lower than any state and more than 10 times less comprehensive than the testing effort in New York.\n\nMore than in other places where testing has been insufficient, experts say that the huge lag has left Puerto Rico blind to where it lies on its infection curve.\n\nThe lack of data makes it difficult to know when to ease Puerto Rico's lockdown, one of the strictest in the country, which has kept hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with Covid-19 patients but has also required much sacrifice from Puerto Ricans enduring the 14th year of an economic recession. Already this year they survived a flurry of earthquakes that left some people effectively homeless for months.\n\n\"Everything has been delay and disorganization,\" said Dr. Carlos Mellado, a physician in San Juan, the capital, who has been treating patients with the virus. \"We're still under a complete lockdown. People are starting to get desperate.\"\n\nEven the scant number of total tests, 11,848 as of Tuesday on an island with a population of nearly 3.2 million, is an overcount: A person who tested positive for coronavirus antibodies in a finger-prick blood test and then took a nasal-swab test for confirmation would have been counted twice.\n\nDr. Lorenzo Gonz\u00e1lez, Puerto Rico's health secretary -- the third person in that position since the pandemic began -- has promised to scrub the data to separate the commingled results.\n\n\"The Department of Health needs to step up to the plate,\" Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez acknowledged in a phone interview.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Congress reaches a deal with the White House on a relief package. Trump says he will suspend immigration, but provides few details about the plan. The record oil market collapse is continuing. See more updates Updated 1m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nMiscounting is particularly delicate in Puerto Rico, where the government took nearly a year to acknowledge that an estimated 2,975 people died after Hurricane Maria in 2017.\n\nThe double counting of coronavirus cases, revealed on Friday by Puerto Rico's Center for Investigative Journalism, was only the latest controversy to hit the government. The former health secretary was removed on March 13 after initially downplaying the virus. His interim replacement stepped down 13 days later. The chief epidemiologist also resigned.\n\nDr. Gonz\u00e1lez took over on March 26 and soon afterward disclosed to El Nuevo D\u00eda, Puerto Rico's largest newspaper, that the department had previously entered into a $38 million contract for one million antibody tests with Apex General Contractors, a small but politically connected local construction company that had no experience in selling medical supplies. The federal control board that has overseen Puerto Rico's finances since the territory effectively declared bankruptcy in 2017 was not consulted.\n\nThe department paid $19 million but the tests never materialized. The department canceled the contract and asked for its money back. The deal is now under investigation by the Puerto Rico House of Representatives. Several federal agencies, including the F.B.I., the Food and Drug Administration and the Office of the Inspector General, have also requested contract records, Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez said.\n\nSenator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, sent Gov. Wanda V\u00e1zquez a sharply toned letter on Monday demanding answers \"as we examine continued aid for Puerto Rico.\"\n\n\"It appears that procurement and contracting in Puerto Rico often passes through a filter of political connections before resources intended for the people of Puerto Rico actually reach them and achieve the intended use, depriving the people of Puerto Rico the primacy that they deserve,\" he wrote.\n\nMs. V\u00e1zquez said she would have preferred he reach out directly \"before attacking the people of Puerto Rico for situations that are replicated in other jurisdictions of the United States or foreign governments.\"\n\nThe latest scandal has consumed the government, diverting attention from the paucity of diagnostic tests, said Daniel Col\u00f3n-Ramos, a neuroscience and cell biology professor at Yale University who is Puerto Rican and has been working to increase testing. Antibody tests are important, if flawed, for monitoring the virus, but they are most effective when deployed once epidemiologists have a better grasp of how many people are sick.\n\n\"We're squandering the time away,\" Dr. Col\u00f3n-Ramos said. \"There's insufficient testing, and then there's insufficient testing. The word 'insufficient' is insufficient to capture it.\"\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency sent 15 machines last week to quickly process diagnostic tests in hospitals. But Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez said Puerto Rico has only enough reagents, the chemical ingredients needed to process the tests, for a single machine to work for one full day.\n\nThe island was one of the first places to order a serious lockdown, shutting down the economy, closing beaches and imposing a nighttime curfew in mid-March. It has seen more than 1,200 cases of the coronavirus so far, and 64 people have died. Not all of them were tested.\n\nThe health department does not know how many cases exist at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities, Dr. Gonz\u00e1lez said. Over the next three weeks, the department plans to do antibody testing at some 28,000 residents and 9,000 staff at 1,000 long-term facilities.\n\nThe youngest person to die so far has been a 29-year-old man identified by his father as Joshua James S\u00e1nchez. He went to the emergency room twice with symptoms and was denied a test until the third time, when he was already in respiratory distress, his father, Luis \u00c1ngel S\u00e1nchez, wrote on Facebook. The elder Mr. S\u00e1nchez wrote that his own father also succumbed to the virus.\n\n\"You cannot understand this pain unless you experience it,\" he wrote. \"And I don't wish this disastrous experience on anybody.\"\n\nMichelle Garc\u00eda Mercado, a 23-year-old college student from Caguas, said her father struggled to get tested after learning that a co-worker had tested positive. Her father first had to test negative for flu and bacterial pneumonia.\n\n\"They told him to stay home,\" she said.\n\nHer father got a test only after coming down with body aches. While they awaited the results, Ms. Garc\u00eda, who helps care for her grandfather and feared she might be a virus carrier, tried to get tested herself but was turned away because she did not have symptoms. Her father's result came back negative.\n\nFrustration over the slow testing has prompted some Puerto Ricans to protest from their balconies with pots and pans and from their cars in drive-by caravans. On social media, they address the governor with #WandaLasPruebas, demanding more tests. Some of the same activists led the protests that ousted former Gov. Ricardo A. Rossell\u00f3 last summer.\n\n\"People are tired already of sitting at home without clear information,\" said Zoan D\u00e1vila, 31, a lawyer from Cayey who is a member of the Colectiva Feminista en Construcci\u00f3n, which organized a protest last week. \"They don't trust the state and what it is doing.\"\n\nPhysicians and public health experts have praised the rigid lockdown that Ms. V\u00e1zquez ordered on March 15, before that of any state and most cities, as crucial to protecting Puerto Rico's fragile health care system, which was severely strained by Hurricane Maria. It has also long suffered from a disparity in federal health care funding and from a loss of doctors and nurses to more lucrative jobs in the states.\n\nPuerto Ricans are under a nightly curfew, and during the day they can leave their homes only to work in essential businesses; get food, medicine or gas; or go to to the bank or to doctors' appointments.\n\nTesting capacity has slowly improved. Private labs have made progress in part because more than a dozen scientists from the nonprofits CienciaPR and the Puerto Rico Science, Technology & Research Trust, including Dr. Col\u00f3n-Ramos, meet via Zoom several times a week to troubleshoot problems, with little government help or coordination.\n\nResources tend to be scarce, but Puerto Rico once had a thriving pharmaceutical and medical supply industry fueled by U.S. tax breaks and still has an arsenal of researchers.\n\nWhen labs needed nasal swabs, Riccardo Papa, an associate biology professor at the University of Puerto Rico in R\u00edo Piedras, who is Italian, emailed an executive at Copan Industries, an Italian swab manufacturer with a plant in Aguadilla, P.R. The company donated 20,000 swabs.\n\nWith reagents in short supply, Marcos L\u00f3pez, an assistant chemistry professor at the University of Puerto Rico at Humacao, worked with colleagues in Massachusetts and Nebraska to stretch the chemicals by figuring out how to test samples in pools, rather than individually.\n\nAnd when labs needed more of the buffer required to transport the swabs for processing, Kenira Thompson, president of the Ponce Research Institute, an arm of the Ponce Health Sciences University, had her lab find the recipe and make the buffer.\n\nShe also telephoned an American reagent supplier that listed Puerto Rico as one of its clients in Latin America and reminded the company that the island should instead be given the same priority as other parts of the United States.\n\n\"You need to have easy testing,\" Dr. Thompson said. \"You need to have hospitals with the capacity to treat all the patients without being in crisis mode. And then you go into the contact tracing and all the other things. We are not there yet.\"\n\nEdmy Ayala contributed reporting.",

        "body": "By The New York Times News Service Syndicate | wordpress@medianewsgroup.com |\n\nA pug in North Carolina named Winston has tested positive for the coronavirus in what is apparently the first known case in which the virus was detected in a dog in the United States, researchers at Duke University said Tuesday.\n\nThe dog belongs to a Chapel Hill family participating in a research study at the university, in which researchers were trying to understand how humans respond to different types of infection. Three of the family members, Dr. Heather McLean, Dr. Samuel McLean and their son Ben McLean, were also infected by the virus.\n\nThe dog's symptoms lasted only a few days and were mild, according to members of the family -- he was sluggish, sneezing and breathing heavily. Most telling of all, they said, he didn't finish breakfast one morning.\n\nWinston's preliminary test results, if confirmed by the U.S. Agriculture Department, will raise broader questions about how susceptible animals are to the coronavirus. Experts have said that there is no evidence that pets can transmit the virus to people, and that people should not worry about giving the virus to their pets.\n\nDr. John Howe, president of the American Veterinary Medical Association, said Winston could have licked something or someone with the virus, causing him to test positive, but that did not mean that the virus was in his bloodstream.\n\nPugs sneeze every day, and not finishing a meal doesn't sound concerning, Howe added.\n\n\"I don't believe he was truly infected -- you would need to do an antibody test,\" he continued, adding that it is important that people provide their pets with love and care.\n\n\"Your pets are not going to catch it from you,\" he said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends treating pets as you would your human relatives. They should be isolated from any sick family members and should steer clear from interacting with people outside.\n\nOf the family pets tested, Winston, who is 2, was the only one to test positive. Both Otis, 13, the older of the McLeans's two pugs, and Mr. Nibs, a 12-year-old tabby cat, tested negative. (The family also has a lizard, which was not tested.) WRAL, a North Carolina television station, first reported the results.\n\nThe McLeans said that if any of their pets tested positive, it would definitely be Winston. He is the most cuddly of the lot. He sleeps in bed with Heather and Samuel McLean, both medical doctors. And he hasn't exactly been social distancing from members of his family, who said they did not think a dog could catch the virus.\n\n\"We constantly snuggle with him, putting his face in our face,\" Ben McLean, 20, said. \"When we put all our plates in the dishwasher, he perches on the dishwasher and licks some of the plates.\"\n\nTheir daughter, Sydney McLean, 17, who is the only member of the family who has tested negative for the virus, helped hold the animals while the researchers were taking the samples.\n\nDr. Chris Woods, head of a Duke University research team that is focusing on the coronavirus, said that researchers found a low amount of virus in the pug's saliva. \"If you've ever seen a pug, they've got a big old tongue and are touching things, so it's not all that surprising that that happened,\" he said. Some of Winston's symptoms were similar to human symptoms, like difficulty breathing.\n\nThere's no evidence that dogs can transmit the virus to humans, Woods said, adding that the detection of the virus won't affect how he interacted with his own dog, a basset hound. \"They are serving such an important role in our mental health in our households at the moment,\" he said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Agriculture Department said that the agency was aware of the report and was following up, but that it had not yet confirmed the test results. If confirmed, Winston would be the first official case of a dog testing positive for the coronavirus in the United States.\n\nWinston is among the first of a small number of both dogs and cats that have tested positive for the coronavirus. One of two dogs in Hong Kong that tested positive, a 17-year-old Pomeranian, died, although its ongoing health issues were probably responsible for the death, rather than the coronavirus, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association, a group representing U.S. veterinarians.\n\nA cat in Hong Kong, a cat in Belgium and two cats in New York have also tested positive, the group said. In one of the New York cases, the owner had tested positive for the virus, while in the other, no human in the household had tested positive. The group said it did not have any information that suggested that pets might infect humans.\n\nA tiger at the Bronx Zoo also tested positive for the coronavirus, probably contracting it from a zoo employee, the Agriculture Department said this month. Although only one tiger was tested, the department said, the virus appeared to have infected other animals as well. Several lions and tigers showed symptoms, but they were expected to recover.\n\nWinston, these days, is back to his usual self, Heather McLean said. He takes long walks, naps and plays with his favorite toy, Lambie. \"We have all recovered,\" Ben McLean said, \"including Winston.\"",

        "body": "When the pandemic struck, the majority of the nation's nursing homes were losing money, some were falling into disrepair, and others were struggling to attract new occupants, leaving many of them ill equipped to protect workers and residents as the coronavirus raged through their properties.\n\nTheir troubled state was years in the making. Decades of ownership by private equity and other private investment firms left many nursing homes with staggering bills and razor-thin margins, while competition from home care attendants and assisted-living facilities further gutted their business. Even so, many of their owners still found creative ways to wring profits out of them, according to an analysis of federal and state data by The New York Times.\n\nIn many cases, investors created new companies to hold the real estate assets because the buildings were more valuable than the businesses themselves, especially with fewer nursing homes being built. Sometimes, investors would buy a nursing home from an operator only to lease back the building and charge the operator hefty management and consulting fees. Investors also pushed nursing homes to buy ambulance transports, drugs, ventilators and other products or services at above-market rates from other companies they owned.\n\nThese strategies paid off handsomely for investors, but they forced nursing homes to skimp on quality. For instance, for-profit nursing homes -- roughly 70 percent of the country's 15,400 nursing homes and often owned by private investors -- disproportionately lag behind their nonprofit counterparts across a broad array of measures for quality, The Times found. Also, they are cited for violations at a higher rate than nonprofit facilities.\n\nThe toll of putting profits first started to show when the outbreak began. No nursing home could be completely prepared for a pandemic as devastating as Covid-19, but some for-profit homes were particularly ill equipped and understaffed, which undercut their ability to contain the spread of the coronavirus, according to interviews with more than a dozen nursing home workers and elder-care lawyers.\n\nThe pandemic \"has brought a lot of these issues to the forefront,\" said David Grabowski, professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School. \"With this huge health crisis and economic downturn, we are all of a sudden seeing how risky it is to have the ownership split between the real estate side that has the most valuable asset and the operator, who is left with much less.\"\n\nControlling the real estate gives investors, including real estate investment trusts, leverage to raise rents. Separating the real estate from the operating business can also help limit liability in wrongful-death lawsuits, because the latter typically has little cash and few assets.\n\n\"The structure is designed to keep liability on the company that has the fewest assets and the most debt,\" said William Murray, a plaintiffs lawyer who specializes in suing nursing homes.\n\nPrivate equity firms and other investors first gravitated to nursing homes more than a decade ago, betting that aging baby boomers would create demand irrespective of economic cycles and counting on a steady stream of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements.\n\nLatest Updates: Economy The S.B.A. is now blocking most new applicants for a small-business loan program.

See more updates Updated 6m ago More live coverage: Global U.S. New York\n\nA recent report on private equity buyouts of nursing homes, which studied 119 transactions from 2000 to 2017, said private equity owners tended to put \"high-powered profit maximizing incentives\" first. The researchers found that after private equity stepped in, nursing staff hours per patient fell 2.4 percent, and staff quality as measured by federal regulators fell 3.6 percent.\n\n\"The quality of care declines after the private equity buyout, which seems to reflect staffing cuts,\" said one of the report's authors, Sabrina T. Howell, assistant professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of Business.\n\nRuthie Moore, a 68-year-old certified nursing assistant who works at Burbank Rehabilitation Center, a for-profit nursing home in Illinois owned by a prominent local investor, said she had been overwhelmed with patients even before the pandemic. The facility provided below-average staffing that was also highly inconsistent, records show. On some days, there was one certified nursing assistant for every 10 residents, according to payroll records. On other days, there was one for every 19.\n\nThings got much worse when the virus hit, Ms. Moore said. Residents, including ones with possible symptoms of Covid-19, were mixing with other patients. Personal protective equipment was scarce, and members of the staff were told to wear the same mask for up to two weeks, she said.\n\nSix residents of the Burbank facility have died of Covid-19 and 41 others have fallen sick, according to local reports citing state health officials. The facility gets a one-star rating -- the lowest ranking in the federal government's five-star rating system for nursing home care. In a document filed with federal regulators for 2018, Burbank's operator listed assets of $4.4 million and liabilities of $10 million.\n\n\"Had we had more staff and protective equipment, there would have been fewer deaths,\" said Ms. Moore, who recently began showing symptoms and is awaiting a diagnosis.\n\nBurbank's owner is a Chicago-area investor, William Rothner. He and his family run a network of companies that have stakes -- owning a piece of either the operating business or the building -- in at least 60 nursing homes across the country, according to disclosures and other documents. Companies owned by Mr. Rothner also provide ventilators, pharmaceuticals, management services and payroll services to many of those facilities, according to financial filings with Illinois.\n\nMost of the nursing homes in which Mr. Rothner has an interest in Illinois reported a net loss from operations in 2018, regulatory filings show. For instance, the Parc at Joliet, which has had at least seven coronavirus-related deaths, reported an operating loss of $714,000. But other companies that Mr. Rothner owns charged the home $1.4 million in rent as well as $138,000 in professional fees and $335,000 in fees to an affiliated pharmaceutical supply company, among other charges, according to those filings.\n\nMr. Rothner said in an email that there had been no \"recent citations for inadequate staffing\" and \"no valid assertions or claims on inadequate P.P.E.\" at Burbank. He also said his firm, Altitude Health Services, monitored management fees taken by the separate firms that run the nursing homes to make sure they were not excessive. He added that his firm provided ancillary services at competitive prices that were often lower than other companies and complied with all regulations.\n\nMr. Rothner's company also owns the buildings for two nursing homes in Sussex County, N.J., where more than 60 residents have died of Covid-19 and where 17 of the bodies were hidden in a small on-site morgue. His company leases the facilities for about $8 million a year to Alliance Healthcare, which runs the nursing homes.\n\nThe nursing home industry is pushing for broad immunity in the wake of the pandemic. So far, 16 states, including New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Georgia and Illinois, have already approved measures granting immunity from lawsuits -- a development that worries longtime critics of the industry.\n\n\"A lot of these nursing homes are trying to get immunity because of Covid, and that is really scary because some of these companies are so negligent,\" said Charlene Harrington, a professor emerita of nursing at the University of California, San Francisco. Many for-profit nursing home operators report meager profits only because income is \"drained off in their management contracts,\" she said.\n\nNot all nursing home buyouts have worked well for private equity firms. In 2018, HCR ManorCare, which was the nation's second-largest nursing home operator, filed for bankruptcy protection -- a decade after the Carlyle Group, a big private equity firm, acquired it. When it filed, ManorCare had $7.1 billion in debt, and its facilities had racked up numerous citations for failure to treat infections and properly monitor residents' medications, records show.\n\nYears before ManorCare declared bankruptcy, Carlyle sold the homes for $6.1 billion to a real estate investment trust, a move that largely wiped out the debt of the nursing homes. ManorCare then rented many of those facilities.\n\nIn November, Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Sherrod Brown of Ohio sent letters to four private equity firms, including Carlyle, seeking information about their involvement with nursing homes. Carlyle, in its response to the two Democrats, said that patient care had not been affected during the bankruptcy and that all employees were paid. A spokeswoman for Carlyle, which no longer owns any nursing homes in the United States, declined to comment.\n\nA representative for Ms. Warren said that only Formation Capital, an Atlanta private equity firm that specializes in nursing home investments, hadn't responded.\n\nFormation led the buyout of Genesis Healthcare, the nation's largest nursing home operator, in 2007; Genesis returned to the public markets seven years later. The private equity firm has a consulting arm that sells services to nursing homes, including some that Formation owns or has a financial interest in.\n\nFormation has said in a filing that it had policies \"that are intended to mitigate this potential conflict of interest.\" The firm did not respond to requests for comment.",

        "body": "Even if you're meeting online, interviewing a therapist can help you determine whether or not the therapy is a good fit.\n\nFrom anxiety and loneliness to trauma and grief, the coronavirus pandemic is rattling our psychological well-being. According to a poll conducted in April by the Kaiser Family Foundation, 54 percent of women and 37 percent of men say the pandemic is worsening their mental health. Concerns about family members getting sick, economic instability and job loss were the survey respondents' top worries.\n\nIn this tangle of stress, a growing number of people may turn to a therapist for guidance. Your first appointment with a new therapist can be stressful itself, and these days many of these meetings are taking place by phone or video, which may make it harder to connect than in a face-to-face meeting. But as with an in-person session, patients should be prepared to ask therapists questions to help figure out if they are a good fit.\n\nResearch has shown that interviewing a prospective therapist can help patients determine whether or not the therapy is right for them. As behavioral researchers have found, queries are the building blocks of connection and conversation. Answers to questions can also reveal how it feels to interact with someone new. And when it comes to therapy, research indicates that therapist and patient compatibility plays a significant role in treatment success.\n\nHere are some questions to get you started.\n\nWhat's your professional background?\n\nFirst, ask about the therapist's educational background and licensure. Licensed therapists are familiar with ethical guidelines, such as maintaining patient confidentiality, maintaining boundaries and practicing within the scope of their expertise.\n\nIt is also useful to ask about the session fee and whether or not the therapist accepts insurance or offers a reduced rate.\n\nTherapy is a broad term, which can imply that all mental health professionals provide similar services. However, they vary in their education, training and ability to prescribe medication. For example, psychiatrists are medical doctors who prescribe medication to treat symptoms of mental illnesses like generalized anxiety, bipolar disorder and major depression. Psychotherapists hold a doctorate or a master's degree. Unlike psychiatrists, they do not prescribe medication; instead, they use \"talk therapy\" to help patients overcome their struggles.\n\nWhat's your treatment approach?\n\nCollective traumas and tragedies can affect our mental health in myriad ways. A recent survey conducted in China found that nearly 35 percent of respondents experienced panic disorder, depression or phobias related to the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Health experts warn of dangers of reopening the country too soon. Cal State will not hold in-person classes this fall. Testing, vaccines and delayed guidance: highlights from Tuesday's Senate testimony. See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"For any given problem, several treatments can work,\" said Joshua K. Swift, a clinical psychology professor and researcher at Idaho State University. Because of this, \"all prospective patients should inquire about the therapist's treatment approach and whether or not there's evidence it works.\" How each therapist answers this question is often guided by their clinical style.\n\nFor example, psychodynamic and depth-oriented clinicians often help patients unearth insight about the source of their suffering. For those struggling with concerns like relationship woes, difficult family dynamics or grief, psychodynamic therapy can be particularly useful.\n\nCognitive-behavioral therapists often see emotional distress as a result of misguided thinking. Focusing on symptom management, these therapists rely on behavioral strategies, such as mood tracking and cognitive exercises, to invoke change. Patients experiencing acute anxiety, insomnia or eating disorders, for example, may find this approach helpful.\n\nTrauma-informed psychotherapists use methods like eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy, and somatic experiencing to help a patient process painful emotions using a body-based approach.\n\nIn addition to learning about the therapist's technique, asking how they measure progress and what success they've had treating patients with similar concerns are also useful questions to ask, Dr. Swift said.\n\nWhat types of patients do you enjoy working with?\n\nOpen-ended questions, such as \"What types of patients do you enjoy working with?\" can yield useful information about the therapist's preference and interpersonal style.\n\nFor instance, a therapist may respond by saying, \"I'll answer your question, but before I do, I'm curious what my answer might mean to you?\" Others may depict their \"ideal\" patient by describing who they enjoy working with and why. In some cases, therapists may see the question as an opportunity to ask the patient, \"What type of therapist are you looking for?\"\n\nRegardless of the therapist's answer, patients should pay attention to how the response makes them feel. Psychotherapy researchers have found that effective therapists convey understanding, authenticity and expertise. During the first meeting, these qualities can help solidify a collaborative union between the patient and therapist.\n\nHow will I know if therapy is working?\n\nWhen suffering is immense, especially during and following a crisis, people long for relief. However, therapy doesn't immediately lift one's pain. Indeed, talking about one's pain may feel hard at first, at least temporarily. How soon treatment begins to work often depends on the severity of the problem and the amount of past adversity the patient has experienced.\n\nDistress brought on by the pandemic can come in various shapes and sizes. For some, situational difficulties, such as working from home, home schooling or being an essential worker, can bring immense stress. Patients with these challenges may benefit from time-limited or brief psychotherapy, according to the American Psychological Association.\n\nThose struggling with more acute problems, such as the unexpected death of a loved one, unresolved childhood trauma or post-traumatic stress disorder, may need ongoing care until the traumas are worked through.\n\nResearch suggests that effective therapists provide an explanation for the patient's suffering, discuss how therapy works and ask for feedback. Of course, each patient's situation is unique, and as therapy unfolds, goals can change.\n\nAfter interviewing your future therapist, ask yourself: \"What's my gut feeling tell me about this person?\" said Benjamin Lipton, an A.E.D.P. psychotherapist in New York. If something feels amiss, honor your experience and ask follow-up questions.\n\nA therapist may have pristine qualifications and glowing online reviews, but if the interaction feels off-putting, it's unlikely that trust and safety will be established. In the end, these two ingredients are essential in any new relationship, including the one with your therapist.\n\nSome resources:\n\nNational Alliance on Mental Illness Covid-19 Resource Guide.\n\nCovid Coach: a free mobile app developed by the National Center for P.T.S.D.

        "body": "Long dissatisfied with the doctor treating his diabetes, Reginald Relf decided to fight through whatever was causing his nagging cough. But then his temperature spiked and his breathing became so labored that he reluctantly took his sister's advice to visit a doctor.\n\nThe staff at an urgent care clinic in suburban Chicago sent him home, without testing him for Covid-19 but after advising him to quarantine.\n\nSo Mr. Relf, a 50-year-old African-American engineer, settled into his mother's basement. A week later, after he was found dead, his sister, Ami Relf, was left shaken.\n\n\"When I finally get him to go to seek help, he's turned away,\" she said. \"If he was a middle-aged white woman, would they have turned her away? Those are questions that haunt me.\"\n\nThe coronavirus has left tens of thousands of grief-stricken American families struggling to make sense of the seemingly random terror it inflicts, sickening many but only taking some lives.\n\nBut for many black families, mourning coronavirus deaths brings an added burden as they wonder whether racial bias may have played a role.\n\nDecades of research shows that black patients receive inferior medical care to white patients. A long history of experimentation, exploitation and mistreatment has left many African-Americans deeply suspicious of the medical establishment. Now comes Covid-19, and the fear among many families, social scientists and public health experts that racial bias might be contributing to the disproportionately high rate at which the novel coronavirus is killing African-Americans.\n\nAcknowledging a history of implicit bias in medical care, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently advised health care professionals to be careful not to let bias influence their treatment during this pandemic.\n\nPreliminary research by a Boston-based biotech firm suggests that treatment may not be consistent across the board. The study found that black people who visited hospitals with Covid-19 symptoms in February and March were less likely to get tested or treated than white patients.\n\nAmericans of all races may have experienced less than ideal care in recent months in an overwhelmed health care system, and it is not uncommon to hear stories of people who visited health professionals for treatment, only to be turned away.\n\nBut African-American patients enter the health care system with distinct disadvantages, experts say. There is less access to quality health care in many black communities, research shows, and black people are more likely to suffer from diabetes, hypertension and other underlying conditions that make Covid-19 particularly fatal.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Carnage in the job market could get much worse. Top U.S. health officials go into quarantine after White House staff members test positive. Key officials are discussing jobs and plans on reopening. See more updates Updated 22m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nSo, should providers misinterpret or ignore coronavirus symptoms in black patients, there is a higher likelihood that the results could be grave, experts say.\n\nThe country's largest professional organization representing black doctors is calling on federal health agencies to study the role bias may have played in the testing and treatment of African-Americans for Covid-19.\n\n\"I think what we will find is race is a factor,\" said Dr. Oliver Brooks, president of the organization, the National Medical Association.\n\nIn previous studies, doctors have been found to have downplayed African-Americans' complaints of pain, given them weaker pain medication for broken bones and withheld cardiac treatments from black patients who needed them. Research suggests that the decisions are the result of ingrained assumptions, cultural ignorance and hostile attitudes toward African-Americans.\n\nThe C.D.C. said in a statement to The New York Times that it did not have data to quantify the role of implicit bias in Covid-19 deaths. But the agency added, \"Becoming aware of and reflecting on one's own biases to help ensure they do not impact decisions is a potentially lifesaving step for clinicians to undertake.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Relf made an appointment for her brother at the Loyola Center for Immediate Care in River Forest, Ill., in late March, she said she was hopeful that the clinic would be able to test and treat him for the coronavirus. He had become extremely lethargic with persistent coughs and chills, she said.\n\nBefore Mr. Relf left the clinic, he called his sister complaining that the staff would not test him because he did not have a fever. He sounded defeated, Ms. Relf said.\n\n\"Quarantine at home for 7 days,\" his discharge papers said. \"Infection control will contact you regarding eligibility for testing.\"\n\nThe clinic set up an appointment for him to see his regular doctor 11 days later. Mr. Relf never made it. One of his brothers went to check on him after he stopped answering his phone and found his lifeless body crumpled in front of a couch.\n\nA spokeswoman for Loyola Medicine said in an email that privacy laws prevented it from discussing Mr. Relf's case specifically, but that Loyola did not \"discriminate based on race, age, gender or socioeconomic status.\"\n\nIt is difficult to know if any individual medical decision was affected by bias.\n\nStill, a 2003 report commissioned by Congress on racial and ethnic disparities in health care found that even controlling for income and insurance access, \"Racial and ethnic minorities tend to receive a lower quality of health care.\"\n\n\"Significantly,\" the report added, \"these differences are associated with greater mortality among African-American patients.\"\n\nA pilot study by Rubix Life Sciences, the biotech research firm, compared the severity of Covid-19 symptoms exhibited by more than 27,000 patients during hospital visits in seven states with the treatment they received.\n\nThe study, which has not gone through peer review, showed that black patients were six times less likely to get treatment or testing than white patients, said Reginald Swift, the founder of Rubix.\n\nDr. Brooks, medical director at Watts Healthcare in Los Angeles, explained the issue this way: \"When we walk into an E.R., what they sometimes see is not a patient who is suffering from respiratory illness, they see a black man here who needs something.\"\n\nGary Fowler's family believes that the minimizing of his symptoms by doctors ultimately cost him his life.\n\nMr. Fowler, 56, who is black, had developed a deep, worrying cough, a fever and labored breathing, said one of his sons, Keith Gambrell. Over the course of five days, Mr. Fowler was sent home by three hospitals in metro Detroit, Mr. Gambrell said. A week later, Mr. Fowler died sitting in a blue recliner in his bedroom.\n\nThe three hospitals where his family said he sought care disagreed with the family's account. A spokesman from one of the hospitals, Detroit Receiving Hospital, said, \"there is no record of this individual coming to Detroit Receiving Hospital for any type of treatment.\" The other two hospitals disputed that Mr. Fowler was denied care.\n\nMr. Fowler's death added to the grim tally of deaths in Detroit, a city with a majority African-American population that has come to tragically symbolize the virus's devastation of black America.\n\nKaila Corrothers believed that her mother, Deborah Gatewood, did not have to be part of that tally.\n\nMs. Gatewood, 63, developed a high fever in mid March. But in four visits over six days, she was sent home with nothing more than Tylenol and cough medicine from the suburban Detroit hospital where she worked as a phlebotomist for 31 years, her daughter said.\n\nDays after that last visit, Ms. Gatewood became so weak at home that her daughter insisted she go to the hospital again.\n\n\"No, they're not going to take me,\" Ms. Corrothers recalled her mother saying.\n\nBut Ms. Gatewood collapsed and an ambulance rushed her to a different hospital, where she was placed on a ventilator.\n\nOn April 17, three weeks after being admitted, her heart, kidney and lungs failed, and she died.\n\nMs. Corrothers said she could not say whether the fact that her mother was African-American played a role in her treatment.\n\nIn her visits to the emergency room of her employer, Beaumont Hospital in Farmington Hills, Mich., Ms. Gatewood never presented with symptoms severe enough to warrant admission, a hospital spokesman said in a statement. Given the shortage of testing supplies, patients with mild symptoms were not tested and told to quarantine at home, but return if their condition deteriorated, the statement said.\n\nThe lack of resources in some hospitals and the overwhelming number of cases likely have played more of a role than bias in the negative outcomes for African-Americans, some public health experts said.\n\nBut, in another case that has raised concern of medical bias, the family of Robert Johnson Jr. cannot help but think that doctors could have done more for him.\n\nHe seemed to embody many coronavirus risk factors: 49 and black, he had diabetes, hypertension, a low-functioning kidney and a double amputation.\n\nThe day before Easter, he woke up too weak to leave his bed, eat, or tell his mother what precisely hurt.\n\nThe next morning, Mr. Johnson's fever soared to 103.3 degrees. He was rushed to the emergency room at Yale New Haven Hospital. His mother, Gloria Johnson, 71, called the hospital hours later and was told her son had been given \"the green light\" to return home after receiving a chest X-ray that showed signs of pneumonia. The hospital did not test him for the coronavirus.\n\nMs. Johnson brought her son Easter dinner that night after his discharge. He had no appetite but she insisted he taste a few spoonfuls of yams. When she called the following morning to check on him, he didn't answer.\n\nShe hurried to his apartment only to find him unresponsive in his bed. Ms. Johnson watched as emergency responders tried to revive him.\n\n\"I thought, 'Oh my God, what if they had given him the Covid-19 test or even kept him overnight for observation? What would the outcome be?'\" she said.\n\nA spokesman for Yale New Haven Health said in a statement that they \"understand the family's concern.\" The hospital was confident in the care provided to Mr. Johnson, but his case was under review, the spokesman said.\n\nAfter Mr. Johnson's burial in a graveside service in New Haven, his mother was preparing to have his old apartment packed and cleaned when she received one last call from the Yale hospital.\n\nThey were calling, she said, to schedule Mr. Johnson's Covid-19 test.\n\nSheelagh McNeill contributed reseaThe",

        "body": "An island community in Washington State has developed a testing and tracing strategy it hopes will as a model for rural and tribal communities.\n\nIn mid-March, Dr. Jim Bristow's wife came down with gastrointestinal issues. Then, she couldn't stop coughing.\n\nHer symptoms pointed to coronavirus, but she couldn't get tested -- in part because of the nationwide test shortage, but also because the pair lived in Vashon, an idyllic town on an island in Washington State's Puget Sound with scant medical resources. When Dr. Anthony S. Fauci of President Trump's coronavirus task force said that the United States was failing with regards to testing, Dr. Bristow, said that it \"really struck me.\"\n\nDr. Bristow felt inspired to collaborate with other members in the Vashon community to develop a model to test, trace and isolate -- in essence, a coronavirus response plan that they call the Rural Test & Trace Toolkit. Dr. Bristow, a retired cardiologist who was trained at the start of the AIDS epidemic, now believes that their model can be replicated, or serve as a guideline, for other isolated parts of the United States, including rural and tribal communities as they continue to face outbreaks.\n\nAs the novel coronavirus expands beyond major cities and the coasts -- and as states start to emerge from shelter-in-place orders -- locations with fewer medical resources will need strategies that work for them.\n\n\"While rural areas are typically underresourced and disadvantaged as it comes to health and health care, a model like this shows that rural places can be particularly nimble and flexible,\" said Carrie Henning-Smith, the deputy director of the University of Minnesota's Rural Health Research Center.\n\nAlthough Vashon Island is geographically part of King County -- which includes Seattle, the early epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States -- it is unincorporated, meaning it is governed by the county but mostly manages its own affairs.\n\n\"We're an hour and a half from the nearest emergency room, we don't have acute care facilities on the island, and our ambulance system can be easily overwhelmed,\" said Dr. John Osborn, who works as an emergency room physician in Seattle and also leads Vashon's Medical Reserve Corps. \"The challenges we face are faced by many other rural communities.\"\n\nAfter Dr. Bristow's initial frustrations, he eventually got in touch with Dr. Osborn and the reserve corps. They came up with a plan for a coronavirus response team on the island. Another 70 volunteers joined the island's corps to help -- many of them older and at higher risk of dying or contracting severe disease if they are exposed. \"We have a volunteer work force we simply can't expose,\" said Dr. Bristow, also the former deputy director of the Joint Genome Institute at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.\n\nDr. Zach Miller, a resident of Vashon who set up the infectious disease department at the nonprofit regional health care system Group Health (now part of Kaiser), quickly realized that nasal swabs could be used in lieu of the clinically standard nasopharyngeal swabs, skirting the need for more extensive personal protective equipment such as face shields and N95 masks. \"This can allow the model to be replicated in other places with a group of well-trained volunteers,\" he said.\n\nSince April 7, a historic building in the center of Vashon has been transformed into a coronavirus testing site. For a few hours every day, volunteers set up tents and tables outside and don medical masks and gloves to help residents get tested for coronavirus infection. Residents drive up and use their vehicles as personal waiting rooms. But instead of a trained medical practitioner inserting a swab deep into their nose, each patient gets a kit from a volunteer, stops their car and takes the swab themselves.\n\nSo far, this testing setup has swabbed about 60 individuals, but not turned up any positive residents. (Vashon had four other coronavirus cases that were reported to the Washington Department of Health.) Dr. Bristow's wife was never tested and has since recovered, and there hasn't been a positive case on the island in over two weeks.\n\nIf the testing does turn up positive cases, some volunteers have been trained as contact tracers to identify people who have been in contact with the infected person.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As the virus devastates tax revenues, states must follow balanced-budget laws.

Moreover, having someone within the community trace call others might be advantageous because there is more inherent trust.\n\nThe success of the Vashon method has relied on its medical reserve corps, a regional emergency preparedness team established by the federal government after the Sept. 11 attacks. Until coronavirus made its way to the West Coast, the corps on Vashon was most concerned with preparing for a massive earthquake expected to strike the Pacific Northwest. Dr. Osborn believes that the 829 Medical reserve corps around the country can be a building block for effective testing and tracing in other rural communities.\n\nCurrently, Dr. Bristow and Dr. Osborn are bringing their model to native nations in the Puget Sound and the Columbia River Basin, where Dr. Osborn had pre-existing relationships from his work on protecting rivers and salmon in the area. Like Vashon, many of these communities are relatively remote.\n\n\"We really welcomed this idea,\" said Fawn Sharp, president of the Quinault Indian Nation in Taholah, Wash.\n\nThe reservation is about a 45-minute drive to the nearest emergency room, and has one ambulance for about 3,500 people.\n\n\"If coronavirus hits here, we are going to be hit hard, so we're taking every precaution we can,\" said M'Liss DeWald, the planning chief for Quinault's coronavirus incident command team.\n\nMs. DeWald says that she and others in the community have many of the ingredients to implement the Vashon model -- with eager volunteers and a physical location to do the testing. But early on they struggled with procuring test kits.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nBeing able to implement the model would largely depend on the financial means to purchase test kits and certain protective gear, such as surgical masks and gloves, Dr. Henning-Smith said. Dr. Bristow suggests coronavirus response teams partner with clinics that have access to such gear. In the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe on the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, medical workers have been able to repurpose many of their existing supplies to do testing for the coronavirus, said Dr. Brenda Powell, the tribe's health services director.\n\nTransportation might also be an issue in some rural communities. \"How can you do a drive-through if people don't have cars?\" said Dr. Jasmeet Bains, describing one of the biggest challenges for the model. As a family medicine doctor in Taft, Calif., she primarily serves uninsured, undocumented immigrants who walk to her clinic.\n\nThe Vashon model is very flexible, Dr. Miller said. Home test kits can be delivered to someone's doorstep and picked up later, he said. The supply-chain bottlenecks that rural communities run into today might change tomorrow.\n\n\"If communities are going to test, they need to be able to adapt,\" Dr. Bristow said. He plans on keeping the webpage for the Vashon model up-to-date, and hopes it \"can be a clearinghouse for information in this rapidly changing landscape.\"",

        "body": "As we learn more about children and Covid-19, new research is reshaping some of our thinking. It continues to be true that children, as a group, have been relatively spared, but there is evidence that some may become very sick, and we are beginning to learn more about who may be most at risk, and what parents need to watch for.\n\nThis past week there were reports of children hospitalized in different locations, including New York City, with a multisystem inflammatory disease that has killed three children. In addition, new research continues to be published describing the ways that the virus can behave in children, which is not always how it behaves in adults.\n\n[Read more: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's list of coronavirus symptoms in children]\n\nA clinical report published Tuesday in Frontiers in Pediatrics describes five children in China who were admitted to the hospital with nonrespiratory symptoms but who turned out to have Covid, including the characteristic lung abnormalities. Dr. Wenbin Li, chief pediatrician of Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, who was the first author of the study, said in an email, \"In our report, four of the five patients had fever and cough during the course of the disease; four of the five cases had digestive tract symptoms as the first manifestation.\"\n\n\"The indisputable fact is that, during the outbreak of Covid-19, the pediatric emergency departments are having a huge reduction of visits,\" Dr. Li wrote. Because parents are afraid of coming to the hospital, they may delay bringing sick children in, which can lead to serious complications, he said. And we're seeing in the United States that they may also delay bringing well children in, which can lead to missed immunizations and vulnerability to other scary diseases.\n\n\"The idea that children either don't get Covid-19 or have really mild disease is an oversimplification,\" said Dr. Adam Ratner, the director of pediatric infectious diseases at New York University School of Medicine and Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at N.Y.U. Langone Health. It's true -- and comforting -- that there have been fewer cases detected in children, and that the case fatality rate is much lower in children than in adults, especially older adults, he said, but \"we have had some extremely sick children.\"\n\nA study just published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics looked at 48 children in the United States who have required intensive care with Covid-19. Among other findings, 40 of them had significant medical issues, so-called comorbidities; half of these were categorized as \"medically complex,\" meaning they were dependent on technological support to begin with, as would be true of a child with a tracheostomy, for example. Other comorbidities included immunosuppression, usually connected to cancer treatment, obesity or diabetes.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Fauci will issue a stark warning on the risks of reopening too soon. The White House plans to ask officials -- but not Trump -- to wear face masks. The baseball season could open in July, with empty stands (to start). See more updates Updated 4h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThere have also been some cases of newborns becoming sick, and at least one reported stillbirth, and a research letter published at the end of April in JAMA reported the isolation of the virus from the placenta of a woman who suffered a second-trimester miscarriage.\n\nDr. David Baud, the head of the obstetrics service at Lausanne University Hospital in Switzerland, who was the lead author of the letter, said that the most likely way for the virus to reach the placenta is through the bloodstream. He noted that in the outbreaks of SARS and MERS, which were also coronaviruses, infected mothers were more likely to have low birth weight babies.\n\nAnd although it feels as if the current pandemic has been going on for a long time, we are in fact not far enough in yet to see what the effect on the fetus might be of infection during the first trimester of pregnancy. But Dr. Baud was one of the doctors who described the establishment of an international registry for pregnancies affected by Covid-19 in an article published this month in the Lancet.\n\nEven when mothers test positive for Covid-19 at delivery, their infants have tended to be negative, Dr. Ratner said, as long as the mothers and babies are kept separate (or well protected by personal protective equipment) after the birth, suggesting that the virus is not being transmitted in utero or at delivery -- which was also found to be the case in China.\n\nDr. Ratner said he had taken care of a number of children with the virus, and \"most of them have very mild disease.\" But some \"have required intensive care and ventilatory support, so there is a wide range, even if most of the cases are OK.\"\n\nSome infants become critically ill, but in preschool and school-age children, we have been saying that Covid-19 tends to be very mild. Children with immunodeficiencies or children who have had chemotherapy are at higher risk for serious illness, but, Dr. Ratner said, \"we have seen kids without prior medical problems at all who've needed admission, who've needed intensive care.\" This is also the age group where the new multisystem disease is being noted, possibly sometimes as a post-infectious hyperinflammatory process.\n\nMany of the symptoms of this recently described syndrome resemble those of a rare childhood illness called Kawasaki disease. Dr. Jane Newburger, the director of the Kawasaki program at Boston Children's Hospital, said, \"We're seeing a wave of a syndrome that can include shock or extreme inflammation.\" Shock is what happens when the body's organs don't get sufficient blood supply, and some of these children have poor heart function.\n\nKawasaki disease itself is a clinical diagnosis; there is no single lab test that can detect it, and the cause is not known. Dr. Newburger described it as \"an acute illness of children that strikes generally children who were previously healthy -- high fever for at least four days with red eyes, redness of lips, tongue, throat, a rash, swollen hands and feet, sometimes red palms and soles.\" It's treated with IVIG, intravenous immunoglobulin, a blood product prepared from the serum of many donors with the intent of preventing the rare but serious enlargement of the coronary arteries, which is the most dangerous complication.\n\nDr. Newburger said that the Covid-19-related cases are a multisystem severe inflammatory syndrome modulated by the immune system, which many people think may appear a few weeks after the initial encounter with the coronavirus. The children come in with high fevers, with dysfunction in one or more body organs, and with lab tests suggesting inflammation.\n\nDr. Moshe Arditi, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases and immunology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, has been working on Kawasaki disease for over 30 years. He said that some of the cases that have been reported in different cities -- especially London and New York -- may just represent Kawasaki disease in children who have also been exposed to Covid-19, without being able to say whether there is any causal link, while others involve children who are much sicker, with what he described as \"a toxic shock kind of syndrome,\" needing intensive care -- which defines this new clinical entity.\n\nDr. Philip Kahn, a pediatric rheumatologist at N.Y.U., said he was currently caring for several pediatric patients hospitalized with what looks like Kawasaki disease.\n\n\"In Kawasaki disease, the vast majority of children do extremely well, with no long-term bad outcomes,\" Dr. Kahn said. \"For the vast majority, this is an acute one-time illness of childhood.\" And he has seen children with Covid-19 and this Kawasaki-like syndrome who have looked sick but done well, he said, responding to treatment with immunoglobulin. He had just gotten off the phone, he said, with a patient who had been discharged. \"The kid is laughing, the mom is laughing, a week and a half later,\" he said. \"Treated with one dose of immunoglobulin, laughing, looks like a million bucks -- that's the kid I live for.\"\n\nAnd even with the cases of multisystem disease that emerged last week, \"compared to adults, children are much less likely to be severely affected, and mortality is very very rare,\" Dr. Newburger said. \"Parents should still feel it would be very unusual for a child to be so seriously affected -- but if their child suddenly becomes very febrile, seems unwell, and a parent's sixth sense tells them their child is much sicker, seek medical attention, call the pediatrician, go to the hospital.\"\n\n\"The important takeaway is that this is still a new disease for us,\" Dr. Ratner said. \"We are still seeing things for the first time, even though over the last few weeks we've seen a lot of adults and children.\"",

        "body": "Two new expert consensus statements urge caution for athletes with coronavirus who are returning to serious training.\n\nIs it OK to resume athletic training, even if you have gotten through a bout of Covid-19 or tested positive for coronavirus or suspect you might have been infected? Two new expert-consensus statements from pulmonologists and cardiologists, published separately in The Lancet and JAMA Cardiology, urge caution.\n\nThe new statements point out that the always-thorny issue of when injured or ill athletes can return to training is further complicated now, since the novel coronavirus is novel and much about its short- and long-term effects on the body remain unknown. So, the authors of the new statements lay out tentative evaluations and protocols that, ideally, ill or homebound athletes would complete before returning to strenuous exercise. They also highlight a few troubling symptoms that potentially could raise new concerns down the road.\n\nBy now, of course, almost all of us recognize that fitness is no guarantee against Covid-19. Marathon runners, competitive cyclists, professional basketball players and other athletes are among the many who have tested positive for the virus, and some reportedly have developed severe illnesses. Untold numbers of other athletes may have been infected but asymptomatic and never realized they carried the virus.\n\nMany of these athletes might now feel ready to resume heavy training. But the usual return-to-play criteria for sick athletes probably do not apply to someone who has been infected with the coronavirus, says Dr. James Hull, a sports pulmonologist at Royal Brompton Hospital in London and co-author of the new statement in The Lancet about athletes and coronavirus.\n\nSince the 1990s, he says, sports medicine physicians typically have relied on the \"neck check\" to decide if and when an athlete with a respiratory condition should train. Using this measure, if an athlete's symptoms are confined, by and large, to his head -- meaning, above or in the neck, such as a runny nose, sinus pain and sore throat -- he or she usually would be cleared to train and play.\n\nBut the novel coronavirus worries sports pulmonologists, Dr. Hull says, in part because in some people, the illness can seem benign at first, then rapidly go downhill. \"We have seen people have some mild symptoms to start with and seem to improve,\" he says, \"only to then deteriorate really badly at seven days following their first symptoms.\"\n\nBecause of this potential disease trajectory, he says, \"it is important that, unlike what people would do with a normal viral infection,\" such as a head cold, \"they don't exercise hard\" while they have symptoms, especially in those first seven days, he says.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. All 50 states have reopened to some degree. The rules still vary widely. C.D.C. releases guidance that the White House had rejected. Colleges weigh fall classes, plus quarantine dorms and mask requirements. See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nInstead, he and other pulmonologists, writing in The Lancet, advise athletes who have tested positive for the coronavirus or suspect they might be positive to rest, without any exercise, for at least 10 days from the point when they first feel symptoms. Then, assuming their illness remains mild, they should continue to rest for another week, even after their symptoms resolve.\n\nThis protocol is conservative, but aligns with a new consensus opinion about athletes, coronavirus, exercise and hearts published this month in JAMA Cardiology, with the backing of the American College of Cardiology's Sports & Exercise Cardiology Council.\n\nThe cardiologists felt compelled to release this statement in part because the new coronavirus seems sometimes to have unexpected and perilous effects on hearts, even among robust athletes, says Dr. Jonathan Kim, a sports cardiologist at Emory University in Atlanta, and co-author of the new recommendations, with Dr. Dermot Phelan of the Sanger Heart and Vascular Institute in Charlotte, N.C., and Dr. Eugene Chung of the University of Michigan.\n\nWith most viral respiratory infections, he says, perhaps 1 percent of people who are infected develop related heart problems, such as myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle. But there are indications that people infected with the coronavirus could have a much higher incidence of heart issues, he says, although the actual risks are hard to assess, with so much about the virus still mysterious.\n\nEven so, he and his fellow cardiologists suggest, much like the authors of the Lancet paper, that athletes and committed exercisers who have tested positive for the virus but have mild or no symptoms -- or who worry they might have been infected, without testing -- stay home and rest for at least two weeks from the date of their first symptoms or positive test. This time period also is the length of self-isolation mandated by current health guidelines following any possible exposure to the virus.\n\nAfter a minimum of two weeks of resting at home and assuming symptoms have improved, the pulmonologists and cardiologists advise returning slowly to exercise training, with a wary eye on symptoms. \"You might have a mild cough and minimal shortness of breath when returning to sport now,\" Dr. Hull says. But those symptoms should lessen day by day, he says. If they do not or you develop new wheezing or shortness of breath, \"go to your doc and get your chest examined,\" he advises, or arrange a telehealth call.\n\nDr. Kim agrees. For most athletes who have spent weeks at home recovering from the virus, the first few workouts could feel lousy, he says, since any lingering viral effects may combine with general physical deconditioning. So, expect some discomfort. But if you experience considerable or increasing chest tightness or new heart palpitations, stop exercising, contact your doctor and discuss whether you should complete cardiac testing, he says.\n\nAny athletes who have been hospitalized or bedridden by the virus will be likely to need extensive pulmonary and cardiac testing and clearance from their physicians before working out again, he says.\n\nBut for those of us who are casual exercisers who have not tested positive for the virus or felt ill during this pandemic, walking, jogging, cycling and other activities remain safe and desirable, he says, with proper social distancing and face covering, of course. \"It's a good idea to be cautious now,\" he says, \"but exercise is still one of the best things you can do for your health.\"",

So why, then, are you a robot-delivery skeptic?\n\nThese robots can't even serve everyone in Milton Keynes, which is ideally suited to robot deliveries because it has bike and pedestrian paths alongside the roadways. Almost nowhere else is set up for these deliveries on a wide scale.\n\nYou can see what these robots can do in small ways or in certain places, but you also see the limitations when you extrapolate that out. People vandalize these robots for kicks. The robots get stuck, and humans have to take over remotely. They can't carry much. If you have a family, it's not great to be limited to a couple of grocery bags.\n\nSo robot deliveries aren't coming to my neighborhood soon?\n\nProbably not. Prices will come down, and autonomous technology will improve, but there are limits to how many of these things you can put on a sidewalk.\n\nAnd delivery robots only work long term if they're cheaper than humans doing the same thing. That's not going to happen if robots stay confined to a tiny number of places like Milton Keynes or college campuses.\n\nYou wrote earlier this month about problems with driverless cars, and now you're picking on delivery robots.

One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\n\"People want certainty, and there's a huge amount of pressure as a leader to make definitive statements,\" Spiegel said in a conversation Wednesday (by video chat, not Snapchat) with New York Times editors and reporters. \"I think it's important that we remain flexible in a situation that is changing rapidly.\"\n\nSnapchat, which has more than 3,000 employees, has been planning for a couple months on how to reopen offices. It's keeping track of business safety requirements issued by local authorities, and Snapchat's own. It has assessed which teams to invite back to offices first based on job requirements. Someone who needs access to high-end video editing equipment available only at the office, for example, would be higher on the list of returnees.\n\nSpiegel and his wife, the model and skincare entrepreneur Miranda Kerr, have two young sons. Like many parents, he said he had mixed feelings about working remotely.\n\nIt's been challenging, he said, for two working adults and their children to manage under the same roof 24/7. But, Spiegel said, \"I get to spend time with my family, which has led to more fulfillment than I've ever had in my life.\"\n\nBefore we go ...\n\nHelp getting connected during the pandemic. Maybe: Internet providers like Charter and Comcast promised to help low-income people get or stay online during the pandemic. But taking them up on the offer hasn't always been easy, my colleague David McCabe reported.\n\nEverything you need to know about tracking disease, with humans: ProPublica has the best explanation I've seen for how disease detectives track down people who may have been exposed to the coronavirus. As I've written here, this is a labor-intensive process for which smartphone location data may (or may not) help a little.\n\nBanal and utterly bizarre: A glitch over smartphone photo formats is causing some high school students to fail advanced placement tests, The Verge reported. Some test takers submit photos of their virtual test sheets, but the testing website doesn't support the default format on some iPhones and newer Android phones.\n\nHugs to this\n\nMove over, BBC Dad.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nFor nearly a week, a single flight of stairs in a two-story home in Rolla, Mo., became a no man's land -- the only thing that separated the sick from the healthy. On the dozen or so steps, the healthy roommates left takeout orders and paper plates, and the sick ones returned used plastic utensils and other trash from their bedrooms.\n\nAnd if any of the three coughing residents thought for a moment about wandering downstairs, a wooden cornhole board placed on the fifth step blocked their path.\n\nWhen Marco Cisneros, 22, moved into that house in central Missouri last month, all five roommates had free rein of the four bedrooms and shared living spaces. They cooked meals together. They stayed up late playing Mario Kart.\n\nBut then one roommate began coughing. Another one got a fever. Soon, three of them were sick. Fearing that their roommates might have the coronavirus, the two healthy roommates banished the sick ones to the second floor.\n\n\"The day we moved them upstairs, we sanitized the whole house,\" Mr. Cisneros said recently of his roommates' quarantine. \"I never thought to sanitize door handles before this, and now I'm sanitizing door handles.\"\n\nLiving with a roommate has always included some drama -- fights over dishes, shared bathrooms and cable bills. But with more Americans testing positive for the coronavirus every day, millions of roommates across the country have been forced to rely on people they may barely know to keep them from getting sick, in some cases entrusting their health to strangers they met on Craigslist or through mutual friends.\n\nWhile the pandemic has brought some roommates closer together, for others, it has turned petty grievances about cleanliness or visitors into arguments over safety.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump says he will issue an executive order suspending immigration. Several states in the South are moving to reopen businesses. Trump defends nation's testing capacity, even as some states scramble for supplies. See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAcross the country, nearly 20 million people live with nonrelatives, according to Census Bureau data. Among people ages 18 to 34, in 2015, one in four lived with roommates, a figure that included young adults who lived with relatives who were not their parents, such as siblings.\n\nIn interviews, people afraid of contracting the virus from less careful roommates said they were fervently cleaning surfaces, keeping toiletries in their rooms and removing shared items, like phone chargers, from common areas. Some have fled apartments for family homes, saying their roommates' nonchalance put them at too much risk.\n\nIn Seattle, navigating the new normal of isolation has been exponentially more complicated for Eliza, a community organizer who lives in a house with nine others. Before the coronavirus, the intentional community felt like a big family. Now it is a source of anxiety -- and possible infection.\n\n\"We all have different definitions of what social distancing means,\" said Eliza, who asked that she not be fully identified to avoid tension with her housemates. One housemate was still going to an office last month, and another recently had three friends over to watch a movie, which \"made me very uncomfortable,\" she said.\n\nAnd then there is the issue of hours upon hours suddenly spent together -- in the same shared space.\n\nWith stay-at-home orders issued in all or parts of 45 states, many roommates who were accustomed to seeing each other only briefly in the morning or after work are now home together, in many cases working remotely, taking business calls and participating in video meetings.\n\nAbout 40 percent of working-age adults are working from home because of the virus, a figure that is higher among the wealthy, according to the Pew Research Center. With roommates now doubling as co-workers, some have tried boosting morale in their new home offices -- which, in many cases, is simply the living room.\n\nNaomi Nagel and Michelle Topping, both 26, said that after a week of wearing their pajamas all day in their Atlanta apartment, they decided they needed to do something that would force them to change clothes -- and lift their moods. The best friends created a \"spirit month\" calendar with a different theme for each day -- including \"ugly sweater\" day and \"fancy Friday\" -- and the effort has caught on among their friends, who have sent photographs of themselves following along.\n\nWhen Ms. Topping was laid off from her job at a law firm during the pandemic, the spirit calendar and photographs gave her something to look forward to each morning.\n\n\"It was really helpful,\" she said. \"Losing my job sucks, but this is a little bit of a distraction.\"\n\nThe altered state of living has also put more novel living arrangements to the test, such as that of Kristin Accorsi, 33, who lives in Freehold, N.J., with her husband, her former husband and a child from each marriage.\n\nWhen the pandemic grew more severe in March, she told her former husband, who usually spends about two nights a week in the house's \"in-law suite,\" that he should go to his other apartment in Brooklyn and hunker down. But within a few nights, after watching his roommates traipse in and out of the apartment and as cases spiked in New York City, he decided to return to the family home, she said.\n\nSince then, there have been a few sticking points: Ms. Accorsi, a teacher who also writes a blog about her living situation, said her former husband has a tendency to talk on speaker phone, for example, and she has been doing much of her family's dishes and laundry.\n\nStill, the unusual circumstances also have their perks. Her 8-year-old son has been happy to see his father every day, and everyone has been somewhat amicable, at times surprisingly so. Sometimes, after Ms. Accorsi goes to sleep, the men stay up to watch anime on TV.\n\n\"I would say my ex and my husband get along better than I get along with either of them,\" she said, laughing.\n\nFor Mr. Cisneros, in Missouri, the coronavirus upended much of his life. Last month, he was working at a movie theater in Springfield, Mo., his hometown. The pandemic caused the theater to close and cost him his job. He filed for unemployment last month and, after weeks of hearing nothing, he began receiving payments last week. His original plan to apply to a local Walmart is on hold, as the job feels increasingly hazardous.\n\n\"The Walmart is still hiring, but I'm too scared to work there, especially because my roommate who worked there potentially has coronavirus,\" he said earlier this month. A few days later, one of his roommates tested negative for the virus, bringing everyone in the house a measure of relief.\n\nNow Mr. Cisneros spends much of his days cleaning. He wants to be at home with his mother, but she has a rare lung disease and he worries about bringing the virus home, even if he has no symptoms.\n\nAlthough he never could have anticipated the arrangement in his new house, Mr. Cisneros is grateful to be with some of his best friends, and glad they never turned on each other when they were all stuck upstairs for nearly a week.\n\nEven once one of the roommates tested negative for the virus, Mr. Cisneros and the other healthy roommate did not take any chances.\n\n\"We had them stay upstairs another day just to be safe,\" he said.\n\nDan Levin contributed reporting.",

As\u00ed es el trabajo.\n\nReg\u00edstrate para recibir nuestro bolet\u00edn con lo mejor de The New York Times.\n\nCuando Jessica Jaramillo llama a alguien para hablar sobre el coronavirus, generalmente comienza diciendo algo as\u00ed:\n\n\"Hola, mi nombre es Jessica. Llamo de parte del Departamento de Salud P\u00fablica de San Francisco. Soy miembro de un equipo de seguimiento de contactos, y nuestro trabajo es llegar a las personas que han tenido contacto cercano con alguien a quien se le ha diagnosticado la COVID-19\".\n\nJaramillo, de 41 a\u00f1os, quien en tiempos ordinarios es gerente de distrito de la Biblioteca P\u00fablica de San Francisco, ha hecho decenas de esas llamadas hasta ahora, todas en espa\u00f1ol. Ella comenz\u00f3 a hacer rastreo de contactos este mes.\n\nJaramillo es una de las m\u00e1s de 11.000 personas en Estados Unidos que est\u00e1n llamando a la gente para darles consejos sobre c\u00f3mo contener la propagaci\u00f3n de la COVID-19, seg\u00fan una encuesta realizada por NPR. (Es probable que ese n\u00famero haya crecido desde que el sondeo se realiz\u00f3 por primera vez, en abril).\n\nEl c\u00e1lculo de la cantidad de personas que se necesita en todo el pa\u00eds para seguimiento de contactos var\u00eda de 100.000 hasta unas 300.000.\n\nEl trabajo se realiza principalmente por tel\u00e9fono y puede hacerse desde casa. Puede ser a tiempo completo o parcial, a menudo con un salario de 17 a 25 d\u00f3lares por hora; algunos incluyen prestaciones. Difieren de un lugar a otro, en parte, porque los esfuerzos de capacitaci\u00f3n y reclutamiento han reca\u00eddo en los gobiernos estatales y locales (y algunos de los programas ya han tenido problemas, tanto pr\u00e1cticos como pol\u00edticos).\n\nA medida que las comunidades comienzan a abrirse y m\u00e1s personas se aventuran fuera de sus casas, se espera que el trabajo se vuelva m\u00e1s crucial, y m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil.\n\n\"Si puedes hacer seguimiento de contactos, puedes localizarlo antes de que se propague en una comunidad como un incendio\", dijo Jaramillo. \"Entonces est\u00e1s salvando a la abuela de alguien, o a su t\u00edo\".\n\nLa adopci\u00f3n de un enfoque a la 'vieja usanza'\n\nComo funcionaria p\u00fablica que se hab\u00eda inscrito para trabajar en caso de desastre, Jaramillo estaba lista para servir a su comunidad en caso de, digamos, un terremoto. No esperaba una pandemia.\n\nLas conversaciones telef\u00f3nicas de Jaramillo se desarrollan de acuerdo a las necesidades de las personas del otro lado de la l\u00ednea. Si necesitan hacerse la prueba de la COVID-19, ella los puede remitir a una cita. Si tienen s\u00edntomas, les puede recomendar aislamiento. Si les preocupa la supervivencia en cuarentena, puede conectarlos con servicios de entrega de alimentos.\n\nY si les preocupa su privacidad, Jaramillo les garantiza que su informaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 segura. Su capacitaci\u00f3n incluy\u00f3 una introducci\u00f3n a las regulaciones federales que protegen la informaci\u00f3n confidencial de salud, y ella trabaja con un software encriptado. Jaramilllo y otros rastreadores de contactos no comparten los nombres de las personas que tienen un diagn\u00f3stico de COVID-19 con la gente a la que llaman.\n\nLa Universidad de California, en San Francisco, ha estado trabajando tanto con la ciudad como con el estado para capacitar a cientos de trabajadores como Jaramillo.\n\n\"El seguimiento de contactos no es una f\u00f3rmula m\u00e1gica\", dijo Mike Reid, profesor asistente en la Escuela de Medicina de la UCSF.\n\nPero dijo que el enfoque a la \"antigua usanza\" en San Francisco y otros departamentos de salud -- que se basa en educaci\u00f3n y empoderamiento, no en aplicaciones de rastreo como aquellas en las que Google y Apple est\u00e1n trabajando -- pueden unir a las comunidades y crear capacidad para manejar futuras crisis.\n\nEs un mercado laboral competitivo\n\nEn un tiempo de aislamiento, un trabajo que requiere conexi\u00f3n humana resulta atractivo. Y para algunos, el trabajo es una forma de contraatacar en una pandemia que ha golpeado la econom\u00eda nacional.\n\nPero incluso si se contrata a cientos de miles de personas como rastreadores de contactos, apenas afectar\u00eda al desempleo; en los \u00faltimos dos meses m\u00e1s de 36 millones de solicitudes de ayuda por desempleo fueron presentadas en Estados Unidos.\n\nY las oportunidades var\u00edan de estado a estado; Massachusetts y California estuvieron entre los primeros en adoptar programas masivos de seguimiento de contactos por la COVID-19.\n\nKevin Williams, de 27 a\u00f1os, escritor y conductor en Columbus, Ohio, pens\u00f3 que le dar\u00eda una oportunidad al seguimiento de contactos despu\u00e9s de que el Departamento de Salud del estado anunci\u00f3 a princicpios de mayo que estaba contratando a 18,59 d\u00f3lares por hora.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Disease models suggest tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented.

El trabajo estatal al que Williams se postul\u00f3 estaba buscando solo a 100 personas.\n\nOscar Baez, de 33 a\u00f1os, un funcionario del Servicio Exterior, tuvo mejor suerte.

El proceso comienza con los investigadores que se comunican con personas con la COVID-19, y esas conversaciones generan contactos para los rastreadores.\n\nDespu\u00e9s de hacer esas llamadas, hay un trabajo de seguimiento para ayudar a la gente a encontrar recursos, como despensas de alimento y asistencia financiera.\n\n\"Les pedimos a las personas que se pongan en cuarentena cuando quiz\u00e1s no tienen f\u00f3rmula para beb\u00e9 para el d\u00eda siguiente, o tal vez no tengan comida para alimentar a una familia de ocho\", dijo Baez. \"Entonces, \u00bfc\u00f3mo podemos pedirles que se queden en casa si no tienen asistencia financiera y apoyo social?\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March.

Entre ellas hay trabajadores de la salud jubilados, empleados p\u00fablicos suspendidos y antiguos trabajadores de hoteler\u00eda.\n\n\"Si sus habilidades inform\u00e1ticas fallan un poco, podemos ayudar a mejorar eso\", dijo. \"Pero lo realmente importante en medio de una epidemia es la empat\u00eda\".\n\nContrace Public Health Corps, una organizaci\u00f3n que ayuda a los departamentos de salud en Estados Unidos a reclutar rastreadores, recibi\u00f3 m\u00e1s de 50.000 postulaciones en las \u00faltimas semanas, principalmente de mujeres, dijo Steve Water, el director ejecutivo.\n\nSi bien no siempre se requiere un diploma universitario, Waters dice que los mejores candidatos tienen una licenciatura y algunos antecedentes en servicios de atenci\u00f3n m\u00e9dica. La diversidad tambi\u00e9n es importante.\n\n\"La cultura general es clave para desarrollar confianza con alguien a quien est\u00e1s llamando sin que lo haya solicitado, en particular en comunidades de minor\u00edas o en dificultades, que son algunas de las m\u00e1s afectadas\", dijo Waters.\n\nA nivel nacional, el coronavirus est\u00e1 infectando y matando a las personas negras a unas tasas desproporcionadamente altas, reflejando desigualdades de larga data en recursos y acceso a la atenci\u00f3n.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nA few days after Amyiah Cohoon returned to Wisconsin from a school band trip to Florida in the middle of March, she developed a dry cough, a high fever and breathing problems. Amyiah, 16, was taken to the hospital twice, before being sent home and told to stay inside despite testing negative for the coronavirus.\n\nDuring her sickness, the Westfield Area High School sophomore posted on Instagram three times about what she still believed was a scary brush with Covid-19, hoping to alert others, including friends and family, to the danger. (Doctors have noted that negative results did not always mean someone was not infected.)\n\n\"I am still on breathing treatment but have beaten the coronavirus,\" Amyiah wrote in the third post on March 26. \"Stay home and be safe.\"\n\nThe next day, a sergeant showed up at the Cohoons' door.\n\nAccording to a police report included in the lawsuit, Amyiah's posts had made other parents at school \"upset.\" Amyiah would have to take the posts down or risk violating rules on disorderly conduct and be cited or arrested, according to the report.\n\nAmyiah deleted the posts immediately. But on Thursday, the Cohoons sued the Marquette County sheriff, Joseph R. Konrath, and the officer who showed up at the home, Sgt. Cameron Klump, accusing them of violating Amyiah's right to free speech.\n\n\"What they did was just outright outrageous,\" Amyiah, who said she has mostly recovered, said in an interview on Monday. \"It's not the right way to do it. They could have done it a different way. The school could have called our family saying, 'All right, is this stuff true? How is she doing?'\"\n\nThe lawsuit also asks for nominal damages -- \"a dollar or something small with an acknowledgment that constitutional rights were violated,\" said Luke Berg, Amyiah's lawyer and deputy counsel at the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, a conservative group that has been involved in high-profile battles over voter eligibility in the battleground state.\n\nThe lawsuit came almost two weeks after Mr. Berg sent a letter on April 3 to Sheriff Konrath requesting an apology.\n\nSamuel Hall, a lawyer for the sheriff and his sergeant, said in an emailed statement that Sheriff Konrath and Sergeant Klump denied that Amyiah was \"threatened with arrest or prosecution.\"\n\nMr. Hall told The Associated Press last week that Amyiah's messages \"caused distress and panic within the school system and law enforcement acted at the request of school health officials in a good faith effort to avoid unfounded panic.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump says he will suspend immigration, but provides few details about the plan. The record oil market collapse is continuing. Additional small business aid won't pass Congress until Thursday at the earliest. See more updates Updated 8m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThere have been more than 4,000 cases of the coronavirus in Wisconsin, according to data compiled by The New York Times; three of them are in Marquette County, which has a population of more than 15,000 and is roughly 100 miles northwest of Milwaukee.\n\nIn his police report, Sergeant Klump said Sheriff Konrath had heard about Amyiah's posts from the Marquette County Health Department.\n\nThe health department did not respond to requests for comment on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nIn a letter to parents on March 27, the same day the deputy knocked on the family's door, Bob Meicher, the administrator of the Westfield School District, acknowledged that \"there was a rumor floating out there that one of our students contracted Covid-19 while on the band trip to Florida two weeks ago.\"\n\n\"Let me assure you there is NO truth to this,\" Mr. Meicher wrote. \"This was a foolish means to get attention and the source of the rumor has been addressed.\"\n\nMr. Meicher said the head of the health department was involved in \"putting a stop to this nonsense.\"\n\nThe school district did not respond to requests for comment on Monday or Tuesday.\n\nAfter developing the dry cough and fever, Amyiah's mother first took her to a nearby hospital, on March 22, a week after returning from the band trip to Universal Studios and Disney World, according to the lawsuit. The doctors said that Amyiah did not meet the criteria to be tested at the time but that she had symptoms consistent with Covid-19, according to the lawsuit.\n\nShe was sent back to her home in Oxford, Wis., and the Cohoon family was directed to quarantine for 14 days, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIt was then, according to the lawsuit, that Amyiah posted the first update on Instagram: \"Hey guys... sorry I've been on a long break.. I wont be back for a while longer due to me noe having the COVID-19 virus... I don't want the attention its just the truth... I am now in self quarantine and am not allowrd to leave my room and have an inhaler since they said to go home... best of wishes. love you guys.\"\n\nFor a few days, it seemed Amyiah would get better, her father, Richard Cohoon, said in an interview on Monday. But on March 25, her symptoms worsened again, and her mother took her to the emergency room at a hospital in Portage, Wis. She was taken in an ambulance to a hospital in Madison, after which Amyiah posted again on Instagram, saying that she was \"in the ER\" and \"might need to stay.\"\n\nAmyiah was tested for the coronavirus and the test came back negative the next day. Some coronavirus tests are known to miss infections and, according to the lawsuit, doctors told the family that \"Amyiah still likely had Covid-19 and had missed the window for testing positive.\"\n\nShe returned home the next day and wrote the third post on Instagram.\n\nOn Monday, nearly four weeks after her hospital stay, Amyiah said she had mostly recovered from her sickness. She is still a little tired, she said, but her strength is back.\n\n\"I'm feeling a lot better,\" she said.",

        "body": "With most bars still takeout only, indoor gatherings discouraged and the weather warmer, Americans are sipping and strolling.\n\nEarlier this month, as the state of Texas was about to ease its stay-at-home restrictions, Pam LeBlanc pulled her wedding dress out of a vacuum-sealed box, put it on for the first time in 21 years, poured herself a glass of prosecco, strapped on some heels, walked out of her house in Austin, and began twirling in the middle of the street.\n\nShe'd been doing some version of this for about 40 days, a period during which she and most Americans were unable to hunker down at their favorite watering hole and let a professional bartender pour them a drink.\n\n\"I decided that every day we were going to shelter in place, I was going to put on some kind of dress and go out in the street with a cocktail,\" said Ms. LeBlanc, 56, an outdoorsy freelance journalist not normally given to swanky garb. \"It was my way of flipping off the coronavirus.\"\n\nWith both bars and gyms closed, such drinking and walking -- or \"walktailing\" -- has been occurring at a seemingly unprecedented rate.\n\nIt's not legal to saunter down sidewalks with open containers in the vast majority of American cities, but police have recently chosen to look the other way when it comes to issuing citations.\n\n\"That has just not been a primary enforcement focus for us,\" said Lauren Truscott of the Seattle Police Department. \"We're really trying to limit exposure between officers and citizens, so I think that would fall into that nonemergent category where people aren't harming themselves or other people.\" (The website Eater recently called for the permanent legalization of takeout cocktails, adding that open-container enforcement has traditionally been racially biased.)\n\nDrinks to go have become so prevalent in many cities that there is even a designer, in New Orleans, selling masks with straw holes in them, The New York Post reported.\n\n\"It's tough to keep my dog on his leash, hold my drink and bend down to pick up his poop,\" said Scott Cornick, 45, a bond trader who lives near the South Street Seaport. \"City life.\"\n\nOn a recent Saturday, the restaurant Evelina in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn sold 470 cocktails to go, said Kaitlin Marron, 25, a manager there. She said the restaurant would typically sell 170 of the sit-down variety during the same span in pre-pandemic times.\n\n\"Our business is based on weather,\" said Ms. Marron, whose restaurant is a few blocks from a park. \"Whenever we have a Saturday that lines up with a sunny day, it's like a full-on Brooklyn block party out here.\" While food sales are \"a fraction of what they used to be,\" she added, \"we're definitely happy given the current situation and that people are drinking more.\"\n\nTexas has long had a congenial walktail culture because \"Texas is Texas,\" said Jenny Nielsen, 51, a therapy farmer who lives just outside Austin with her husband. \"Alcohol does a lot of things for us, some positive and some negative, but it lets off steam, it's social, it's a stress reliever, it lightens the mood.\"\n\nThe stay-at-home mandate, she said, if you're not affected by the virus, \"feels a little bit like you're on vacation. The alarm clock isn't as necessary. Demands upon your time are lifted, so it's like, 'Why not have a drink at 3 p.m.? Why not have a drink of 10 a.m.?'\"\n\nWill Rhodes sells pickled okra and green beans in nearby Lockhart; basically, he's \"in the Bloody Mary business.\" Because bars have been closed, he's been pulling shifts at a local liquor store, Bevies Fine Wine & Spirits, where it's been \"like the day before Thanksgiving every day\" lately, with 30 vehicles passing through the drive-through each hour.\n\nMany of those rigs wind up in the parking lot of a closed funeral home next door, and for the past few Fridays, Mr. Rhodes has performed a D.J. set from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m. in front of Bevies, complete with a smoke machine and laser lights.\n\n\"People will get in the beds of their pickup trucks 30 yards away from the next truck while I spin records,\" said Mr. Rhodes, 47, who used to live in New Orleans, where people walktail with impunity. \"I'll get requests from people who are just drinking in their yard. No one's complaining, and the cops have yet to show up.\"\n\nBusiness has been similarly brisk for Ashley Trout, 38, the founder and winemaker at Vital Wines and Brook & Bull Cellars in Walla Walla, Wash., which sells bottles in the $38 to $58 range.\n\n\"We're sold out of everything,\" she said. \"People are taking advantage of this moment by breaking all the rules that they won't be able to break in the future. Walktailing would absolutely fit into that category. People are drinking starting at noon. If it really is 'the end of the world of as we know it, we're going to feel fine.'\"\n\nIn Seattle, the site of America's first coronavirus outbreak and one of its longest stay-at-home orders, Stephanie Huske, 42, and her husband, Dave Huske, 44, have been enjoying cocktails in their front yard starting at 3:30 every afternoon. When their dog requires walking, Mr. Huske makes no effort to conceal his Crown Royal in a clear glass with ice.\n\n\"Less than 10 percent try to conceal it,\" said Ms. Huske, a freelance advertising producer. \"The first couple weeks, you'd see people you'd never seen before walking by with their kid, dogs and strollers. And then, two or three weeks in, there was a marked switch to walking with cocktails.\"\n\n\"I've seen people out with goblets of wine and they don't care,\" said Phil Miller, 40, a financial adviser whose \"whiskey walks\" around the Ravenna neighborhood of Seattle have increased in frequency since his entertainment options became more limited. \"It's better than staring at your front yard.\"\n\nJustin Freet, 48, a bartender in Seattle, lives near an elderly woman who is \"always walking her dog\" and used to \"terrorize\" his son. But, recently, he noticed \"the unmistakable smell of Two-Buck Chuck\" on her breath.\n\n\"She was so sweet,\" said Mr. Freet, who hosts a podcast called \"How to Be a Better Drinker.\" \"I'm thinking this apocalypse is bringing out the good in all of us.\"\n\nBut is it all good?\n\nKristen Anderson, a professor of psychology at Reed College in Oregon who specializes in addictive behavior, is nervous. \"One of the things I'm really worried about is that people are drinking to cope with this pandemic,\" she said. \"I'm concerned that there's going to be a subpopulation within that group who've learned that this is their coping mechanism, and now they've gotten used to drinking at home alone. So there are concerns with what this is going to mean to us down the line with health care and addictions services. Calls to alcohol and drug hotlines are really high right now.\"\n\nYet, strangely, with all this epic boozing going on, some people are reporting less severe hangovers. Maybe they're drinking more water or eating more while they drink.\n\nOr, as Drew Silva, 33, a St. Louis resident who writes about fantasy baseball for NBC Sports, posited, \"I don't indulge in as many sugary drinks when I drink at home. I keep it pretty simple with a beer or a vodka-water. I'm not taking some shot that someone bought me.\"\n\nDr. Richard Ries, the director of Harborview Medical Center's addiction division at the University of Washington, theorized rather that Americans are now mimicking a French or Mediterranean mode of drinking, \"built around having small to medium amounts of wine at lunch or snacks and dinner,\" rather than compressing their drinking in evenings or weekends as they did pre-quarantine.\n\n\"The hypothesis is that if you drink it in a shorter period of time, you're much more likely to get intoxicated,\" Dr. Ries said. \"And if you push a toxic level higher in your brain, you're more likely to get a hangover. A hangover is essentially a bruise in your brain caused by alcohol.\"\n\nAnd, these days, what with the manifold symptoms of coronavirus, a hangover that feels like death may prove to be a false positive for death itself.\n\n\"I woke up with this hangover about a week ago that was gnarly,\" said Mr. Freet, himself an avid walktailer. \"I know what a hangover is, but I was feeling under the weather and headachy and started attributing it to Covid-19. One part of me knew it was a hangover, but there was this little voice that was having a panic attack. But I was like, 'No, man, you drank half a bottle of Old Forester last night.'\"",

        "body": "Tens of thousands of people across the United States have applied for the job of cold-calling strangers who may have been exposed to Covid-19. Here's what it's like.\n\nWhen Jessica Jaramillo calls someone to talk about the coronavirus, she usually starts with something like this:\n\n\"Hi, my name is Jessica. I'm calling on behalf of the San Francisco Department of Public Health. I'm part of a contact-tracing team, and our job is to reach people who have come into close contact with someone who has been diagnosed with Covid-19.\"\n\nMs. Jaramillo, 41, a San Francisco Public Library district manager in ordinary times, has made dozens of such calls so far, all in Spanish. She began contact tracing, or \"seguimiento de contactos,\" this month.\n\nShe is one of more than 11,000 people across the United States who are calling people with advice about containing the spread of Covid-19, according to a survey conducted by NPR. (That number has most likely grown since the survey was first conducted in April.)\n\nEstimates for the number of people needed nationwide for contact tracing range from 100,000 to as high as 300,000.\n\nThe work is mostly phone-based and can be done from home. The jobs can be full- or part-time, often with an hourly wage of $17 to $25; some include benefits. They differ from one place to the next in part because training and recruiting efforts have largely fallen to state and local governments (and some of the programs have already run into problems, both practical and political).\n\nAs communities begin to open up and more people venture outside their homes, the job is expected to become more crucial -- and more difficult.\n\n\"If you can do contact tracing, you can get ahold of this before it runs through a community like wildfire,\" Ms. Jaramillo said. \"Then you're saving someone's grandmother, or their uncle.\"\n\nTaking an 'old school' approach\n\nAs a public employee who had signed up to be a disaster service worker, Ms. Jaramillo was ready to serve her community in the event of, say, an earthquake. She did not expect a pandemic.\n\nMs. Jaramillo's phone conversations unfold according to the needs of the people on the other end of the line. If they need testing for Covid-19, she can refer them for an appointment. If they have symptoms, she might recommend isolation. If they worry about survival in quarantine, she can connect them with food-delivery services.\n\nAnd if they worry about privacy, Ms. Jaramillo assures them that their information is secure. Her training involved a primer on the federal regulations protecting confidential health information, and she works with encrypted software. Ms. Jaramillo and other San Francisco contact tracers do not share the names of people who have a Covid-19 diagnosis with the people they call.\n\nThe University of California, San Francisco, has been working with both the city and the state to train hundreds of workers like Ms. Jaramillo.\n\n\"Contact tracing is not a silver bullet,\" said Dr. Mike Reid, an assistant professor at the U.C.S.F. School of Medicine.\n\nBut he said the \"old school\" approach of San Francisco and other health departments -- which is based on education and empowerment, not tracking apps like the ones Google and Apple are working on -- can bring communities together and build capacity to handle future crises.\n\nIt's a competitive job market\n\nIn a time of isolation, there's something appealing about a job that calls for human connection. And for some, the work is a way to punch back at a pandemic that has pummeled the national economy.\n\nBut even if hundreds of thousands of people are hired as contact tracers, it would put barely a dent in unemployment; more than 36 million jobless claims were filed in the United States over the last two months.\n\nAnd the opportunities vary from state to state; Massachusetts and California were among the earliest to adopt widespread Covid-19 tracing programs.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. W.H.O. gathers to push for global coordination amid a deepening rift between the U.S. and China. The first coronavirus vaccine tested in people appears to be safe and generates an immune response. Firms face tough choices: Today is the deadline to decide whether to return government loans. See more updates Updated 32m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nKevin Williams, 27, a writer and driver in Columbus, Ohio, thought he would give contact tracing a shot after the state's Department of Health announced last week that it was hiring at $18.59 per hour.\n\n\"If they call me back and I get an interview, then great,\" he said. \"I really don't have a hell of a lot of options right now. But also, I just don't feel like these jobs are real. Are they actually contact tracing, or do they just want to look like they're doing the right thing?\"\n\nHe did not hear back, and by Tuesday, the job posting on the Health Department's website had been removed. Over 9,000 people applied to do contact-tracing work with the state, according to the department.\n\nAnd although Ohio officials have called for 1,700 contact tracers, those were to be deployed largely by local health departments. The state job Mr. Williams applied for had been seeking only 100 people.\n\nOscar Baez, 33, a Foreign Service officer, had better luck. He was evacuated from his post in Jerusalem in March and returned to Boston, where he grew up.\n\nMr. Baez, who is from the Dominican Republic, has used Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic to communicate with the people he calls in the Boston area.\n\n\"This is an opportunity to go on offense, track down exposures to this virus and limit the spread,\" he said. \"It requires heart.\"\n\nContract tracers don't work alone. The process starts with investigators who reach out to people with Covid-19, and those conversations yield contacts for tracers.\n\nAfter those calls are made, there is follow-up work to be done to help people find resources like food pantries and financial assistance.\n\n\"We're asking people to quarantine when they may not have baby formula for the next day, or they might not have food to feed a family of eight,\" Mr. Baez said. \"So how can we ask them to stay home if they don't have financial assistance and social support?\"\n\nWhat makes a good candidate?\n\nMr. Baez found this job through Partners in Health, which has helped Massachusetts officials recruit and train more than 1,700 people. That's only a fraction of the more than 41,000 who have applied through the organization.\n\nJohn Welch, a director of operations with Partners in Health, said he was impressed with the range of people who wanted to help. They included retired health care workers, furloughed public employees and former hospitality workers.\n\n\"If their computer skills are lacking a little bit, we can help boost that,\" he said. \"But what's really important in the middle of an epidemic is empathy.\"\n\nContrace Public Health Corps, an organization helping health departments across the United States recruit tracers, received more than 50,000 applications in recent weeks, mostly from women, said Steve Waters, the chief executive.\n\nWhile a college diploma is not always required, Mr. Waters said the best candidates have a bachelor's degree and some background in health care services.\n\nDiversity is important, too.\n\n\"Cultural literacy is key to developing trust with someone you are cold-calling, particularly in minority or distressed communities, which are some of the worst hit,\" Mr. Waters said.\n\nNationally, the coronavirus is infecting and killing black people at disproportionately high rates, reflecting longstanding inequalities in resources and access to care. The virus has also brought deadly disease clusters and economic crises to Native American reservations across the United States.\n\nMs. Jaramillo's Spanish fluency has been particularly helpful in California, where over 50 percent of the people known to have been infected are Latino.\n\nAnd Mr. Baez, whose diplomatic career has taken him to countries including Haiti, China and Brazil, is now putting his skills to use in the neighborhood where he grew up, speaking to immigrant families much like his own.\n\n\"I see the date they tested positive, and it's at the same community health center that I went to for physicals as a kid,\" he said. \"Every single day is different. I'm hearing many, many individual stories that are depressing, inspiring and uplifting all at the same time.\"",

Estoy en contacto con redes de intensivistas de Italia y Espa\u00f1a y compartimos experiencias que no habr\u00edamos imaginado.

Es distinto del caso de Guayaquil, la capital comercial del pa\u00eds. Ah\u00ed, la crisis se ha acumulado: los hospitales est\u00e1n rebasados, los servicios funerarios est\u00e1n colapsados y las muertes aumentaron a un ritmo desalentador.\n\nAhora, contagiado y haciendo la cuarentena forzosa, pienso mucho en mis colegas en Guayaquil; me conmueve su esfuerzo monumental, su valent\u00eda.\n\nLos m\u00e9dicos intensivistas estamos entrenados para las decisiones duras. Solemos trabajar con pacientes que se debaten entre la vida y la muerte. Pero a\u00fan as\u00ed, ni siquiera nosotros -- o algunos de nosotros -- est\u00e1bamos preparados emocionalmente para esta crisis, para las deliberaciones dif\u00edciles que debemos tomar de manera r\u00e1pida y asertiva, para el cansancio f\u00edsico y an\u00edmico y la posibilidad inminente de contagiarnos y a nuestras familias.\n\nPero con el paso de los d\u00edas, m\u00e9dicos, enfermeros, auxiliares y administrativos hemos tenido que vencer los miedos.\n\nAunque hacerlo no ha sido sencillo, ayuda saber que no estamos solos. Cuando recib\u00ed mi prueba positiva, sab\u00eda que el m\u00edo no era un caso aislado. Muchos trabajadores de la salud antes que yo han estado en mi lugar. Sab\u00eda, como todos en el hospital, que as\u00ed pas\u00f3 en Italia y Espa\u00f1a. Estamos en la primera l\u00ednea de batalla. Luego de jornadas interminables en los que debemos usar prendas de protecci\u00f3n inc\u00f3modas pero indispensables, he visto en los rostros de mis colegas ansiedad y hasta l\u00e1grimas. Tambi\u00e9n he visto determinaci\u00f3n y resiliencia.\n\nAmbas cualidades ser\u00e1n muy necesarias ahora. Es inquietante enfrentarse a una enfermedad nueva: vamos a ciegas en cuanto a un tratamiento espec\u00edfico contra el virus SARS-CoV-2. No tenemos estudios rigurosos en humanos y hay incertidumbre respecto a la evoluci\u00f3n que va a tener en los pacientes que presentan la enfermedad de manera m\u00e1s agresiva.\n\nQuiz\u00e1s no lo sabes, pero en las unidades de cuidados intensivos el mundo se cierra a un sistema muy peque\u00f1o: el enfermo grave, el familiar del paciente, el m\u00e9dico y el equipo que los atienden. Entre todos conformamos una relaci\u00f3n que, caso a caso, pone a prueba nuestra paciencia y hasta nuestra vocaci\u00f3n. Pero tambi\u00e9n la fortalece. Ah\u00ed he podido conocer la potencia del cari\u00f1o que las familias sienten por sus parientes enfermos. Y es particularmente dif\u00edcil ahora, mientras lidiamos con un virus tan contagioso, que los enfermos deben estar tan aislados como sea posible. Los familiares deben permanecer a distancia y el personal m\u00e9dico debe tomar muchas precauciones. La posibilidad de brindarnos cari\u00f1o mutuo se reduce.\n\nUna de las situaciones m\u00e1s arduas de esta contingencia es que nos vemos forzados a comunicarnos con las familias por medios electr\u00f3nicos. Comunicar noticias malas o terribles a trav\u00e9s de un aparato electr\u00f3nico tiene una cualidad impersonal que no anticipaba. Hemos perdido la posibilidad de abrazarnos y llorar juntos.

        "body": "UPDATE Includes confirmed and probable cases where available\n\nThere have been at least 218,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Spain, according to the Spanish Ministry of Health. As of Monday evening, 25,428 people had died.\n\nHere's how the number of cases are growing in Spain:\n\nSpanish authorities have begun to loosen the nationwide lockdown in place since mid-March, one of the world's strictest, which only allowed people outside to walk their dogs or shop for groceries. In the last week of April, children under 14 years old were permitted to go outside for the first time in six weeks, and Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez announced a plan to return to normalcy by the end of June. As part of his plan, Prime Minister S\u00e1nchez wants Parliament to approve an extension of the current state of emergency beyond May 9, but his minority government is facing strong criticism from opposition parties for its handling of the crisis.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has severely damaged Spain's image as one of the healthiest nations in the world, which has long boasted a robust universal health care system and the highest life expectancy in the European Union. The pandemic has knocked out thousands of the country's health workers, who make up nearly 20 percent of its confirmed coronavirus cases, the highest reported share in the world. Among the grim episodes of the crisis, an ice rink in Madrid was converted into a temporary morgue, and soldiers found abandoned or dead residents in their nursing home beds.\n\nHere's how the number of new cases and deaths are changing over time:\n\nThe New York Times has found that official tallies in the United States and in more than a dozen other countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability.\n\nSpanish authorities have changed their data collection method several times since March, creating confusion over the actual number of confirmed cases in the country. On April 16, the health ministry started to include results from antibody tests in its daily tallies of confirmed cases, only to retract them a week later. Antibody tests, authorities said, don't reflect new infections, because they \"do not determine whether the person developed the disease, how long it has been since he or she has developed immunity.\"\n\nSince April 24, the tally of confirmed cases includes data obtained from PCR diagnostic tests only, which caused a drop in the number of known infections, from around 220,000 to just over 200,000.\n\nSpain, like most countries, is only counting fatalities of those who have tested positive for coronavirus. The Madrid region and Catalonia, the country's worst hit areas, have started to report \"confirmed or suspected\" coronavirus deaths provided by funeral homes in daily updates, but those updated numbers are not included in the daily death tolls published by Spain's health ministry. The regional numbers there include deaths in nursing homes and suggest that the death toll is far higher than reported so far.\n\nSpain has also faced an acute shortage of test kits, and has not tested those who don't present symptoms. Over a million tests had been performed as of late April, including 40,000 a day in recent weeks, according to authorities. But Spanish news outlets have questioned such figures.\n\nRead more about Spain's overwhelmed nursing homes, and watch how unprotected health workers, who have called themselves \"health care kamikazes,\" have made their own equipment. Police officers have played guitar in the streets daily, and Spainards organized elaborate Good Friday celebrations from their balconies.\n\nHere is where you can find more detailed information:",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nVALDERROBRES, Spain -- The deafening rumble rose from the depths of the countryside, a welcome yet unnerving sign of life in a corner of northeastern Spain, where villages perched on craggy hills overlook vineyards and fields of olive and almond trees.\n\nAt the wheel of his tractor, a farmer disinfected the narrow streets of the village of Valderrobres, with a spreader normally used to fertilize his fields. The breeze sent flowerpots and chairs flying, but it didn't matter. There was a virus to kill.\n\n\"Everything here arrives later,\" said the farmer, Miguel Angel Caldu, about the initial lack of testing kits and protective equipment in the area. Half of the health workers at the local nursing home tested positive for the coronavirus, and so did nearly 50 of the 60 residents, 12 of whom have died.\n\nSo every evening, locals like Mr. Caldu have been cleaning places like Valderrobres, a tourist town of about 2,400 people that is known for its 14th-century gothic castle and stone bridge.\n\n\"If we don't take care of ourselves, nobody will,\" he said.\n\nIn terms of deaths, the coronavirus pandemic has hit Spain harder than every European country but Italy and has ravaged large cities such as Barcelona and Madrid. Less noticed has been the plight of villages. Their isolation may offer some protection against contagion, but once the coronavirus strikes, it can reveal the particular vulnerabilities that smaller communities face.\n\nIn Spain, despite a robust health care system and one of the highest life expectancy levels in Europe, rural areas have suffered from aging health care infrastructure and a lack of doctors, after decades of urbanization and a lack of public investment.\n\nRural areas also have an abundance of older adults. In Teruel, the province in a remote corner of Aragon that contains Valderrobres, they make up a quarter of the population. Villages in the region, many with centuries-old ramparts overlooking the countryside, now have the appearance of boarded-up fortresses trying to keep their aged populations safe.\n\nIn other rural areas, such as the province of Soria, in the neighboring region of Castile and Le\u00f3n, outbreaks overwhelmed for weeks the only hospital with intensive care units. Such rural stretches of Spain have among the lowest population density levels in Europe, and many there have long complained about being neglected and cut off by the national authorities.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Lifting restrictions means 'balancing lives against livelihoods,' W.H.O. warns. China rejects growing calls for compensation over pandemic. Infections grow among medical workers in Afghanistan, threatening a struggling health system. See more updates Updated 2h ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nIn one village in Teruel, the only doctor in the area interrupted his weekly visits after he had to go into isolation; in another, the only grocery store closed for days after the shopkeeper left.\n\nIn Valderrobres, where the closest hospital with intensive care in the region is two hours away, the health authorities initially refused to test those at the nursing home who didn't have symptoms, said the mayor, Carlos Bon\u00e9, even as it became the epicenter of a local outbreak.\n\nWhen Mr. Bon\u00e9 bought tests and discovered that two-thirds of the staff and residents had the virus, the regional authorities rejected the results because they came from a private lab, and then conducted their own tests a week later.\n\n\"In villages, it's always 'It will arrive soon,' or 'You will get this shortly,'\" Mr. Bon\u00e9 said. \"In the meantime, we're risking lives, and here, 35 workers are 35 people you know.\"\n\nMr. Bon\u00e9, a former nurse, worked in the nursing home for two straight weeks because most of its nurses have had to isolate themselves at some point and he couldn't find replacements.\n\nLike many other European countries, Spain has struggled to contain the spread of the coronavirus in many parts of its territory. Unions are taking the authorities to court after thousands of health care workers became infected. Soldiers have found residents abandoned or dead in nursing homes. But in remote areas, the crisis has accentuated a perception that the right to health care might differ depending on where a person lives.\n\n\"In the areas that may have been neglected, the feeling of abandonment can be as much emotional as it is material,\" said Sergio del Molino, a novel writer and journalist who has coined the expression \"Espa\u00f1a vac\u00eda,\" or \"empty Spain,\" to refer to the draining away of people and skilled workers, and the hollowing out of infrastructure, especially in rural areas.\n\nConfinement measures enforced throughout Europe have plunged other rural areas into similar situations. In a small village in the Lombardy region, the epicenter of Italy's outbreak, a ban on leaving a town without a health or work reason has forced the national agency managing the crisis response to make multiple trips per day to the closest supermarket to bring food to locals there.\n\nIn France, which has long struggled against a shortage of doctors in some rural areas, an organization representing small towns has recommended that municipal employees deliver bread and groceries to aging populations.\n\nIn Spain, Aragon has received roughly as many tests per inhabitant as the Madrid region, the epicenter of Spain's outbreak, but half as many masks per inhabitant. And mayors of isolated villages in Teruel argue that the masks that have been sent have mostly gone to Aragon's larger cities.\n\n\"There is an advantage in isolation, distance provides protection,\" said Angel Paniagua, a researcher at the National Research Council of Spain, who has studied the country's most isolated regions. \"But when the virus hits, you're left with your own problems.\"\n\nMr. del Molino, the author and journalist, said that resources had dwindled in many rural areas after health care was gradually decentralized to the regions in the 1980s and '90s.\n\nIn the province of Soria, about 120 miles north of Madrid, a death rate of more than one per 1,000 inhabitants has been more than double the national average. Local politicians have denounced the shortage of doctors after the hospital in the city of Soria had to almost triple intensive care capacity but without any extra staff. \"We are not fighting this virus with the same weapons\" as in the bigger cities, Soria's mayor Carlos Mart\u00ednez said in a telephone interview.\n\nRegional authorities reported 44 confirmed coronavirus deaths in Soria in March, but Mr. Mart\u00ednez said that the toll was surely higher. Total deaths from all causes in the province that month was nearly 250, he noted, up from 83 over the same period in 2019. \"The numbers don't add up,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Mr. del Molino, \"When you had a serious health condition in Soria, you were sent to Zaragoza or Madrid,\" referring to hospitals in larger cities. \"The pressure could be rationed in normal times, but it's been impossible with overwhelmed hospitals,\" he added. Weeks into the crisis, neighboring regions have taken in patients from Soria.\n\nIn the province of Teruel, more than 500 cases have been detected, and more than 60 people have died. On a recent afternoon at the nursing home in Valderrobres, Esther Pitart, an 81-year-old resident who tested positive days earlier, sat in an ambulance, ready to be transferred to a center with more resources. \"I'll come back stronger,\" she said with a grin as she coughed and clenched her fist.\n\nIt has proved hard to know who is infected, as those who have the virus or symptoms fear stigmatization, locals say. In one village, some health workers isolated themselves in secret. \"It's a taboo for us, many people are not reporting their symptoms,\" said Maria Teresa Criville Herrero, the mayor of Lled\u00f3, a village with less than 200 residents.\n\n\"That's the upside and downside of life in a village,\" said Maria Dolores Pascual Lahoz, the manager of the nursing home in Valderrobres. \"Someone will always give you a hand.\" But she added that since the beginning of the outbreak at the nursing home, locals were also looking at employees with caution.\n\nFor those who have been contaminated, that has made the weight of isolation heavier, they say. \"You can feel the virus in the air, and you just feel so powerless,\" Conchita Esteve, an employee at the nursing home who tested positive, said from the doorstep of her apartment. \"For the elders, and for yourself.\"\n\nSamuel Aranda contributed reporting from Valderrobres, Spain; and Emma Bubola from Milan.",

And when the doors swooshed open, half of them had no intention of getting off.\n\nJust after 10:30 p.m., a female transit worker leaned in close to a man who was slumped in a seat against a railing. He was wearing a large hooded jacket and had a dark scarf wrapped around his mouth.\n\n\"Wake up!\" the woman shouted.\n\nThe man didn't flinch. It took another worker rapping the railing with a metal tool to get him to stand up.\n\nThe man, who gave his name only as Victor C., said in an interview on the platform that staying on the train was a point of pride: \"People not wanting to burden their family, not wanting to count on the government.\"\n\n\"What works for you may not work for me,\" he added.\n\nGenerations of homeless people have used New York City's subway as protection against the elements and a place to unsoundly sleep.\n\nBut with little access to showers or medical care, they have become a health hazard during the coronavirus pandemic. And with ridership down 92 percent, images of them splayed across otherwise empty cars have become searing symbols of the city's precarious condition.\n\nSo on Thursday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, Mayor Bill de Blasio and transit officials reached a consensus: Putting the city on track to eventual reopening, and restoring public confidence in public transportation, required an extraordinary step.\n\nBeginning on Wednesday, a subway system famous for never shutting down will close each night during the pandemic from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., allowing time for intensive cleaning and disinfecting while also eliminating the overnight refuge that some homeless people depend on.\n\nMr. Cuomo and Mr. de Blasio said they would work to help them get shelter.\n\n\"It's an unacceptable reality and this new plan will disrupt that unacceptable reality and allow us to actually get help to people more effectively,\" Mr. de Blasio said.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Schools across N.Y. State will stay closed through the end of the school year, Cuomo says. New Jersey is now reporting more virus deaths per day than New York.

See more updates Updated 8h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nAlthough no one keeps an official daily count, transit workers and homeless New Yorkers said they believed more homeless people were on the subway these days, because other public gathering spots had closed and because they feared the very places where officials want them to go.\n\nIn the dormitory-style shelters where single adults sleep just a few arms' lengths from one another, there seems to be no escape from the virus. More than 60 homeless people have died in the outbreak; nearly three out of every four were single adults who had stayed in shelters where multiple people shared rooms and bathrooms.\n\nAt the same time, almost 100 Metropolitan Transportation Authority employees have died. Many were bus drivers and train operators, all working in confined spaces where multiple people sneeze and cough and grip the same metal poles.\n\nNo passengers have stirred more public fear than those who, often because of mental illness, are unable to keep themselves clean.\n\nWithout the shutdown, cleanup crews now have about 10 to 15 minutes to scrub down cars before a train turns around, said David Duarte, a cleaner based at the Stillwell Avenue Station in Coney Island, Brooklyn, one of the largest elevated terminals in the world.\n\nMr. Duarte said that he and four co-workers now put on hazmat suits, masks and gloves before starting work.\n\n\"There can be feces, urine, a lot of trash,\" he said. \"The more homeless are in there, the harder it is to clean the train.\"\n\nThe cleaner at the last stop on the No. 2 line on Wednesday night said that homeless people had cursed her, tried to fight her and spit at her when she asked them to leave the train. Now, she works quickly, paying attention to any symptoms people who refuse to leave are showing.\n\n\"I try to keep my mask on and the doors open,\" said the woman, who declined to give her name because she was not authorized to speak to a reporter. \"And if I hear anybody cough I just run out.\"\n\nSarah Feinberg, the interim president of New York City Transit, said in a statement that \"the subway system should not be used as a substitute for shelter.\"\n\n\"It's not good for our customers, it's not good for our workers, and it's not good for homeless New Yorkers who deserve much, much better care,\" she said.\n\nFor decades, the concentration of homeless people on New York's streets and trains has been viewed as an indicator of the health of the city itself. Despite growing numbers of homeless people in recent years, a boom in tax revenue has allowed the mayor to meet a legal requirement to place most of them in shelters, apartments and, in recent weeks, thousands of hotel rooms.\n\nBut with the M.T.A. experiencing deep declines in ridership, the presence of homeless people in the absence of almost all other passengers has made subway cars appear to be nothing so much as rolling shelters.\n\nOn Tuesday, Mr. Cuomo called images of unkempt homeless people on trains \"disgusting.\" The remark struck some people as insensitive, but it reflected a broader worry that the authority will have a hard time persuading the millions of daily riders who used the system before the pandemic to trust public transportation again.\n\nThe city and the authority have already been moving more aggressively to remove homeless people from the subway, trying to coax them into shelters and also checking whether they have virus symptoms and might need hospitalization. As is often the case with such outreach efforts, what it looks like depends on which side of the subway doors you are on.\n\nTo officials, the nightly descent of police officers, transit employees and homeless services workers into the system is a concerted attempt to restore order and get the most down-and-out the help they desperately need. To homeless people and their advocates, it is an intimidating show of force that tramples individual rights and merely sweeps a problem outside without addressing its root causes.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we understand this is a very dangerous situation people are going through,\" said Donte Johnson, 47, who has lived on the A and D trains for about three years. \"But before this, homeless people were already going through a dangerous situation.\"\n\nA woman who rode into the Wakefield station on Wednesday, surrounded by trash bags that took up an entire end bench and all the floor space around it, said she resented the way authority officials and the police had treated her. She said they had thrown out some of her bags. And the shelters the city was trying to get her into, she said, were hazardous.\n\n\"The shelters are full of the virus,\" she said, a surgical mask flapping from one ear beneath a black ball cap decorated with colorful ribbons and a sleigh bell. The rest of her clothes were ragged.\n\nThe woman, who declined to give her name and identified herself only as over 65, said her trick for keeping people away from her is to act sick, or erratic. She had taken to yelling at anyone she rode the train with -- some tended to be homeless as well -- who was not wearing a mask. It had kept her physically distanced, she said.\n\nAll things considered, she said, she felt better protected on the subway than just about anywhere else.\n\n\"It's safer,\" she said. \"There's nobody on the train.\"\n\nThe city is trying to mitigate the health risk at shelters by moving thousands of people into hotel rooms that are empty because of a lack of tourists. Urban Justice Center, an advocacy group, said the city had not opened enough rooms; the group has raised about $60,000 for more.\n\nGina, a 53-year-old woman who did not want to use her last name to protect her identity, moved into a hotel room about two weeks ago. The subway had been her home for more than a year. To wash up, she would buy a cup of coffee or soda from a shop where she could use the bathroom. She kept her belongings in a storage unit.\n\nNow, she doesn't want to ride the subway because of the health risk. Nor does she want to go into a shelter system where people tend to be close together and where, she said, she was once sexually assaulted.\n\n\"There are a lot of people who are like me,\" said Gina, who lost her job working at a call center in March. \"Why would they send you to a shelter where people have Covid? I won't do it. I'm still afraid.\"\n\nVictor C., the man hustled off the No. 2 train on Wednesday, said he began living on the subway about five years ago after his mother died. He said he worked in construction, had \"no issues\" and refused to enter the shelter system. \"You don't get the help you need,\" he said.\n\nAnd he had no intention of going to a shelter now. After getting kicked off the train, he waited for 20 minutes, and then shuffled onto a train headed south toward Manhattan.\n\nChristina Goldbaum contributed reporting.",

        "body": "Most of the 48 I.C.U. patients studied had pre-existing medical conditions, including two who died. Eighteen of the children were put on ventilators.\n\nAs concern grows over the potential for children to become seriously ill from the coronavirus, a new study paints the most detailed picture yet of American children who were treated in intensive care units throughout the United States as the pandemic was taking hold in the country.\n\nNone of the children in the study, published Monday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, were stricken by the new mysterious inflammatory syndrome linked to the coronavirus that can cause life-threatening cardiac issues in children. They suffered from the virus's primary line of attack: the severe respiratory problems that have afflicted tens of thousands of American adults.\n\nThe study looked at 48 cases from 14 hospitals, infants up to age 21, during late March and early April. Two of the children died. Eighteen were placed on ventilators and two of them remain on the breathing machines more than a month later, said Dr. Lara S. Shekerdemian, chief of critical care at Texas Children's Hospital, and an author of the study.\n\nOver all, the study both reinforces the evidence that only a small percentage of children will be severely affected by the virus and confirms that some can become devastatingly ill.\n\n\"You can read this either like a half-empty glass or a half-full glass,\" said Dr. Daniele De Luca, the president-elect of the European Society for Pediatric and Neonatal Intensive Care, who was not involved in the study. \"At the end of the day, we have to realize that this disease can actually be serious in children. It's not like in the beginning when some people said, OK, this is never going to happen.\"\n\nThe vast majority of the patients -- 40 children, including the two who died -- had pre-existing medical conditions. Nearly half of those patients had complex developmental disorders like cerebral palsy or lifelong technology-dependent treatments like tracheostomies or feeding tubes, children \"who have trouble walking, talking, eating, breathing,\" Dr. Shekerdemian said. Other pre-existing health issues included cancer and suppressed immune systems from organ transplants or immunological conditions.\n\nPerhaps because it was so early in the pandemic, none of the children in the study displayed the newly identified pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, which experts believe may be a latent condition that develops weeks after the initial coronavirus infection and assaults a child's circulatory system with inflammation rather than directly attacking the lungs. Over the weekend, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York reported that three children in the state have died of that illness, and last week the journal Lancet reported a death in England.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The spread of the virus in the White House complicates Trump's push to reopen the country. A new study offers most complete details to date of American children seriously sickened by the virus. Pennsylvania governor comes under attack from Trump. See more updates Updated 9m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThe new study also suggests that, at least at this point in the pandemic, \"nobody knows what the appropriate treatment is for these very sick children,\" said Dr. Nigel Curtis, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of Melbourne, who was not involved in the research.\n\nHospitals used many methods of breathing support, as well as unproven medications like hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir and tociluzimab to treat the children. Other approaches included inhaled nitric oxide and blood plasma.\n\n\"They get a variety of different treatments in a very nonsystematic way because, of course, quite understandably, these intensive care doctors are going to do their best by these children and so they're going to try different potential therapies,\" said Dr. Curtis, who is also head of infectious diseases at the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne.\n\nThe study was conducted by members of an international collaborative of more than 300 pediatric intensive care and infectious disease specialists formed to study coronavirus in children and make recommendations.\n\nForty-six hospitals agreed to participate in the study, which included patients with confirmed coronavirus infections who were admitted to pediatric I.C.U.s in North America between March 14 and April 3, said Dr. Shekerdemian, who is also vice chair of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine. But only 16 of them had cases during that span, and only 14 reported data in time for publication, she said.\n\nThe 14 hospitals were all in the United States, and reflected the trajectory of the early pandemic, concentrated on the East Coast, with scattered cases in Texas and elsewhere. Young people up to age 21 were included, but all but three patients were 18 or younger, Dr. Shekerdemian said.\n\nGiven the small number of cases, it's hard to know how representative the results are. For example, while studies on children in China and an early report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested that infants and preschool-aged children were at highest risk, fewer than a third of the pediatric I.C.U. patients in the new study were that young. The two children who died were 12 and 17.\n\nDr. De Luca, who is chief of the division of pediatrics and neonatal critical care at Paris Saclay University Hospitals, said it made sense that older children with developmental disorders and other complex long-term problems would be more vulnerable than infants or toddlers to a virus like Covid-19.\n\n\"As they get older, they have lower immunity, they don't move much, and their weakening muscles affect their respiratory condition,\" he said.\n\nFourteen of the patients in the study had only mild or moderate coronavirus symptoms, and it's possible that because of the previous fragile state of their health they were admitted to I.C.U.s as a precaution, experts said. Another was asymptomatic but was already in the I.C.U. for other reasons.\n\nStill, 33 young people became severely or critically ill. And of the 18 who required ventilators, six needed additional respiratory interventions, including one child who needed a last-resort heart-lung bypass machine. Thirty patients experienced lung failure, and at least 11 also had failure of one or more other organs, such as the heart, kidneys or liver, Dr. Shekerdemian said. Two had neurological symptoms, primarily seizures.\n\nThe children's cases were followed through April 10. At that point, 15 remained hospitalized, but most were no longer severely or critically ill, the study said. Four were on ventilators then, one of whom was also on the heart-lung bypass machine. Those four remain hospitalized now, with two still on ventilators, Dr. Shekerdemian said.\n\nThe small number of patients treated by the hospitals in the study echoes C.D.C. figures so far, which report that 2 percent of confirmed American coronavirus cases have been in children under 18. That's similar to data in China and higher than rates reported in Italy and Spain. As of May 6, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 10 deaths in children 14 and younger and 48 deaths between the ages of 15 and 24.\n\nBut the actual prevalence and effects of coronavirus in children remain unknown, and last week, the National Institutes of Health announced it was starting a large study to learn more.\n\nScientists are also studying why most children seem less affected than adults, a question that could help them learn more about how the virus works in general. Theories include that cells lining the blood vessels and heart change as we age or that children's lung cells express lower levels of proteins that help the virus enter the cells and replicate.\n\nAnd doctors emphasize the need for standardized treatment approaches for children. \"It's critical that we try all these therapies in a systematic way,\" Dr. Curtis said. \"Clinicians worry that because there are small numbers of children that they'll be left out of clinical trials, but it's important that children are included.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "body": "ROME -- When Morena Colombi tested negative for the coronavirus on March 16, the official tallies counted her among the Covid-19 recoveries, a success amid the tragedies overwhelming Italy. But she was nowhere near recovered, her cough and crippling fatigue nowhere near gone.\n\nFive weeks later, on April 21, she returned to her job developing colors for a cosmetics company, but with shortness of breath and aching muscles, she found herself unable to take even short walks. Another test confirmed that she was no longer infected. But 11 weeks after testing positive, on the same day Italy first quarantined towns, she is still not back to normal.\n\n\"It takes a long time,\" said Ms. Colombi, 59, who lives in Truccazzano, outside the northern city of Milan. \"I can't get back into my natural rhythms.\"\n\nItaly was the first European country to be hit hard by the pandemic -- its intensive care units inundated and its elderly dying in droves before the tsunami reached Spain, France, the United States or Britain. And so Italy is also ahead in coming to grips with the long duration of the illness and the lasting consequences for some survivors.\n\nMany Italians have grown painfully familiar with the way the infection can hang on for weeks, the symptoms can linger for weeks more, and full recovery can take longer still -- if it ever arrives. Of the more than 218,000 people in Italy who have tested positive, more than 30,000 have died and the government lists more than 103,000 as recovered.\n\nThe stubbornness of the virus and the length of the convalescence have become topics of conversation in northern Italy where some of the longest-suffering Italians are finding themselves in physical and financial uncertainty, unable to shake sickness and fatigue and get back to work.\n\nTheir experience may also be instructive to other nations as struggling to get their economies moving again.\n\n\"We have seen many cases in which people take a long, long time to recover,\" said Alessandro Venturi, the director of the San Matteo hospital in the Lombardy town of Pavia, adding that the discomfort often seems to last even longer for people with lighter symptoms. \"It's not the sickness that lasts for 60 days, it is the convalescence,\" he said. \"It's a very long convalescence.\"\n\nMost people who catch the virus have few symptoms or none, but some get very sick, most often with pneumonia. Any pneumonia damages the lungs, which can take months to heal, and doctors warn that the harm might not be completely reversible.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak New cluster in China highlights the challenge of controlling infections as countries open up. Berlin Cathedral holds its first Sunday services since Germany lifted lockdown measures. Hong Kong police storm malls, accusing protesters of violating social distancing rules. See more updates Updated Just now More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nStudies also point to kidney, heart, liver and neurological damage, often from secondary infections, and no one knows what the long-term prospects are for those patients.\n\nBut even some of the infected who have avoided pneumonia describe a maddeningly persistent and unpredictable illness, with unexpected symptoms. Bones feel broken. The senses dull. Stomachs are constantly upset. There are good days and then bad days without apparent rhyme nor reason.\n\nThe afflicted find the simplest tasks taxing. Testing is still mostly reserved for the hospitalized, and so people suffering less severe but stubborn symptoms are trailed by doubt about whether they have the virus.\n\nDr. Annalisa Malara, an intensive care physician in Codogno, southeast of Milan, who diagnosed Italy's first case of the outbreak in February, said there was still no clear understanding of why the virus and its effects lingered so long.\n\n\"Lack of energy and the sensation of broken bones\" are common, she said, adding that fatigue often lingered \"even after the more intense symptoms are gone.\"\n\nIn the north of Italy, the epicenter of the contagion in that country, a partial lifting of the lockdown this month has allowed more family and friends to compare notes on their experiences.\n\n\"It never finishes,\" said Martina Sorlini, a 29-year-old math and physics high school teacher who has been running a low-grade fever since the beginning of March. She said that the cough and sore throat eventually went away, and that after three weeks she got her sense of taste and smell back, and even found enough energy to run and tend vegetables in her garden.\n\nThen came stomach aches, fatigue and the return of fever. And it hasn't left, making it extremely tiring to teach her online high school classes.\n\n\"I was convinced that I was better. They don't know what happened,\" Ms. Sorlini said. \"They are seeing everything for the first time too.\"\n\nSome say the experience of the long-suffering, if not critically ill, deserves more attention.\n\nEdmondo Cirielli, a member of Parliament with the right-wing Brotherhood of Italy party, has argued that the health ministry should pay more attention to cases like his.\n\nOn the weekend of March 7, Mr. Cirielli ran a fever and suffered cold-like symptoms, and became convinced he had picked up the virus by touching an infected surface in the Parliament chamber. He tested positive that week.\n\nAlmost immediately, he said, his fever and cough faded, and he thought he would be fine. Then he had what he called a \"small respiratory crisis\" that put him in the hospital.\n\nBut he had no pneumonia, so he went home to self-quarantine. There, he suffered debilitating fatigue, sore throat, diarrhea and intense pain at the base of his neck that made it impossible to concentrate.\n\n\"One day I was fine, the next bad. There was no building to a peak and then coming back down. It was up and down for a month,\" he said.\n\nThen things got stranger.\n\nAfter 40 days of feeling lousy, he tested negative for the virus, but his eyes still burned and bouts of diarrhea continued, he said.\n\nAt the end of the month, he finally felt better, but another test result came back positive, forcing him to spend weeks more in isolation, where he kept busy watching \"Versailles\" on Netflix.\n\nTesting has been imperfect, and not everyone has access to it.\n\nIngrid Magni, 44, got fever and chills on March 21.\n\n\"It never left me,\" she said, adding that she started suffering intense headaches after about three weeks. Doctors could only recommend over-the-counter painkillers and bed rest. She got winded just making her bed.\n\n\"I had to sit down,\" she said. \"I was too tired.\"\n\nWithout the eligibility to receive a swab test, which is usually reserved for hospital patients, she told her boss at a chemical plant that she would get an antibody test, which could be used to trigger an official swab test for the virus itself if antibodies are detected.\n\nBut the results have not come back. She is eager to get back to work by the middle of the month and is not sure how many more sick days the doctor will sign off on.\n\nOthers just want to feel better.\n\nAlbertina Bonetti, 77, from Trescore Balneario, near Bergamo, developed nausea and fever on March 7, followed by dry heaves and diarrhea. After 10 days of fever, her legs began hurting so much that she could not put her feet on the ground.\n\nShe needed an oxygen tank from March 20 to the end of April, but when she went to a hospital, the staff refused to admit her -- so she, too, remained untested.\n\nMs. Bonetti said that she still had shortness of breath and fatigue and that her senses remained out of whack. She misses normal life and the taste of her latte in the morning.\n\n\"It leaves something inside you,\" she said of the virus. \"And you never go back the way you were before.\"\n\nEmma Bubola contributed reporting from Milan.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nTakuo Aoyagi, a Japanese engineer whose pioneering work in the 1970s led to the modern pulse oximeter, a lifesaving device that clips on a finger and shows the level of oxygen in the blood and that has become a critical tool in the fight against the novel coronavirus, died on April 18 in Tokyo. He was 84.\n\nHis death, in a hospital, was announced by his employer, Nihon Khoden, a Tokyo-based company that makes medical equipment. A niece, Kyoko Aoyagi, confirmed the death but said she did not know the cause.\n\nThe pulse oximeter has become \"an indispensable addition to medicine,\" said V. Courtney Broaddus, a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. Historically, patients were measured by four vital signs: temperature, blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rate. \"It has become the fifth vital sign,\" she said of oxygen level.\n\nWhile many coronavirus patients do feel chest pain, fever and other symptoms, Dr. Broaddus said, the pulse oximeter \"has become especially important because humans do not sense a low oxygen saturation alone.\"\n\nMoreover, some Covid patients seem not to have other symptoms. As a result, when moderately or mildly ill patients test positive for the coronavirus, they may be sent home with a pulse oximeter so that they can track their oxygen level and return to the hospital if it drops.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Some governors face growing resistance as many businesses open their doors around the country.

In an essay about Mr. Aoyagi, John W. Severinghaus, a professor emeritus of anesthesia at the University of California, San Francisco, wrote in 2007 that Mr. Aoyagi's \"dream\" had been to detect oxygen saturation levels without having to draw blood.\n\nHis early research tried to measure cardiac output (the amount of blood the heart pumps), using a method known as dye dilution, which involves injecting a patient with dye. Instead of withdrawing the blood downstream and measuring the concentration of dye, he attempted instead to use early oximeters, some of which were developed during World War II to help military pilots breathe at high altitudes.\n\nThose early devices, which clamped to the ear, tended to be inaccurate, unreliable and cumbersome, but Mr. Aoyagi was fascinated by the underlying technology: using two wavelengths of light -- red and infrared -- to measure blood oxygen levels. (Hemoglobin, the protein in blood that transports oxygen, absorbs light differently when it binds with oxygen.)\n\nBut he soon ran into a problem. Blood does not flow smoothly like an open tap, but pulses through the body irregularly, thus preventing an accurate recording of dye levels. The problem, however, turned out to be an opportunity. By devising a mathematical formula to cancel out this \"pulsatile noise,\" he created a device that measured oxygen levels with greater accuracy than before.\n\n\"Greatness in science, often, as here, comes from the well-prepared mind turning a chance observation into a major discovery,\" Dr. Severinghaus wrote.\n\nNihon Kohden applied for a Japanese patent for its pulse oximeter in 1974, with Mr. Aoyagi and a colleague, Michio Kishi, listed as inventors. It was granted in 1979.\n\nWhile many companies sell oximeters today, \"all of today's pulse oximeters are based on Dr. Aoyagi's original principles of pulse oximetry,\" according to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, which awarded Mr. Aoyagi its IEEE medal for innovations in health care technology in 2015. He was the first Japanese person to receive the award.\n\nTakuo Aoyagi was born Feb. 14, 1936, in Niigata Prefecture, on the west coast of Japan, to Monshichi and Tatsu Aoyagi. His father was a math teacher, his mother a homemaker. He graduated from Niigata University win 1958 with a degree in electrical engineering and worked for Shimadzu before joining Nihon Khoden in 1971.\n\nHe earned a doctorate in engineering from the University of Tokyo in 1993. Other honors include the JS Gravenstein Award from the Society for Technology in Anesthesia in 2013. In 2002, he received a Medal With Purple Ribbon from the Emperor of Japan, given in recognition of achievements in the arts and academics.\n\nSurvivors include his wife, Yoshiko, and three children, Yasutoshi, Midori and Kaori.",

        "body": "A new study shows how respiratory droplets produced during normal conversation may be just as important in transmitting disease, especially indoors.\n\nCoughs or sneezes may not be the only way people transmit infectious pathogens like the novel coronavirus to one another. Talking can also launch thousands of droplets so small they can remain suspended in the air for eight to 14 minutes, according to a new study.\n\nThe research, published Wednesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, could help explain how people with mild or no symptoms may infect others in close quarters such as offices, nursing homes, cruise ships and other confined spaces. The study's experimental conditions will need to be replicated in more real-world circumstances, and researchers still don't know how much virus has to be transmitted from one person to another to cause infection. But its findings strengthen the case for wearing masks and taking other precautions in such environments to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nScientists agree that coronavirus jumps from person to person most often by hitching a ride inside tiny respiratory droplets. These droplets tend to fall to the ground within a few feet of the person who emits them. They may land on surfaces like doorknobs, where people can touch lingering virus particles and transfer them to their face. But some droplets can remain aloft, and be inhaled by others.\n\nElaborate experiments have revealed how coughing or sneezing can produce a crackling burst of air mixed with saliva or mucus that can force hundreds of millions of influenza and other virus particles into the air if a person is sick. A single cough can propel about 3,000 respiratory droplets, while sneezing can generate as many as 40,000.\n\nThis 3-D Simulation Shows Why Social Distancing Is So Important\n\nWe visualized a cough to show how far respiratory droplets can spread. If you haven't been keeping your distance to fight the coronavirus, this may persuade you.\n\nTo see how many droplets were produced during normal conversation, researchers at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the University of Pennsylvania, who study the kinetics of biological molecules inside the human body, asked volunteers to repeat the words \"stay healthy\" several times. While the participants spoke into the open end of a cardboard box, the researchers illuminated its inside with green lasers, and tracked bursts of droplets produced by the speaker.\n\nThe laser scans showed that about 2,600 small droplets were produced per second while talking. When researchers projected the amount and size of droplets produced at different volumes based on previous studies, they found that speaking louder could generate larger droplets, as well as greater quantities of them.\n\nAlthough the scientists did not record speech droplets produced by people who were sick, previous studies have calculated exactly how much coronavirus genetic material can be found in oral fluids in the average patient. Based on this knowledge, the researchers estimated that a single minute of loud speaking could generate at least 1,000 virus-containing droplets.\n\nThe scientists also found that while droplets start shrinking from dehydration as soon as they leave a person's mouth, they can still float in the air for eight to 14 minutes.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A whistle-blower tells a House panel that lives were lost because the administration did not heed warnings about the virus. Wisconsin's governor urges residents to 'be safer at home' after a court strikes down his stay-home order. With 36.5 million jobless claims in two months, calls to cover workers' wages. See more updates Updated 2m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"These observations confirm that there is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,\" the authors wrote in the study.\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that the experiment was performed in a controlled environment with stagnant air that may not reflect what happens in rooms with good ventilation. But they still had reason to believe their reported values were \"conservative lower limit estimates\" because some people have a higher viral load, meaning they may produce droplets with several thousand more virus particles than average.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says keeping at least six feet away from others can help people avoid contact with respiratory droplets and lower the risk of infection. But many scientists have argued that droplets can travel farther than six feet, depending on the force with which droplets are launched, the surrounding temperature, whether there are air currents that can carry them farther and other conditions.\n\nThere is also debate about whether the coronavirus can also be transmitted through even smaller droplets -- less than a tenth the width of a human hair -- that are known as aerosols, and can remain suspended or travel through the air for longer.\n\nIn another recent study, the same authors showed that just articulating certain sounds can produce significantly higher amounts of respiratory particles. The \"th\" sound in the word \"healthy,\" for example, was a very efficient generator of speech droplets. Another paper, published in January by researchers from the University of California Davis, found the vowel sound \"e\" in \"need\" produces more droplets than the \"a\" in \"saw,\" or \"o\" in \"mood.\"\n\nWhat researchers don't yet know is whether all speech, cough and sneeze droplets carrying virus particles are equally infectious, or if a specific amount of virus needs to be transmitted for a person to get sick by breathing it in.\n\nBut the new study adds to the case for maintaining a physical distance from other people to help slow the spread of coronavirus, said Linsey Marr, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech who was not involved with the paper.\n\n\"Based on this and other evidence, it would be wise to avoid extended face-to-face conversations with other people unless you are far apart and in a well-ventilated space, including outdoors,\" Dr. Marr said.\n\nThe study also highlights the importance of wearing masks during social and other interactions.\n\n\"The risk of talking to one another will probably be lower than being exposed to a person who is not wearing a mask and openly coughs and sneezes,\" said Dr. Werner E. Bischoff, the medical director of infection prevention and health system epidemiology at the Wake Forest School of Medicine. \"Normal talking to a person while keeping the recommended social distance will be fine. Putting on a mask will be even better.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nNormally, Taylor Mac's days would follow a series of familiar scripts. Mac has a number of projects in the works, after all: a musical theater piece about Socrates called \"The Hang,\" as well as an eerily timely play called \"Joy and Pandemic,\" which is set before the outbreak of the 1918 flu pandemic.\n\nThe playwright and performance artist, whose prefers the pronoun \"judy,\" as in Garland, has been social distancing in the Berkshires, still writing while also supporting his Trickle Up initiative for artists impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak. Like so many people, Mac's taken up new routines, too, like playing the banjo and video chatting with friends over Zoom.\n\nThe thing is, the days and weeks have started to run together. \"It's Blursday, in the month of Macram\u00e9,\" Mac said.\n\nMac tracked his cultural diary for a week while in isolation in April, which included listening to the new Fiona Apple album and watching James Bond movies on VHS. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n\nMost Mornings:\n\nI wake up around 7 a.m. and I have breakfast and make everybody coffee, and I hang out. I always read The New York Times. I skip anything telling me what might happen, I just find those articles extremely annoying. The entire news has been taken over by what might happen, so I just scan the paper, and if something seems like it's telling me what has happened, or what is happening, then I'll read it.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump unveils a plan to help states expand testing. Experts say it is not enough. Mnuchin says that companies could face \"criminal liability\" for improperly taking relief funds. The C.D.C. expands the list of symptoms, and the W.H.O. warns of a long road ahead. See more updates Updated 21m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThen I try to write for two hours. I've got a couple of projects I'm working on. A big kind of musical -- I can't say anything about it yet. And then my new piece that I'd better get up to the Here Arts Center.\n\nI have all these projects that I just try to chisel away at every day, which is kind of my pattern, normally. But then, I get up [for] about two hours, and then I do administrative work. When I started doing Trickle Up -- I guess the best thing to call it is a network, it's an online streaming platform that you can subscribe to. I had that idea to make it so that we could raise money for people who lost all their gigs. So far, we've raised $20,000 for everybody, so that's pretty cool, and we just gave out our second $10,000 commission.\n\nIt's moving to watch all the people respond in this moment, even if they don't directly address the pandemic or being isolated, you still feel that subtext in everybody's work. It's like an educational tool because as a performing artist, to see everyone's process, and then just for the emotional experience, watching the videos. It makes you feel more connected to everybody.\n\nDuring the Day:\n\nLike everybody else who's in the world, I've been listening to Fiona Apple in the last couple of days. I also started getting into some old, obscure kind of funk disco, like B.T. Express. My friend Rachelle Garniez has a new album out, called \"Gone to Glory.\" I listen to her, and also John Prine because I'm cheesy that way. Whenever somebody dies, I always go out and listen to their music. But I will say that I listen to John Prine at least a few times a year, so it's not like it's some weird nostalgic thing. Oh, and then the other night, we got really into \"Ellington at Newport,\" 1956. That album and that crazy, unchained denouement [\"Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue.\"] It's so good.\n\nI'm lucky enough that I can go for walks -- there are lots of woods. The only time we see people is when we go grocery shopping, and then you know. We Hazmat it up.\n\nI didn't bring any of my drag up with me, or my ukulele. That's why I started practicing the banjo every day. But that has been fun, focusing on an instrument that has been in my peripheral vision for maybe a decade now.\n\nEvenings:\n\nMy friend's therapist said it would be a really good idea to just have a ritual. It sounds kind of cheesy, but it really helps you understand where you are. The only ritual we have that we share every single day is cocktail hour and movie night. We've got a movie night. I cook dinner, usually, and my husband does the dishes, and then we'll watch a movie.\n\nYesterday was Monday. I remember. I made a cocktail. I've never seen a recipe for it, I made it by accident because we ran out of lime, but we had a cucumber. So, it was cucumber juice, St-Germain and gin. It's just equal parts and it was so yummy. I'm calling it the St. Cupid. I'm sure it exists already in the world, but I'm calling it St. Cupid anyway.\n\nWe don't have the internet, so I can't stream anything; I just have cell service. But luckily, my husband is a movie buff, so we have hundreds of movies that are on VHS tapes and things like that, so we just watch old shows. It's a sweet thing. Sometimes we like to read or talk, but that's about it.\n\nWe watched \"Bonnie and Clyde\" last night, and what else did we watch? \"Five Easy Pieces,\" and we watched \"La Dolce Vita,\" and we got on a Merchant Ivory kick, so we watched \"A Room with a View,\" and \"Maurice.\" I think we've watched every Bond movie. We've been watching Almod\u00f3var, a lot of Almod\u00f3var. And then we also got into Horatio Hornblower. We were watching really bad Horatio Hornblower melodrama on the high seas. It's fun. I like those ones because you can just shout at the TV and you have a good time. That's what I find I have energy for, and mental state for, by the end of the day.\n\nBefore Bed:\n\nI'm actually reading a book about the Spanish flu. It's been really fascinating to read. My play is set in 1918, so I thought, \"Oh, maybe I should read and find out some details about it.\" It's called \"The Great Influenza\" by John M. Barry.\n\nWas It Thursday?\n\nThere was a Zoom dance party with all the people from \"24 Decade\" the other day. I think it was Thursday. People hopped on, and basically held their phones up and danced.",

        "body": "Richard Nelson's new play, \"What Do We Need to Talk About?\" will be performed online, but live, restoring some of theater's ephemerality.\n\nHas anyone checked on the Apples? Do they have enough groceries? Are they working remotely? And what do they think about all those Manhattanites fleeing upstate?\n\nThe playwright Richard Nelson introduced the clan -- three middle-aged sisters and one brother living gently melancholic lives in and around Rhinebeck, N.Y. -- in \"That Hopey Changey Thing,\" at the Public Theater on the evening of the midterm elections, in 2010. He brought them back for a new play in 2011, and again in 2012 and 2013.\n\nEach play took place in the same living room at the same table, covered in the same cloth. Each was set on the night it opened -- either an election night or a significant anniversary -- offering a discrete time capsule of how members of one middle-class American family understood the world, its peculiar politics and one another, there and then.\n\nNelson has moved on to other families -- the Gabriels (three plays) and the Michaels (one staged, one to come). But for many who met them at the Public or on tour or on public television, the Apples have come to feel like kin. And in the midst of a pandemic, we could be forgiven for wondering how they were doing. Thoughtfully, Nelson and the Public Theater have arranged a video conference.\n\nOn Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., on YouTube Live and at the Public Theater's website, audiences can watch a new Apple play, live: \"What Do We Need to Talk About?: Conversations on Zoom.\" On our screens, the four Apple siblings and Tim (Stephen Kunken), the boyfriend of the youngest Apple sister, Jane (Sally Murphy), will eat cookies, tell bad jokes, celebrate and mourn. The call should last about an hour. An edited version will stream online for three days after.\n\nIdeas from The Times on what to read, cook, watch, play and listen to while staying safe At Home.\n\n\"It's a great surprise,\" Nelson said, speaking from his home in Rhinebeck, which he described as \"not a bad place to be hunkered down.\" He had, he thought, left the Apples behind years ago. But when the pandemic arrived, he realized that he wanted to hear from them and that others might want to hear from them, too.\n\nAt the end of March, Nelson wrote to the original cast. Maryann Plunkett, who plays Barbara, the oldest sister; and Laila Robins, who plays the middle sister, Marian, had booked roles on a new television series, \"Dr. Death.\" Robins was also filming \"The Blacklist.\" Plunkett's husband, Jay O. Sanders, who plays Richard Apple, the sole brother, had just opened \"Girl From the North Country\" on Broadway. Murphy was in previews for \"The Minutes,\" another Broadway show. Kunken was busy shooting \"Billions.\"\n\nBut with Broadway shuttered and television production shut down, they were all at liberty. Two hours after Nelson sent his email, they had all signed on.\n\nThen he called Oskar Eustis, the Public Theater's artistic director, recently returned from a hospital stay that he thought was likely related to Covid-19. Nelson pitched him a play in the form of a Zoom call. Eustis agreed. \"That seemed to me to me an inherently great way to approach virtual theater,\" Eustis said. \"You're combining an innovative formal idea with an absolute master playwright.\"\n\nFive or six days later, Nelson had produced a draft. \"The rapid response of this is part of what's so beautiful about it,\" Eustis said. The Public allotted 25 hours for rehearsal, considerably less than any previous Apple play, but as Nelson said: \"You can't rehearse eight hours a day on Zoom. People would go crazy; it's just too much staring at a computer.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, I sat in for the first hour of the first day of rehearsal. Ido Levran, the Public's video supervisor, was troubleshooting technical problems as Nelson coached the actors on camera placement. A storm had knocked out Kunken's Wi-Fi, and he was working from his iPhone. Robins fiddled with her view. That afternoon's goal, Nelson said, was creating intimacy without actual intimacy. Spread throughout the city, the actors tried to find their rhythms, pick up their cues.\n\nIn real life, Plunkett and Sanders, who are spouses not siblings, live together in Greenwich Village, so Nelson decided that Richard, who usually lives in Albany, had moved into Barbara's house in Rhinebeck. Plunkett placed their shared laptop on the same card table that Barbara had unfolded at the beginning of each Apple play, a gift from the producers after the plays' final tour. \"No one will ever know,\" Plunkett said. \"But we know.\" Because Murphy lives on the Upper East Side and Kunken is in Brooklyn, Nelson arranged for Tim to self-quarantine behind a closed door, explaining their individual logins.\n\nHaving already collaborated with Thirteen to film the original Apple plays and having learned what was lost when the camera lingers only on one speaker, Nelson decided to stage the call in gallery view. Sequestered in separate frames yet sharing a screen, the Apples will be, like so many of us, alone, together. (Thirteen's Theater Close-Up site has made the previous Apple Family plays available for viewing. The Gabriels trilogy, too.)\n\n\"It's nice being in the room, even though it's a virtual room,\" Plunkett said, the day after that first rehearsal. \"I have real longing for the physical, but I know at this point that's not what we can do.\"\n\nSanders said something similar, a few minutes later, after Plunkett handed him back his cellphone. \"It's a way to embrace the moment,\" he said. \"This play isn't saying, 'Let's pretend we're in a theater.' This is saying: 'OK, we're at home. Let's do this at home.'\"\n\nAs earlier Apple plays were set on specific days, Nelson thought he would set this one on a specific day, too. But he worried that tethering it to a particular news conference or mortality statistic would drown out the human voices. \"To do that would push the play into a kind of journalism,\" he said. And the news, he felt, is already too much with us. So he has set \"What Do We Need to Talk About?\" on an unnumbered April day, shortly after Barbara has been released from the hospital after experiencing severe Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nStill, the topicality can overwhelm. Reading the play on my laptop, the night before rehearsal, I came to a section where Tim discusses the death of an actor friend. That friend, I saw a few lines later, was Mark Blum, a treasured theater actor who died of complications of the coronavirus on March 25. I had to stop reading for a while. (When Eustis first read the play, he told me, \"I was a mess.\")\n\n\"What Do We Need to Talk About?\" acknowledges the impossibility of live theater, now and in the months to come. \"Will big groups of people want to sit tightly together in the same space for a couple of hours,\" Tim wonders. \"How long will that take?\"\n\nBut the play will be performed live, restoring some of theater's ephemerality. \"It's kind of dangerous in a good way,\" Sanders said. \"It's like when I do Shakespeare in the Park and the raccoons come on the stage.\" In the event of an absolute technical failure, footage from a filmed dress rehearsal will be shown. The technology didn't seem to worry Nelson. \"Compared to what people are going through, it's a very small issue,\" he said.\n\nIf \"What Do We Need to Talk About?\" isn't quite theater, it is a chance to commune with familiar characters and to think through what faces us and them. It doesn't necessarily point a way forward -- \"I don't believe for a second that we are going to turn into a digital company,\" Eustis said, strongly -- but it reflects a shared present.\n\n\"All I can say is, 'We'll see,'\" Nelson said. \"But this is the life we live in right now. So trying to find a way to live in that world and articulate that world feels important.\"",

        "body": "The return of matches is not so much proof of German soccer's greed or its smooth running as it is a testament to a broader political reality.\n\nEnjoying this newsletter? Tell a friend to sign up at nytimes.com/rory and then you'll have at least one thing to talk about every Friday.\n\nEvery morning, when Bayer Leverkusen's players wake up in the hotel requisitioned for their weeklong quarantine, they have a list of six questions to answer. They must tell the club how they slept, how they are feeling, whether any of the telltale symptoms of the coronavirus have set in overnight.\n\nOnce they have answered satisfactorily, the players eat breakfast -- on their own -- and head to the club's training facility. Before entering, they have their body temperatures assessed by a scanner, in case anyone is running an undetected fever.\n\nOnce they pass that entrance exam, they head to the changing room: not the communal one, the one they would ordinarily use, but one they share with only a couple of teammates. They do not need to worry about showering afterward. The instructions on that are clear, too. They are to wash up back in their rooms at the hotel.\n\nFor all of the players, as it is for everyone involved in the reopening of the Bundesliga this weekend, this is uncharted territory. It is 65 days since the Bundesliga went into hibernation, along with every other major sports league on the planet. On Saturday, at 3:30 p.m. local time, it plans to become the first major league back, the first high-profile competition in any sport in the age of coronavirus.\n\nEven now, even when the return is so close, it feels like a delicate, fragile thing, one that could yet be derailed at the very last moment by a raft of positive tests, by an uptick in Germany's infection rate, by a change of heart by the government. Those involved in bringing the league to this point know how hard it has been to pick a way through when there is no map to use as a guide.\n\n\"It has been a lot of work, and a lot of unusual work,\" said Simon Rolfes, Leverkusen's sporting director. \"We planned for the start, and then everything changes in three days, and the league gives some new advice: the plans get more detailed, more precise.\" Planning, he said, started in earnest four weeks ago. \"But four weeks, now, feels like a year or two,\" he said.\n\nThat the Bundesliga has managed to get this close -- closer than any of its peers -- is rooted, to some extent, in the league's sense of purpose, its unified vision, its leadership.\n\nKarl-Heinz Rummenigge, Bayern Munich's chairman, argued that the \"good collaboration\" between teams had helped the league identify a \"clear concept\" for its return. Rolfes was quick to credit the role that Christian Seifert, the Bundesliga's chief executive, had played in helping craft a solution. The players, meanwhile, are largely content with the arrangements.\n\n\"We have had one or two who are a bit concerned,\" Rolfes said. \"That is natural. But they feel safe here. A lot of them are glad to be in Germany. They feel the club will take care of them.\"\n\nTo some people -- perhaps to many -- that will feel trite, almost venal, under the circumstances. Now, after all, is not necessarily the time for games. It is too early, too soon, for soccer to be played again, while a global pandemic still rages, while the death toll continues to mount. There are plenty, including many of Germany's organized fan groups, who believe the Bundesliga has hurried back with money as its only motivation.\n\nThat is not, in fairness, entirely wrong. \"As an industry, we will have big financial problems not only this season but in the next seasons, too,\" Rummenigge said. \"The loss of ticketing, of corporate partners, of sponsors -- it will have a huge impact, and maybe one the big clubs should worry about the most.\" The Bundesliga has, without question, been driven by a desire to staunch those losses as much as possible.\n\nBy returning first, it has turned a problem into an opportunity. The Bundesliga has, for many years, sought to end the primacy of England's Premier League in soccer's global landscape.\n\nIts clubs have opened offices across the world, trying to pry open new markets and improve their commercial performance. It has proved adept and innovative at managing its broadcasting arrangements. (At one time, the Bundesliga received more than one sotto voce rebuke from the Premier League, the single most marketed product in history, about what the latter perceived to be the Bundesliga's undignified attempts to raise its profile in Britain.)\n\nNow, it has that chance. \"There is an advantage of being the first back,\" Rummenigge said. The Bundesliga is not back as it would wish to be, of course -- there will be no fans in the stadiums, robbing the league of its atmosphere -- but still: This weekend, and for a few weekends yet, the eyes of the world will be on Germany.\n\nTempting as that narrative is, it does not quite tell the whole story. Yes, the Bundesliga is thinking about money, but not out of individual acquisitiveness so much as out of collective fear. As Rummenigge put it: The hiatus made it inevitable that German soccer would face a crisis. The league's returning is simply a way to avert disaster.\n\nBut most important, the return of the Bundesliga is not so much proof of German soccer's greed or its smooth running as it is a testament to a broader political reality. \"We can be the first to start again because of our health care system,\" Rolfes said. \"We are thankful to have the opportunity.\"\n\nRummenigge lays much of the credit for the Bundesliga's return at the door of Germany's government. \"We have to say thank you to our politicians,\" he said. It is only because of the decisions they have made, in his mind, that the impact of the virus was limited and that soccer was in a position even to contemplate its return.\n\nGermany, after all, has recorded a quarter of the deaths that Britain has, despite a larger population, and a tenth of the total in the United States. It was among the first European countries to start lifting stringent lockdown restrictions, and some version of normal life is at least visible there in a way that it is not, say, in either Britain or the United States.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The House will vote tonight on a $3 trillion relief package that Trump and the Senate oppose. Fears grow over new outbreaks as more states lift restrictions on bars, beauty shops and other businesses. Who's enforcing mask-wearing rules? Often it's retail workers. See more updates Updated 19m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nIt is worth considering that as you settle in to watch top-flight soccer for the first time in 65 days. Perhaps you feel that the Bundesliga has come back too soon. Perhaps you fear there will be a raft of infections, and the curtain will have to fall again.\n\nOr, perhaps, you will feel that soccer, and sports in general, is possible in the age of coronavirus. Instead of wondering if the Germans have been too quick, it is worth wondering why governments elsewhere seemed to be so slow. Perhaps, instead of feeling the Germans have not waited enough, we should ask our politicians why we have to wait so long.\n\nSoccer Fans Are Just People\n\nLaced into the endless, intractable debate over when, if and how soccer should return in places other than Germany is a deep-rooted, pernicious sort of a presumption, the kind that for some reason is allowed to build its nest in otherwise right-thinking minds. It is the idea that soccer fans are a danger to themselves and others.\n\nThe logic is this: Back in March, fans of Paris St.-Germain and Valencia gathered by the thousands outside their teams' stadiums, where Champions League matches were being held behind closed doors. This was held up as proof that, whenever and wherever soccer is next played, it is all but certain that fans of some, or all, teams will inevitably do the same, putting their lives, the lives of their families, and society as a whole, at risk.\n\nIn England, at least, everyone from city mayors to police chiefs has promoted some version of this idea. They have not mentioned the rather salient fact that the world has changed markedly since the last time teams played; that whole countries have grown used to being in lockdown; that social distancing has, for most of us, seeped into second nature.\n\nMostly, though, they seem to have forgotten that soccer fans are, well, just people. A minority might believe the rules do not apply to them, of course, just as a small minority did not seem to realize that the parks were closed or the beaches shut or that they were not allowed to make armed visits to government buildings.\n\nBut the majority? The majority are like you. The majority, in fact, are you. And, as this excellent Twitter thread from my old boss -- in a previous life -- makes clear, that means we really need to ask just one question. Would you do it?\n\nBigger Than 'Tiger King'\n\nThe thing that best sums up what made \"Tiger King\" such compelling viewing is this: It took until the end of the third episode before anyone so much as mentioned the (unproven) allegation that a lead character had fed her husband to a tiger. Not many shows have so much content, so many layers, that they can afford to bury a lead quite that explosive.\n\nNo wonder, then, that \"Tiger King\" proved a sensation. Netflix's figures suggest that some 64 million households, so far, have watched Joe Exotic's journey from large cat prison to human prison. No wonder it took over the zeitgeist. No wonder it was, for a while, the show that everyone seemed to be watching.\n\nExcept take a step back, and it wasn't. Netflix has 182 million subscribers or so, which means two-thirds of its viewers are, as yet, blissfully unaware that it is apparently fine for entirely unqualified Americans to keep a bunch of tigers in the yard. There are, meanwhile, 16 countries in which there are more than a million Netflix subscribers. Their combined population is somewhere north of two billion.\n\nThe point is that we tend to overestimate the \"global\" in \"global sensation.\" When we say that the world is watching something or doing something or thinking something, we tend to mean our own, small worlds -- the people we know, the people we talk to, the people like us.\n\nLast week, Dominic Raab, the British foreign secretary, suggested that the Premier League returning would \"lift the spirits of the nation.\" A few days later, a poll -- carried out by YouGov -- found that was only true of a fifth of the country: 19 percent of respondents said the return of soccer would boost their morale, while 73 percent said it would not.\n\nThis was taken, of course, as proof of the government's hypocrisy, of its intention to use soccer to try to placate a country that is currently amassing the second-highest coronavirus death toll in the world. It added fuel to the fire of those who accuse soccer in general, and the Premier League in particular, of inflating its importance.\n\nAnd yet, in a world in which many of us are used to being able to summon whatever entertainment we wish at the press of a button or the swipe of a screen, a world in which nothing is as universal as it seems, an era in which the monoculture is a distant memory, isn't that figure remarkable?\n\nIt is, after all, not a fifth of a country saying it watches soccer, or a fifth of a country saying it quite likes soccer, but a fifth of a country saying soccer means so much that it might help people cope with one of the bleakest times in living memory. It's the sort of reach that even \"Tiger King\" could not manage.\n\nIt isn't proof of how little soccer matters. It is proof of the opposite.\n\nCorrespondence\n\nA couple of late arrivals, this week, for book and film recommendations: David Simpson suggests \"The Ball Is Round,\" an \"encyclopedic\" work by David Goldblatt; and thanks to the estimable Candy Lee for pointing us toward \"Those Glory Glory Days,\" a 1983 film about four girls growing up as Tottenham fans.\n\nAnd a question from Chris Ogden, in Hawaii: \"American football coaches spend extraordinary amounts of time studying game film. To what extent is that a practice in top-tier global football, especially at the main European and South American clubs?\"\n\nIt's standard now, really, and it probably has been for at least two decades in England, and much farther back than that elsewhere (we are late developers). As a rough guide, I suspect most teams would watch five or more games of a forthcoming opponent, looking for everything from attacking patterns to specific moves on set pieces. Most clubs, in fact, have at least a couple of staff members employed just for that purpose.\n\nThanks for all the correspondence this week. If there's anything urgent, I'm on Twitter. If it can wait, drop me a line at askrory@nytimes.com. Set Piece Menu is here for those of you who have an hour that needs filling with people talking nonsense.

        "body": "Ravi Sharma was doubled over on his bed when his father found him. He'd had a bad cough for a week and had self-quarantined in his bedroom. As an emergency medical technician, he knew he was probably infected with the coronavirus.\n\nNow, Mr. Sharma, 27, could not move the right side of his body, and could only grunt in his father's direction. His sister, Bina Yamin, on the phone from her home in Fort Wayne, Ind., could hear the sounds.\n\n\"Call 911,\" she told her father. \"I think Ravi's having a stroke.\" She was right.\n\nOver the next few hours, doctors at a Queens hospital worked frantically to break up a blood clot blocking an artery to Mr. Sharma's brain. But the doctors were puzzled.\n\nMr. Sharma was far too young for a stroke. He worked out every day and didn't have diabetes, high blood pressure or the kinds of medical conditions that can set the stage for strokes in young adults, which are rare.\n\nNeurologists in New York City, Detroit, New Jersey and other parts of the country have reported a flurry of such cases. Many are now convinced that unexplained strokes represent yet another insidious manifestation of Covid-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nThe cases add to evidence that the coronavirus attacks not just the lungs, but also the kidneys, brain, heart and liver. In rare cases, it seems to trigger a life-threatening inflammatory syndrome in children.\n\n\"We're seeing a startling number of young people who had a minor cough, or no recollection of viral symptoms at all, and they're self-isolating at home like they're supposed to -- and they have a sudden stroke,\" said Dr. Adam Dmytriw, a University of Toronto radiologist who is a co-author of a paper describing patients who suffered strokes related to Covid-19. The paper has not yet been peer reviewed.\n\nThough many of those patients had diabetes and hypertension, none had heart risks known to increase the odds of a stroke. Many were under age 65. For some, stroke was the first symptom of coronavirus infection, and they postponed going to the emergency room, fearing exposure.\n\nOf 10 patients described in Dr. Dmytriw's paper, two died because the coronavirus attacked their lungs, and two men -- a 46-year-old and a 55-year-old -- were killed by strokes.\n\nDoctors at Mount Sinai Health System in New York have also seen an unusual number of young stroke patients, saying they treated five such patients with Covid-19 during a recent two-week period. The medical center typically sees only one stroke patient under the age of 50 every three weeks, Dr. Johanna Fifi, a neurologist, and her colleagues noted in a letter in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nFour of the five patients were relatively healthy; two patients in their 30s had no known risk factors for stroke. \"We came to the conclusion it had to be related to Covid-19,\" Dr. Fifi said in an interview.\n\nThough strokes seem to affect a very small number of Covid-19 patients, they appear to be related to a broader phenomenon that has emerged in critically ill patients: excessive blood clotting.\n\nPatients with severe Covid-19 may develop clots in the legs and lungs that can be life-threatening, doctors said. Their blood can be so thick and viscous that it blocks intravenous lines and catheters. Tiny clots in other organs, like the kidneys and liver, have been found in autopsies of coronavirus patients.\n\nDr. Michael Yaffe, an intensive care physician at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, called clotting a \"hallmark\" of the disease, although \"not in everyone.\"\n\nGerman scientists reported last week that autopsies of 12 Covid-19 patients turned up a type of blood clot called deep vein thrombosis in seven of them. The cause of death in four patients was another type of blood clot in the lungs, called a pulmonary embolism.\n\nClotting is a risk in all critically ill patients if they are immobile for long periods. But patients with the coronavirus have elevated levels of clotting proteins in the blood, and the condition seems to be less responsive to blood-thinning drugs, said Dr. Adam Cuker, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nSome evidence suggests that the coronavirus may directly infect the endothelial cells that line the inside of blood vessels, causing injury and swelling that draws proteins that promote clotting, Dr. Cuker said.\n\nPeople who have been exposed to the coronavirus, or are managing the infection at home, should call their doctors if they feel chest pain and shortness of breath, which may signal a blood clot in the lung, or leg pain, swelling, redness and discoloration that may indicate a clot.\n\nHealthy, Until He Wasn't\n\nUntil he arrived at Jamaica Hospital on April 1, Mr. Sharma had never been tested for infection with the coronavirus. But he knew he was at risk. He had spent weeks making back-to-back ambulance runs, ferrying sick, elderly patients from nursing homes to hospitals in Brooklyn and Queens in February and March.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A whistle-blower tells a House panel that lives were lost because the administration did not heed warnings about the virus. Wisconsin's governor urges residents to 'be safer at home' after a court strikes down his stay-home order. With 36.5 million jobless claims in two months, calls to cover workers' wages. See more updates Updated 7m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nBy mid-March, Mr. Sharma had developed a dry cough. He went to an urgent care clinic, where he was told that it was out of tests, but that he should stay home because he was probably infected.\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]\n\nAt the hospital, emergency room doctors took aggressive steps to restore the blood supply to the left side of his brain. They also diagnosed acute respiratory distress syndrome, finding that Mr. Sharma's infected lungs were filling with fluid and his blood oxygen levels were low. A test revealed infection with the coronavirus, and he was placed on a ventilator.\n\nThe doctors were kind but honest with the family, Ms. Yamin said: \"They told us that it was 50-50. They didn't know if he would live or die.\"\n\nOver the next few days, while Mr. Sharma remained sedated. Ms. Yamin spoke frequently with the doctors and nurses at the hospital, taking meticulous notes that she shared with relatives and with The New York Times.\n\nMr. Sharma's body was flooded with blood thinners to prevent additional clots from forming. His fever spiked as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit some days, raising his heart rate and further incapacitating his lungs.\n\nThen, on April 8, Mr. Sharma started having seizures. He was sedated more deeply and put on additional medications. Doctors cranked up the ventilator.\n\nBy mid-April he had been intubated for two weeks, a period considered a critical make-or-break point for Covid-19 patients, and Ms. Yamin was concerned. No one knew the toll of the stroke itself, or whether Mr. Sharma would be able to walk or talk when he woke up.\n\nThe left side of the brain controls movement on the right side of the body, as well as speech and language, reading and writing, organizational ability, reasoning and analysis.\n\n\"I began to lose faith,\" Ms. Yamin recalled in an interview.\n\nThen, on April 15, there was some movement on the left side of Ravi's body, the side not affected by the stroke. His fever ebbed. The staff lowered the ventilator setting, and he tolerated it.\n\n\"Looks like he's slowly beating this,\" Ms. Yamin wrote in a note to the family. \"We just need to be patient.\"\n\nBy April 18, Ravi was breathing more on his own. His fever had disappeared, and his blood pressure and heart rate had stabilized. The next day, he woke up, was taken off the ventilator and started breathing on his own.\n\nHe still could not speak and didn't know what had happened to him, but a nurse held up his phone so the family could see him on FaceTime. \"We couldn't stop crying,\" Ms. Yamin said. \"We just said: 'Oh my gosh, Ravi, we love you. These are happy tears.'\"\n\nMr. Sharma whispered into the phone for the first time the next day, his throat was still sore and hoarse from the ventilator tube.\n\nProgress continued in baby steps. He ate some applesauce one day, a whole container the next. He started walking using a walker for support.\n\nAfter a few weeks of inpatient physical therapy at Nassau University Medical Center, he graduated from a walker to a cane. He walked up stairs, sat in a chair and practiced getting up from the bed on his own.\n\nA full recovery from a stroke can take months or even years, and Mr. Sharma is also recovering from the lingering effects of Covid-19, which has left him fatigued, and 50 pounds lighter than before his illness, he said in a video interview with The Times.\n\nBut he has made great strides in a short time, and those closest to him say he is still the old Ravi: a social butterfly.\n\nMr. Sharma boasted that he is everyone's \"favorite patient\" at the rehab facility and that he is recovering quickly because staff members have been sneaking him chocolate milk and sweets.\n\n\"I got the doctors to order me ice cream as part of my diet,\" he said.\n\nHe wants to go home, see his family in person, continue to build strength and start building a future with his girlfriend, Leana Soman. They both cried when they were able to video chat for the first time.\n\n\"He couldn't speak, his throat was so bad, so I was lip reading,\" Ms. Soman recalled. \"He said, 'I love you,' and I said, 'I got that -- I love you too.'\"\n\nToo many people are still cavalier about the coronavirus, Mr. Sharma said, and young people think they are immune. The disease \"was like being hit by a bus,\" Mr. Sharma said.\n\n\"I'm 27, and if this could happen to me, it could happen to anyone,\" he said. \"This is real and it's scary. I want people to go out there and be cautious.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThey called it the Covid-19 swell.\n\nSpectacular waves more than 25 feet high barreled on Tahiti's famed Teahupo'o reef that day a month ago. Audible from miles away, Teahupo'o -- home of the 2024 surfing events of the Paris Olympics -- normally echoes like thunderous Morse code, calling in the best surfers from every corner of the globe. They would have buzzed to the reef by the dozen, spilling out of boats and riding Jet Skis to tow into waves as film crews in helicopters circled above.\n\nBut this time, very few people were out. \"Not even one boat,'' said Tikanui Smith, a Tahiti local and professional surfer whose exploits at Teahupo'o have earned him multiple Ride of the Year nominations from the World Surf League.\n\nSomething similar happened as a southern swell broke at Pleasure Point in Santa Cruz County, Calif., on April 9, the first day of what would be a weeklong beach ban. \"All we could do was stand there and watch it break,\" said Kyle Thiermann, a professional surfer. \"On a day that good, usually there are 100 surfers in the water. It made me feel like I'd jumped in a time machine and landed in a time before surfing.\"\n\nFrom Bali to Brazil, Costa Rica to California, the pandemic has widely shut down surfing, either through outright bans on access to beaches or from the inability of surfers to travel to them. But enough spots remain open to foment a schism between surfers who are able to get in the ocean and those stuck at home.\n\nThe World Surf League suspended its Championship Tour on March 12, just two weeks before its opening event on Australia's Gold Coast. The annual tour takes surfers to some of the world's most famous waves -- from the Eastern Cape of South Africa to the North Shore of O'ahu, Hawaii. The announcement rocked the surf world. Four days later, the league canceled or postponed all of its events through May.\n\nBut surfers are still drawn to the water, legally or otherwise.\n\nIn Australia, decisions on restricting access to the surf have fallen to the local councils. Some beaches in Sydney have been closed for weeks, and others like Bondi Beach have reopened from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekdays and for water sports only. Laying a towel down can bring a $1,000 fine.\n\nThe American surfer Lakey Peterson, the third-ranked woman on the 2019 World Surf League Championship Tour, has been in Australia since before the tour was suspended. Her husband is from Bells Beach, Australia, which was set to host the second Championship Tour event. Peterson has been able to surf four hours a day, expanding her repertoire of tricks.\n\n\"For nine years, I haven't had this much time to be able to work on things and practice,\" she said. \"I've been working on lay backs, aerials a fair amount. Just trying to better myself in the water.\"\n\nAnd across the Hawaiian Islands, lounging or loitering on the beach is prohibited but people have not been barred from going into the ocean.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As the Lakers and others return small business aid, Mnuchin says big companies could face \"criminal liability.\" Trump unveils a plan to help states expand testing.

He can keep surfing.\n\n\"We've been very fortunate here,\" Lenny said from his home in Maui. \"We're allowed to go surfing, windsurfing and do all these multiple sports, so long as we're keeping social distance.\"\n\nBut many of Brazil's beaches are closed, which means that Gabriel Medina, a two-time world champion and last year's runner-up, is moored on dry land in Maresias, a beach town in S\u00e3o Paulo state. He was preparing to leave for the airport to catch his flight to Australia when he learned the tour had been suspended.\n\nEven as beach access remains uneven, there is peer pressure to stay local and abide by government restrictions, the three-time world champion Mick Fanning of Australia said. \"There's a big push to surf your postal code,\" he said. \"I haven't really ventured south. I just don't feel like it's right.\"\n\nWorld Surf League officials said they remained hopeful they could salvage a 2020 Championship Tour. So far, two events -- the Corona Open, which was supposed to open the season on Australia's Gold Coast, and the Quiksilver Pro G-Land in Indonesia, which was scheduled for June -- have been canceled. Three other events have been postponed, including the Oi Rio Pro, the league's chief executive, Erik Logan, announced on Tuesday. Rio is the best attended event on the league calendar.\n\nLogan also announced on Tuesday that the league would build a one-day championship event onto the end of the tour calendar starting in 2021, with the final heat of the year determining the world title. Logan was less clear on what would happen this year.\n\nAfter staying dry for so long, Medina estimated that he would need three to four weeks of surfing and hitting the gym regularly to be ready for competition.\n\nAnd for every patient professional there are countless hobbyists desperate for salt water.\n\nThe drive to get in the water has manifested in offenses from the comical to the absurd and in enforcement that has varied from shots fired to nothing at all. In Costa Rica, a surfer fresh out of the water sprinted from a police officer who fired on him from behind. In Malibu, Calif., a stand-up paddler defied beach closures to catch over 20 perfect waves, then attempted to evade lifeguard and sheriff's boats by paddling to safety. Spoiler alert: He didn't make it.\n\nLast week, beaches reopened in parts of Southern California, including Ventura County, where Mayor Matt LaVere of Ventura advocated a softer closure that provided ocean access but no sun bathing, bathrooms or parking. Oceangoers have to arrive on foot or by bike.\n\n\"Ventura has some of the best waves in the world,\" LaVere, a surfer, said. \"Telling people in Ventura they can't surf is like telling them they can't breathe air.\"\n\nChad Nelsen, the chief executive of the Surfrider Foundation, was more circumspect. When the closures began, Surfrider, which has fought for beach access for 35 years and opened scores of beaches to surfers around the world, began its \"Stay Home, Shred Later\" campaign.\n\n\"People are losing their patience, which is completely understandable,\" Nelsen said. \"But the risk is we open places too soon, we increase community spread, get a second wave of infections, people suffer and we see extended closures.\"",

        "body": "The coronavirus has killed so many people in Iran that the country has resorted to mass burials, but in neighboring Iraq, the body count is fewer than 100.\n\nThe Dominican Republic has reported nearly 7,600 cases of the virus. Just across the border, Haiti has recorded about 85.\n\nIn Indonesia, thousands are believed to have died of the coronavirus. In nearby Malaysia, a strict lockdown has kept fatalities to about 100.\n\nThe coronavirus has touched almost every country on earth, but its impact has seemed capricious. Global metropolises like New York, Paris and London have been devastated, while teeming cities like Bangkok, Baghdad, New Delhi and Lagos have, so far, largely been spared.\n\nThe question of why the virus has overwhelmed some places and left others relatively untouched is a puzzle that has spawned numerous theories and speculations but no definitive answers. That knowledge could have profound implications for how countries respond to the virus, for determining who is at risk and for knowing when it's safe to go out again.\n\nThere are already hundreds of studies underway around the world looking into how demographics, pre-existing conditions and genetics might affect the wide variation in impact.\n\nDoctors in Saudi Arabia are studying whether genetic differences may help explain varying levels of severity in Covid-19 cases among Saudi Arabs, while scientists in Brazil are looking into the relationship between genetics and Covid-19 complications. Teams in multiple countries are studying if common hypertension medications might worsen the disease's severity and whether a particular tuberculosis vaccine might do the opposite.\n\nMany developing nations with hot climates and young populations have escaped the worst, suggesting that temperature and demographics could be factors. But countries like Peru, Indonesia and Brazil, tropical countries in the throes of growing epidemics, throw cold water on that idea.\n\nDraconian social-distancing and early lockdown measures have clearly been effective, but Myanmar and Cambodia did neither and have reported few cases.\n\nOne theory that is unproven but impossible to refute: maybe the virus just hasn't gotten to those countries yet. Russia and Turkey appeared to be fine until, suddenly, they were not.\n\nTime may still prove the greatest equalizer: The Spanish flu that broke out in the United States in 1918 seemed to die down during the summer only to come roaring back with a deadlier strain in the fall, and a third wave the following year. It eventually reached far-flung places like islands in Alaska and the South Pacific and infected a third of the world's population.\n\n\"We are really early in this disease,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Research Institute. \"If this were a baseball game, it would be the second inning and there's no reason to think that by the ninth inning the rest of the world that looks now like it hasn't been affected won't become like other places.\"\n\nDoctors who study infectious diseases around the world say they do not have enough data yet to get a full epidemiological picture, and that gaps in information in many countries make it dangerous to draw conclusions. Testing is woeful in many places, leading to vast underestimates of the virus's progress, and deaths are almost certainly undercounted.\n\nStill, the broad patterns are clear. Even in places with abysmal record-keeping and broken health systems, mass burials or hospitals turning away sick people by the thousands would be hard to miss, and a number of places are just not seeing them -- at least not yet.\n\nInterviews with more than two dozen infectious disease experts, health officials, epidemiologists and academics around the globe suggest four main factors that could help explain where the virus thrives and where it doesn't: demographics, culture, environment and the speed of government responses.\n\nEach possible explanation comes with considerable caveats and confounding counter-evidence. If an aging population is the most vulnerable, for instance, Japan should be at the top of the list. It is far from it. Nonetheless these are the factors that experts find the most persuasive.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Some countries take tiptoe steps in easing restrictions. China's race for a coronavirus vaccine is revitalizing a troubled industry. As Italy's lockdown lifts, how to define 'relative' becomes a sticking point. See more updates Updated 39m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York The Power of Youth\n\nMany countries that have escaped mass epidemics have relatively younger populations.\n\nYoung people are more likely to contract mild or asymptomatic cases that are less transmissible to others, said Robert Bollinger, a professor of infectious diseases at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine. And they are less likely to have certain health problems that can make Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, particularly deadly, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nAfrica -- with about 45,000 reported cases, a tiny fraction of its 1.3 billion people -- is the world's youngest continent, with more than 60 percent of its population under age 25. In Thailand and Najaf, Iraq, local health officials found that the 20-to-29 age group had the highest rate of infection but often showed few symptoms.\n\nBy contrast, the national median age in Italy, one of the hardest hit countries, is more than 45. The average age of those who died of Covid-19 there was around 80.\n\nYounger people tend to have stronger immune systems, which can result in milder symptoms, said Josip Car, an expert in population and global health at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore.\n\nIn Singapore and Saudi Arabia, for instance, most of the infections are among foreign migrant workers, many of them living in cramped dormitories. However, many of those workers are young and fit, and have not required hospitalization.\n\nAlong with youth, relative good health can lessen the impact of the virus among those who are infected, while certain pre-existing conditions -- notably hypertension, diabetes and obesity -- can worsen the severity, researchers in the United States say.\n\nThere are notable exceptions to the demographic theory. Japan, with the world's oldest average population, has recorded fewer than 520 deaths, although its caseload has risen with increased testing.\n\nThe Guayas region of Ecuador, the epicenter of an outbreak that may have claimed up to 7,000 lives, is one of the youngest in the country, with only 11 percent of its residents over 60 years old.\n\nAnd Dr. Jha of Harvard warns that some young people who are not showing symptoms are also highly contagious for reasons that are not well understood.\n\nCultural Distance\n\nCultural factors, like the social distancing that is built into certain societies, may give some countries more protection, epidemiologists said.\n\nIn Thailand and India, where virus numbers are relatively low, people greet each other at a distance, with palms joined together as in prayer. In Japan and South Korea, people bow, and long before the coronavirus arrived, they tended to wear face masks when feeling unwell.\n\nIn much of the developing world, the custom of caring for the elderly at home leads to fewer nursing homes, which have been tinder for tragic outbreaks in the West.\n\nHowever, there are notable exceptions to the cultural distancing theory. In many parts of the Middle East, such as Iraq and the Persian Gulf countries, men often embrace or shake hands on meeting, yet most are not getting sick.\n\nWhat might be called \"national distancing\" has also proven advantageous. Countries that are relatively isolated have reaped health benefits from their seclusion.\n\nFar-flung nations, such as some in the South Pacific and parts of sub-Saharan Africa, have not been as inundated with visitors bringing the virus with them. Health experts in Africa cite limited travel from abroad as perhaps the main reason for the continent's relatively low infection rate.\n\nCountries that are less accessible for political reasons, like Venezuela, or because of conflict, like Syria and Libya, have also been somewhat shielded by the lack of travelers, as have countries like Lebanon and Iraq, which have endured widespread protests in recent months.\n\nThe lack of public transportation in developing countries may have also reduced the spread of the virus there.\n\nHeat and Light\n\nThe geography of the outbreak -- which spread rapidly during the winter in temperate zone countries like Italy and the United States and was virtually unseen in warmer countries such as Chad or Guyana -- seemed to suggest that the virus did not take well to heat. Other coronaviruses, such as ones that cause the common cold, are less contagious in warmer, moist climates.\n\nBut researchers say the idea that hot weather alone can repel the virus is wishful thinking.\n\nSome of the worst outbreaks in the developing world have been in places like the Amazonas region of Brazil, as tropical a place as any.\n\n\"The best guess is that summer conditions will help but are unlikely by themselves to lead to significant slowing of growth or to a decline in cases,\" said Marc Lipsitch, the director of the Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics at Harvard University.\n\nThe virus that causes Covid-19 appears to be so contagious as to mitigate any beneficial effect of heat and humidity, said Dr. Raul Rabadan, a computational biologist at Columbia University.\n\nBut other aspects of warm climates, like people spending more time outside, could help.\n\n\"People living indoors within enclosed environments may promote virus recirculation, increasing the chance of contracting the disease,\" said Mr. Car of Nanyang Technological University.\n\nThe ultraviolet rays of direct sunlight inhibit this coronavirus, according to a study by ecological modelers at the University of Connecticut. So surfaces in sunny places may be less likely to remain contaminated, but transmission usually occurs through contact with an infected person, not by touching a surface.\n\nNo scientist has proposed that beaming light inside an infected person, as President Trump has suggested, would be an effective cure. And tropical conditions may have even lulled some people into a false sense of security.\n\n\"People were saying 'It's hot here, nothing will happen to me,'\" said Dr. Dom\u00e9nica Cevallos, a medical investigator in Ecuador. \"Some were even going out on purpose to sunbathe, thinking it would protect them from infection.\"\n\nEarly and Strict Lockdowns\n\nCountries that locked down early, like Vietnam and Greece, have been able to avoid out-of-control contagions, evidence of the power of strict social distancing and quarantines to contain the virus.\n\nIn Africa, countries with bitter experience with killers like H.I.V., drug-resistant tuberculosis and Ebola knew the drill and reacted quickly.\n\nAirport staff from Sierra Leone to Uganda were taking temperatures (since found to be a less effective measure) and contact details and wearing masks long before their counterparts in the United States and Europe took such precautions.\n\nSenegal and Rwanda closed their borders and announced curfews when they still had very few cases. Health ministries began contact tracing early.\n\nAll this happened in a region where health ministries had come to rely on money, personnel and supplies from foreign donors, many of which had to turn their attention to outbreaks in their own countries, said Catherine Kyobutungi, executive director of the African Population and Health Research Center.\n\n\"Countries wake up one day and they're like, 'OK, the weight of the country rests on our shoulders, so we need to step up,'\" she said. \"And they have. Some of the responses have been beautiful to behold, honestly.\"\n\nSierra Leone repurposed disease-tracking protocols that had been established in the wake of the Ebola outbreak in 2014, in which almost 4,000 people died there. The government set up emergency operations centers in every district and recruited 14,000 community health workers, 1,500 of whom are being trained as contact tracers, even though Sierra Leone has only about 155 confirmed cases.\n\nIt is not clear, however, who will pay for their salaries or for expenses like motorcycles and raincoats to keep them operating during the coming wet season.\n\nUganda, which also suffered during the Ebola contagion, quickly quarantined travelers from Dubai after the first case of coronavirus arrived from there. Authorities also tracked down about 800 others who had traveled from Dubai in previous weeks.\n\nThe Ugandan health authorities are also testing around 1,000 truck drivers a day. But many of those who test positive have come from Tanzania and Kenya, countries that are not monitoring as aggressively, leading to worries that the virus will keep penetrating porous borders.\n\nLockdowns, with bans on religious conclaves and spectator sporting events, clearly work, the World Health Organization says. More than a month after closing national borders, schools and most businesses, countries from Thailand to Jordan have seen new infections drop.\n\nIn the Middle East, the widespread shuttering of mosques, shrines and churches happened relatively early and probably helped stem the spread in many countries.\n\nA notable exception was Iran, which did not close some of its largest shrines until March 18, a full month after it registered its first case in the pilgrimage city of Qum. The epidemic spread quickly from there, killing thousands in the country and spreading the virus across borders as pilgrims returned home.\n\nAs effective as lockdowns are, in countries lacking a strong social safety net and those where most people work in the informal economy, orders closing businesses and requiring people to shelter in place will be difficult to maintain for long. When people are forced to choose between social distancing and feeding their families, they are choosing the latter.\n\nCounter-intuitively, some countries where authorities reacted late and with spotty enforcement of lockdowns appear to have been spared. Cambodia and Laos both had brief spates of infections when few social distancing measures were in place but neither has recorded a new case in about three weeks.\n\nLebanon, whose Muslim and Christian citizens often go on pilgrimages respectively to Iran and Italy, places rife with the virus, should have had high numbers of infections. It has not.\n\n\"We just didn't see what we were expecting,\" said Dr. Roy Nasnas, an infectious disease consultant at the University Hospital Geitaoui in Beirut. \"We don't know why.\"\n\nRoll of the Dice\n\nFinally, most experts agree that there may be no single reason for some countries to be hit and others missed. The answer is likely to be some combination of the above factors, as well as one other mentioned by researchers: sheer luck.\n\nCountries with the same culture and climate could have vastly different outcomes if one infected person attends a crowded social occasion, turning it into what researchers call a super-spreader event.\n\nThat happened when a passenger infected 634 people on the Diamond Princess cruise ship off the coast of Japan, when an infected guest attended a large funeral in Albany, Ga., and when a 61-year-old woman went to church in Daegu, South Korea, spreading the disease to hundreds of congregants and then to thousands of other Koreans.\n\nBecause an infected person may not experience symptoms for a week or more, if at all, the disease spreads under the radar, exponentially and seemingly at random. Had the woman in Daegu stayed home that Sunday in February, the outbreak in South Korea might have been less than half of what it is.\n\nSome countries that should have been inundated are not, leaving researchers scratching their heads.\n\nThailand reported the first confirmed case of coronavirus outside of China in mid-January, from a traveler from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the pandemic is thought to have begun. In those critical weeks, Thailand continued to welcome an influx of Chinese visitors. For some reason, these tourists did not set off exponential local transmission.\n\nAnd when countries do all the wrong things and still end up seemingly not as battered by the virus as one would expect, go figure.\n\n\"In Indonesia, we have a health minister who believes you can pray away Covid, and we have too little testing,\" said Dr. Pandu Riono, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Indonesia. \"But we are lucky we have so many islands in our country that limit travel and maybe infection.\"\n\n\"There's nothing else we're doing right,\" he added.",

        "body": "Your child may have setbacks during the school shutdown. But remember, schools will open again at some point and help get things back on track.\n\nAs a developmental pediatrician, I have worked throughout this coronavirus crisis with parents strained by fears about their child's learning, stresses around anxiety and behavior, and the disruption of school services.\n\nFor parents of children with special needs, who often carry an extra heavy load managing academics in the best of times, the burden while on home quarantine is magnified.\n\nMany educational services -- such as a full-day program for a child with severe autism -- are simply impossible to implement effectively online, and not all parents have time to monitor educational interventions. And the reality is that most parents are neither teachers nor therapists. Stay strong in planning for your family's well-being, but don't create more stress in your home by taking on more than is realistic.\n\nParents may fear that with schools closed, their children's progress will stall or reverse. But as always with children, long-term growth relies on a well-monitored three- or five-year plan, not every week or month along the way. Schools will open again at some point, and appropriate services will resume and methodically address whatever ground has been lost. It's far from ideal, but it is our reality right now.\n\nThat is not to say that you need to be resigned to accepting setbacks. If your child regresses developmentally or emotionally, reach out right away to your school, your pediatrician, or a mental health professional. Stay clear about what is possible now, and firm but patient in getting it done.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Powell warns economic damage could become permanent as Congress debates more support. 2020 will be the 'darkest winter in modern history' if changes aren't made, a whistle blower plans to testify. Manafort is released to home confinement amid concerns of contracting the virus in prison. See more updates Updated 1m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nOn a foundational level, our children's emotional well-being and resilience matter most. With or without special needs, focus on positive relationships, physical and emotional safety, and routines around exercise, sleep and general health. That is the most vital bottom line for our children.\n\nThe Benefits of Schedules\n\nChildren rely on adults to create structure. A cognitive skill set called \"executive function\" includes all of judgment and planning. Anything that seems to require \"management\" in life, from attention to projects to emotions, relies on these abilities. But they are not fully developed until our late 20s. Adults have the only grown-up brain in the house, so kids rely on us for those skills quite often.\n\nA consistent school schedule will cut down on arguing about schoolwork and fill a child's day in a useful way. It is also emotionally reassuring for kids to have familiar routines. On a practical level, many children focus better when given a single task (start with math ...) for a set amount of time (... from 8:30 to 9:15). A strong school plan may therefore create space for you to get your grown-up work done, too.\n\nTriage What Is Most Disruptive\n\nUse your resources and make sure you have a specific plan for heading off acutely intense behavioral or emotional concerns. You may not have much time for these interventions, such as connecting with a psychologist or behavioral specialist. Explore what is possible with your school or your pediatrician, however, because a strong plan will decrease your own stress by providing you with new parenting tools and teach your children useful skills too.\n\nBehavioral learning often relies initially on adult-led intervention and feedback rather than discussion or child therapy. That means even if a child cannot yet participate in treatment all that much, or their therapy has been disrupted, there may still be steps you can take. For children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, for example, parent training in early childhood can be almost as effective as working directly with kids. And for autism, a plan coordinated with your school's applied behavior analysis therapist may allow for social progress over these next weeks or months.\n\nIn the meantime, collaborate with your school district (or outside providers if you have them) to continue services as best as possible. If you have the time as a parent (and of course, many of us don't right now) there are also online parent resources for autism, A.D.H.D. and learning disabilities that may provide some guidance for at-home supports.\n\nSpecial education law has not been suspended. Interventions such as reading instruction or speech language therapy may continue even during these uncertain times, as can some behavioral services. Ask your school to provide guidance and to continue online services directly with school staff when possible.\n\nAlso recognize that all beginning learners need to develop academic \"fluency,\" meaning mastering skills like decoding words or math facts. That might mean using flashcards or an online math academic program, or activities such as having a child read aloud to you. A few consistent minutes over the upcoming months may go a long way toward staying on track for younger students.\n\nPlan Ahead for the Fall\n\nNow is also the right time to consider your child's academic plan for the fall. The process of updating developmental or academic interventions typically relies on classroom and therapist feedback, and sometimes updated testing. For now, parents, schools and service providers must remain flexible in creating the best plan possible from the information we have. You can lay the groundwork for your fall plan this spring and adjust as needed.\n\nYou can even get started with new evaluations if you have concerns about your child's learning or development. That process is harder with social distancing but remains possible. Much of educational and developmental evaluation relies on a comprehensive understanding of a child's developmental history, and reports from parents and teachers. Seek out community resources by placing a call to early intervention services, your school district, or a local developmental specialist.\n\nSupporting developmental and educational interventions always requires doing our best to make a strong plan, monitoring it over time and then allowing for change.\n\nBalancing common-sense, practical solutions now with a more complete plan once schools open is all any of us can expect of ourselves, or our children, in this uncertain time.\n\nFollowing are some suggested strategies and resources -- this is not meant to be an exhaustive list, and your child's doctors and therapists will be able to offer advice specific to your child's needs.\n\nFor A.D.H.D.:\n\nAround education, children with A.D.H.D. tend to struggle specifically with organization, time management and planning. Anticipate that by supervising and pulling together what needs to get done at the start of the day and when possible checking in on your child's organization periodically through the day.\n\nBehavioral change often relies on parent-created plans. Consistent use of praise, reward and limit setting is harder than it sounds -- but allows for improvement around A.D.H.D. and decreases tensions at home. Professionals such as psychologists or developmental pediatricians are able to provide guidance through telemedicine as well.\n\nA.D.H.D. frequently gets in the way of the healthy activities that improve A.D.H.D. symptoms in the first place. Strong sleep and exercise routines coupled with distinct screen time limits are a big help. Obviously most kids are using screen more than usual now, but still set boundaries.\n\nMedication is an option to consider as you would for any other medical condition.\n\nSome useful resources include: CHADD.org, ADD.org, Healthychildren.org.\n\nFor Autism:\n\nBehavioral therapy is the core treatment for autism, and quite hard to implement at home. Depending on a child's individual skills, some online intervention may work. Parent-led intervention is also highly recommended if you are experiencing specific disruptive behaviors.\n\nSocial skills can be worked on in a similar way, if you are able.

        "body": "As Australia announces plans to revive tourism, we look at 10 top travel destinations and their timetables for reopening. The challenge: balancing safety with the need to reboot.\n\nCovid-19 has upended daily life in much of the world for so long that the idea of traveling to another country or state seems like the stuff of dreams. But in the last week or so, as the idea of opening up to travelers has gained traction, some countries are taking concrete steps. Yesterday, Australia announced a three-stage plan to reopen the economy, which includes a focus on tourism. And some countries are forming regional alliances designed to minimize the risk of the virus, including an Australia-New Zealand travel \"bubble,\" and, in Europe, a travel \"corridor\" shared by Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.\n\nBut for many places, international flights carrying leisure travelers remain on hold or are banned outright, and the process of reopening remains speculative. The focus, instead, is on internal tourism, to be followed at some point by foreign tourism.\n\nHere is a look at 10 top tourist destinations and the beginnings of their plans for reopening in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand\n\nOn May 8, Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia announced a three-step plan for reopening, in which the country will gradually take steps to resume normal life. The third and final step of that plan includes the trans-Tasman \"bubble,\" which will eventually allow for travel between Australia and New Zealand. The alliance, in addition to geographic proximity, stems from their similarly successful handling of Covid-19 -- both countries continued to report low total case numbers, deaths and growth rates (New Zealand has declared the coronavirus \"eliminated,\" meaning the small number of new cases can all be tracked and traced).\n\nIs there an opening date? On May 7, Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, announced the possibility of reducing the country's lockdown measures to \"Level 2\" as soon as next week, pending cabinet approval. This would allow many Kiwis to go back to work, visit friends and family, and for businesses like markets, museums and dine-in restaurants to reopen, provided social distancing and hypervigilant hygienic practices are followed. Travel within the country will be allowed.\n\nWhat are the current restrictions? New Zealand and Australia have both shut their borders to all international travel and non-residents, in addition to greatly restricting movement within the countries themselves. The countries have since begun to slowly open up; in New Zealand, that's meant allowing outdoor exercise, small family gatherings and takeout and delivery service at restaurants and cafes.\n\nIn Australia, restrictions vary by state -- in New South Wales, for example, cafes and restaurants are open for takeout only, gatherings in public places are limited to two people and parklands are open for socially distant exercise. Disobeying current rules is considered a criminal offense and can lead to fines or imprisonment.\n\nAustralia's stage one allows a gradual reopening of retail stores, parks and outdoor sporting facilities. Dine-in restaurants and cafes can reopen, but are limited to 10 patrons at a time, and social distancing of four square meters per person. Hotels and hostels may reopen and travel within states will be allowed, though state borders will likely remain closed. All reopening timelines will be determined by individual states and territories -- currently, Queensland plans to begin its stage one May 15 and Tasmania on May 18.\n\nAs of now, there is no firm date for the proposed trans-Tasman Bubble, or for more advanced phases of opening in both countries. Per Prime Minister Morrison's recent remarks, he is hopeful that Australia will reach its third phase, which may include trans-Tasman travel, by July. When travel within the trans-Tasman Bubble has been deemed safe, both nations are interested in potentially expanding to include other Pacific island countries.\n\nHow will they open safely? When trans-Tasman travel is allowed, it's likely that a 14-day quarantine will be required following any travel between the two nations.\n\nWhat are the major obstacles? Much of Australia and New Zealand's success in containing Covid-19 can be attributed to the strictness of their lockdowns. Any easing of these measures comes with the possibility that the virus could begin circulating again. Proceeding with extreme caution, while attempting to effectively reopen their economies, will guide the coming weeks and months.\n\nGreece\n\nThanks to fast action and restrictions put in place before a major outbreak, Greece has avoided the major outbreaks of nearby Italy -- as of May 6, the country has reported 2,663 cases and 147 deaths.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The U.S. economy shed 20.5 million jobs in April. An aide to the vice president tested positive on Friday. The nation's largest cities emerge as focal points for the virus. See more updates Updated 9m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nIs there an opening date? The first phase of Greece's two-month plan began May 4, \"with the opening of some shops and services,\" according to VisitGreece.gr. More businesses are expected to open on May 11 and 18; next steps will be announced on May 18, with the opening of other businesses, including restaurants and hotels, starting June 1.\n\nWhat are the current restrictions? As restrictions continue to lift, Greeks are required to wear masks on public transit, in hospitals and in shops. Residents are still not allowed to travel beyond their \"wider region of residence;\" travel from outside the European Union, plus Italy, Spain, the Netherlands and Germany, is banned. All arrivals are subject to a 14-day quarantine.\n\nHow will they open safely? In addition to maintaining a gradual cadence of openings over the next one to two months, there are no plans to resume sporting events, festivals, concerts or other large, crowded gatherings. According to a government presentation on the easing of restrictions, May and June will be dedicated to a \"coordinated return to a 'new normal' with continuous monitoring,\" while the focus in July and beyond will be on \"sustaining the 'new normal' yet remaining alert, while simultaneously preparing for a second wave in the fall.\"\n\nStill, according to Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, the country hopes to open to tourists in the fall, using extensive testing and contact tracing, and placing emphasis on more easily distanced accommodations and activities, including agritourism and boating.\n\nWhat are the major obstacles? Balancing the need for tourism with safety. While Greece has fared better than many European nations, its economy, having only just recovered from years of debt and collapse, is at great risk. Tourism has been a major part of the recent economic improvements, welcoming more than 34 million visitors in 2019 while employing 20 percent of Greek workers.\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nAfter requiring some of the strictest confinement measures in the United States, including a nightly curfew, Puerto Rico is beginning to look forward; in addition to a gradual easing of the lockdown and reopening of businesses, the Puerto Rican Tourism Company announced a new two-step program that will allow businesses to be recognized for exercising high standards of cleanliness and safety. As of May 6, Puerto Rico's confirmed case count is 1,757, with 95 deaths.\n\nIs there an opening date? If the first round of openings, which started May 4, goes well, restaurants may be allowed to open between May 18 and 25. The curfew is still in place, until at least May 25.\n\nWhat are the current restrictions? Puerto Rico's initial lockdown restrictions, which went into effect March 16, included a closure of most businesses, the curfew and threats of fines or imprisonment for anyone who violated its terms. As of May 4, restrictions are loosening somewhat -- some smaller businesses are allowed to open, as long as they enforce social distancing and provide protective gear to employees. Parks and beaches remain closed (though exercise is allowed), and a curfew is still in effect between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. All visitors to the island are being screened for symptoms and are also requested to self-quarantine for 14 days.\n\nHow will they open safely? Puerto Rico's governor, Wanda V\u00e1zquez, has been unequivocal about her willingness to clamp down on restrictions at any sign of a surge. That, combined with the health and safety program for tourism-centered businesses, will allow travelers to make their own choices when selecting hotels, restaurants and services.\n\nWhat are the major obstacles? Puerto Rico's population of older people, and a shaky health care system that was strapped during Hurricane Maria. Fears of a similar collapse make the possibility of a surge even more worrisome, particularly one occurring in concert with hurricane season. A recent earthquake disturbed residents, too, damaging some buildings and briefly knocking out power.\n\nIceland\n\nThanks to an extensive program of testing and contact tracing, Iceland's response has been quite successful, with about 1,800 cases, 10 deaths and no new cases as of May 6. With an economy that's hugely reliant on tourism, the island nation is eager to find ways to safely reopen to the rest of the world.\n\nIs there an opening date? Travel restrictions banning most foreigners are in place until May 15; there is currently not a final decision on extending those restrictions or beginning the process of reopening on or after that date.\n\nWhat are the current restrictions? Iceland, more so than many countries, has remained relatively open -- two-meter (about 6.5 feet) social-distancing rules are emphasized, but many businesses and primary schools have remained open, and residents may go outside. As of May 4, high schools and universities have reopened and gatherings of 50 people and under are allowed, with expectations for gatherings under 100 to be allowed by the end of May. Since March 20, most foreign nationals have been banned from entering the country (with the exception of citizens of the European Union, Britain and the European Free Trade Association); as of April 20, all visitors were required to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nHow will they open safely? Details are scarce, but the government has deployed a task force to determine how to safely reopen the country this spring or summer.\n\nWhat are the major obstacles? Obstacles \"are all health-related,\" Elias Bj. Gislason, the director of the Icelandic Tourism Board, said. \"Can we open up the borders only for citizens from countries that have had success in handling the spread of the virus? And so on.\"\n\nMexico\n\nTourism is a major industry in Mexico -- the country saw close to 50 million visitors in 2018, with the vast majority from the United States. But with a steady rise of Covid-19 cases and a health care system that is at risk of being overwhelmed, a return to \"normal\" may be far off.\n\nIs there an opening date? There is no official opening date for tourist services, said Enrique Vega V\u00e1zquez, the publisher of VisitMexico.com, but many hotels and restaurant owners are hoping to open by June 1. \"Although everyone is confident that they will be able to reopen, the reality is that it is only what they have in mind,\" he said. While President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador has expressed his desire to reopen parts of the country by May 17, and the country in full by June 1, details of how that will happen remain scarce.\n\nWhat are the current restrictions? All citizens and visitors are encouraged to stay home, maintain social distance and wash hands frequently. Gatherings over 100 people have been banned, and schools are closed until May 30. As of March 21, Mexico and the United States entered a joint agreement limiting all movement between the U.S.-Mexico land border to essential travel. Air travel, however, is still operational -- all travelers entering the country are subject to health screenings. Hotels were ordered to cancel new and existing reservations on April 3, save those made by people carrying out essential business (with a letter from their employer stating their purpose); those hotels must limit occupancy to 15 percent. Restrictions also vary by state and municipality.\n\nHow will they open safely? A joint statement from Miguel Torruco Marqu\u00e9s, the secretary of tourism, and Jorge Alcocer Varela, the secretary of health, was published on April 23 and laid out details for the hospitality industry to insure cleanliness and safety, and to allow hotels and restaurants to safely function once the threat of Covid-19 has waned. Details include how frequently to disinfect spaces, procedures for disinfection and cleanliness requirements for employees, including providing them with protective equipment.\n\nWhat are the major obstacles? Mr. V\u00e1zquez is unsure how these protocols will be enacted. \"In reality, they are only plans,\" he said, because business owners \"do not really know how they will apply these measures.\"\n\nFrance\n\nOne of the harder hit European nations, France's early Covid-19 surge has slowed, as the number of patients requiring hospitalization has steadily decreased. But while movement within the country may become less restricted in the coming weeks, international travel will take much longer to resume.\n\nIs there an opening date? Prime Minister Edouard Philippe recently announced a \"very gradual\" easing of restrictions starting May 11. A Council on Tourism will work on an overview for a tourism-centered reopening plan to be delivered by the end of this month. However, France's Parliament voted to extend the official \"health emergency\" until July 24 -- this maintains the closed borders outside the European Union, and requires a two-week quarantine for \"French or foreign nationals entering French territory from a list of geographical areas to be determined.\"\n\nWhat are the current restrictions? A \"containment and confinement\" program was announced on March 17, and further extended on April 28 until May 11. Residents are not allowed to leave their homes without a written certificate stating that they are engaging in one of a few approved activities, including purchasing food, assisting a family member or limited exercise. Borders outside of the \"European/Schengen\" area were also closed.\n\nHow will they open safely? \"The opening process will be gradual,\" said Kate Schwab, the media relations manager at Atout France, France's national tourism development agency. Small museums, libraries, stores and open-air markets will be allowed to open first, starting on May 11, with social distancing rules in place, but restaurants, cafes, major museums and beaches will be closed until early June. Masks will be required on public transportation, and gatherings will be limited to 10 or fewer people. Travel between regions in France will continue to be limited. \"Each region will be classified as either red (high infection zone/not safe to relax confinement) or green (OK to relax confinement) but the ultimate decision will rest with the local authorities,\" Ms. Schwab said. Paris, Calais, Strasbourg and Dijon are currently classified as red areas.\n\nWhat are the major obstacles? Keeping gatherings small and avoiding crowded public transportation. \"French destinations are working at implementing sanitary measures to adapt their cultural offerings to allow smaller groups,\" Ms. Schwab said. A 20 million euro (about $21.6 million dollars) government initiative to encourage cycling over using public transportation was recently announced, with particular focus on opening up Paris. \"Mayor Anne Hidalgo has announced that 30 miles of streets normally used for cars will be reserved for cyclists, including Rue de Rivoli and Boulevard Saint-Michel,\" said Ms. Schwab. \"Furthermore, another 30 streets will be pedestrian only, particularly around schools to avoid groups of people.\"\n\nSingapore\n\nSingapore's early success in containing Covid-19 was upended in April with news of major outbreaks in migrant worker dormitories. Still, while the country's positive case number climbs -- at more than 20,000, it's currently the highest in Southeast Asia -- aggressive testing and contact tracing has kept the death toll low (with 20 reported as of May 6).\n\nIs there an opening date? Currently, restrictions are in place until June 1, though \"select services,\" including barbers and hairdressers, laundry services and cake and confectionary shops, will be permitted to open May 12.\n\nWhat are the current restrictions? All foreign, short-term visitors have been denied entry into Singapore since March 23. On April 7, strict \"circuit breaker\" measures were enacted throughout the country -- all meetings and large gatherings are canceled; residents are to stay home as much as possible (face coverings are mandatory when leaving the house for essentials or emergency medical services); schools and nonessential businesses are closed; and dining establishments are restricted to delivery and takeout.\n\nHow will they open safely? According to Rachel Loh, the Singapore Tourism Board's regional director of the Americas, the board is working with the National Environmental Agency to create an \"SG Clean\" certification process for hotels, food and beverage establishments, tourist attractions and more. Starting May 12, the government is also requiring open businesses to participate in the SafeEntry system, which will track all employees and visitors who enter and exit a location, to continue contact tracing efforts. The country is also testing the efficacy of using a \"robot dog\" to enforce social distancing.\n\nWhat are the major obstacles? Opening up safely, Ms. Loh said, will be dependent on \"ramping up testing and harnessing technology for faster contact tracing.\" But tourism comes with its own brand of risk. \"We recognize that tourism businesses attract high human traffic and social interactions.\"\n\nHawaii\n\nWhile cases remain relatively low -- 625 total with 17 deaths as of May 5 -- the state's government has proceeded cautiously. The economic losses from tourism are worrisome, too, in a place that relies so heavily on the industry. A 2020 Strategic Plan published by the Hawaii Tourism Authority at the beginning of this year credited tourism with $17.75 billion spent in the state in 2019, and 216,000 local jobs.\n\nIs there an opening date? On May 7, the first wave of nonessential businesses were allowed to open, including astronomical observatories, carwashes and some retail services. The required 14-day quarantine for air arrivals was also extended until at least May 31.\n\nWhat are the current restrictions? Residents and visitors to Hawaii are asked to stay home, or in their place of residence, as much as possible, venturing out only for essential business or activities. Outdoor exercise, including running, walking and surfing, is allowed, as long as social distancing is practiced. While there is not currently an active ban on traveling to Hawaii, it is strongly discouraged. Visitors and residents who arrive by airplane are required to self-quarantine for 14 days (some of those who haven't followed the rules have received a free ticket home); the same applies to travel between the Hawaiian islands.\n\nHow will they open safely? Gov. David Ige's reopening plan differs by island. For example, retail establishments will not open on Oahu until May 15; retail in Maui still does not have a targeted opening date. All openings may be rolled back or paused if cases begin to sharply increase.\n\nWhat are the major obstacles? Balancing safety and resources. While a government-led task force has been announced, the sharp decline in travel, and the current 14-day quarantine requirement, renders any kind of immediate relief challenging.\n\nItaly\n\nFew countries have been hit harder by Covid-19 than Italy (the United States being a notable exception), which, as of May 6, has seen well over 200,000 cases and some 30,000 deaths. As the country cautiously begins to reopen, tourism officials insist that tourism in Italy will start again this year.\n\nIs there an opening date? Following the recent limited openings of some establishments, further openings are planned for May 18 -- namely, additional shops, museums and libraries -- and June 1, when bars and restaurants may be allowed to reopen for eat-in service, if infection rates continue to slow.\n\nWhat are the current restrictions? This week, Italy's lockdown, which began March 10, slowly began to lift, as parks reopened along with bars and restaurants for takeout. Some Italians are allowed to return to work, and while group gatherings are still banned, family visits are allowed. Residents may travel across different provinces to return home, but cannot go back and forth. In a televised statement on April 26, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte urged Italians to maintain one-meter social distancing, or about three feet. Anyone who enters Italy from outside the country must self-quarantine for two weeks. Travelers from the United States have not been explicitly banned, but travelers must prove that they are \"returning to their residence or entering the country for justifiable work reasons, special needs or health emergencies.\"\n\nHow will they open safely? Social distancing rules stand, and masks are required, even for the family visits mentioned above. Schools are expected to remain closed until September.\n\nWhat are the major obstacles? Again, the need to balance health considerations and a desperate need to boost the economy. Italy's already suffering economy has taken an enormous hit following nearly two months of shutdown and a 95 percent drop in tourism (the national tourism industry is predicting 20 billion euros in losses from tourism this year in comparison to 2019).\n\nFollow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Family of U.S. Marine killed in Iraq surprised with parade outside California home.\n\n-- Thousands pack Southern California beaches to beat heat wave.\n\n-- Italian bishops seeking return of public Masses along with other freedoms.\n\n-- Italy's sports teams given go-ahead to resume training in mid-May.\n\n___\n\nSIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- The family of a U.S. Marine killed in Iraq last month had to postpone his memorial service because of restrictions on large gatherings in California to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nOn Sunday morning, they were surprised with a parade outside their Simi Valley home that began with a police helicopter flyover, followed by about 1,500 law enforcement vehicles, fire engines and cars.\n\nThe Ventura County Star reports the huge turnout to honor Gunnery Sgt. Diego D. Pongo was orderly.\n\nPongo's sister-in-law helped organize the parade to surprise his parents and brothers. The city's police department helped with traffic control.\n\nCommunity members kept the parade going for more than two hours, and many of their cars blasted music while kids hung out of windows waving flags. People who gathered on the sidewalk to watch the parade followed social distancing measures, Sgt. Patrick Zayicek told the newspaper.\n\n\"It was a great show of support in our community.,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- China's ambassador to Australia has told a newspaper that the Australian government's pursuit of an independent international inquiry into the coronavirus outbreak could spark a Chinese consumer boycott of students and tourists visiting the country, as well as sales of major exports including beef and wine.\n\nAmbassador Cheng Jingye told The Australian Financial Review in an interview published Monday that Australia's push for an inquiry was \"dangerous\" and predicted it would fail to gain traction among global leaders.\n\n\"Resorting to suspicion, recrimination or division at such a critical time could only undermine global efforts to fight against this pandemic,\" Cheng said.\n\nCheng did not accept that the virus had started in a \"wet market\" in the city of Wuhan, saying the scientific jury was still out on its origins.\n\nAustralian Health Minister Greg Hunt said such an independent inquiry was in the interests of Australia and the world.\n\nThe Australian government has called for an inquiry into the virus and for changes to the World Health Organization.\n\nEducation is Australia's third largest export industry and China is the largest source of students studying in Australia. China is also Australia's largest trading partner.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the accuracy of the newspaper story.\n\n___\n\nLOS ANGELES -- A lingering heat wave lured people to Southern California beaches, rivers and trails again Sunday, prompting warnings from officials that defiance of stay-at-home orders could reverse progress and bring the coronavirus surging back.\n\nTens of thousands of people packed the sand at Newport Beach in Orange County, where residents compared weekend crowds to the Fourth of July and lifeguards reminded people to stay apart if they were in groups of six or more.\n\nNeighboring Huntington Beach also saw big gatherings, despite the closure of parking lots and metered parking restricted along Pacific Coast Highway. Temperatures were close to 90 degrees.\n\nRobin Ford surveyed the crush of visitors with concern.\n\n\"Unless all these people are in one household, it does look like they are not social distancing,\" Ford told the Orange County Register. \"They could be spread out more.\"\n\n___\n\nROME -- After Italy's bishops complained that the latest lockdown rules still don't allow public Masses, Premier Giuseppe Conte's office has promised to come up with a plan that would let the faithful attend services while respecting social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSince a national lockdown began in early March, churches in Italy haven't been allowed to hold Masses for the public, although they can keep their doors open for those wanting to pray individually.\n\nConte on Sunday announced some easing of containment measures for the nation, starting May 4.\n\nIn response, the Italian bishops conference quickly put out a sharply worded statement, saying bishops \"cannot accept seeing the exercise of freedom of worship be compromised\" and insisting that the faithful must have access especially to the sacraments.\n\n___\n\nROME -- After seven weeks in lockdown to contain one of the world's worst outbreaks of COVID-19, Italians are regaining some freedoms.\n\nPremier Giuseppe Conte says that starting May 4, public parks and gardens will re-open and people will be able to visit relatives who live in the same region.\n\nHowever, Conte told the nation in a televised address Sunday night that citizens must practice social distancing. In the case of parks, mayors can impose limits, such as how many people enter, to avoid crowding.\n\nDuring family visits, people will have to wear masks and can't hold parties. If people don't follow the new measures, Conte says \"the curve of contagion can rise again, it will go out of control, deaths will climb and we'll have irreparable damage\" to the economy.\n\nConte says professional sports teams can resume training on May 18 and athletes in individual sports can resume training on May 4.\n\nThat means the Serie A soccer league could resume playing games in June. It has been suspended since March 9. Twelve rounds remain in Serie A, plus four other games that were postponed from the 25th round. The Italian Cup was suspended after the first leg of the semifinals.\n\nAlso on May 18, libraries, museums and art exhibitions can re-open.\n\nFactories, construction sites and wholesale supply businesses can resume activity as soon as they put safety measures into place aimed at containing COVID-19.\n\nBut Conte says that if the epidemiological curve of contagion starts to rise again, the government will quickly intervene and shut down such industrial activity again.\n\nConte offered a new mantra for the about-to-begin second phase: \"If you love Italy.... keep the social distance.\"\n\nHealth ministry figures indicate that Italy had seen its lowest day-to-day increase in deaths - 260 - since mid-March, during the first week of lockdown. Starting May 4, funerals will be allowed, but preferably should be held in the open, no more than 15 persons can participate and mourners must wear masks. If all goes well, retail shops will reopen on May 18, and restaurants, cafes, barber shops and hair salons on June 1.\n\n___\n\nFISHERS, Ind. -- A church in suburban Indianapolis resumed in-person services for the first time in a over a month.\n\nThe iTown Church in Fishers limited the number of attendees to 10 on Sunday in order to adhere to a state order that prohibits gatherings of over 10 people. According to the Indianapolis Star, the 40-minute services began on the hour, with each service followed by a 20-minute period to allow cleaning crews to sterilize the area.\n\n___\n\nPARIS -- While the number of COVID-19 patients in intensive care in France is continuing to trend downward, the overall number of ICU patients is increasing, with more people needing emergency care for other ailments.\n\nThe build-up of patients in French ICUs comes amid concerns that people with long-term medical problems have been delaying or not getting treatment during the outbreak, while hospitals have been struggling with huge flows of patients seriously ill with the new coronavirus.\n\nThe Health Ministry said hospital ICUs were treating 7,553 people on Sunday, 28 more than on Saturday.\n\nBut the proportion of COVID-19 patients in ICUs was again down, at 4,682. That was 43 fewer than the day before.\n\nThe ministry said the increase of non-COVID patients in ICUs \"underscores the necessity of tracking and treating patients with chronic illnesses as well as the urgent need to care for serious acute illnesses.\"\n\nThe overall death toll from France's virus outbreak is now up to 22,856, behind only Italy and Spain in Europe. More than one-third of France's victims died in care facilities, mostly for the elderly.\n\n___\n\nLAUREL, Mont. -- Montana took its first, halting step toward reopening as churchgoers returned to services after a month-long hiatus and a general stay-at-home order expired.\n\nWhile other states have been extending restrictions amid the continuing spread of the coronavirus, Montana is among those that are beginning to loosen rules in hopes of restoring battered economies and regaining some normalcy.\n\nRoughly 100 people streamed into St. Anthony Catholic Church in Laurel on Sunday, where ushers tried to keep families separate from one another and large bottles of hand sanitizer were on offer at the sanctuary's entrance. Church member Jack Auzqui says being unable to attend had been spiritually difficult for him and his wife. Returning, he said, was akin to a family being reunited.\n\nRev. Bart Stevens opened with an instruction for attendees \"not to linger\" after the Mass to minimize social interactions.\n\nAt Christ the King Lutheran Church in Billings, Pastor Ryan Wendt said the church was mixing faith with common sense precautions. Every other pew was kept empty to comply with social distancing guidelines, while elderly and medically-vulnerable members of the congregation were advised to stay home.\n\n___\n\nTORONTO -- Canada's most populous province says all publicly-funded schools will remain closed until May 31 to keep students and staff safe amid the pandemic.\n\nOntario Education Minister Stephen Lecce says the decision was based on advice from medical experts. Lecce says the school closure could be further extended. Students have already transitioned to learning online over the past month.\n\nThe Ministry of Education says it has already distributed 20,000 iPads to students whose families don't have the means to access online learning.\n\n___\n\nCENTRAL, La. -- A Louisiana pastor is holding services in his church, defying house arrest orders that followed an assault charge related to his decision to hold mass gatherings in defiance of public health orders during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nA livestream from Life Tabernacle Church on Sunday showed Tony Spell walking among more than 100 congregants, often repeating the phrase, \"I've just got to get to Jesus. ... Come on America, let's get back to Jesus.\" Nearly all parishioners were not wearing face masks, and social distancing was not being practiced.\n\nThe police department in Central, a suburb Baton Rouge, says on their Facebook page that Spell turned himself into the department last week on charges of aggravated assault and improper backing.\n\nTrey Bennett has kept up a one-man demonstration in front of the church since Easter Sunday, when he noticed hundreds of parishioners still attending services in defiance of the state's stay-at-home mandate, which bans gatherings of more than 10 people. Houses of worship across Louisiana have turned to online services instead.\n\nLast Sunday, Spell drove a church bus in reverse in the direction of the sign-holding protester. Spell already faces misdemeanor charges for holding in-person church services despite the ban on gatherings.\n\nDozens of Spell's parishioners met him at the East Baton Rouge Parish prison, dressed in their Sunday best, arrived in church buses to show support. In a livestream from the church, images including photos from Spell's arrest, as well as information for a GoFundMe account to help with his legal costs, played over music being performed at the church.\n\n___\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly says she's reached a deal that could resolve a lawsuit brought by two churches challenging her order banning religious gatherings of more than 10 people to help slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nUnder the deal, the two churches and the Democratic governor agreed to the extension of a federal judge's temporary restraining order that allows those churches to disregard the 10-person limit as long as they complied with social-distancing measures.\n\nThe extension essentially allows the two Kansas churches to continue their in-person services while the governor finalizes her plans for new re-opening restrictions that would take effect May 4.\n\nKansas has traced five coronavirus clusters that resulted in seven deaths to church gatherings.\n\n___\n\nNEW YORK -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the 367 deaths from the coronavirus that he reported Sunday were \"horrific,\" but the number was less than half the nearly 800 deaths that occurred in a single day during the pandemic's peak in New York.\n\nIt is the first time this month that the statewide daily death toll has been below 400.\n\nCuomo also reports that the number of hospitalizations, which still topped 1,000, and the number of individuals put on a ventilator had dropped as well.\n\nThe deaths include 349 patients who died in hospitals and 18 individuals who died in nursing homes, the Democratic governor said.\n\nOn Saturday, Cuomo said there were 437 deaths on Friday.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "Telemedicine is teaching us new ways to communicate with our patients.\n\nAs I wait for the interpreter to call the mother and then connect me into our three-way call, I berate myself for how bad my Spanish has become. I imagine it will continue to get worse. But what I am also realizing in this 30 seconds of dead airtime is that my overall communication skills are dwindling, too. I realize that in normal, non-Covid times, I do a lot of nonverbal communication with my patients. That I can't do over the telephone.\n\nCalling my patients at home, with or without video, has become my new normal. After 25 years of being a pediatrician, telemedicine is teaching me new ways to communicate with families. On the phone, with or without an interpreter, I try to listen carefully to the pauses in a mother's voice, to know when it is my turn to speak and ask questions. It's hard to tell if a patient is done speaking or just pausing. I find myself interrupting patients far more than I do with face-to-face visits.\n\nI try to hear the mother above the babbling of her baby. And then to listen to the babbling of the baby. Is it joyful? Are there big breaths between the babbling?\n\nA federal government waiver, issued early in March, expanded the use of federally funded health insurance -- Medicaid, Medicare and the Children's Health Insurance Program -- to pay for telemedicine visits. The goal was to allow more people with symptoms of illness to be heard, and sometimes also seen, by a health care provider without the risk of exposure to coronavirus at a doctor's office or hospital. The federal government has been expanding the use of telemedicine for years -- but like so many changes in this pandemic, what used to take years to transform, we are now doing within weeks.\n\nIn my former life of face-to-face visits, when I walked into an exam room, introduced myself, and sat down -- long before I laid hands or a stethoscope on the baby -- I watched the baby breathe. Is her chest heaving with every breath? Is she flaring her nostrils? Is her mouth moist? The equivalent over the phone may be trying to appreciate how worried the mother's voice sounds. But it's no substitute.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. An internal Trump administration report expects about 200,000 daily cases by June. N.Y. doctors warn about a mysterious illness affecting children that might be tied to Covid-19. The reality of coronavirus in the U.S.: An unrelenting crush of cases and deaths. See more updates Updated 27m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nIn face-to-face visits, when I've decided that the symptoms the mother is worried about are a common cold and not something serious, I try to show the mother how, despite the runny nose and cough, her infant is doing well. I often hold a not-yet-walking infant under her arms while the mother and I watch in awe as the infant holds her head up and takes a step forward. \"Que fuerza ella tiene!\"\n\nOn the phone, as I listen to the interpreter tell me that the mother said that the child does not have a fever and is eating and sleeping well, I am convinced that the symptoms are from the common cold. But I have no similar magic trick to boost the mother's confidence in my diagnosis.\n\nSeeing the same families over and over, watching their children grow, the parents and I build trust. In face-to-face visits, I try to build trust in all the ways we teach our students: I introduce myself, I sit down, I listen, I hold their hands when it feels appropriate. And when a pediatric visit calls for it, I follow a toddler under the desk, squatting to get my stethoscope on his chest.\n\nSometimes on the phone or video, there's a delay or echo. It might be caused by the bad internet I have at home. But it might be the patient's bad internet, who knows.\n\nI know in many ways I am lucky. Many of my colleagues are taking care of patients who are sick or dying from Covid-19, at high risk to themselves. I have a paying job that allows me to work from home. I had asked to stop seeing patients face-to-face early in the pandemic, because I am being treated for metastatic colon cancer and am immunocompromised.\n\nDespite the nausea and vomiting my biweekly chemo appointments bring, they remind me of the pleasures of face-to-face health care. I am wearing a mask, my providers are wearing masks, and yet face-to-face, I can see in their eyes when they are smiling. We can watch each other's body language to see when it's the other person's turn to start speaking. Masks are not great for communication, but they easily surpass telehealth.\n\nI am getting better at it, though. I started by using my landline, which had better reception than my cellphone, then returned to my cellphone after downloading some apps that allowed my patients and me to hear each other more clearly. Now I have a hospital-issued cellphone with greater security and apps that make a video call easier.\n\nSome of the changes we make and the new skills we develop during this pandemic will be worth sustaining long after it is over. I am learning to listen for when it is my turn to speak, to diagnose rashes on a phone screen, to identify emotions from words and tone as much as from facial expressions. I am working on building trust over the phone.\n\nAt the end of a face-to-face visit, I always ask the parent, usually a mother, if there's anything else I can do for her today. She may have some questions while we are both sitting down, her baby on her lap. Or she may not have any questions until my hand is on the door handle to leave and she says, \"Oh, doctor, one more thing...,\" which often turns out to be the most important part of the visit.\n\nNow, at the end of this virtual visit, I ask the mother if there's anything else I can do for her today. She says no, she's set, she just wanted to know if she should bring her baby to the emergency room, and she's relieved she doesn't have to. I say great, that she should feel free to call us back if she has any other questions. She says goodbye, the translator says goodbye, and then I say goodbye. And then there is a little bit of dead airtime before we all find the right button to hang up.\n\nMarjorie Rosenthal is a pediatrician at Yale.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nLONDON -- As the British government comes under mounting criticism for its response to the coronavirus -- one that has left Britain vying with Italy and Spain as the worst hit countries in Europe -- Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his aides have defended themselves by saying they are \"guided by the science.\"\n\nThe trouble is, nobody knows what the science is.\n\nThe government's influential Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies -- known by its soothing acronym, SAGE -- operates as a virtual black box. Its list of members is secret, its meetings are closed, its recommendations are private and the minutes of its deliberations are published much later, if at all.\n\nYet officials invoke SAGE's name endlessly without ever explaining how it comes up with its advice -- or even who these scientists are.\n\nThat lack of transparency has become a point of contention, as officials struggle to explain why they waited until late March to shift from a laissez-faire approach to the virus to the stricter measures adopted by other European countries. Critics say the delay may have worsened a death toll now surging past 20,000, and they fault the government for leaving people in the dark about why it first chose this riskier path.\n\nWith all the secrecy, even some of Britain's top scientists say they don't know whether they can trust the government's approach.\n\n\"Is the science being followed by the government on coronavirus?\" said David King, a former chief scientific adviser to the government. \"I don't know, because I don't know what the advice is, and there isn't the freedom for the scientists to tell the public what their advice is.\"\n\nProfessor King, who counseled Prime Minister Tony Blair on the foot-and-mouth disease that infected British farm animals in 2001, said there was no justification for the government to withhold either the advisory group's membership or the minutes of its meetings. Doing so, he said, eroded public trust in the government, especially given the bewildering twist and turns in its response.\n\nIt also raises questions about an academic group that ought to be a point of pride for Britain: the country's best scientific minds, in fields from epidemiology to behavioral science, assembled from cutting-edge labs at Cambridge, Oxford, Imperial College and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\n\"The names are likely to come out at some stage,\" said David Lidington, who served as a deputy to Mr. Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May. He warned that the government's lack of disclosure would only cause more headaches later. \"There is the risk that if names leak out after a time it becomes a great shock-horror,\" he said, adding that it would be better to make a virtue of transparency.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Merkel: 'Let us not squander what we have achieved.' The pandemic is shaking beliefs about American exceptionalism. China to give millions more to the W.H.O. after the U.S. halts funding. See more updates Updated 36m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\nEven now, outside scientists and doctors are second-guessing the advice of these unnamed authorities.\n\nWhy, for example, did SAGE recommend less stringent social-distancing measures on March 9, when France and Ireland were banning large events and ordering lockdowns, and there was ample evidence from Italy of the epidemic's rapid and lethal spread? (The unusual disclosure came in a report the government posted about the predicted effects of various social-distancing measures.)\n\nWhy in late February did a subgroup of SAGE experts underestimate the percentage of people who would have to be hospitalized as a result of contracting the virus, and why did their models underestimate the speed at which the pathogen spread?\n\nWhy did those scientists agree to classify the risk level of the contagion to the public as \"moderate,\" even after weeks of evidence that it was being transmitted between humans in China?\n\nWhy, after Imperial College London published a frightening study on March 16 that projected up to 500,000 deaths if Britain did not act more aggressively to curb the virus, did Mr. Johnson wait another full week to close nonessential shops and order people to stay in their homes?\n\n\"Political decisions are often framed as following the best scientific advice,\" said Connor Rochford, a physician and former consultant at McKinsey & Company. \"But science is nothing more than a normative claim about how we ought to make a decision. These are best-guess estimates.\"\n\nSome said the frequent references of Mr. Johnson and his aides to the scientists should be a warning sign. If, as is likely, the government's handling of the crisis is scrutinized in a future parliamentary inquiry, officials are likely to justify their actions by saying they were listening to the experts.\n\n\"It has become a shield for them,\" said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. \"If things go off, you can always say, 'Well, it was the experts who told us.'\"\n\nThe government has deflected pressure to identify the group's members or how many there are by noting that Patrick Vallance, the current chief scientific adviser, who chairs the group, regularly appears in public at news conferences. The government also posts brief reports from some of SAGE's subgroups, and the data that go into its models, on the internet.\n\nIn a recent letter to Parliament, Professor Vallance said anonymity protected the security of scientists and also shielded them \"from lobbying and other forms of unwanted influence which may hinder their ability to give impartial advice.\" He added that people were free to disclose their membership.\n\nOne member who has -- Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease specialist who is the director of Wellcome Trust -- acknowledged the limitations of the system when he recently told the BBC that the New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group, which advises SAGE, underestimated the threat of the contagion in March.\n\n\"The U.K.,\" Dr. Farrar added, \"is likely to be certainly one of the worst, if not the worst, affected countries in Europe.\"\n\nAnother member who has become a household name, and a source of scrutiny for his eye-watering statements, is Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London. His team of modelers produced the March 16 report that prompted Downing Street to impose a lockdown (it was also influential at the White House, which embraced social distancing).\n\nProfessor Ferguson, who collaborates with the World Health Organization and has advised other countries on how to deal with epidemics, later came down with symptoms of the virus himself. In late March, testifying before Parliament from self-isolation in his house, he generated more headlines when he said that Britain could keep its death toll under 20,000 if it stuck with strict social distancing.\n\nProfessor Ferguson did not reply to requests to discuss his advice to the government or the deliberations of SAGE.\n\nBut in an interview with The New York Times the day the March 16 report was published, he laid out the choice Britain faced: Manage the spread of the virus in a way that minimized deaths but allowed a significant percentage of the population to become infected -- a situation known as \"herd immunity.\" Or tamp down transmission of the virus by imposing a lockdown of the kind the Chinese government did in Wuhan. In the end, he said, there was no choice but to take the latter course.\n\n\"The U.K. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term,\" Professor Ferguson said. \"We don't have a clear exit strategy, but we're going to have to suppress this virus, frankly indefinitely, until we have a vaccine. It's a difficult position for the world to be in.\"\n\nUntil mid-March, Professor Ferguson, Professor Vallance and other scientists had appeared receptive to the case for \"herd immunity.\" Then, confronted with new numbers that projected hospitals would be overwhelmed with patients and that the death toll would skyrocket, they pivoted to a suppression strategy.\n\nWhat is unclear is the role SAGE played in shifting the government's thinking.\n\nOne of the few public documents that gives a glimpse into its deliberations -- a March 9 report assessing the potential impact of social distancing measures -- said the group recommended \"a combination of individual home isolation of symptomatic cases, household isolation and social distancing of the over 70s.\"\n\nThat is far short of the lockdown measures Britain ultimately adopted. It did not, for example, include a ban on large gatherings, like concerts and sporting events, in part because behavioral scientists doubted there would be enough compliance with the bans to reduce the spread of the virus.\n\nNor did it include a recommendation for widespread testing and contact tracing of people who had contracted the virus -- a policy the government had pursued with some success during the earliest days of the outbreak in Britain.\n\n\"I'm guessing there was a debate between containment and mitigation, and they decided to go with Option B,\" Professor Sridhar said. But she added there was no way to be sure until the deliberations were made public.\n\nAmong the other mysteries of SAGE is the makeup of the group. Professor Vallance said it includes representatives from more than 20 institutions, with expertise ranging from molecular evolution to microbiology. There are four expert groups, with anywhere from five to 45 members, whose advice is funneled into SAGE. Some scientists, like Professor Ferguson, serve on multiple panels.\n\nBut outside experts questioned whether it has enough representation from fields like public health and logistics. Britain's lack of masks, gloves and other protective gear has become another weak link in its response.\n\nSome experts also said the scientists suffered from a lack of independence. While Professor Vallance has begun to show some daylight with the government -- he recently said SAGE would re-examine the government's decision not to advise people to wear masks -- his regular public appearances next to Mr. Johnson and other cabinet ministers have made him look too much like an agent of the government rather than an independent adviser, according to critics.\n\nOn Thursday, the government said it would consider the latest scientific advice on masks and it seemed likely to encourage their use -- a decision complicated by the shortage of masks for people who work in hospitals and nursing homes.\n\nSome of SAGE's internal debates play out in competing research studies published by their authors. A few days after Imperial College released its dire projections about the deadliness of the virus, a team at Oxford University published a study that considered a scenario in which more than half of the population might already have been infected -- a theory that, if valid, would argue for a less draconian response.\n\nScientists, of course, often disagree and change their minds, based on new data. To some, that is yet another argument for lifting the veil on the advisory group.\n\n\"The idea that a small group of experts can never make a mistake or miss out on any information is never right,\" said Sarah Wollaston, a former chairwoman of the House of Commons Health Select Committee. \"But you can't challenge the advice if other experts can't see what they are looking at.\"\n\nSheri Fink contributed reporting from New York.

The impact has been felt in cities and suburbs, in large facilities and small, in poorly rated homes and in those with stellar marks.\n\nBut Covid-19 has been particularly virulent toward African-Americans and Latinos: Nursing homes where those groups make up a significant portion of the residents -- no matter their location, no matter their size, no matter their government rating -- have been twice as likely to get hit by the coronavirus as those where the population is overwhelmingly white.\n\nShare of nursing homes with at least one coronavirus case Only states that provided facility-level data and that have had outbreaks in at least 20 percent of nursing homes are shown.\n\nHomes that are at least 25% black and Latino\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\nMinn.\n\nMass.\n\nN.Y.\n\nMich.\n\nConn.\n\nN.J.\n\nNev.\n\nOhio\n\nMd.\n\nIll.\n\nColo.\n\nCalif.\n\nKy.\n\nN.M.\n\nS.C.\n\nGa.\n\nFla.\n\nLess than 5% black and Latino\n\nMinn.\n\nMass.\n\nMich.\n\nN.Y.\n\nConn.\n\nN.J.\n\nIll.\n\nOhio\n\nNev.\n\nMd.\n\nCalif.\n\nColo.\n\nKy.\n\nS.C.\n\nN.M.\n\nGa.\n\nFla.\n\nHomes that are at least 25% black and Latino\n\nLess than 5% black and Latino\n\nMinn.\n\nMinn.\n\nMass.\n\nMass.\n\nMich.\n\nN.Y.\n\nN.Y.\n\nMich.\n\nConn.\n\nConn.\n\nNev.\n\nN.J.\n\nN.J.\n\nOhio\n\nNev.\n\nOhio\n\nMd.\n\nColo.\n\nMd.\n\nIll.\n\nIll.\n\nCalif.\n\nColo.\n\nCalif.\n\nKy.\n\nKy.\n\nN.M.\n\nS.C.\n\nN.M.\n\nS.C.\n\n100%\n\nGa.\n\nGa.\n\n50%\n\nFla.\n\nFla.\n\nHomes that are at least 25% black and Latino\n\n100%\n\n50%\n\nMinn.\n\nMass.\n\nN.Y.\n\nMich.\n\nNev.\n\nOhio\n\nN.J.\n\nMd.\n\nIll.\n\nColo.\n\nCalif.\n\nKy.\n\nS.C.\n\nN.M.\n\nGa.\n\nFla.\n\nLess than 5% black and Latino\n\nMinn.\n\nN.Y.\n\nMich.\n\nMass.\n\nNev.\n\nN.J.\n\nOhio\n\nIll.\n\nColo.\n\nMd.\n\nCalif.\n\nKy.\n\nS.C.\n\nN.M.\n\nGa.\n\nFla.\n\nBy Robert Gebeloff and Jeremy White | Sources: New York Times database of coronavirus cases; Nursing Home Compare, medicare.gov; LTCFocus.org, Brown School of Public Health | Notes: States that did not have 10 or more homes in each category are excluded.

Some states did not provide full data for all nursing home facilities. Numbers do not always tally, because of rounding. Data is as of May 16, 2020.\n\nThe nation's nursing homes, like many of its schools, churches and neighborhoods, are largely segregated. And those that serve predominantly black and Latino residents tend to receive fewer stars on government ratings. Those facilities also tend to house more residents and to be located in urban areas, which are risk factors in the pandemic.\n\nYet the disparities in outbreaks among homes with more Latino and black residents have also unfolded in confusing ways that experts say are difficult to explain.\n\nThe race and ethnicity of the people living in a nursing home was a predictor of whether it was hit with Covid-19. But the Times analysis found that the federal government's five-star rating system, often used to judge the quality of a nursing home, was not a predictor. Even predominantly black and Latino nursing homes with high ratings were more likely to be affected by the coronavirus than were predominantly white nursing homes with low ratings, the data showed.\n\nTo better understand the disparities in Maryland, California and Illinois, The Times teamed up with The Baltimore Sun, KPCC/LAist and The Southern Illinoisan to interview dozens of current and former nursing home workers, residents and their relatives.\n\nEric Russell, who moved his mother to a different nursing home in the Chicago area after she tested positive for the virus, said the prevalence of cases in homes with more black residents was alarming, and needed to be more widely understood and examined by the authorities.\n\n\"Nobody gave a damn about the black people dying at a higher clip,\" Mr. Russell said. At his mother's former nursing home, Villa at Windsor Park on Chicago's South Side, where most residents are black, at least 121 residents and employees have been infected and 24 people have died.\n\nCompany officials said in a statement that they had proactively sought testing for Villa at Windsor Park residents and tried to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nThe coronavirus has been infecting and killing people of color at disproportionately high rates in the United States, data has shown. And officials in the nursing home industry say that the situations playing out inside homes largely reflect the circumstances unfolding outside their walls.\n\n\"Typically, what occurs in the general population is mirrored in long-term care facilities,\" said Dr. David Gifford, chief medical officer for the American Health Care Association, which represents the industry. Nursing homes within communities that have been hot spots for the virus are more likely to see outbreaks, he said, especially in large facilities with lots of employees coming in and out.\n\nSmall nursing homes, which are disproportionately occupied by white residents, tend to have fewer outbreaks than larger facilities, and urban nursing homes have more outbreaks than suburban or rural ones.\n\nShare of nursing homes hit, by facility size Larger facilities have been more likely to have outbreaks, but homes of all sizes with a higher share of black and Latino residents were more likely to have at least one coronavirus case.\n\n80\n\n% of nursing homes\n\nFacility size\n\n150+ beds\n\n70\n\n60\n\n100 to 149\n\nbeds\n\n50\n\n50 to 99\n\nbeds\n\n40\n\n30\n\n0 to 49 beds\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nHomes that are\n\nat least 25%\n\nblack and Latino\n\nHomes that are\n\nless than 5%\n\nblack and Latino\n\n80\n\n% of nursing homes\n\nFacility size\n\n70\n\n150+ beds\n\n60\n\n100 to 149\n\nbeds\n\n50\n\n50 to 99\n\nbeds\n\n40\n\n30\n\n0 to 49 beds\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nHomes that are\n\nat least 25%\n\nblack and Latino\n\nHomes that are\n\nless than 5%\n\nblack and Latino\n\nBy Guilbert Gates and Robert Gebeloff | Sources: New York Times database of coronavirus cases; Nursing Home Compare, medicare.gov; LTCFocus.org, Brown School of Public Health | Note: Data is as of May 16, 2020.\n\nBut the Times analysis found that a racial disparity remained even after accounting for a variety of factors, including the size of a nursing home, the infection rate in the surrounding county, the population density of the neighborhood and how many residents had Medicaid or Medicare.\n\nLarge homes with few black and Latino residents were less likely to have outbreaks than large ones with more black and Latino residents. A home in an urban area was less likely to get hit by the virus if it had a small black and Latino population.\n\nShare of nursing homes hit, by neighborhood type Homes in urban neighborhoods had a higher infection rate, but regardless of community type, facilities with a higher share of black and Latino residents were more likely to have at least one coronavirus case.\n\n80\n\n% of nursing homes\n\n70\n\nNeigborhood type\n\n60\n\nUrban\n\nInner-ring\n\nsuburbs\n\n50\n\nOuter-ring\n\n40\n\n30\n\nRural\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nHomes that are\n\nat least 25%\n\nblack and Latino\n\nHomes that are\n\nless than 5%\n\nblack and Latino\n\n80\n\n% of nursing homes\n\n70\n\nNeigborhood type\n\n60\n\nUrban\n\nInner-ring suburbs\n\n50\n\nOuter-ring\n\n40\n\n30\n\nRural\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\nHomes that are\n\nat least 25%\n\nblack and Latino\n\nHomes that are\n\nless than 5%\n\nblack and Latino\n\nBy Guilbert Gates and Robert Gebeloff | Sources: New York Times database of coronavirus cases; Nursing Home Compare, medicare.gov; LTCFocus.org, Brown School of Public Health | Note: Data is as of May 16, 2020.\n\nThe Times analysis, which covers the 22 hardest-hit states for which data is available and the District of Columbia, represents a snapshot in time, and the picture could change as the crisis wears on. Based on data collected as of May 16, the analysis could not determine whether there was a disparity in rates of illness or death for white residents and people of color within nursing homes because data was not available.\n\nAbout 1.3 million people live in the nation's nursing homes, according to federal data. About 80 percent of those residents are identified as white by nursing home administrators.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Modelers find that tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Scientists express cautious optimism about developing a vaccine quickly. See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nLong before the pandemic, there was disparity in homes. Those with more black and Latino residents tended to score worse than mostly white homes on quality metrics used by regulators. And they were more likely to have been punished for serious rule violations.\n\n\"I had roommates who pushed the call button because they needed help to go to the bathroom,\" said Armand Harris, who said he was discharged in February from Gateway Care and Rehabilitation Center in Hayward, Calif., after receiving care for cancer and kidney disease. \"After about a half-hour or 45 minutes, they would just go on themselves.\"\n\nThe situation at Gateway, which has had a diverse group of residents who are black, Latino, white and Asian, only grew worse once the pandemic hit, interviews with former residents, workers and relatives suggested. At least 100 residents and employees were infected, according to the California Department of Public Health, and 17 died, including some of Mr. Harris's friends.\n\n\"I got out in the nick of time,\" said Mr. Harris, who is of mixed racial background. The Alameda County District Attorney's Office said it was investigating deaths at Gateway and the safety and well-being of its residents.\n\nIn a statement, officials from Gateway said workers were doing all they could to keep residents safe and healthy. They said that there had been \"significant mischaracterizations and misrepresentations\" about their handling of the crisis, and that no one in the home currently had symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nNationally, at least 106,000 people have been sickened by the virus in more than 4,000 skilled nursing facilities, which do not include stand-alone assisted living centers, retirement communities and other long-term care facilities. Almost 19,000 people have died, and that is quite likely a significant undercount. All sorts of nursing homes, including those with mostly white residents, have been affected.\n\nOne-Third of All U.S. Coronavirus Deaths Are Nursing Home Residents or Workers\n\nIn at least 14 states, more than half of coronavirus deaths are tied to long-term care facilities for older adults, according to a New York Times database.\n\nIn Maryland, 80 percent of nursing homes with high black and Latino populations have been hit by the coronavirus, double the rate for homes with hardly any such residents.\n\nAt the FutureCare Lochearn nursing home, in Baltimore, 158 residents and 75 employees tested positive for the virus over a few weeks, and 20 people have died. Holly O'Shea, a spokeswoman for FutureCare, said the large number of infections reflected the widespread testing that the company sought out.\n\nAnita Kelly, whose father fell ill at FutureCare, said she was angry that testing had not come sooner, and said she wondered whether the fact that her father and most other FutureCare residents were black had played a role. Her father, Alexander F. Gaskins, a former interior decorator who tested positive for the virus, died on April 19.\n\n\"They wouldn't stand for it,\" Ms. Kelly said of how officials might react if the pandemic was disproportionately affecting white Americans. \"But it's killing us at a higher rate and we don't take it serious.\"\n\nIn some facilities that had coronavirus outbreaks, concerns about how residents were being cared for came well before the virus. Bria of Belleville, in southern Illinois, has been tied to at least 22 cases and two deaths. It is one of more than 300 nursing homes in the state where the virus has been detected. Bria, where many residents are black, has a one-star overall rating, the lowest available, from the federal government.\n\nJuanita Willis helped look after her uncle Ralph Wellmaker, who had lived at the home since last summer. Ms. Willis said she had raised concerns about sanitation and staffing at the home, and she described the care there as \"just horrible.\"\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nMs. Willis, a nurse at a St. Louis medical center, is still unsure whether her uncle had the virus. She last visited him in early March, shortly before visitors were told to stay away. In mid-April, she received a call from a hospital social worker asking about funeral arrangements for her uncle, learning for the first time that he had died two days earlier. His death certificate listed cardiac arrest as a cause of death, but records indicate he was not tested for the virus, according to the local coroner's office.\n\n\"It is very upsetting,\" Ms. Willis said. \"I think once they got the first case, they should have tested everyone in the facility.\"\n\nIn a statement, Bria officials defended the quality of care at the Belleville facility, noted the difficulty in securing coronavirus tests and said Mr. Wellmaker lived in a part of the center separated from people known to have had the virus.\n\n\"Bria of Belleville took early and aggressive steps to protect the health and safety of its residents and staff,\" the facility's administrator, Stephanie Birch, said in a statement.\n\nAlong with residents of nursing homes, thousands of nurses and aides have been sickened by the virus in an industry where African-Americans make up an outsize share of the work force.\n\nDozens of nursing home workers interviewed across the country described short-staffed, disorganized facilities that sometimes lacked adequate protective gear amid the pandemic. Workers fell ill, alongside their patients.\n\nIn Baltimore County, at the Forest Haven Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, where many residents are black, workers said they were given rain ponchos and nylon hair bonnets in early April, after Maryland required all nursing homes to provide the staff with protective equipment.\n\nThey have since received proper supplies, including face shields, masks and gowns. But at least 97 people, including 27 workers, have contracted the virus and eight residents have died.\n\nRon Colbert, the facility's administrator, said the home was restricting visitor access, screening anyone who entered for symptoms, and following federal guidelines for personal protective equipment and patient isolation. Asked in an email about the ponchos and hair bonnets, Mr. Colbert did not respond.\n\nDonna Johnson, a cook at Forest Haven who says she was given a mask for protection, said she came down with a 102-degree fever in April and tested positive for the virus. She said she worried that the virus made its way in because some staff members were working in multiple facilities.\n\nShe said her strongest concern was for the residents.\n\n\"It's so unfair to them,\" Ms. Johnson said. \"They contracted this through no fault of their own.\"\n\nIn East Los Angeles, at the Buena Ventura Post Acute Care Center, a five-star facility where many residents are Latino, Alma Lara-Garcia, a certified nursing assistant, said workers were not given masks until April, well into the outbreak in the United States.\n\nMs. Lara-Garcia said administrators told her that they were going to order medical-grade eye protection, but that suppliers were out. Instead, she said, she was given orange plastic swimming goggles. The goggles did not fit under her glasses, so she did not wear them.\n\nNot long after, she said, she started to feel sick. She said she was told to come into work anyway. Days later, she said, she was sent home when she complained of a sore throat and uncontrollable coughing, and she eventually tested positive for the virus at a county-run testing site.\n\nTiana Thompson, Buena Ventura's administrator, said that the facility had worked to secure protective gear for workers and that Ms. Lara-Garcia had not been asked to work while sick.\n\n\"At no time has Buena Ventura Post Acute Care Center asked any employee who reported experiencing Covid-related symptoms to report to work,\" Ms. Thompson said in an email.\n\nAt least 83 residents and employees have contracted the virus, and at least a dozen of them have died.\n\nSheelagh McNeill contributed research.\n\nHOW THE NUMBERS WERE CALCULATED\n\nIn examining racial disparity in coronavirus infections at nursing homes, The New York Times gathered data on infection reports from state and local health agencies and joined the information to databases of information about facilities, including the federal government's Nursing Home Compare data and Brown University's Long Term Care Focus data.\n\nWhile the analysis could not fully explain why some homes have seen outbreaks and others have not reported any infections, it did identify variables that increased the likelihood of a home reporting a problem, and found that the racial disparities persisted even after accounting for these variables.\n\nThere is no official published data on the race of nursing home patients by home. The Times obtained Medicare claims data and supplemented it with the Brown University data, which incorporates information from Medicaid and Medicare claims.\n\nThe analysis bypassed states that have published limited information, focusing on the District of Columbia and 22 states where at least 20 percent of facilities reported at least one coronavirus case.",

He died after 17 days in intensive care, never improving enough to tell us whether the extended life support he was getting was actually acceptable to him, let alone to say goodbye to his family.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation study reported that only 56 percent of adult Americans have had a serious conversation about health care preferences, 27 percent wrote down their preferences, and just one in 10 discussed them with a health care provider.\n\nMany families are surprised to discover that a standard living will doesn't provide specific guidance on the numerous decisions that must be made when a person is critically ill and may require life support.\n\nThe most powerful thing that patients and families can do to take control of their health care is the simple act of thinking through what is most important if they become seriously ill and identifying a person they trust to speak for them if they can't speak for themselves.\n\nNow that we're living through a pandemic, having this conversation has become especially urgent, when mild flulike symptoms can turn into life-threatening respiratory failure within hours.\n\nBefore Covid-19, we often had the luxury of time to talk about a patient's values and priorities. Family, pets, being at home, independence and faith were at the top of almost everybody's lists.\n\nSome people say it's most important to live as long as possible. Others feel most strongly about quality of life. They worry about suffering for no purpose, becoming burdensome, or surviving in an unacceptable condition.\n\nWith Covid-19, the window for having these conversations often closes before anyone realizes it was open. Hospitalized patients can't receive visitors and are often too ill to communicate by phone. Once on a ventilator, most can't communicate at all.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The U.S. will reconsider its W.H.O. membership, president says. Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine, an unproven drug against the virus. Steven Mnuchin and Jerome Powell will face the Senate over emergency lending programs. See more updates Updated 26m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nMany families thrown into emergency decision-making often default to intensive care as the \"safest\" route, not realizing the risks and burdens of this choice.\n\nI see many families place their hopes on a ventilator keeping their loved one alive. Ventilators can be lifesaving. But they also come with risks. Because of limited and fast-changing data, the risk of dying from Covid-19 once on a ventilator is a moving target. So far, published data from the United States suggest about half of patients on ventilators did not survive their illness, and survival odds decreased with age and existing chronic health conditions. Most who survive require weeks to months in a skilled nursing facility. Recovering patients may struggle with memory loss, post-traumatic stress disorder, and routine activities like walking and eating. Many will never return to their prior quality of life.\n\nKnowing how unpredictably Covid behaves, I urge you to assign someone as your backup decision maker. Talk to that person now about what matters most if you become seriously ill, and what is essential for an acceptable quality of life.\n\nCall it \"The Talk.\" The conversation may feel awkward at first. There's no one-size-fits-all answer. But know that having \"The Talk\" means if difficult decisions must be made on your behalf, they will reflect your wishes.\n\nThe goal of \"The Talk\" is to be specific about what matters most, because \"quality of life\" means something different to every person.\n\nAn 87-year-old man with lung disease said the only reasonable outcome was if he could continue living independently on his two acres and chop his own firewood.\n\nA 36-year-old mother with cancer said as long as she could feel her children's little bodies against her, that life was worth living.\n\nAfter our first cluster of Covid cases in early March, I called my mother, a retired hospice social worker in California. She had always been clear about her wishes, but checking in seemed like a good idea.\n\nWe chatted about where she was buying groceries, how her friends were doing, and what TV shows she was watching.\n\n\"Well,\" I finally said, \"What are you thinking about Covid-19?\"\n\n\"I've been worrying,\" she said. \"I've never wanted a ventilator, but maybe it would help me if I get Covid-19.\"\n\n\"This is hard,\" I said. \"What's most important to you if you get really sick?\"\n\nShe spoke about family, independence, living at home rather than in a facility, and avoidance of pain. She worried most about what her life might be like if she survived after prolonged life support.\n\nWe talked honestly about ventilators and Covid-19. She decided that her prior wishes were unchanged.\n\n\"I feel better about this now,\" she said.\n\nI did too.\n\nTips on Having 'The Talk'\n\n\"The Talk\" can feel awkward. Here are some tips to help you or your family member think through what you or they would want:\n\nWho is your backup decision maker? If you have not assigned a \"durable power of attorney for health care,\" it falls to your legal next of kin. In the state of Washington, for example, your legal next of kin is your spouse or state registered domestic partner, then children who are at least 18 years of age, then parents, and then siblings. In most states, the health care proxy document needs to be notarized or witnessed by two people unrelated to you.\n\nHave you completed a living will? Does it reflect your wishes? Who has a copy?\n\nTalk with your backup decision maker about your wishes. Share with them what is most important to you, for example: being at home, being with family, living as long as possible, being able to say goodbye. Honoring Choices Pacific Northwest and the Conversation Project offer helpful guides to get started with these conversations and to document them.\n\nLaura Schellenberg Johnson is a palliative care and internal medicine physician practicing at EvergreenHealth in Kirkland, Wash.",

        "body": "An I.C.U. doctor felt despair at how little could be done for the sick. Soon, she had musicians playing over the phone in hospital rooms.\n\nIn chaotic emergency rooms and intensive care units around New York City, coronavirus patients struggle to survive in isolation, with masked doctors and nurses keeping their distance and family visits barred. Alarms, monitors and overhead announcements blare incessantly.\n\nBut at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital in Manhattan, the music of Bach, Brahms and even the Beatles has begun wafting through patient rooms, played by accomplished performers -- recently out-of-work chamber music players; winners of international competitions and prizes; teachers at prestigious music schools.\n\nThey perform from California, Kentucky, Maine, Virginia, Massachusetts and New York, where they are sheltered in place. The music plays through an iPhone or iPad placed at the bedside of patients who indicated they wanted to hear a performance, using FaceTime's audio-only feature to protect their privacy.\n\n\"I'm hoping to offer a brief moment of comfort or distraction or beauty,\" said Michelle Ross, a violinist in Manhattan who has performed for the patients.\n\nAt the Allen Hospital, which is at the northern tip of Manhattan and serves a community that is largely low income and minority, the toll of coronavirus cases has been particularly devastating. Last week, a top emergency room physician at Allen died by suicide, putting a spotlight on the struggles at the small hospital.\n\nAt times, the 200-bed hospital has had as many as 170 coronavirus patients; by early April, there were 59 patient deaths, The New York Times has reported.\n\nIt was around that time that the concert idea blossomed. Dr. Rachel Easterwood, who works the night shift in the I.C.U., had despaired at how little could be done for some patients. \"I just felt desperate actually, and helpless,\" she said. \"People are dying left and right.\"\n\nOne evening off, she listened to a cellist friend in California play Bach for her over FaceTime. Dr. Easterwood, 35, who played clarinet professionally before going to medical school, found the music comforting.\n\n\"Man, I wish we could do that in the hospital,\" she told her friend, as he recalled the conversation. At that moment, the idea about playing for patients clicked.\n\nThe cellist, Andrew Janss, and another friend, Molly Carr, a violist, began recruiting other musicians.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Schools across N.Y. State will stay closed through the end of the school year, Cuomo says. New Jersey is now reporting more virus deaths per day than New York. Macy's unveils plans to reopen stores with masks, hand sanitizer and plexiglass barriers. See more updates Updated 32h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nSome of the patients were on regular floors, awake and able to communicate. Others, in I.C.U. beds, were on ventilators and heavily sedated.\n\nIn those cases, Dr. Easterwood said, she called families to obtain permission for a performance to be played. She hoped even those patients might be comforted in some way.\n\nShe soon expanded the concerts to harried staff members who were being challenged like never before, exposing themselves to health risks, living apart from families and sharing the sadness of patient deaths. On one shift, workers gathered at a nursing station near midnight to hear Mr. Janss play a cello solo.\n\n\"We clapped for him and we asked for one more song,\" said Anna Kosmider, a physician assistant. \"It's hard to find those moments of happiness at work.\"\n\nDr. Easterwood also found solace in Mr. Janss's performance. \"It was comforting to me,\" she said, \"because I, as a doctor, was hurting.\"\n\nLast Monday, hours after news of the death of their physician-colleague, a short concert was arranged for members of the Allen emergency room staff. More than a dozen employees crowded in a break room to hear Mr. Janss play selections from Bach, Edith Piaf, Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Elton John. The performance was subdued and somber.\n\nDr. Easterwood, a 2006 graduate of the Manhattan School of Music, obtained her medical degree in 2014 at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons. She completed a residency in internal medicine and became an attending physician at Allen last year.\n\nShe said she always assumed music would be a part of her life -- she keeps her clarinet -- but there was little time to play as she began her medical career.\n\n\"I mean, music takes an enormous amount of dedication, but medicine takes way more,\" she said.\n\nIn April, she was working night shifts covering the intensive care unit at Allen.\n\n\"That's the most difficult of all the shifts,\" said her supervisor, Dr. Zorica Stojanovic, medical director for Allen's hospitalist physicians, \"because everyone is most of the time walking the fine line between life and death.\"\n\nOn April 2, Dr. Easterwood had her serendipitous conversation with Mr. Janss.\n\nThe concert idea was a natural for him and Ms. Carr, the violist, who together recruited the musicians. They co-direct Project: Music Heals Us, a nonprofit Ms. Carr founded that organizes free classical concerts in nursing homes, hospices, prisons, homeless shelters and refugee centers.\n\nThe pandemic had brought its work to a halt, and its stable of freelance musicians also were having performances canceled. (To support the musicians, the group said it had decided to pay them $100 apiece for any three-hour period they are on call to perform the coronavirus concerts.)\n\nDr. Easterwood emailed her supervisor, Dr. Stojanovic, seeking her approval.\n\nDr. Stojanovic did not hesitate, saying in an interview that the idea was a wonderful one given the calamitous times. \"What can disrupt this pattern of despair is the music,\" she said.\n\nOn April 7, Mr. Janss, in his apartment in Oakland, Calif., played the first concert -- a 15-minute cello set that began with Bach.\n\nLater that day, a trio in Kentucky played for 75 minutes for another patient. The musicians included Ms. Carr, who teaches at the Juilliard School and Bard College; her husband, the cellist Oded Hadar; and Anna Petrova, who teaches piano at the University of Louisville. (All three were quarantined at Ms. Petrova's home while Mr. Hadar recovered from coronavirus symptoms.)\n\nMs. Petrova also played Chopin briefly for another patient who responded over the phone, \"'I love music. Thank you. You made my day,'\" Ms. Carr recalled.\n\nPerformances followed on nights when Dr. Easterwood could find time. For the musicians, who typically feed off live audience reaction, playing on the phone for heavily sedated patients on ventilators amid the sounds of beeping monitors could be surreal.\n\n\"You're playing basically into a void,\" Mr. Janss said.\n\nThe musicians have drawn from their own playlists that include Schubert, Schumann, Beethoven and Rachmaninoff, as well as George Gershwin and Andrew Lloyd Webber. They have played \"All My Loving\" and \"Something\" by the Beatles, and a viola-and-cello arrangement of \"Over the Rainbow.\"\n\nMiki-Sophia Cloud, a violinist in Boston, said she played Bach for a patient who wanted to hear something relaxing. She could hear the patient coughing, and she took out her viola, which has a lower range of notes.\n\n\"I just played the low strings in a very calming, steady, slow rhythm for about 30 minutes,\" she said.\n\nPerhaps no composer's work has been played more often for the coronavirus patients than Bach, Dr. Easterwood said, describing his music as soothing, uplifting and \"kind of a melancholy that people appreciate.\"\n\nSome of the musicians said they found playing for the patients deeply emotional, and they have cried while performing.\n\nThe music has also stirred emotion in patients.\n\nDr. Easterwood said she left her phone by one older patient's bedside, and returned after the performance to find the patient smiling.\n\n\"I realized I had never seen a patient smile this entire time,\" she said.\n\nBy April 16, about a dozen concerts had been held for patients and staff members, Dr. Easterwood said. But that day, she began to feel ill, experiencing virus symptoms. She was tested, and went home. The test came back negative.\n\nUntil she could return to work, two other physicians -- Ricky Regalbuto at Allen and Mike Robbins, an emergency department doctor at Columbia University Irving Medical Center -- volunteered to arrange performances at each hospital.\n\nDr. Robbins said one patient's face just \"lit up\" when he offered a concert. Minutes into the performance, though, the music was ended when the patient had to be intubated, he recalled.\n\nThe patient's \"last minutes of consciousness were embraced with beautiful music,\" Dr. Robbins texted the musicians later.\n\nLast Monday, Dr. Easterwood returned to the night shift at Allen, where she arranged two 45-minute concerts for patients on ventilators, each by the pianist Henrique Eisenmann in Brooklyn. Dr. Easterwood said this week that she hoped to continue the performances for patients and the staff.\n\n\"We go into this profession to help people,\" she said. \"And this music had the ability to at least help a little bit.\"\n\nJoseph Goldstein contributed reporting.",

        "body": "Some people who have survived the coronavirus describe being shunned by relatives and friends, rather than being celebrated.\n\nOn the day Elizabeth Martucci and her 11-year-old son were deemed to have recovered from the coronavirus, they emerged from their home on the Jersey Shore with some sidewalk chalk to sketch a message in the driveway.\n\n\"We are Covid survivors,\" they wrote.\n\n\"I thought I'm going to tell everybody, 'I had this, and I'm OK,' just to show people it's not a death sentence,\" Ms. Martucci said.\n\nShe also bought T-shirts that said \"Covid Survivor,\" anticipating that some of the neighbors on her cul-de-sac in Cape May Court House might have some lingering discomfort.\n\nMs. Martucci soon learned that she had drastically underestimated the anxiety she and her son, Marcus, would encounter. Even now, a month into their recovery, some neighbors see them and run.\n\nAs those who have been stricken with the virus emerge from hospitals or home quarantine, they are being forced to navigate a world that clearly is not yet ready to welcome them back into a still-sheltering society.\n\nThere are still many unanswered questions about the efficacy and duration of any post-virus immunity, and the uncertainty has caused some people who have survived the illness to confront a fear-driven stigma from the outside world.\n\nThe veterinarian who refused to treat a recovered woman's dog. The laundromat worker who jumped at seeing an elected official whose illness had been reported on the local news. The gardener who would not trim the hedges outside a recovered man's home. The neighbor who dropped off soup, and said not to bother returning the Tupperware it was in. And the sick teenager whose solace during his long illness was the thought of fishing with friends, only to have them ghost him when he recovered.\n\n\"My gut thought was not, 'Oh, people will now be afraid of me because I had this virus,'\" said Ms. Martucci, 41, who described a neighbor tripping over a curb while running for her door when she and her son, who goes by M.J., approached on their bicycles.\n\n\"It didn't even occur to me -- being shunned,\" said Ms. Martucci, a real estate investor. \"You're looked at as a contagion, versus as a survivor.\"\n\nShe said she had put the \"Covid Survivor\" T-shirts away.\n\nFeeling stigmatized is not what many survivors said they expected after their tough bouts of illness. It carries a particular sting given the worldwide discussions about how reopening society will hinge in part on people with antibodies being able to return to work, and about how those who have recovered can donate convalescent plasma for experimental treatments of those who are still sick.\n\n\"There is a dichotomy between feeling like you can go give your plasma to save other people's lives, but feeling like you're an untouchable,\" said Sheryl Kraft, a health journalist in Fairfield, Conn., who has written about surviving Covid-19, and how it affected her physical and mental health.\n\n\"We're like the chosen ones,\" she added. \"We can go back into society, we can donate plasma, we are very valuable. But to people who are afraid of catching it, we are like pariahs.\"\n\nMark D. Levine, a New York City Council member who leads the health committee, experienced virus symptoms in late March. He quarantined at home until he recovered from the illness, which was covered by the news media.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Some N.Y. hospitals will allow visits to resume under a pilot program.

See more updates Updated 8h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nWeeks after he had recovered, Mr. Levine, who represents Upper Manhattan, said he was stunned when a worker at his local laundromat jumped at the sight of him.\n\n\"There are people who really think if you got it you essentially have magical armor and can never get sick again -- that's dangerous -- but clearly, there are people who do not understand you're no longer contagious if you've recovered,\" he said. \"It feels like we've failed on education on both sides of that.\"\n\nOn Long Island, Flora Touloupis, 60, experienced both kindness and caution from a neighbor. After a brutal case of the virus that left her with bilateral pneumonia and blood clots in her legs, Ms. Touloupis said she was warmed by the homemade chicken soup a neighbor in Lindenhurst dropped off after she had tested negative.\n\nBut when she texted about returning the soup container, Ms. Touloupis said her neighbor told her to throw it away. So did her sister-in-law, who dropped off some lentils in a dish that she left outside on Ms. Touloupis's porch.\n\n\"I said, 'Oh my God, I feel like a leper!'\" Ms. Touloupis said. \"I am hoping that the people who normally eat at my house for Christmas will show up this year. It almost makes you feel ashamed.\"\n\nDuring the 21 days he was stuck isolating in his bedroom in Lakeland, Fla., William Long, 17, said the one thing that kept his spirits up was the idea of going fishing with his friends once he was better.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nWhat should I do with my 401(k)?\n\nWatching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions -- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that \"free money.\"\n\n\"It was my No. 1 thought,\" he said. \"'I can't wait to get back and get healthy and hang out with all of my friends.'\"\n\nBut even two weeks after he had recovered, he said his friends had not returned his text messages. The loneliness and feeling of being ostracized, William said, had prompted him to enroll in mental health counseling and to seek new friends.\n\n\"I was three weeks in isolation, and then to see nobody?\" he said. \"It's really heartbreaking.\"\n\nWilliam and other survivors said they understood the anxiety. They know that there are instances of virus patients becoming infected a second time, and that the disease is so new there has not been enough time to study how long, or even if, any immunity lasts.\n\n\"People need to be afraid of this virus, because you do want to keep the numbers down,\" Ms. Touloupis said. \"But it's still hurtful.\"\n\nSamantha Hoffenberg, who lives in Manhattan, said she understood why her family had stayed away from her for nearly two months after she had recovered: Her father died of the virus in April after contracting it at the hospital where he was admitted because of complications from dementia. She said the ordeal had been deeply traumatic.\n\nAfter she became infected, she was committed to staying far away from her loved ones, even after she recovered.\n\nThen on April 23, there was a fire in her building. After being hospitalized for smoke inhalation, she had a series of panic attacks. A social worker at the hospital called Ms. Hoffenberg's family to tell them she was virus-free and wanted to see them.\n\nThey refused.\n\n\"I have never been in such a sad dark place after that happened,\" Ms. Hoffenberg, a hiring recruiter, said. \"And my own family is that scared of me that they are not even able to see through the fact that I am alone through this.\"\n\nStill, even as she craved a hug, she said she had empathy for people who were scarred by the virus and as well as their loss.\n\n\"They're petrified,\" she said.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nSince the coronavirus outbreak began, dozens of workers from the three major airports in the New York City area have been infected, and at least 17 have died, union officials said.\n\nThose still on the job are afraid they could be next.\n\nMost of the workers earn less than $20 an hour and do not have health insurance, because the cost of the coverage was more than they could afford on their salaries, they say.\n\nFour of those who died worked for LSG Sky Chefs, a large catering operation at Kennedy International Airport, and two worked for United Catering at Newark Liberty International, their union said. The others had a range of duties, from pushing travelers in wheelchairs to restocking airplane galleys. It's not clear if they contracted the virus on the job.\n\nBut workers who got sick said they had been worried about their working conditions.\n\nManuel Fernandez, 64, who works at Kennedy, had given little thought to medical bills while he struggled to survive at Columbia University Irving Medical Center in Manhattan.\n\n\"I was basically saying goodbye to the world,\" he said.\n\nMr. Fernandez, who was released from the hospital on Wednesday, works for LSG Sky Chefs in a building at Kennedy that receives serving carts from airplanes and cleans and restocks them.\n\n\"We were all worried about the conditions because we work very close together,\" Mr. Fernandez said.\n\nHis employer, he said, did not tell him if co-workers were sick and only provided a mask when he demanded one.\n\n\"They should have closed that kitchen,\" he said, though he added that he is not certain he was infected at work.\n\nCompanies and government agencies said they have taken major steps to safeguard their workers, including providing protective gear and conducting deep cleanings.\n\n\"We have developed and implemented comprehensive safety measures throughout all our facilities to safeguard our employees against health risks,\" LSG Sky Chefs said in a statement. The plan includes social distancing, providing masks for employees who do not bring their own, health surveys and \"enhanced disinfecting protocols,\" it said.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Deaths keep falling in N.Y. and N.J. as reopening plans take shape. New York's Democratic presidential primary was canceled. For weary N.Y.C. ambulance crews, the crisis drags on. See more updates Updated 6h ago More live coverage: Global Markets\n\nThe company, which caters to airlines around the country, said it had placed employees on temporary leaves of absence because demand for in-flight meals had fallen 94 percent.\n\nUnited Catering at Newmark Liberty has reduced its work force at the airport by about 85 percent and has taken several steps to protect the remaining 100 workers, said Charles Hobart, a spokesman for United Airlines.\n\nThose precautions included providing masks, gloves and hand sanitizer and taking workers' temperatures before they enter the building.\n\nThe Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the three big airports that serve New York City, said it had distributed masks to employees and had increased the frequency of cleaning of airport terminals.\n\nThough airports have stayed open, air travel has dropped to a fraction of normal levels. The Transportation Security Administration has been screening about 100,000 passengers daily across the country, down from more than 2 million before the pandemic.\n\nThousands of airport workers have been laid off, but airlines, contractors and concessionaires have maintained small corps of employees.\n\nTwo major unions that represent more than 20,000 workers at the three airports said their lists of member who have died of the virus are not comprehensive because they are counting only confirmed cases.\n\nLocal 32BJ of the Service Employees International said seven members had died, while Unite Here said at least 40 of its members had tested positive for the coronavirus and at least 10 had died.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration said 167 of its screening officers at the three airports had tested positive for the virus and one of them who worked at Newark Liberty died of Covid-19.\n\nDonna Hampton, 60, a security officer in Terminal 7 at Kennedy, said she bought her own masks until last week, when her employer, a contractor to the terminal operator, provided her with reusable masks.\n\n\"It's fear of the unknown, and the fear for me is real,\" Ms. Hampton said.\n\nFor several years, Unite Here and Local 32BJ organized protests at meetings of the Port Authority's board of commissioners until the agency agreed to raise their minimum wage to $19 an hour, among the highest in the country.\n\nNow the unions are pushing legislation in Albany that would provide a supplement to the base wages to make health care affordable.\n\nJuan C. Morales, who stocks a Starbucks and a Shake Shack at La Guardia Airport, said he, too, was worried -- especially because he is diabetic.\n\n\"It's scary to go to work every morning,\" he said.\n\nMr. Morales, 46, lives in Manhattan with his wife and five children. He said he could not afford health insurance on his hourly wage of $17.60 and worried about bringing the virus home.\n\n\"My wife is very paranoid,\" he said. \"She's scared. But I've got to provide.\"\n\nLorenzo W. Pincay, a Sky Chefs workers who died after testing positive for the coronavirus, had worked for the company at Kennedy for nearly six years, earning less than $16 an hour, said his son Luis.\n\nAfter a short vacation, Mr. Pincay returned to work on March 23. On his second day back, he started to feel ill, his son said.\n\nEventually, when Mr. Pincay started having trouble breathing, his family took him to Long Island Jewish Medical Center.\n\n\"It was like taking a pet to the shelter,\" Luis said. \"We just park in the parking lot, and we never see him again.\"\n\nDoctors there quickly put Mr. Pincay into an induced coma, Luis said. The next day his father's coronavirus test came back positive, he said.\n\nReports from the hospital gave Luis and his younger sister, Monica, hope that their father would recover. But on April 9, a doctor told Luis that the family should prepare for a FaceTime call to say their last goodbyes.\n\nTwo days later, Mr. Pincay was declared dead, Luis said. Flying his body home to his native Ecuador, as the family had hoped to do, was not possible.\n\nThe only alternative was a cremation, Luis said, but the soonest he could schedule one was April 30. He did not expect to be able to collect his father's ashes until May 10, nearly a month after his death.\n\nLuis said representatives of Sky Chefs had tried to contact him, but he had not been in the mood to talk to them.\n\n\"I'm not blaming the company,\" Luis said, but he added that he thought it could have done more to protect employees.\n\nAnother Sky Chefs employee, Juan Leon, 58, said he and two family members tested positive for the coronavirus. Then Mr. Leon's 78-year-old mother, Maria Marta Abando, who lived with him in the Corona neighborhood of Queens, started showing Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nHer daughter took her to a nearby hospital, where she died, Mr. Leon said.\n\nHe has not returned to work since he first reported his illness. \"I know the virus is in that kitchen,\" he said.",

        "body": "As the famed Copper River salmon season begins, isolated fishing towns are bracing for an influx of workers and their first brush with the coronavirus.\n\nThe people of Cordova, Alaska, had weathered the coronavirus pandemic with no cases and the comfort of isolation -- a coastal town unreachable by road in a state with some of the fewest infections per capita in the country.\n\nBut that seclusion has come to an abrupt end. Over the past two weeks, fishing boat crews from Seattle and elsewhere have started arriving by the hundreds, positioning for the start of Alaska's summer seafood rush.\n\nThe fishing frenzy begins on Thursday with the season opening for the famed Copper River salmon, whose prized fillets can fetch up to $75 a pound at the market. Before the pandemic, Cordova's Copper River catch was flown fresh for swift delivery to some of the country's highest-end restaurants.\n\nBut the town of about 2,000 people has been consumed in recent weeks by debates over whether to even allow a fishing season and how to handle an influx of fishing crews that usually doubles its population.\n\nThe conditions are ideal for propagation of the coronavirus: Most of the imported crews work in the close quarters of fishing boats or sleep in crowded bunkhouses next to processing facilities. Cordova's tiny hospital, which typically has no ventilators, could be quickly overwhelmed.\n\n\"My worry is they are hoping for the best without having planned for the worst,\" said Sylvia Lange, who grew up in the fishing industry and now runs a popular restaurant and hotel in Cordova, on the shores of Alaska's magnificent Prince William Sound.\n\nThe threat of a disrupted fishing season comes as Alaska deals with a series of crippling blows to its economy.\n\nThe state's leading industry, oil and gas, has suffered from plummeting oil prices and subsequent layoffs. The upcoming tourism season appears in peril, with cruise ships already canceling their sailings.\n\nNow, the state's $5 billion seafood industry is at risk. Conditions at fish processing centers are often as crowded as those at the meat processing plants in the rest of the country that have proved to be magnets for coronavirus infection. And the workers there and on fishing boats typically fly in from all over the country, sometimes from all over the world.\n\nIn Cordova, the community has been polarized. On the one hand, fishing is its lifeblood. On the other, how many cases of the coronavirus can so small a town afford?\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Data is expected to show millions more unemployment claims; experts warn of a long struggle ahead. Wisconsin governor urges residents to adhere to a stay-at-home order after a court strikes it down. In a display of armed defiance, some shops in Texas turn to militia-style protesters for support. See more updates Updated 17m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nMayor Clay Koplin tried last week to reassure the community: While the fishing season would proceed, he said in a radio briefing, the city was ready with a variety of strategies to quarantine newcomers, maintain social distancing and contain any cases that emerged.\n\nHe did not anticipate that the first case would arrive so soon -- just two days later.\n\n\"It's pretty discouraging,\" Mr. Koplin said.\n\nHealth officials have rushed to contain that first case, a fish processing facility worker who had recently flown up from Seattle. They have traced and tested all who were in contact with that person and now believe the case is contained.\n\nBut with more than 50 crew members and other workers arriving each day, more infections may be coming.\n\nWith that in mind, the city has embarked on an all-stops-out effort to test, trace and isolate each and every case. Tests have been stockpiled to check anyone who develops symptoms. People found to have infections will be quarantined or removed from the city, and their contacts tracked down and tested.\n\nIt is essentially the strategy advocated by public health officials for communities across the country, once they bring their coronavirus outbreaks under control. Cordova provides a unique opportunity to see how effective such a protocol may be, using a community with very few cases, but a substantial continuing threat.\n\n\"Nobody ever wants to be an experiment,\" said Dr. Hannah Sanders, medical director of the Cordova Community Medical Center. \"But, in some ways it is.\"\n\nTalk of a canceled season\n\nAlaska has its own history of devastating impacts from disease, including the influenza pandemic of 1918 that led to widespread deaths, especially among Alaska Natives. In some native communities, such as Nome and Wales, more than half of the residents died.\n\nMs. Lange, the hotel proprietor, said she and other Alaska Natives have talked a lot in recent days about the 1918 outbreak and the risks of another pandemic. She said that while fishing was at the core of her family and community, she also had concerns about the ability of the city and the industry to hold back an outbreak as virulent as the coronavirus.\n\n\"It's not easy to be critical of an industry we all love and are dependent on,\" Ms. Lange said. \"People have said they'll never set foot again in our business.\"\n\nThe discussion is happening in fishing towns all over Alaska, including Dillingham, the center of the salmon fishing fleet in Bristol Bay.\n\nHospital leaders at the Bristol Bay Area Health Corporation have requested that the fishing season remain closed, arguing that the arrival of thousands of people from around the world puts the community at risk. So far, the request has gone unheeded. The fishing season there is set to commence in June.\n\nIn Cordova, Mark Roye was one of the people who argued for a Copper River fishing season with only locals to avoid the risk of importing coronavirus cases from outsiders. He said that while the season would be prolonged, the proceeds could be divided among all of the fishery's stakeholders, even those who could not participate.\n\nThat idea ultimately was rejected. Now Mr. Roye has taken his sailboat, stocked it with months of supplies and sailed 20 miles outside town, settling in for some long-term isolation on his boat. He said that he while the town had done a lot to prepare, he worried that it would not be enough.\n\n\"If anything goes wrong,\" Mr. Roye said, \"the threat to the rest of the salmon fishery around the state is going to be enormous.\"\n\nFlying a quarantine flag\n\nCordova's strategy for keeping the virus at bay involves several strict protocols.\n\nWorkers arriving in town must be quarantined for 14 days -- either in a facility or on a ship, with a yellow-and-black quarantine flag raised. They cannot go inside grocery stores. They have to have their temperatures taken twice a day and report any symptoms. Hand-washing facilities are available around the docks.\n\nPeople in town must wear masks and are required to follow social distancing rules.\n\nMr. Koplin, the mayor, said he had been pleased with the level of compliance among the newly arriving fishing crews.\n\nThe first coronavirus case surfaced not with someone on a fishing boat but among the large group of workers who process the fish that are not sold fresh.\n\nThe company involved, Ocean Beauty Seafoods, said the employee tested negative in Seattle but then tested positive after arriving in Cordova. It is unclear where the person got infected, Mr. Koplin said, but testing of all of the people the worker was in contact with in the area has not identified anyone else with the illness.\n\nRich Wheeler, who runs a neighboring processing facility, 60\u00b0 North Seafoods, said he had told his workers that they must remain on the campus for the entirety of their working time in Alaska and would be fired if they leave.\n\nThe scene in Cordova is much different than other years, with a slower pace and fewer people ahead of what is normally an energetic opening day for the Copper River season. Mr. Wheeler said companies did not want to be \"part of the problem,\" and would also face their own serious challenges if the virus were to start spreading in one of their plants.\n\n\"It would be pretty catastrophic,\" he said.",

I had always been interested in emergency medicine and was an emergency medical technician in college, so I got recertified and was hired by Empress Emergency Medical Service in a suburb of New York City last September.\n\nI remember reading briefly about the coronavirus earlier this year but not thinking much of it -- until the second documented case in New York State was announced in early March, in Empress's coverage area, New Rochelle.\n\nAs cases multiplied, and our work became riskier and more intense, I felt an obligation to document. Over the course of three weeks in April, I photographed my colleagues as we worked to do our part to combat the pandemic that has frozen our country.\n\nEmpress's E.M.T.s and paramedics work shifts that can range from eight to 24 hours. Last month Empress responded to about 350 cardiac arrest calls, many of them the result of complications stemming from Covid-19.

Often, I don't know if the patients I brought to the hospital lived or died.\n\nMany of us are also struggling with isolation from friends and family. My colleague, Austin Magnuson, 25, a paramedic from Dallas, has been sleeping in the basement of his home for the past month because he is worried that he might infect his partner and roommates.\n\nI haven't seen my partner, Maya, or my dog, Bear, since March 14. We decided it was best for Maya to stay upstate because her father suffers from a respiratory illness. We were scared that I could pass the virus to her, which in turn could infect her dad.

        "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed that detention facilities are hot spots for infection and recommended regular symptom screenings.\n\nJails and prisons are among the most challenging places to control the outbreak of the coronavirus. Similar to cruise ships and nursing homes, detention facilities have crowded living spaces and shared dining areas, as well as communal bathrooms and a lack of space to isolate infected detainees, all of which makes physical distancing practices difficult to achieve.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study of the spread of the coronavirus in prisons and detention centers in the United States, both public and private. Although it did not have complete figures for the approximately 2.1 million people incarcerated nationally, the study found that nearly 5,000 prisoners had contracted the virus along with over 2,000 staff members, resulting in 103 deaths, combined.\n\n\"This analysis provides the first documentation of the number of reported laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 in correctional and detention facilities in the United States,\" the report said.\n\nAmong the findings, the report found that slightly more than half of the affected facilities (53 percent) had at least one case among staff members and not detainees. Staff members move regularly between facilities and outside communities, which could be important factors in introducing the virus into prisons, it said.\n\nThe arrival of new detainees also poses a risk, and the study noted that some jurisdictions like Puerto Rico have lowered or eliminated bail and introduced house arrest as a way to prevent new cases from entering prisons.\n\nThe C.D.C. warned that its data was incomplete; it was therefore unable to determine the percentages of infected prisoners and staff members across the country. It received data from the health departments of 37 states and U.S. jurisdictions; 32 of them reported at least one laboratory-confirmed case among 420 facilities. There are roughly 5,000 detention centers and prisons in the U.S., both public and private.\n\nThe C.D.C. recommended regular screening for symptoms, including taking prisoners' temperatures and asking if they have coughs, when reliable testing is not available. It also suggested screening quarantined detainees and staff members twice daily in cases when they may have been exposed to an infected person, and then isolating suspected cases.\n\nIt urged staff members and prisoners to wear cloth face masks and for facilities to promote physical distancing, when possible, to disinfect shared surfaces and to provide soap free of charge. Prisoners should sleep head to foot; meal times and showers should be staggered; the number of people in common areas at one time should be reduced; and some group gatherings suspended.",

        "body": "Wednesday: As California gradually allows businesses to reopen, officials say there still isn't enough testing to move more quickly.\n\nGood morning.\n\n(Don't get California Today delivered to your inbox? Here's the sign-up.)\n\nFor weeks, officials have said California's reopening will be incremental and varied across the state. On Tuesday, it became a little clearer what that actually looks like.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom announced that the first two counties, Butte and El Dorado, had met the criteria for easing some restrictions ahead of the rest of the state and that more were expected to follow. (Indeed, as of Tuesday night, five other counties had been added to the list.)\n\nThat means restaurants in those counties may be able to open for dine-in service, as long as they take precautions; the state released lengthy guidelines for doing so on Tuesday.\n\n[See which California counties have the most coronavirus cases.]\n\nThey say restaurants should take steps like adding partitions to areas where it's difficult to stay apart, implementing temperature or other symptom checks for workers, and prioritizing outdoor seating. Customers should wear face coverings when they can.\n\n\"If we love our community and our restaurants, let's protect them,\" Mr. Newsom said, adding that if consumers and workers feel unsafe, reopening more places won't do much good.\n\nThe guidelines serve as a kind of preview for diners in the Bay Area or Los Angeles, where stricter orders are expected to be in place longer than in other parts of the state.\n\nTesting capacity continues to be a major hurdle to lifting restrictions, officials have said.\n\nMr. Newsom said that as of this week, the state was averaging about 35,000 tests per day -- many more than the 2,000 tests per day on average about a month ago, but still short of the roughly 61,000 per day that experts have said should be a baseline.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Americans are increasingly on the move, even as top public health officials warn of dangers. The White House has no authority to delay 2020 election, but Kushner does not dismiss the possibility. The stay-at-home order in L.A. County could last into July; Cal State cancels in-person classes this fall. See more updates Updated 2m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nHe said there were plans to mandate testing at nursing homes, where CalMatters reported testing is still lagging.\n\nWhat Goes Into the Personal Decision to Get a Test\n\nEven as the capacity to test for Covid-19 has expanded, there's still lingering confusion about who should actually sign up.\n\nMy colleague Brian X. Chen, who writes about consumer technology, tried to figure it out for himself. Here's his dispatch on what happened:\n\nMy journey to getting tested for Covid-19 started with a text message. I had opted to receive texts from the San Francisco government about the pandemic, and last Monday my phone vibrated with an alert: \"SF is offering Covid-19 testing for anyone who lives or works in SF. For more info at sf.gov/GetTestedSF or call 311.\"\n\nI took this to mean universal testing had reached the city. That would be a major development, because pandemic experts have said that as many people as possible need to get tested to get a clear picture of Covid-19's spread.\n\nSo even though I lacked symptoms, it seemed like a civic duty to accept the city's invitation to be tested. I quickly clicked through the website to schedule an appointment. So did my wife.\n\nA day later, my wife had second thoughts. She saw that the city government's website about the test had conflicting messages. While it said anyone in the city could get tested, another portion of the site said: \"Check if you can get tested,\" stating that essential workers or people with at least one symptom were eligible.\n\nSo did this mean that my wife and I, who don't fit the criteria, were taking a test away from others? My wife called 311, and a city worker said only essential workers or people with symptoms should be taking the test.\n\n[Read more about California's testing expansion plans.]\n\nShe left a voice mail message with Color, the test lab, asking to cancel her appointment. A Color employee called back and reassured her that there was an abundance of tests available, and if people wanted to contribute to the city's data gathering, they should do so. We kept our appointments.\n\nOn Friday afternoon, we drove to the test site in downtown San Francisco. The lab had set up several white tents in a large parking lot, divided into two sections, for drivers and for pedestrians. People with cars drove through a lane of orange cones and rolled down their windows to be swabbed. Pedestrians stood in line to take the test, with markers to keep them six feet apart.\n\nWhen it came our turn, we drove up to the swab station. A medical worker asked whether I had a preference for a nostril (I chose the left). Then he took a giant Q-tip and jammed it up there, holding it for 10 seconds.\n\nIt was painful. Stinging and mushy at the same time. (Was I actually swabbed in the brain?) After repeating the process for my wife, the worker handed us bar codes that we could later check on Color's website for the results. We drove off in tears.\n\nWhile the test was simple, I was still confused about the city's \"Get Tested\" website and whether we had done the right thing. I asked the mayor's office for clarity.\n\nTyrone Jue, the senior adviser to the mayor who oversaw the Get Tested SF campaign, said my wife and I had inadvertently taken the test. It was meant for essential workers and people with symptoms.\n\nSo why say anyone can get tested?\n\nMr. Jue explained that the city faced a challenge. There are economically disadvantaged groups that are more likely to be exposed, and many avoid getting tested in fear of unemployment. To encourage those people to get tested, the city worked with community organizers to come up with inclusive messaging: Anyone living or working in the city can get tested. (Not just anyone though.)\n\n[Read more about why the virus is deadlier for black and Latino Californians.]\n\n\"The language, while confusing, is true,\" Mr. Jue said. (Since last week, the Get Tested website was updated to make the city's eligibility requirements more clear, but it still states that anyone can get tested.)\n\nSince the introduction of this language, test numbers are up, Mr. Jue said. But that's in part because people who were ineligible for testing -- like me, my wife and a dozen of our friends who got the memo -- were swabbed.

        "body": "ALBUQUERQUE -- Tribal nations around the United States are facing their most severe crisis in decades as they grapple simultaneously with some of the deadliest coronavirus outbreaks in rural America and the economic devastation caused by the protracted shutdown of nearly 500 tribally owned casinos.\n\nThe Navajo Nation, the country's largest Indian reservation, now has a higher death rate than any U.S. state except New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts.\n\nAcross Indian Country, more than 5,200 cases have been confirmed in communities from Arizona to Minnesota -- a number that might seem small compared with those in major urban centers in New York and Los Angeles, but which in many cases represents significant local clusters that are challenging the limited resources of tribal clinics and rural hospitals.\n\nOn reservations in the Dakotas and Montana where good housing is scarce, extended families have been forced to shelter together in tiny homes with no clean water and no internet. On the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, the Northern Arapaho Tribe opened its casino as a quarantine site.\n\nThe collective perils -- fragile health care systems, large numbers of people with pre-existing conditions and the collapse of tribal economies -- have prompted Native American leaders to warn that serious havoc may be ahead, especially if shutdown casinos prevent tribes from battling to recover on their own.\n\n\"Life and death,\" said Bryan Newland, tribal chairman of the Bay Mills Indian Community in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, who estimated that about two-thirds of tribal employees were out of work. \"We're just going to write off 2020. There's no sense in trying to work under the delusion that we'll be able to claw back to normal life this year.\"\n\nThe closure of the tribal casinos, which have emerged as one of the largest new sources of employment of any economic sector in the United States in recent decades, is eviscerating the revenues many tribal nations use to provide basic services. In one of the most important shifts toward increasing self-determination since the start of the century, more than 40 percent of the 574 federally recognized tribes in the United States now operate casinos.\n\nNow these operations are hemorrhaging jobs. After the entire industry shut down in the early days of social distancing measures, more than 700,000 people were left out of work, according to Meister Economic Consulting, which specializes in the tribal gaming industry.\n\nIn Michigan and Indiana, almost 1,500 workers were laid off at casinos owned by the Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians. Up and down California, tribal nations have laid off or furloughed casino workers. In Connecticut, the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribal nations announced last week that they were laying off the majority of their nearly 5,000 workers.\n\nNon-Native Americans account for about 70 percent of workers in tribally owned casinos, reflecting the economic importance of such operations in many rural parts of the country. Altogether, tribal gaming enterprises generated $17.7 billion in local, state and federal tax revenue in 2019, according to a letter sent to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin in April by members of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development.\n\nIn an interview, the Harvard scholar Joseph Kalt likened the far-reaching devastation caused by shutdowns of tribal businesses around the country this year to the demise of the bison herds in the 19th century and the contentious attempt in the 1950s to disband tribes and relocate Native Americans to cities.\n\n\"You'd have to go back to the 50s for something of this magnitude,\" said Mr. Kalt, a co-director of the Harvard Project on American Indian Economic Development.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The White House plans to ask most officials -- but not Trump -- to wear face masks. As states rush to reopen, scientists fear the virus will come back. Trump uses misleading numbers to praise his administration's virus response. See more updates Updated 6m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"What you're seeing right now is simply a symptom of a much deeper problem facing tribal nations for over a century,\" said Fawn R. Sharp, president of the National Congress of American Indians. \"The failure to fund us has left us incredibly vulnerable.\"\n\nIt was not until the beginning of the 21st century that tribal gaming began to gather considerable momentum, providing tribal nations a crucial source of funding that could not collect taxes.\n\nSome tribes have continued paying their employees despite the closures, in attempts to stave off the economic pain. But after federal authorities delayed providing tribes with their portion of $8 billion in assistance from federal stimulus measures, the losses are accumulating.\n\nBut the Treasury Department has been slow to disperse the aid, and tribal leaders have expressed exasperation over the delays at a time when the virus is hitting them hard.\n\nIn Michigan, the closure of the Keweenaw Bay Indian Community's casino has already produced monthly losses of about $2 million, depleting funds for police patrols and the health clinic serving the 3,600-member tribe. As a result, fewer people are receiving basic health care and authorities have had to cancel daily lunches for tribal elders.\n\nIn the meantime, tribes are trying to plan for the uncertain weeks ahead.\n\nIn Oklahoma, where Gov. Kevin Stitt was already demanding more money from tribal casinos before the pandemic as part of a simmering feud, the Cherokee Nation, the largest tribal nation in the United States, is still paying its employees and planning to open parts of their gaming operations in early June.\n\nBut what that will look like remains unclear, said Brandon Scott, director of communications for the tribe. \"I think it would be irresponsible of us to open the doors and go back to exactly the way we were,\" he said.\n\n\"Tomorrow if we saw a huge spike in incidents in the state of Oklahoma, our plan would change dramatically.\"\n\nAlready, the Navajo Nation has seen a serious spike, with a rate of 62 coronavirus deaths per 100,000 people. In New Mexico, which includes part of the Navajo reservation, Native Americans account for 57 percent of confirmed cases in the state, though they comprise only about 11 percent of the population.\n\nA lack of basic infrastructure has further complicated thoughts of reopening. A business incubator on the Navajo Nation once offered internet access, tax-education seminars and work space to dozens of tiny start-ups before being forced to shut down in March. Now, the lack of plumbing or running water in the group's shared work space poses a huge obstacle to its future.\n\n\"The virus is really showing years and years of neglect,\" said Jessica Stago, a director of the incubator Change Labs. \"Everything's sort of collapsing at this point.\"\n\nMeanwhile, unemployment rates on some reservations that were 50 percent or higher during normal times have now soared to catastrophic levels, and tribal leaders worry that their budgets will be the last places in America to recover economically.\n\nScott Russell, a former tribal secretary of the Crow in eastern Montana, said the throngs of summertime tourists who come to boat and watch re-enactments of the Battle of Little Bighorn was a critical source of revenue and jobs on the reservation. He said the tribe was preparing to open up, but it was unclear whether people would return.\n\n\"It's a ripple effect we feel right down to our cafe,\" Mr. Russell said.\n\nThe economic pain has been getting worse as people lose even the odd jobs and piecework that helped them pay bills. Cedar Rose Bulltail survived by selling handmade beadwork at indigenous art fairs, cooking fry bread for neighbors and making yarrow balm in the kitchen of her tiny rural home with no running water on the Crow Reservation.\n\nNow, the festivals and fashion shows that were an economic lifeline have been canceled. Her 18-year-old daughter is back home from boarding school and straining to keep up with her schoolwork without any reliable internet connection. And with hand washing now an urgent health need, Ms. Bulltail's hopes of saving enough money this summer to buy a new well pump to bring reliable, clean water into her house have been dashed.\n\n\"I just feel robbed,\" Ms. Bulltail said.\n\nAs tribes measure the economic fallout, some leaders are hitting back at pressure from state and federal authorities to reopen. The demand by Kristi Noem, the Republican governor of South Dakota, that tribes remove checkpoints on roads has flared tempers around the country, showcasing how tension is building over what happens next in many tribal nations.\n\n\"Heads would roll if that kind of discussion were to happen in New Mexico,\" said Rep. Derrick Lente, a Democratic state legislator and member of Sandia Pueblo, which operates a large casino and hotel complex on the outskirts of Albuquerque that has been closed for weeks.\n\n\"Tribal sovereignty needs to be respected if we're to get back on our footing,\" Mr. Lente said, citing the reach of tribal gaming operations. \"You don't do that by disrespecting tribal nations that have created thousands of jobs.\"\n\nSimon Romero reported from Albuquerque and Jack Healy from Denver.

        "body": "(Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n\nTwin antibodies may be better than one\n\nScientists have found twin antibodies that neutralize the new coronavirus, each by slightly different mechanisms. Finding a way to use both antibodies simultaneously might be a particularly good way to attack the virus, the researchers say. According to their report on Wednesday in Science, the two antibodies were isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Both work by attaching to a spike on the virus that helps it break into human cells. Because the antibodies each bind to different places on the spike, a \"cocktail\" containing both may be more effective than a treatment using either one by itself. The information could also help in development of a preventive vaccine, the laboratory experiments suggest. Furthermore, even if the virus mutates so that one of the antibodies no longer works, the other might still retain its neutralizing activity. (https://bit.ly/2WsbD7b)\n\nChildren with cancer may be no more vulnerable to the coronavirus than healthy kids\n\nChildren with cancer do not need to delay treatment for fear of becoming more vulnerable to the new coronavirus, according to a study reported on Wednesday in JAMA Oncology. \"It was reassuring that they didn't appear to be any more vulnerable than other children,\" Dr. Andrew Kung, coauthor of the study and head of pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, told Reuters. \"With this information we can now feel confident to forge ahead with cancer therapy and not delay out of fears of affecting susceptibility to COVID-19.\"\n\nAmong children with cancer but without symptoms of coronavirus infection, only 2.5% tested positive for the virus, researchers reported. Among those who had been exposed to the virus or had symptoms suggestive of infection, 29.3% tested positive, with only one requiring hospitalization. Altogether, the team tested 178 children and 74 adult caregivers for the virus. Among the children's asymptomatic caregivers, 14.7% turned out to be infected. \"Even in that setting, we found that just half of the time when a caregiver was positive did the kid also test positive,\" Kung said. \"This suggests that there is something about kids that makes them less susceptible not just to the development of symptoms but to the infection itself.\"\n\n(https://bit.ly/3cuDM3j)\n\nScientists find cheaper way to study coronavirus genome\n\nResearchers have found a simpler, cheaper way to sequence the coronavirus genome, a crucial process that allows researchers access the genetic information in the RNA of the virus. \"This approach builds on ongoing sequencing efforts by other groups but bypasses time consuming and costly steps in preparing samples for sequencing,\" Daryl Gohl of the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, who led the research, told Reuters. \"The ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at low cost and at large scale will aid in the genomic surveillance of (the virus) for public health efforts, and has the potential to accelerate studies on the influence of viral genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and clinical outcomes.\" The paper describing the new method was posted online on Tuesday on the bioRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed. (https://bit.ly/3buhU6A)\n\nCoronavirus particles in feces may not be infectious\n\nThe new coronavirus may not spread via contact with fecal matter, researchers suggest in a report on Wednesday in Science Immunology. In laboratory experiments, they discovered that while the virus does infect the cells of the small intestine, fluid from the large intestine inactivates it, so that the virus is no longer infectious by the time it is excreted in feces. The authors caution, however, that because they only studied fecal samples from 10 patients, they cannot definitively rule out fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Their findings also suggest that certain protein-digesting enzymes help the new coronavirus enter cells in the gut. Blocking those two enzymes might be a way to treat the infection, they speculate, especially since a drug that inhibits the TMPRSS2 enzyme is already approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nThe first pets in the United States, two cats from New York state, have tested positive for the virus that is causing the worldwide pandemic, the Agriculture Department and the Centers for Disease Control announced Wednesday.\n\nThe cats, from different parts of the state, are showing only mild symptoms and are expected to be fine.\n\nTesting positive does not mean the cats have the same illness that people have. Nor does it mean that the cats can pass on the illness to people. And tests for pets are not the same as those for people, so no humans missed out on testing because the cats were tested.\n\nVeterinarians took samples from both cats that were tested at a private lab. The test results were then confirmed at a national veterinary lab. The owners brought both cats to veterinarians because they showed symptoms of a respiratory infection. One owner had tested positive for the virus. No human in the other cat's household tested positive.\n\nOther cats have tested positive for the virus, SARS-CoV-2, including a pet in Belgium and a tiger at the Bronx zoo. After the tiger who showed mild symptoms tested positive, the zoo collected fecal samples from other big cats and found that a total of five tigers and three lions had been infected. One of the tigers didn't show any symptoms. All of the big cats are doing well, the zoo reported Wednesday.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A doctor says he was removed from his federal post after pressing for rigorous vetting of treatments embraced by Trump. The timeline of the virus's arrival in the U.S. shifts with the revelation of an early death in California. The Education Department will ban colleges from giving DACA students emergency aid. See more updates Updated 35m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nIn an experiment in China, cats were shown to be susceptible to infection with the coronavirus, showing mild symptoms. The researchers said the experiment also showed that cats could pass the virus to other cats. But that was in a laboratory setting. The virus was detected by tests done after the cats had been euthanized. The researchers noted in the paper, \"It was difficult to perform regular nasal wash collection on the sub-adult cats because they were aggressive.\"\n\nThe Agriculture Department and the C.D.C. emphasized that \"there is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading the virus in the United States.\" Other experts agree that people should not start looking at their cats with suspicion. If anything, it's the other way around.\n\nKaren Terio, the chief of the Zoological Pathology Program at University of Illinois's veterinary college, where the Bronx Zoo tiger sample was tested, noted that hundreds of thousands of people have tested positive in the United States, as opposed to two cats.\n\nDr. Terio said that while the tests and the earlier experiments did show that cats appear to be somewhat susceptible to the virus, \"If this was going to be a serious problem for cats, we would have seen greater numbers.\" Either very few cats are being infected, or their symptoms are so mild that their owners don't notice them or think they warrant a trip to the vet. The direction of infection \"is not going to be cat to human,\" she said, \"It's going to be us to our pets. Thankfully, they're having very mild disease.\"\n\nFor now, the C.D.C. recommends keeping cats indoors to prevent them from contact with other animals or people. And for people who become sick, they recommend, as they have in the past, isolating from pets as much as possible, treating them as you would a human being in your family.\n\nDogs are less susceptible to infection with the virus, according to the same research paper on cats. Although there is some evidence that they may have low-level infections, they haven't shown any symptoms. Nonetheless, the C.D.C. recommends that you put dogs on a six-foot leash when walking them, keep them away from other animals and avoid contact as much as possible with any pets if you are sick. The American Veterinary Medical Association has the same advice, which did not change with the new announcement.\n\nThe Agriculture Department will post any confirmed tests of animals with SARS-CoV-2 on its website. It does not recommend routine testing for pets.",

        "body": "The U.F.C. is to stage the first major American sporting event in nearly two months on Saturday night. On Friday, however, one of the bouts had to be canceled because a fighter tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe Ultimate Fighting Championship is back.\n\nOn Saturday night, in a nearly empty arena in Jacksonville, Fla., U.F.C. 249 will make the world's biggest mixed martial arts organization the first major North American sport to return from an industrywide shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOf course, the U.F.C.'s president, Dana White, would have preferred not to take a hiatus at all, even as the rapid spread of the virus shut down sports events from the N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments to the Masters, and forced the N.B.A., N.H.L., M.L.B. and other leagues to suspend their schedules. Instead White pressed forward with plans to stage U.F.C. 249 on April 18, looking toward a lightweight title matchup in Brooklyn between the Russian Khabib Nurmagomedov and the American Tony Ferguson that had been years in the making.\n\nWhen the New York State Athletic Commission refused to approve the event, the U.F.C. clung to its date while scouting new locations. Nurmagomedov, the U.F.C.'s lightweight champion, eventually dropped out, unable to leave his native Dagestan because of pandemic-related travel restrictions. He was replaced by Justin Gaethje, a top lightweight contender.\n\nWhen the U.F.C. finally had to postpone the event, White -- eager to prove the U.F.C. could host bouts safely in the midst of the health crisis -- told fighters to keep training because he would find a solution.\n\nThe first answer is Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis declared pro sports an essential industry when issuing a stay-at-home order last month. The U.F.C. plans to stage two more cards in Jacksonville next week after the series begins Saturday with U.F.C. 249. Ferguson, an unorthodox striker known for bloody brawling and submissions, will face a power puncher in Gaethje during the main event, which figures to deliver excitement and a high pace.\n\nWith no competition from Major League Baseball or from hockey and basketball playoffs, U.F.C. is positioned for a big viewership win.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The F.D.A. approved the first home saliva test for the coronavirus. The U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs in April as unemployment rose to 14.7 percent. Pence's press secretary has tested positive for the virus. See more updates Updated 3m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAnd yet its success will also be measured by whether it proves harmful to public health. On Friday night, U.F.C. officials said one of their fighters, Ronaldo Souza, a Brazilian middleweight nicknamed Jacare, had been pulled from U.F.C. 249 because he had tested positive for the coronavirus earlier in the day. The U.F.C. said in a statement that two of Souza's cornermen had also tested positive for the virus.\n\nSouza, who was not showing symptoms, told the promotion company when he arrived in Jacksonville on Wednesday that one of his relatives might have had the virus, a U.F.C. executive told ESPN, which is airing the preliminary bouts and selling the pay-per-view card.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nAll times are Eastern.\n\nSaturday's 11 remaining bouts, with the fight between Souza and Uriah Hall canceled, are divided among two broadcasts.\n\nStarting at 6 p.m., six preliminary bouts will appear on ESPN, the ESPN+ streaming service, and on U.F.C. Fight Pass.\n\nThe main pay-per-view card, with five fights, will begin at 10 p.m., and will stream on ESPN+ for $64.99.\n\nWhat's different about this card?\n\nA lot.\n\nThe venue, the VyStar Veterans Memorial Arena, usually seats up to 15,000 people, but U.F.C. 249 will not have spectators. And the U.F.C. is limiting the number of fight-night and TV production staff members in the arena, staging this show with a crew of 150 instead of the usual 300.\n\nPre-fight and post-fight news conferences have been moved online, and there were no ceremonial weigh-ins on Friday night, when screaming fans and on-stage staredowns would typically have contributed to fight-week hype.\n\nLawrence Epstein, the chief operating officer of U.F.C., told the Sports Business Journal that about 1,200 Covid-19 tests would be used for fighters and other employees during the three events in Florida. During an online news conference on Thursday, several fighters spoke about the discomfort of having long cotton swabs shoved up their nostrils. The test was particularly uncomfortable for Gaethje, who has a blocked passage in his right nostril because of an old injury.\n\nThe fighters themselves are staying in a local hotel, and they have been given private saunas to help them shed weight and private workout rooms. Inside the arena, everyone besides the fighters is required to follow physical distancing recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Outside the arena, competitors have been aware of the absence of traveling fans.\n\n\"It's just more calm,\" said the U.F.C. bantamweight champion, Henry Cejudo, who will face Dominick Cruz in Saturday's second-billed event. \"We know we're fighting, but it doesn't feel like fight week. It's deserted.\"\n\nHow did the event get to this point?\n\nWhen other pro sports outfits suspended operations in mid-March, White made plain his intention to stick as closely as possible to the U.F.C.'s normal schedule. He has said in interviews since then that moving forward has allowed the U.F.C. to avoid layoffs. So when New York regulators barred U.F.C. 249 from Brooklyn, the company targeted the Tachi Palace Casino Resort on tribal land in California, postponing the event only when executives from Disney, the parent company of ESPN, implored White not to go on with his California plan.\n\nBy then Gaethje had replaced Nurmagomedov in the main event, and speculation raged about where the card would land. White repeatedly talked about moving operations to a private island where fighters would fly in from around the world for events that the U.F.C. planned to hold weekly. White says \"Fight Island\" is still a plan, though he has not revealed specifics about its location or timing.\n\nWhat can viewers expect?\n\nBesides a nearly empty arena and people staying far apart from one another outside the octagon?\n\nAction.\n\nFerguson is a relentless pressure fighter, and Gaethje has put together a string of stunning one-punch knockouts. The preliminary bouts are full of fighters matched to produce maximum violence. In the final bout of the ESPN preliminary fights, Anthony Pettis -- whose wall-walking roundhouse kick to Ben Henderson's head in 2010 became a viral highlight -- will face Donald Cerrone, a fighter nicknamed Cowboy who has delivered, and received, some of the U.F.C.'s most spectacular knockouts.\n\nNormally fighters like Cerrone and Pettis would land on the pay-per-view portion of the event, but their presence on cable TV probably isn't a coincidence, since they are likely to deliver the kind of high-impact violence that could prompt a casual fan to purchase the main card.\n\nWhat's in it for the fighters?\n\nFor Ferguson and Gaethje, the U.F.C.'s interim lightweight championship and the right to face Nurmagomedov for the undisputed title -- eventually.\n\nOther fighters have expressed a sense of honor about participating in the first major pro sports event in the United States since mid-March. The featherweight Jeremy Stephens, for example, said he was proud of proving that he and his peers don't fear a virus and that White was committed to keeping Americans entertained.\n\n\"The stay-at-home man is a dead man,\" Stephens said two days before his scheduled fight against Calvin Kattar. He added: \"It's worth the risk. Go out there and do it, and we're going to bring America back on top.\"\n\nGreg Hardy, a former N.F.L. defensive end who will compete in the first bout on the main card, conceded that Covid-19 presents risks, especially since he has asthma.\n\n\"I'm terrified, man,\" Hardy said. \"But it's not going to stop me from making sure my boss has the most entertaining fight.\"",

        "body": "LONDON -- On May 1, a visibly relieved Matt Hancock announced that the British government had exceeded its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day. As health secretary, Mr. Hancock had set the goal after enduring intense criticism for the country's lagging coronavirus testing program.\n\nHe called the milestone \"an incredible achievement.\"\n\nBut leaked documents and interviews with doctors, lab directors and other experts show that the push to hit the April 30 deadline -- and arguably salvage Mr. Hancock's career -- placed a huge strain on public laboratories and exposed other problems that are now slowing efforts to further expand coronavirus testing.\n\nDays before the deadline, some hospitals in England were given 48 hours to rapidly expand testing to thousands of health care workers and patients, even though they were not exhibiting any symptoms of the virus, the documents show.\n\nAt the same time, public labs across the country raced through limited supplies of the chemical reagents needed to carry out a flood of tests after the government promised to replenish their supplies. Two weeks later, some labs still haven't received the stocks they need, forcing some to reduce the number of new tests they can process, several lab managers said.\n\n\"It was clear that the reason was for meeting the 100,000 target,\" said Dr. Tom Gardiner, a junior doctor at St Mary's Hospital in London, which received a call to urgently ramp up testing. \"It was two days before the deadline, only lasted two days, and we haven't heard it before or since,\" he said.\n\nBritain has recorded the most coronavirus deaths of any country in Europe, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Conservative government have come under mounting criticism for an often-inconsistent response to the pandemic, especially on testing.\n\nThe government had a slow start in rolling out mass testing, made an ill-fated initial decision to only process tests at one central laboratory and made an embarrassing purchase of millions of unproven antibody tests from China, after failing to ramp up domestic test production.\n\nEven the country's statistics regulator criticized the government's testing target this week, calling for more \"truthfulness\" around how it presents its data.\n\nMr. Hancock set the 100,000-test target at the beginning of last month, in response to growing pressure. Now Mr. Johnson has promised to increase the daily capacity for testing to 200,000 -- except the system still hasn't recovered from the frantic push to reach the initial goal.\n\nIn the two weeks since April 30, the government's number of daily tests initially slipped well below 100,000, where it has remained for every day but three. A major problem is that Britain has far fewer domestic producers of reagents than the United States, Germany and China, and huge global demand has made supplies scarce.\n\n\"Since the 100,000 test target was passed, there appears to be a decline in the labs' chemical reagents in terms of what they're getting from the government,\" said Allan Wilson, head of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, which represents public lab workers. \"It's all hand-to-mouth, there's no secure supply chain.\"\n\nMr. Wilson said the government needed to develop a coherent testing strategy, rather than set arbitrary targets that could be counterproductive when the country's supply chain lacked necessary amounts not just of reagents but even of the cotton swabs needed for testing.\n\n\"When we're chronically short of tests and supplies, the government should be prioritizing those most in need instead of focusing on hitting a target,\" said Bill Esterson, a Labour Party lawmaker who has been working closely with the country's chemical industry.\n\nA spokesman from the Department of Health and Social Care insisted that all labs had adequate supplies of reagents and said it was working \"tirelessly\" to scale up capacity.\n\n\"The scale and speed at which we have increased our testing capacity and rolled out mass testing is unprecedented and a real success,\" the spokesman said.\n\nFrom the moment Mr. Hancock announced that the government had surpassed the April 30 goal -- reaching 122,347 tests that day -- he was accused of manipulating the numbers. It turned out that the government had counted more than 40,000 home testing kits and tests that had been sent to satellite health centers but not necessarily returned.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak China's economy, now a bellwether, shows hints of recovery.

Ordinarily, expanding eligibility would be admirable, but the government did so even as it lacked adequate testing resources to keep up with the demand, or to process all the test results.\n\nOn April 28, just two days before the government's deadline, only 52,429 daily tests had been carried out, barely half the target.\n\nThat same evening, the hospital staff at Imperial College Healthcare N.H.S. Trust -- a network made up of five major hospitals in north and west London -- had received a frantic email calling for \"at least\" 1,500 staff to be tested over the next 48 hours, even if they had no symptoms.\n\nThis was far more tests than the government had previously asked hospitals to conduct as part of a pilot study to understand coronavirus prevalence in hospitals, documents show. It also came with a new deadline of April 30, which coincided with the government's own.\n\n\"It's clear someone has said 'We need to meet this target in two days' time,'\" said Dr. Gardiner. \"The fastest way is not to send round test kits, but to go to a site where lots of people are still working. That's obviously a hospital.\"\n\nStaff members were blindsided, but the hospitals quickly responded, testing more than 2,000 workers by the following day, internal emails show. The day after that, the government hit its target.\n\nBut problems quickly emerged at hospital labs across the country. The chemical reagent stocks the government had promised to replenish were not delivered in their weekly allocation. Some received significantly less than they had asked for while others received none, several lab managers said.\n\nOne senior lab manager, who helped coordinate the rush testing at the Imperial College network, said they were initially asked to carry out up to 800 tests over 48 hours, but that was ramped up to 2,600. To do this meant labs had to risk exhausting their reagents rather than keeping supplies in hand for the following week's tests, said the manager, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the N.H.S. forbids speaking publicly without permission.\n\nThe next week, the government provided the manager's labs with 15 percent fewer test kits than needed -- but other labs had fared far worse, the manager said, with reagent stocks at several London hospitals \"semi-decimated.\"\n\nIn one case, the manager donated the lab's entire remaining stock of 196 test kits to South West Pathology, a lab network where the managers said one hospital had run out of reagents entirely after ramping up their testing before the government deadline.\n\nLast week, the British news outlet The Independent reported on a leaked email from South West Pathology that said one of its London hospitals had been forced to restrict testing to symptomatic patients and staff, because of a shortage of chemical reagents -- on the same day that Boris Johnson announced the new 200,000 test target.\n\nSouth West Pathology said in a statement that it was continuing to offer a \"comprehensive\" testing service for all symptomatic patients and workers at all its hospitals.\n\nMr. Wilson, president of the Institute of Biomedical Sciences, said he had heard anecdotal evidence about reagent shortages \"across the country\" since the government passed its 100,000 target. Last week, one lab in the Midlands only received a fifth of the reagents it was expecting to get from the government, he said.\n\nFurther north, a network of labs held an emergency meeting on Monday, because they had not received a large enough allocation of reagents to carry out the tests asked of them. One senior lab manager said that her own lab had only received 300 kits, compared with 1,200 at peak supply, and that their biggest lab did not receive any stocks.\n\n\"It's the biggest reagent shortage by a significant mile that we've had since the outbreak, and it's at least partly due to the 100,000 test target,\" said the manager in the north, speaking on condition of anonymity because she did not have permission to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nN.H.S. England said that its labs had successfully expanded daily testing capacity and that all labs worked together to share, \"where necessary,\" the supplies needed to process coronavirus tests.\n\nA leaked briefing document shows that N.H.S. labs were running at around 75 percent capacity over three days last week -- while central labs run by Public Health England, an arm of the government, were running at around 65 percent capacity.\n\nThe biggest fear for health care workers is that testing to meet a target could lead to shortages of supplies which leave the sickest and most vulnerable without a test when they need it.\n\n\"It's dangerously arbitrary,\" said Dr. Gardiner, who added: \"We've met this one target and it's given the perception to the public that we're doing enough on testing, when clearly we are not.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nLONDON -- For Britons looking to judge their government's desperate response to the coronavirus pandemic, the verdict has increasingly come down to two numbers: 100,000, the number of tests that officials promised to conduct every day by the end of April; and 27,510, the latest death toll.\n\nOn Friday, there was good news and bad news in the numbers: The government announced it had exceeded its testing target, carrying out 122,347 tests on the last day of the month. But with 739 more people dying from the virus that same day, Britain was also poised to soon overtake Italy in a few days as the hardest hit country in Europe.\n\nThe fixation on numbers is understandable but misplaced, experts said. Just because Britain can carry out more than 100,000 tests a day does not mean it has built an effective testing and contact tracing program, which experts say is needed to avert another spike in infections if the government eases the lockdown.\n\nAnd while there would be grim symbolism for Britain in passing Italy in the total deaths, drawing direct comparisons between any two countries is extremely difficult, given differences in population, demographics, population density, and how the authorities collect the statistics.\n\nStill, Britain's health secretary, Matt Hancock, trumpeted the achievement of 122,000 tests, a 10-fold increase from when he set the goal on April 2, a day after having emerged from isolation himself with symptoms of the virus.\n\nHe said the achievement had set the stage for an equally ambitious program of contact tracing -- identifying people who have come into contact with an infected person so they can be also isolated, helping curtail the spread of the disease. Mr. Hancock said this program would eventually allow Britain to lift its lockdown and return to a semblance of normalcy.\n\n\"I knew it was an audacious goal, but we needed an audacious goal,\" said a visibly relieved Mr. Hancock, for whom the target had become a personal crucible. \"The challenge we still face is vast, but we are making real progress.\"\n\nThere were some lingering questions over whether the government changed its policy for counting tests to make its target. While officials insisted they had not changed the rules, they acknowledged having counted more than 27,000 home test kits, and more than 12,000 tests sent to satellite testing centers, at the time they were mailed rather than when they were returned to labs, with results.\n\nRegardless how many tests Britain has conducted, medical experts said the government had yet to build a contact-tracing operation to match its testing capacity. Drawing so much attention to the 100,000 number, critics said, was mostly a public-relations stunt.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak The W.H.O. extends its declaration of a global public health emergency as deaths approach 240,000. The F.D.A. has authorized emergency use of an antiviral drug, President Trump said. Our New Delhi correspondent shows us a city frozen in fear. See more updates Updated 56m ago More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York\n\n\"The number of people tested is meaningless,\" said Dr. Bharat Pankhania, an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Exeter Medical School. \"If you fail to deliver on contact tracing, then you are testing as a ceremony rather than as a way to contain and isolate the outbreak.\"\n\nOther experts, however, said there was merit to setting a numerical goal for testing, given Britain's slow start. In March, officials decided to abandon testing and tracing in the general population in favor of testing only those people with symptoms serious enough to hospitalize them.\n\n\"When there is a political priority to do something, then it can happen,\" said Professor Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at the University of Edinburgh. \"Now we need the same effort and priority given to tracing and isolation, as it goes in a package: test, trace, isolate.\"\n\nTo some extent, the government is a victim of its penchant for using numbers to reassure the public it has a coherent plan. On March 19, in one of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's early public statements on the crisis, he said that he believed the British people could send the virus \"packing\" within 12 weeks.\n\nSince returning to work after his own near-fatal bout of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, Mr. Johnson has fastened onto another metric: the number of new infections stemming from a single case, which has fallen to below one throughout Britain, but which Mr. Johnson fears could spike again if he lifts the social distancing measures too abruptly.\n\nAlongside the plan to ramp up testing, the government plans by mid-May to recruit around 18,000 people -- including around 3,000 in the field -- to conduct contact tracing. That is supposed to operate with a cellphone app that is being tested next week in one place, the Isle of Wight.\n\nBut so far, Downing Street has been unable to say how many of the 18,000 new employees have been recruited.\n\nMr. Johnson once set an objective of 250,000 tests a day, though the government now says that was conceived at a time when the search was on for an inexpensive and user-friendly antibody test, which would detect whether a person had been infected in the past. In fact, when it was announced, Mr. Hancock's 100,000 target also included the possibility of counting antibody tests.\n\n\"Targets work when you have confidence that hitting them helps you in meeting your goal,\" said Stewart Wood, an adviser to former Prime Minister Gordon Brown. \"The problem with this type of targeting is it suggests a level of competence which is not backed up by the strategy.\"\n\nFrom the start, the government has publicly plotted the country's death toll relative to its neighbors, a comparison that initially looked favorable for Britain. But that data came under scrutiny, since it was based on deaths in hospitals only, while France's, for example, included fatalities in nursing homes, too.\n\nWhen non-hospital deaths were recently added into the equation, Britain suddenly appeared headed for among the worst fatality numbers in Europe. That prompted the government to add yet another new chart -- based on per capita death rates -- which puts it behind Belgium, Spain and Italy.\n\nAs of Friday, Italy's deaths totaled 28,236 -- a number that excludes deaths in nursing homes. Its daily fatality rate has mostly declined over the last week, and was at 269 on Friday.\n\n\"You can see the shift in government messaging emerge, and the new line is the importance of data comparability,\" said Sophia Gaston, director of the British Foreign Policy Group and a fellow at the London School of Economics.\n\n\"There is some truth in that,\" she said, \"but at the same time it is dealing with the realization that Britain is likely to come out of this with a rather ghastly report card.\"\n\nThe government, Mr. Wood said, would have been better served by explaining the uncertainty over statistics from the start and by being more explicit about the lack of up-to-date figures on nursing home fatalities.\n\n\"The public would have understood that lack of certainty,\" he said. \"Instead, they have stuck with measures which everyone gradually has got to know are not quite right, and then had to shift, almost as a concession.\"\n\nElisabetta Povoledo contributed reporting from Rome.",

When the coronavirus began tearing across her reservation, she counseled family members to stay home, wash their hands and wear masks.\n\nThen the virus somehow made its way into her own home in Kayenta, a town in the Navajo Nation near the sandstone buttes of Arizona's Monument Valley. Her companion, Robby Jones, a detention officer with the Navajo Department of Corrections, caught Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\n\"She cared for him until she got sick herself,\" her sister Vanielle said. \"She was always that way, looking after others.\"\n\nWhen Ms. Blackhorse came down with symptoms including shortness of breath and back and knee pain, she went for a test. The results came back on April 22 and showed she was positive. A day later, Ms. Blackhorse died at Kayenta's health clinic, where Mr. Jones had taken her after she had difficulty breathing, her sister said. She was 28.\n\nMs. Blackhorse, who worked as an assistant at the Dennehotso Chapter House, an administrative office, was among the Navajo Nation's youngest and most prominent pandemic victims, and her death stunned many among her people. The reservation was already grappling with one of the deadliest outbreaks in rural America, with 1,977 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 62 deaths from the infection as of Thursday,authorities said.\n\nMs. Blackhorse was born on Sept. 2, 1991, in Tuba City, Ariz., to Danny and Laverne Blackhorse. Her father was a coal miner, her mother a cook.\n\nA former Miss Western Navajo, she had also previously held the titles Miss Monument Valley High School and Miss Din\u00e9 College. She won those titles while starting a family and a career as a public servant, even as she grappled with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that might have heightened her risk of dying from Covid-19.\n\nIn addition to her parents, Mr. Jones and her sister Vanielle, she is survived by her 1-year-old daughter, Poet Bessie Blackhorse, and another sister, Victoria.\n\nVanielle Blackhorse said her sister had dreamed of entering politics one day, aspiring to become a delegate to the Navajo Nation Council or even president of the Navajo Nation, one of the largest tribal nations in the United States.\n\n\"But she accomplished her big dream by becoming a mother,\" said Ms. Blackhorse, whose own daughter is the same age as Poet Bessie. \"She loved being a mom to her daughter.

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Aboard the carrier Theodore Roosevelt, recent history is repeating itself.\n\nAs sailors and other crew members who were quarantined on Guam return to the ship and begin preparations to return to sea, tensions have flared again between the ship's medical personnel and Navy leadership over whether the Roosevelt is ready to go back to work in the Pacific Ocean.\n\nMedical personnel and crew members aboard the Roosevelt say that several returning sailors have displayed symptoms that they associate with the coronavirus. But Navy officials counter that the sailors have tested negative twice, and that they may have the flu.\n\nIn one instance last week, according to a crew member aboard the ship, several sailors with symptoms associated with the coronavirus were accidentally placed on a bus bound for the Roosevelt. The entire bus was then sent back to quarantine and the sailors were tested again, Navy officials said.\n\n\"If the results come back negative the sailors will return to the ship -- if they are positive then the sailors will remain in quarantine and will be retested after a four-day wait period,\" the Navy said in an emailed response to The New York Times.\n\nIn a letter to the crew of the Roosevelt dated May 1 and obtained by The New York Times, Capt. Carlos A. Sardiello, the current commanding officer of the 1,000-foot-long nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, acknowledged that the threat of the virus \"onboard the ship remains real.\"\n\nBut on Monday night, the captain also gave a series of telephone interviews from the ship to reporters in Washington in which he repeated assurances that the Roosevelt was ready to get back to work.\n\n\"You've just got to give them direction and give them the tools that they need,\" he told The Associated Press in one interview. \"Then, whatever you put in front of them -- they're going to knock it out of the park.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. An ousted federal scientist said that he was pressured to steer contracts to clients of a well-connected lobbyist. The reality of the coronavirus in the U.S. is an unrelenting crush of cases and deaths. The White House is considering winding down the coronavirus task force in the coming weeks. See more updates Updated 2m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nAboard the ship, the crew is not so sure. Medical personnel, who have been reluctant to bring sailors back aboard even after 21 days of isolation and two to three tests, expressed frustration, according to a health care provider on Guam.\n\nThe divergence of assessments mirrors a similar split in March, when the coronavirus first arrived aboard the ship and led to a tumultuous series of events, including the removal of the ship's commander, Capt. Brett E. Crozier, and the resignation of the acting secretary of the Navy, Thomas B. Modly.\n\nThe Navy has stopped releasing daily updates on the number of virus cases among the crew after publicly announcing that 100 percent of the sailors had been tested. Roughly 1,700 sailors remain on Guam, many of them still quarantined and recovering.\n\nSailors clean the Roosevelt three to four times a day, and failing to wear a protective mask may now subject a sailor to nonjudicial punishment, said a crew member aboard the ship.\n\n\"The U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt is a deployed unit and ready for tasking if needed,\" Cmdr. J. Myers Vasquez, a U.S. Pacific Fleet spokesman, said in an email. \"We remain focused on the health and safety of our sailors, and ensuring the full recovery of all sailors on board U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt.\"\n\nIn his letter, Captain Sardiello told the crew to \"act like you and each of your shipmates have it and just don't know it yet.\" He said that the Roosevelt's \"collective effort to achieve and maintain a Covid-free ship can be undone by a single individual's offense or inattention.\"\n\nCaptain Sardiello said to expect daily medical screenings and to \"transit the ship at all times like we are conducting a Man Overboard muster; up and forward on the starboard side, down and aft on the port side. This will limit the risk of transmission by reducing close passes.\"\n\nCaptain Sardiello, who previously commanded the Theodore Roosevelt, was reinstated just over a month ago when Captain Crozier was removed.\n\nThough top Navy officials have recommended the reinstatement of Captain Crozier, a leader adored by his crew, the Navy initiated a broader investigation into the outbreak of the virus aboard the Roosevelt after a preliminary inquiry.\n\n\"I have unanswered questions that the preliminary inquiry has identified and that can only be answered by a deeper review,\" the acting Navy secretary, James E. McPherson, said in a statement.\n\nMr. McPherson said he was directing the chief of naval operations, Adm. Michael M. Gilday, to oversee the investigation, which is expected to conclude at the end of the month. Adm. Robert P. Burke, the vice chief of naval operations and the officer who conducted the preliminary inquiry, will also carry out the larger investigation.\n\nAnd in another twist, the Senate Armed Services Committee is holding a hearing on Thursday on President Trump's nomination of Kenneth Braithwaite to be the permanent secretary of the Navy. If the full Senate ultimately confirms Mr. Braithwaite, who is currently the U.S. ambassador to Norway, it is not clear how he will handle the outcome of the Roosevelt investigation or the possible reinstatement of Captain Crozier.\n\nThe Kidd, a Navy destroyer and the second deployed American warship stricken with the virus, has returned to port in San Diego with dozens of cases aboard. The ship was deployed to the eastern Pacific as part of a counternarcotics operation.\n\nIt is unclear how the virus got aboard the Kidd, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper said Monday during a webinar with the Brookings Institution. But illness spread quickly among the roughly 300 crew members.\n\n\"The statistics show that the safest place to be is on a deployed Navy ship, as compared to one that's in port,\" Mr. Esper said. \"Of the 90-plus ships we have at sea, we only have two that have been affected.\"",

        "body": "For one Rikers Island correction officer, the low point came when he and his wife were both extremely sick with the coronavirus. She could hardly breathe and begged him to make sure she was not buried in a mass grave, he recalled. He was sure he had contracted the disease working in the jailhouse, where supervisors had discouraged him from wearing a mask.\n\n\"I'm looking at the person I care most about possibly dying from this thing I brought home,\" he said, choking back tears. \"That to me is the scariest thing I ever faced.\"\n\nAnother officer at the Rikers jail said he worked for nearly two weeks while feeling ill but received no help from the jail's administrators in getting a test. A third, who delivered mail to people in custody, some of them sick, was told he could not use a mask that he had at home but had to wait for a city-issued one. He, too, became infected.\n\nThe coronavirus has wreaked havoc on New York City's 9,680 correction officers and their supervisors, who, like the police and firefighters, are considered essential workers. So far, 1,259 have caught the virus and six have died, along with five other jail employees and two correctional health workers. The officers' union contends that the death of one other guard is also the result of Covid-19.\n\nThe virus has sickened more correction officers in New York, the center of the pandemic in the United States, than in most other large American cities, including Chicago, Houston, Miami and Los Angeles combined, according to data collected by The New York Times.\n\nA majority of the officers in New York City are black and Hispanic and come from neighborhoods with high rates of Covid-19. They have been even more deeply affected than inmates, who also have been hit hard. At least three inmates have died in custody, and two succumbed within hours of being released. Among about 3,900 inmates left in the city's jails, 363 currently have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nCorrection officers and union officials have blamed the jail system's management for the high number of infections. The union points to the department's practice of asking officers to return to work after they recovered from the illness even if they had not yet tested negative for the virus. And they cited delays in providing many officers with protective gear during the critical month of March and failures to notify guards about colleagues who tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThey also have said that extra-long work shifts -- sometimes 24 hours at a stretch -- contributed to the epidemic among officers. At the peak of the epidemic, 36 percent of the uniformed jail staff called in sick, leading to long shifts for those still on the job.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio's spokeswoman, Avery Cohen, said that the health of correction officers was the administration's \"number one priority\" and that the city had supplied \"ample amounts of masks and protective equipment, access to testing and health screenings before shifts.\"\n\nThe city correction commissioner, Cynthia Brann, in testimony last week before the Board of Correction, a watchdog agency overseeing the jails, said all staff members are screened for fever when they arrive at work, common areas are sanitized daily and everyone in the jails has been required to wear masks since April 3.\n\n\"We have fielded inquiries from correction systems around the country that are looking to learn from our successes and modify their operations to mirror ours,\" she said.\n\nCorrection officers and union leaders acknowledged that in recent weeks the department has taken some steps to curb the epidemic, providing more protective equipment and testing, but they say those measures came too late for many officers and only after the union had sued the city.\n\n\"If we had better leadership, I believe we could have gotten through this a lot easier,\" said Elias Husamudeen, the president of the correction officers union. \"I believe there is a possibility, maybe, not as many people would have been affected by this thing.\"\n\nThe New York Times interviewed several correction officers, their spouses and union officials who provided a glimpse of what it has been like to work in the city's jails in the midst of a pandemic while also trying to protect themselves and their loved ones. They spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from management.\n\nA struggle to get tested\n\nAs the virus swept through the jails in March, one of the biggest complaints among officers was the lack of testing. Several said they sought tests at state-run sites, but, like many people, they were turned away.\n\nOne veteran officer said he lost his sense of taste and smell in mid-March, then got a slight fever. He went to a drive-though testing site, but the medical staff, seeking to conserve tests, told him to quarantine for 14 days instead.\n\nWithout a positive test result, he was required by his superiors to continue to work, and his symptoms worsened, he said. He had a cough and was sneezing. He did not have a mask, he said, or access to hand sanitizer.\n\n\"Inmates were dropping like flies\" on the cellblock where he worked, he said, and every day he saw several transferred to a different jailhouse where people showing symptoms of the virus were being isolated. Some were also sent to a hospital where inmates with Covid-19 were being treated.\n\nYet, few jail staff members had received masks, he said.\n\nNearly two weeks after his initial symptoms, the officer was ordered to go home, he said. His cough had worsened. He had chills and a fever. He felt incredibly weak. In late March, he finally managed to get tested in Queens and learned he had the virus.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Some N.Y. hospitals will allow visits to resume under a pilot program.

You feel helpless.\"\n\nOn April 2, the Correction Officers' Benevolent Association sued the city, arguing it should provide protective equipment and testing to all officers. A week later, the correction department arranged for guards who wanted a test to receive one at clinics run by Northwell Health.\n\nBefore those tests became available, some officers were taking extreme steps to shield their loved ones from the disease.\n\nThe wife of a second correction officer said a number of her husband's colleagues became sick with Covid-19, and he tried in vain to get tested at urgent care centers but was turned down because he had no symptoms. They have two children, one of whom has asthma, she said.\n\nFor weeks, she said, she and her husband had been living like \"two ships passing in the night,\" rarely seeing each other. He works nights, and when he comes home, he changes clothes, then sleeps in a guest bedroom.\n\n\"This is worse than anybody anticipated,\" she said. \"The department is not protecting their officers.\"\n\nThree weeks ago, he received a letter from the Department of Correction notifying him that on March 20 he had come into contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19.\n\n\"We're both on edge,\" she said.\n\nPutting lives at risk\n\nA third correction officer, who is 33, works in a jailhouse mailroom and was delivering letters to dozens of inmates even as the coronavirus began to sicken many people in the jail in mid-March.\n\nOn his rounds, he walked through areas where inmates were being tested for Covid-19 without a mask. His supervisors had told him, he said, that he could not wear a mask he had at home, without saying why.\n\n\"I was scared,\" he said. \"I knew eventually I was going to get sick.\"\n\nHe washed his hands every 10 minutes and avoided touching doors by waiting for someone else to open them. As a precaution, he had stopped visiting his parents, who are both diabetic. One of his uncles had died of the disease.\n\nAt the end of March he received a mask from the city, but no gloves. Two days later, he developed a cough, a sore throat and he felt dizzy. He knew he had delivered mail to people in custody who had the virus, including Harvey Weinstein, the movie producer convicted of rape.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nWhat should I do with my 401(k)?\n\nWatching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions -- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that \"free money.\"\n\nA test later confirmed what the officer believed: He, too, had the coronavirus.\n\nMs. Brann, who declined multiple requests for an interview, said in her testimony that she first required some jail staff members and people in custody to wear masks starting on March 11, a month before doing so was recommended for the general public. By April 3, she said, everyone in the jail was required to wear them.\n\nThat change came a day before a judge ordered the city to provide officers protective gear, union leaders said. Guards in jailhouses housing people with the coronavirus are given high-quality N95 masks. The rest receive surgical masks. A Board of Correction report released last week said some inmates and guards were either not wearing the masks or wearing them incorrectly.\n\nTwo weeks after the officer in the mailroom became ill, a city doctor called him to see how he was doing. He still had a slight fever, but the doctor told him to return to work anyway, he said. The officer refused. Tests in late April showed he still had the virus.\n\n\"I'm not going back until I know I'm negative,\" he said. \"That's ridiculous and irresponsible. They're literally putting people's lives at risk and not just the inmates -- you're bringing it back home.\"\n\n'The scariest thing I ever faced'\n\nThe officer whose wife became gravely ill said he tried for weeks to protect her. As soon as he walked into his apartment in southeast Queens after a double shift at Rikers, he stuffed his uniform, shoes and underwear into a closet, then sanitized everything he touched -- doorknobs, faucets -- and took a shower.\n\nAt work he wore an N95 mask that he had purchased. He stuffed alcohol pads into his pocket and as many plastic gloves into his waistband as would fit. He hooked a small bottle of hand sanitizer onto his belt. When he got to his post, he frantically cleaned the desk and phone with an alcohol pad.\n\nDuring lunch, he discarded the plastic gloves, washed his hands in a bathroom and used a tissue to open doors and pick up things.\n\nIn late March, he began to feel worn down. He attributed it to having worked a number of 16-hour shifts as more of his colleagues began to get sick. But then he tested positive for the virus. He had chills and body aches, he said. He coughed so hard that his rib cage hurt.\n\nSoon his wife, who has a chronic respiratory illness, became sick too, and had trouble breathing. He took her to a nearby hospital where she learned she had Covid-19 and pneumonia, he said. They wanted to admit her, but she refused, telling the doctors she would rather die at home with her husband.\n\nFor days, he worried she might not make it, he said. She needed help walking. Even small tasks left her extremely breathless. One day, she implored him not to let her be buried in a mass grave.\n\nAfter three difficult weeks, their symptoms improved. Though he still had a cough, and his doctor wanted him to be retested before he returned to work, a city doctor cleared him for return sooner.\n\nWorried about being reprimanded, he went back to work several weeks ago against his doctor's wishes, he said. He said not much had changed. The department has supplied him with a surgical mask, but he still buys his own N95 masks at inflated prices.\n\nThe cellblock where he works was placed in quarantine after an inmate was suspected of having the virus. Some of the inmates, he said, appear \"rundown and are bundling under whatever blankets they can get.\" Throughout the night, he can hear coughing.\n\n\"Each cough,\" he said, \"is worrisome.\"\n\nLibby Seline, Rebecca Griesbach, Maura Turcotte, Danya Issawi, Brendon Derr and Laura Messman contributed data research.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Despite a century's progress in science, 2020 is looking a lot like 1918.\n\nIn the years between two lethal pandemics, one the misnamed Spanish flu, the other COVID-19, the world learned about viruses, cured various diseases, made effective vaccines, developed instant communications and created elaborate public-health networks.\n\nYet here we are again, face-masked to the max. And still unable to crush an insidious yet avoidable infectious disease before hundreds of thousands die from it.\n\nAs in 1918, people are again hearing hollow assurances at odds with the reality of hospitals and morgues filling up and bank accounts draining. The ancient common sense of quarantining is back. So is quackery: Rub raw onions on your chest, they said in 1918. How about disinfectant in your veins now? mused President Donald Trump, drawing gasps instead of laughs over what he weakly tried to pass off as a joke.\n\nIn 1918, no one had a vaccine, treatment or cure for the great flu pandemic as it ravaged the world and killed more than 50 million people. No one has any of that for the coronavirus, either.\n\nModern science quickly identified today's new coronavirus, mapped its genetic code and developed a diagnostic test, tapping knowledge no one had in 1918. That has given people more of a fighting chance to stay out of harm's way, at least in countries that deployed tests quickly, which the U.S. didn't.\n\nBut the ways to avoid getting sick and what to do when sick are little changed. The failure of U.S. presidents to take the threat seriously from the start also joins past to present.\n\nTrump all but declared victory before infection took root in his country and he's delivered a stream of misinformation ever since. President Woodrow Wilson's principal failure was his silence.\n\nNot once, historians say, did Wilson publicly speak about a disease that was killing Americans grotesquely and in huge numbers, even though he contracted it himself and was never the same after. Wilson fixated on America's parallel fight in World War I like \"a dog with a bone,\" says John M. Barry, author of \"The Great Influenza.\"\n\nThe suspected ground zero of the Spanish flu ranges from Kansas to China. But it was clear to U.S. officials even in 1918 that it didn't start in Spain.\n\nThe pandemic took on Spain's name only because its free press ambitiously reported the devastation in the disease's early 1918 wave while government officials and a complicit press in countries at war -- the U.S. among them -- played it down in a time of jingoism, censorship and denial.\n\nLike COVID-19, the 1918 pandemic came from a respiratory virus that jumped from animals to people, was transmitted the same way, and had similar pathology, Barry said by email. Social distancing, hand-washing and masks were leading control measures then and now.\n\nMedical advice from then also resonates today: \"If you get it, stay at home, rest in bed, keep warm, drink hot drinks and stay quiet until the symptoms are past,\" said Dr. John Dill Robertson, Chicago health commissioner in 1918. \"Then continue to be careful, for the greatest danger is from pneumonia or some kindred disease after the influenza is gone.\"\n\nIn the manner of the day, there just had to be a catchy rhyme in circulation, too: \"Cover up each cough and sneeze. If you don't you'll spread disease.\"\n\nBut there were also marked differences between the viruses of 1918 and 2020. The Spanish flu was particularly dangerous to healthy people aged 20 to 40 -- the prime generation of military service -- paradoxically because of their vibrant immune systems.\n\nWhen such people got infected, their antibodies went after the virus like soldiers spilling from the trenches of Europe's killing fields.\n\n\"The immune system was throwing every weapon it had at the virus,\" Barry said. \"The battlefield was the lung. The lung was being destroyed in that battle.\"\n\nYoung soldiers and sailors massed at military camps in the U.S., sailed for Europe on ships stuffed to the gunwales with humanity, fought side by side in the trenches and came home in victory to adoring crowds. The toll was enormous, on them and the people they infected. The Spanish flu could just as easily have been called the U.S. Army or U.S. Navy flu instead. Or the German or British flu, for that matter.\n\nAmong those who died in the pandemic was Friedrich Trump, Donald Trump's paternal grandfather. Among those who contracted it and recovered were the wartime leaders of Britain and Germany as well as of the United States, British and Spanish kings and the future U.S. president, Franklin Roosevelt, when he was assistant Navy secretary.\n\nBut the toll was heavier on average people and the poor, crowded in tenements, street cars and sweaty factories.\n\nThey could not all live by the words of the 1918 U.S. surgeon general, Rupert Blue: \"Keep out of crowds and stuffy places as much as possible. ... The value of fresh air through open windows cannot be overemphasized. ... Make every possible effort to breath as much pure air as possible.\"\n\nAn estimated 675,000 Americans died in the pandemic, which is thought to have infected one-third of the global population. Tracking by Johns Hopkins University shows the continuing COVID-19 pandemic has killed more than 250,000 people globally, more than 68,000 in the United States.\n\n___\n\nBAD SCIENCE\n\nIn 1918, the surgeon general noted in a handbill that \"a person who has only a mild attack of the disease himself may give a very severe attack to others.\" The warning is just as applicable to the coronavirus, especially as scientists learned large numbers of people with COVID-19 may spread it despite no obvious symptoms. Exactly how often the new virus kills can't be determined without better counts of the infected; some estimates put the 1918 flu's death rate at 2.5%.\n\nBlue's public notice also warned people to avoid charlatans and only get medicine from doctors.\n\nPhysicians, though, didn't always know what they were doing. Medical journals at the time describe a rash of unusual treatments, some in the league of Trump's amateur theories about disinfectant, blasts of lights and an unapproved drug that has both potential benefits and risks.\n\nOne 1918-era doctor recommended that people sniff a boric acid and sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) powder to rinse out nasal passages. Others prescribed quinine, strychnine and a poisonous garden plant called Digitalis to help circulation, as well as drugs derived from iodine for \"internal disinfection,\" according to Laura Spinney, who wrote the 2017 book \"Pale Rider: The Spanish Flu of 1918 and How it Changed the World.\"\n\nPopular theories spread that warming your feet would prevent infection, or gobbling brown sugar, or getting the onion rubdown. A \"clean heart\" was one supposed preventive, though it is not clear whether that meant the organ or the heart of love.\n\n\"There was no Tony Fauci back then,\" Barry said in a remote Library of Congress interview in April.\n\nWe have Fauci now -- a federal immunologist who has been regarded as the truth-teller in White House briefings, singularly immune to Trump's positive spin and falsehoods. Plus, we know so much more than people did in 1918.\n\nYet we're still hearing lots of Dark Ages nonsense.\n\nConspiracy theorists have blamed COVID-19 on the development of 5G networks, just as they say radio waves caused the 1918 flu. Arsonists recently torched more than a dozen British cell towers after that falsehood circulated.\n\nOver the months of this pandemic, The Associated Press has debunked a series of bogus remedies that spread on Facebook, Twitter and the like. No, blasting hot air up your nose from a hair dryer won't protect you. Nor will drinking tonic water, eating high-alkaline foods, stuffing antibiotic ointment up your nose, downing vodka or any home elixir.\n\nNo, it's not true that if you can't hold your breath very long, you have COVID-19. Or that a vaccine from a lab only works on a disease created by a lab.\n\nSocial distancing has not come with social-media distancing. Over a century of science, we haven't gone back to the future, but ahead to the past.\n\n___\n\nLESSONS OF 1918 (and 1919)\n\nIn September 1918, as the Spanish flu's second and by far deadliest wave hit in the U.S., Philadelphia's public health chief disregarded advisers and let a massive war-bond parade proceed through downtown. The H1N1 virus raced through the masses in what has been called the world's deadliest parade. As officials insisted there was nothing to be alarmed about, people were seeing neighbors sicken and die with astonishing speed and mass graves being dug.\n\n\"It's just the flu\" had worn thin as the mantra of officialdom.\n\nLate that November, sirens wailed in San Francisco to sound the all-clear after six weeks of lockdown and tell people they could remove their masks. San Francisco, like many cities in the West, had been largely spared the first wave and spent the interval preparing for Round 2, mandating masks and jailing people who didn't comply.\n\nThey had a rhyme for that, too, of course: \"Obey the laws, and wear the gauze. Protect your jaws from septic paws.\"\n\nThe precautions paid off with a death rate lower than in afflicted cities elsewhere. But the city relaxed too soon.\n\nIn December, thousands of new cases erupted. A wave spilling into the new year was underway. San Francisco's death toll mounted by more than 1,000. It was the last lashing by the Spanish flu, and a less lethal one.\n\nThe brutal lessons of 1918 and 1919? To Barry, who was enlisted 15 years ago in a Bush administration drive to prepare all levels of government for pandemics, they are to respond early, relax cautiously, tell people the truth.\n\nInstead he has seen denial followed by a chaotic federal response and leadership vacuum as Washington and the states compete for the same medical essentials and now move fitfully toward reopening.\n\n\"Now we have plans, even war-gamed the plans, spent billions preparing for just what is happening, federal agencies have been tasked to handle all these things, and we get ... next to nothing,\" he said.\n\nNot even a jingle.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Colleen Long and Lauran Neergaard in Washington, Amanda Seitz in Chicago and Karen Mahabir in New York contributed to this report.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nIn Teaneck, N.J., half of the town's volunteer ambulance corps is out sick, in quarantine or staying home to avoid potential exposure to the coronavirus. The remaining 25 are responding to double the usual number of daily calls, racing from one high fever or respiratory distress emergency to the next.\n\nIn Rockville, a Maryland suburb of Washington, D.C., hit hard by the virus, more than 10 percent of the 160-member volunteer ambulance force has stopped taking shifts, either because they tested positive for the virus or because underlying health conditions have forced them indoors.\n\nAnd in a rural Iowa county with one of that state's highest infection rates, the Dysart Ambulance Service has just 22 volunteers who share two ambulances, cover 150 square miles and, in the first two weeks of April, responded to far more calls than in all of March.\n\nAs the virus has continued its spread into suburbs and rural towns, overwhelming hospitals and emergency medical workers, it also has taken a toll on scores of volunteer emergency response units, many of which are the sole responders in critical and urgent situations.\n\n\"Even if the worst-case scenarios from Covid-19 don't play out, you're going to have a lot of departments that are in a really difficult spot,\" said David Finger, chief of legislative and regulatory affairs for the National Volunteer Fire Council, which represents firefighters, Emergency Medical Services personnel and emergency responders.\n\nMore than 80 percent of the nation's 30,000 fire departments are all or mostly volunteer, responsible for providing emergency care to about one-third of the country's population. And while more than 60 percent of the fire departments across the nation provide basic or advanced life support, those in smaller, rural communities -- areas already dangerously short on health care and often dependent on part-time volunteers to transport patients to hospitals -- are less likely to offer emergency medical services.\n\nMany squads said in interviews this month that they were overwhelmed by the challenges. As they struggle to retain members, volunteer emergency response departments have also been hobbled by the cancellation of fund-raising drives that they rely on to keep the ambulances running and the station house lights on.\n\nThe financial shortfall is also complicating efforts to buy the gear needed to protects members from infection, they said. With training certification programs and recruitment drives also halted, volunteer corps are now worried about their ability to function long after the infection curve has flattened.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" said Jules Scadden, the director of emergency medical services in Dysart, Iowa, a farming community in Tama County, where an outbreak at a nursing home led to more than 230 positive cases and seven deaths.\n\n\"My folks are scared,\" she added. \"Your risks are so high in the back of the ambulance, and we have a minimum 30-minute transport time so we know we're back there with the virus.\"\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump says daily briefings are not worth the effort, as the White House considers firing the health secretary. Some states are moving to reopen. But the path ahead is far from simple. The U.S. conducted 1.2 million tests in a week, but experts say that is not enough. See more updates Updated 7h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nSome volunteers in Tama County have stopped taking calls because they are considered high risk or because they were told they would lose their day jobs if they continued riding in the ambulances, officials said.\n\nBut Jackie Obrosk, a nursing home dietitian, said she has no plans to end her volunteer ambulance shifts with the Dysart Ambulance Service. \"We're our neighbors' only line of defense between home and hospital,\" she said.\n\nThe volunteers are taking extra precautions -- wearing masks and homemade face shields, and putting masks on patients, too. \"You just pray that we're doing enough,\" she said.\n\nMs. Scadden said she also now requires members to take their temperature before entering an ambulance.\n\nIn Maryland, the pandemic is straining an already overtaxed volunteer emergency response system. Before the virus, the Wheaton Volunteer Rescue Squad in Montgomery County was among the nation's busiest ambulances services, said Gamunu Wijetunge, the squad president.\n\nOn nights and weekends, all-volunteer crews of nine handle emergency calls. They pull 12- to 18-hour shifts, and many of them are off-duty firefighters and medical professionals.\n\nAs cases continue to climb in Montgomery County -- there were more than 3,480 cases and 152 deaths as of Saturday, the second-highest count in the state -- the squad has tried increasing its dwindling ranks of 100 or so volunteers, Mr. Wijetunge said, while also barring dozens of recruits who have not completed E.M.T. training.\n\nBut he said the squad's efforts to meet minimum staffing requirements have been hindered by local competition: a children's hospital and a medical school that have told employees they cannot volunteer for shifts during the pandemic.\n\nMaryland's governor announced this month that people who had worked as E.M.T.s or paramedics in the past decade would be granted provisional licenses, a welcome relief for Eric Bernard, president of the Rockville Volunteer Fire Department.\n\nMore than 10 percent of the 160 volunteers have stopped taking shifts, he said. Some have exhibited coronavirus symptoms, but others are worried their underlying medical conditions could put them at greater risk.\n\nThe ranks have also been diminished by the loss of firefighters too busy with their day jobs and medical professionals forbidden from volunteering by their employers. Mr. Bernard fears those numbers will grow. \"We're nowhere near toward the end of this,\" he said.\n\nTo reduce the risks of contamination, the department disinfects the station house and its vehicles every four days. But maintaining social distancing is near impossible. \"When you have 19 people on a shift in the firehouse,\" he said, \"you can't be six feet away from each other.\"\n\nAfter weeks of searching, Mr. Bernard found nearby hotels to house members who needed to be quarantined or who wanted to avoid potentially exposing their families.\n\nWith recruitment drives and training halted, Mr. Bernard said he was also anxious about the squad's long-term viability. Like most volunteer departments, Rockville faces a high turnover and his recruits can no longer take classes or ride emergency vehicles required for certification. \"When you have a temporary pause like this, how do you recover?\" he asked.\n\nJacob Finkelstein, the captain of the Teaneck Volunteer Ambulance Corps, barely has time to dwell on the tragedies unfolding in his community, let alone worry about recruitment. Like so many of his squad members these days, he is usually in one of the corps' five ambulances, sirens screaming as they careen down the empty suburban streets to homes hit by the virus.\n\n\"It's all over town,\" said Mr. Finkelstein, 24, during a rare moment of calm.\n\nA proudly diverse community of about 40,000, Teaneck had recorded 932 cases of the coronavirus and 71 deaths as of last week, a higher rate per capita than New York City five miles to the east. The task of tending to the sick has fallen to the ambulance corps -- 120 unpaid volunteers who include Broadway stagehands and high school students -- which occupies a beige brick building by the freight train tracks that slice through town.\n\nThe dispatch phone rings constantly, as many as 28 calls a day, compared with the usual dozen or so, and the corps responds to every medical emergency, sometimes crossing into nearby towns in Bergen County, where private ambulance squads are overwhelmed.\n\nVolunteers handle more than a quarter of the state's basic life support calls, but some squads are refusing to respond to virus-related emergencies or have shut down entirely during the pandemic, said Barbara Platt, president of the E.M.S. Council of New Jersey.\n\nA dozen of Teaneck's ambulance corps volunteers have had virus symptoms, and at least five have tested positive. Some have infected family members, including a volunteer who was hospitalized for more than a week. Around 30 percent are not responding to calls because they or their loved ones have underlying health conditions. One lost his father to the virus.\n\nThe emergencies are a blur: a middle-aged man with shortness of breath; an older woman with virus symptoms who was dead by the time the ambulance arrived; a father, in respiratory distress, whose distraught sons wanted to help him walk out to the ambulance but who were too afraid of getting sick.\n\nCharles Levin, a 25-year-old member of the volunteer corps, understands that fear better than most. A month ago, after transporting a dozen patients with coronavirus symptoms, he developed a fever and breathing difficulties. He had planned to move out of his parents' house. Instead, he self-quarantined in the basement, but they got sick, too.\n\nNow that they have all recovered, Mr. Levin is back on ambulance shifts, eager to aid his town in its darkest hour.\n\n\"This is our community, and we need to help,\" he said.",

        "body": "SAN ANTONIO -- It happened early inside the cool, darkened cineplex, before Vin Diesel even had a chance to turn superhuman, as people sat munching popcorn and sipping sodas in their plush recliner seats.\n\nSomeone coughed.\n\nIf anyone seated nearby was alarmed, no one showed it. The cough sounded muffled: The moviegoer was wearing a mask -- part of the recommended etiquette of going to the movies in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nOn Saturday, three movie theaters in the San Antonio area became some of the first in the country to reopen, a move that worried some infectious-disease experts but was applauded by those who bought tickets and went to the show.\n\nSantikos Entertainment opened three theaters, offering discounted prices, a limited food menu, workers in masks and greeters who opened doors as people entered, limiting contact with door handles.\n\nThe theaters were showing older releases for $5, and at the Palladium, in an upscale shopping center called the Rim, business was steady -- low for a Saturday in May, but higher than what might be expected in a state still grappling with a coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 900 people, 48 of them in Bexar County, which includes San Antonio.\n\nTexas took a big step out of its coronavirus lockdown on Friday, allowing restaurants, malls, retail stores and some other businesses to resume operations, with strict limits on the number of patrons allowed inside.\n\nMovie theaters, like restaurants, were allowed to seat only 25 percent of their listed capacity.\n\nGrady McClung and his wife Rachel went to the 1:10 p.m. showing of the Christian movie \"I Still Believe\" at the Palladium, each wearing a mask.\n\n\"Yesterday was my birthday, so I got the first two tickets for the first opening of the first movie in the first movie theater,\" said Mr. McClung, 51, a project manager for a telecommunications company who lives in nearby Boerne. \"There's about 12 seats in a 150-seat auditorium. We're well spaced out.\"\n\nTo sit in a theater with dozens of strangers was a walk on the wild side of public health. But as the movies played and the plots thickened amid the crunch-crunch of patrons chewing popcorn, Hollywood was doing what it has done for decades: providing an escape, albeit masked and at a distance.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Warmer weather lures people outdoors, and protests continue over restrictions. 'We had to do something': Government will spend $300 million on surplus food. The race for a vaccine is compressing a process of years into months. See more updates Updated 25m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nMr. McClung and others at the theater said that before buying their tickets they had researched the steps the company was taking to keep people safe and were satisfied that they were not putting themselves at risk. Going to the movies, some of them said, brought back a touch of much-needed normality after weeks under quarantine.\n\n\"If you feel like you have fear, then that's perfectly fine, and you don't go out,\" Mr. McClung said. \"But other people need to get their lives back. We didn't go to movies all the time. I mean, probably five or six a year. But this was something that was right for now.\"\n\nAt the afternoon showing of the Vin Diesel action-adventure flick \"Bloodshot,\" moviegoers kept their distance, sitting two, three or four seats apart. Some wore masks, and others wore them in the lobby but took them off in the auditorium to eat popcorn.\n\nIn Row F, the company mistakenly put three guests in F1, F2 and F3, nearly elbow to elbow. F2 moved down to F7 to ensure social distancing.\n\nTim Handren, the chief executive of Santikos Entertainment, said the company was taking the safety of both employees and customers seriously and was going beyond the state's health requirements.\n\n\"We are following, we believe, the best guidelines that we can to open safely,\" Mr. Handren said in a YouTube message to the public.\n\nMasks were recommended, but not required, for customers. In the lobby of the Palladium, a masked worker asked customers as they entered whether they or anyone they had been in contact with had experienced fever, chills or other symptoms in the past 14 days. Signs warned that if the answer was yes, they would not be allowed to enter and the cost of their tickets would be refunded.\n\nCashiers stood behind plexiglass shields. At least 75 percent of the seats in each auditorium were left unsold. Many doors were left open so people did not have to touch them. The arcade games were shut down, and no cash was accepted -- those with cash exchanged their bills for gift cards.\n\n\"We're trying to minimize the number of touch points, where you could be interacting with, touching, things that we don't need you touching, or our employees,\" Mr. Handren said in the video.\n\nThe company had asked employees if they were comfortable returning to work before reopening, Mr. Handren said, and \"our employees have resoundingly said, 'We want to come back.'\" Santikos had furloughed employees and had kept its theaters closed for more than 40 days.\n\nMr. Handren said that the company would probably not make money off the low-capacity showings but that it recognized that people needed to get out of their houses and \"just go somewhere else.\"\n\nThat said, business was brisk: By the early evening, the Palladium had sold 800 tickets and was still getting walk-up customers.\n\nInfectious-disease experts said they worried that the decision by Gov. Greg Abbott to include movie theaters in the first phase of the state's partial reopening was risky.\n\n\"You're not going to catch me at a theater any time soon,\" said Dr. Diana Cervantes, an expert in infection prevention and control who is an assistant professor at the University of North Texas Health Science Center, a medical school in Fort Worth.\n\n\"When you think of what aids transmission, it is going to be the type of contact you have with the person who's infected, the length of time, proximity -- all of those factors come into play. The amount of time starts to be a little too prolonged for me to be sitting there with a bunch of strangers.\"\n\nJoe Garcia, 74, a retired military chaplain in a camouflage mask, said he had no health concerns. He printed out a copy of the theater's safety procedures and brought it with him.\n\nHe and his family have a long-running tradition: Once a week, they bring his 41-year-old daughter, who has cerebral palsy, to the movies, one of her major social outings. The tradition had been put on hold during the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nMr. Garcia, his daughter and his other daughter, Karla Ross, 51, went to the 4:10 p.m. showing of \"I Still Believe.\"\n\nIt was the first time in six weeks that Mr. Garcia, who lives in Blanco, had seen Ms. Ross, who lives in San Antonio, because Mr. Garcia's age makes him more vulnerable to the virus than others.\n\nFor their day back at the movies, he had no worries.\n\n\"We feel safe,\" he said.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nMy patients continue to have medical problems that are not related to the coronavirus. But now, when I offer recommendations -- especially those that possibly involve putting themselves at risk of contracting a Covid-19 infection -- they often reject my advice.\n\nOf course, my patients have a point. Not only has the coronavirus killed hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, it is especially stealthy and unpredictable, able to spread from carriers who have no symptoms. But when, if ever, should the fear of catching a virus, and one that usually causes a mild infection, outweigh the need to address urgent medical issues?\n\nThere is growing literature on risk in medicine. Studies consistently indicate that the actual risk of harm to a patient is often colored by perceptions of potential harm. For example, research has shown that women fear dying from breast cancer more than heart disease, although the latter is more likely to kill them. One reason for this discrepancy is the successful job done by breast cancer activists in drawing attention to the disease.\n\nDuring my interactions with patients, it is clear that some are far more worried than others about the same condition. At a recent clinic session before the coronavirus outbreak, I saw one patient who thought her blood pressure reading of 130/90 was so good that she could stop one of her medications. Another patient with a similar reading was so certain she was going to get a stroke that she aggressively lobbied me to add another pill. These patients had opposite views of the risk posed by their blood pressure, which was on the high side.\n\nMy job as an internist is, first and foremost, to know the science about hypertension, strokes and other diseases. But it is impossible to use a \"one size fits all\" model that merely uses data to guide my decisions. Patients are entitled to their own perceptions of illness and risk. When these opinions stray too far from the science, however, I push back hard.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The stock market rallied after promising news about an antiviral drug. Experts say rushing a vaccine is risky despite Trump's desires. The Los Angeles mayor says all residents can now get tested. See more updates Updated 5h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nGiven the above mortality data and the constant media coverage of the Covid-19 epidemic, it is hardly surprising that my patients are freaked out about possibly becoming ill. Most of them seem to be taking quite seriously the orders from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to stay home and otherwise socially distance.\n\nBut in several recent scenarios, I had to question my patients' judgment. For example, a diabetic man called to tell me that he thought he had an infected toe. My ears shot up. Foot infections in diabetics are notoriously dangerous and, if not treated quickly enough, can lead to amputation of feet and even legs.\n\nBecause my clinic is not currently able to see patients in person, I informed my patient that he needed to go to an emergency room. Fortunately, there was one fairly near his home. But he immediately demurred.\n\n\"Doctor, can't you just look up the antibiotic they gave to me last time and prescribe it?\" he asked. \"I'm afraid to go to an emergency room because I might get coronavirus.\"\n\nI tried to reason with him. \"You have an actual infection that could be very dangerous,\" I said. \"That is more worrisome than potentially getting a different infection, even though it is a scary one.\" Plus, I added that emergency rooms are doing everything they can to keep non-Covid cases apart from those who appear to have the new virus.\n\nWe went back and forth for a while, but I felt this was one of those occasions to vigorously push back. Eventually, he agreed to go. It turned out he had an abscess under his toenail that required drainage and antibiotics, exactly the type of infection that needs prompt treatment to avoid complicastions.\n\nIn another instance, I got a call about a man who was a kidney transplant patient on immunosuppressive drugs with a fever of 104. Although it was possible that he had a Covid-19 infection, he had no other suggestive symptoms.\n\nFever in a transplant patient is a medical emergency. Yet here, too, the patient and his wife were reluctant to go to an emergency room because they feared Covid-19 exposure. Fortunately, they eventually went, and the man was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection. Knowing the diagnosis, his doctors were able to prescribe the proper antibiotics.\n\nConcerns about risk persist among patients who likely already have a coronavirus infection. I recently got a call from a family member of a patient with multiple medical problems who had both a high fever and lethargy. She was not eating or drinking very much.\n\nEven though there were no respiratory symptoms, it sounded like coronavirus. Once again, I recommended going to the emergency room where they could draw blood, check her kidney function and possibly even do a Covid-19 test. But the patient and her family declined, preferring to try to treat her at home with Tylenol and fluids. Part of their reasoning was their fear of going to the hospital during this era of the virus -- even though the patient almost certainly had it and the family had thus already been exposed.\n\nNone of the above should suggest that for patients with non-Covid issues, it is business as usual. I am constantly in touch with patients by phone who have diabetes, high blood pressure and other problems, and I usually discourage them from coming into the clinic. The reality is that many necessary treatments and procedures will have to wait until the hospital reopens. We are also delaying mammograms, colonoscopies and other screening tests that we normally urge patients to get promptly.\n\nBut for emergency medical issues, fear of Covid-19 should not cloud the judgment of patients or their caregivers. If patients need to go to the hospital, they should put on a mask and gloves, stay as far apart from others as possible, and let the emergency room staffs do their job of saving lives.\n\nBarron H. Lerner, M.D., professor of medicine and population health at New York University Langone Medical Center, is the author of \"The Good Doctor: A Father, a Son and the Evolution of Medical Ethics.\"",

        "body": "With Pride canceled or postponed this year because of the coronavirus, many in the L.G.B.T.Q. community are missing out on an important moment of visibility and acceptance. We want to hear from them.\n\nFrom the first protests and parades in New York City 50 years ago to the celebrations that span the world today, Pride has always been about being seen -- not just by the L.G.B.T.Q. community but by everyone.\n\nBut this year, the coronavirus pandemic has put a halt on mass gatherings, and Pride events have been canceled or postponed in New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles as well as in Indianapolis, Charlottesville, Va., Birmingham, Ala., and more than 300 other cities globally.\n\nFor many, this means missing out on what can be a pivotal moment of visibility and acceptance: their first Pride.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure I was going to be very emotional on the day of Pride,\" said Marc Castenada, 25, who grew up in Texas and planned to join his first Pride in New York this year. \"I just imagined myself being overwhelmed with excitement, joy, a little bit scared, because it would have been something that I never experienced.\"\n\nWe want to hear from people like Mr. Castaneda who would have been experiencing their first Pride events. Tell us below what it would have meant to you and how you plan to celebrate in its absence.\n\nOr if you've been to Pride before, send us your recollections and photos, your thoughts about this year's cancellations and plans for alternative online events. (A reporter might contact you to hear more about your story.)\n\nFor Mr. Castaneda, a fund-raising coordinator for the L.G.B.T. Center in New York City who said he \"really struggled with my identity being in a small, conservative neighborhood in Texas,\" the cancellations mean missing out on a sense of connection and belonging.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 12, 2020\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nWhen will this end?\n\nThis is a difficult question, because a lot depends on how well the virus is contained. A better question might be: \"How will we know when to reopen the country?\" In an American Enterprise Institute report, Scott Gottlieb, Caitlin Rivers, Mark B. McClellan, Lauren Silvis and Crystal Watson staked out four goal posts for recovery: Hospitals in the state must be able to safely treat all patients requiring hospitalization, without resorting to crisis standards of care; the state needs to be able to at least test everyone who has symptoms; the state is able to conduct monitoring of confirmed cases and contacts; and there must be a sustained reduction in cases for at least 14 days.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nHow does coronavirus spread?\n\nIt seems to spread very easily from person to person, especially in homes, hospitals and other confined spaces. The pathogen can be carried on tiny respiratory droplets that fall as they are coughed or sneezed out. It may also be transmitted when we touch a contaminated surface and then touch our face.\n\nIs there a vaccine yet?\n\nNo. Clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Europe. But American officials and pharmaceutical executives have said that a vaccine remains at least 12 to 18 months away.\n\nWhat makes this outbreak so different?\n\nUnlike the flu, there is no known treatment or vaccine, and little is known about this particular virus so far. It seems to be more lethal than the flu, but the numbers are still uncertain. And it hits the elderly and those with underlying conditions -- not just those with respiratory diseases -- particularly hard.\n\nWhat if somebody in my family gets sick?\n\nIf the family member doesn't need hospitalization and can be cared for at home, you should help him or her with basic needs and monitor the symptoms, while also keeping as much distance as possible, according to guidelines issued by the C.D.C. If there's space, the sick family member should stay in a separate room and use a separate bathroom. If masks are available, both the sick person and the caregiver should wear them when the caregiver enters the room. Make sure not to share any dishes or other household items and to regularly clean surfaces like counters, doorknobs, toilets and tables. Don't forget to wash your hands frequently.\n\nShould I stock up on groceries?\n\nPlan two weeks of meals if possible. But people should not hoard food or supplies. Despite the empty shelves, the supply chain remains strong. And remember to wipe the handle of the grocery cart with a disinfecting wipe and wash your hands as soon as you get home.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nWhat should I do with my 401(k)?\n\nWatching your balance go up and down can be scary. You may be wondering if you should decrease your contributions -- don't! If your employer matches any part of your contributions, make sure you're at least saving as much as you can to get that \"free money.\"\n\n\"I just knew that I was going to be happy and accepted and be able to celebrate myself as well as everybody else,\" he said.\n\nFirst Pride Experience",

Do you use slang that is specific to your school or community?\n\nIn \"How Does a New Yawker Tawk?,\" Jon Caramanica writes about the #BestNYAccent challenge on Instagram and features videos compiled by Noah Throop and Shane O'Neill:\n\nWhat we think of as the distinctive New York accent is really a pool of accents, a stew that draws liberally from various communities: Italian, Jewish, Jamaican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Irish and many more. Slang might come from Yiddish, or it might come from hip-hop.\n\nBut what was most striking watching the videos en masse -- from every borough, from children and senior citizens, from dozens of ethnic and racial backgrounds -- was just how much of what we think of as the New York accent is not about sonic specifics at all.\n\nThe New York accent, as it were, is both music and ideology, instantly recognizable as sound and almost physically palpable, too. It's about the delivery, usually offered by someone leaning in to the conversation, some combination of excitement and bristly attitude. Sometimes it's about the liberal sprinkling of sounds and catchphrases, the salt and pepper on a conversation that actually becomes the dominant flavor. Sometimes it's the fluent cursing.\n\nMr. Caramanica shares some background about the contest:\n\nThe #BestNYAccent challenge was initiated by Nicolas Heller, a director of short films and a sort of unofficial liaison to New York City's ample pool of eccentrics. In January, he posted on Instagram a list of the 100 best New York accents of all time, a mix of the legitimately famous and around-the-way favorites: Nas, Rhea Perlman, Cardi B, Luis Guzm\u00e1n and so on. While recently sidelined with Covid-19-like symptoms, Heller decided to turn his preoccupation with the sound of New York into a social media challenge.\n\nThe contest received several hundred submissions and was viewed hundreds of thousands of times. Celebrities, trapped at home like everyone else, tapped in: Debi Mazar, Chazz Palminteri, The Kid Mero, Kathrine Narducci, John Joseph from the Cro-Mags and more. (No Rosie Perez, sadly.) Notionally, there was a winner: Charlie da Wolf, a foulmouthed septuagenarian from Williamsburg. But the robustness of the entries as a whole was revivifying.\n\nThe article continues:\n\nIt would be impolitic to say that the New York accent is the signature American accent. You could argue, though, that the New York accent is the accent of the current crisis. It's there in the burly roundness of the words coming out of Gov. Andrew Cuomo's mouth, or the acidity in the tone of Dr. Anthony Fauci, or the way President Trump scrapes all of his syllables together. (Senator Bernie Sanders's howling woof counts here, too.)\n\nFor New Yorkers, that's made the conversation around the coronavirus feel as local as the pandemic's actual impact. Watching the news can feel like watching quarrels between grouchy neighbors.\n\nStudents, read the entire article, then tell us:\n\nDo you think you have an accent? Do other people think you do?\n\nHow does your accent use tone, rhythm, tempo, slang and language? How much is your accent connected to your identity? Do you ever shift your accent, or way of speaking, based on who you are talking to or the setting you are in? What determines how much of yourself you show through your accent?\n\nWhat regional expressions do you use when speaking? Do you think your way of expressing joy, anger or frustration is unique to the part of the country or world you come from? How does that show up in the way you speak?\n\nThis article focuses on pride about having an accent, but sometimes people are made fun of or discriminated against for having an accent. How have you seen accents honored and revered? Have you also seen accents mimicked or used to make fun of someone? Do you think it is OK for someone to mimic someone else's accent?\n\nIn 2013, Josh Katz and Wilson Andrews created the \"How Y'all, Youse and You Guys Talk\" quiz, which produces a dialect map based on a participant's responses. If you have the time, answer the 25 questions and examine the dialect map generated for you. How accurate is your dialect map to where you live, where you grew up and where your family comes from? Are you able to trace the influences that show why you speak the way you do?\n\nStudents 13 and older are invited to comment.

        "body": "It's hard to believe now, as I write this, but just two months ago, when we were allowed to roam free, when we could board planes and alight from them and wander into rental cars and check into hotels -- when we could chase down and replenish the beauty and wonder our very cells need to survive -- I went to Los Angeles, where I was asked this question by Val Kilmer:\n\n\"Do you think South by Southwest will be canceled?\"\n\nBut Val Kilmer no longer sounds like Val Kilmer, the movie star of the '80s and '90s who has mostly vanished from screens. He hasn't since his tracheostomy. He can still squeeze air up through his windpipe, however, and past the hole that was cut into his throat and the tracheostomy tube, in a way that makes him somewhat understood -- not very, but somewhat. The sound is something between a squeak and a voiceless roar. He says the fact that I can understand him is a result of the endless vocal exercises that he was trained to do when he went to Juilliard after high school, that he was taught to work his voice \"like it was a trumpet.\" He hated the authoritarian rule at Juilliard while he was there; he hated those stupid vocal exercises. Now look at him, still using his most beloved instrument when really, by all rights, it should be useless. See how it all turned out for the best?\n\nAll Val Kilmer's stories are like that, told with that same dash of preordained kismet. He was traveling in Africa in 1994 when he decided to spend a morning exploring a bat cave; later that day, literally seriously that day, he was inspired to call his agent, who had been trying to contact Kilmer for weeks to see if he was interested in playing the role of Batman, now that Michael Keaton was hanging it up. Another story: In the days before he set eyes for the first time on his (now ex-) wife, Joanne Whalley, he dreamed that he met the woman he was destined for and woke up and immediately wrote a poem called, \"We've Just Met but Marry Me Please.\" Then right after that, he went to London, and while he was there, he saw a play, and Whalley was in it. He was so taken with her that he followed her to the pub after-party just so he could look at her. This was crazy even for him, so he made no move. But two years later, in 1987, she would be randomly coincidentally serendipitously cast opposite him in \"Willow,\" and they would end up married. So yes, he can talk, and it's such a miracle that he has these abilities, because if you have enough faith, you'll see how every part of your life is just a piece of a bigger part of your life, and nothing is an accident, and everything is good.\n\nWe were in his office at HelMel, an office space/art gallery/artists' studio/retail museum for Val Kilmer's movie career that takes up several storefronts and more than half the block of Melrose Avenue between Edgemont Street and Heliotrope Drive in Hollywood. Officially, according to Brad Koepenick, his childhood friend and adult business associate, who was in the room to help me better understand Kilmer, HelMel's mission is to serve as \"a fun, sacred space where eclectic artists gather with novices to collaborate, and through new technology, inspire change and spark giving in our local underserved community.\"\n\nOf its storefronts: One is a traditional art gallery. Another is a dark window display with three black cubes that say GOD stenciled in white paint, behind which is an inventory of merch from Kilmer's long and storied movie career -- socks that featured his \"Tombstone\" character, Doc Holliday, and Jim Morrison coasters from his role in \"The Doors\" and some paintings that Kilmer himself created, some of which are about his film career (a rendering of his \"Top Gun\" character, Iceman, with the word \"LOVE\" stenciled across it) and some that aren't (a hummingbird in a forest).\n\nThe final storefront is a door that leads to the Willy Wonka core of HelMel. Inside there's a podcasting studio, a cafe area and a screening room. HelMel also houses a foundation Val and Koepenick created called TwainMania, which aims to send its Mark Twain curriculum into schools. Twice a week, high school students from South Central Los Angeles practice \"Hamlet\" and other plays there as part of a program called Inner City Shakespeare. HelMel started holding events last February: a screening of \"Tombstone,\" an Echo in the Canyon concert. It is the creative incubator of Kilmer's dreams -- the fruition of a vision he had always hoped his 6,000-acre New Mexico ranch would be before he lost most of it in the 2008 housing crash. \"The idea is to create kind of a life that's active,\" Kilmer told me. \"It's active. It's alive. I want the feel of it being alive. You feel the electricity.\"\n\nHe sat at his desk. Behind him was a replica of a painting he had sold to Robert Downey Jr. and, on the other side, a maybe two-foot-tall Batman figure with a Mark Twain head. Elsewhere were Apple computers from the 1980s and 1990s dipped in glossy red paint, a tumbleweed bathed in gold paint. There was a box of newly shipped hardcovers of his new memoir, \"I'm Your Huckleberry,\" which debuted on the best-seller list in April, a brooding photo of the Val Kilmer of your 1990s matinee memories on its cover.\n\nOn the walls were more of his paintings, swishes of paint and resin and oil (and sometimes spray paint) on sheets of repurposed aluminum. He makes them by swirling around the chemicals and paint until they look like an emotion or an element to him, at which point he adds a photograph, solidifying his theory into fact. I stood and admired a rectangle of blue-gray haze that he had determined looked like ocean waves, and so he had added photos of swimmers, diving into the waves, one after another.\n\nOf all the projects going on inside the studio at that minute, it was a short animated film about Mark Twain that concerned him most. In it, Mark Twain falls asleep and dreams of the resurrection of Jesus Christ, resulting in his waking up and realizing that Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of Christian Science -- Val Kilmer is a lifelong Christian Scientist -- was correct about God's eminent perfection and the theories of Mrs. Eddy, as Kilmer calls her, about God's capacity to heal. Kilmer loves a lot of things, but two of the tops are Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy.\n\nKilmer wanted to debut the short at South by Southwest in a few weeks. It was early March. There were rumors that festivals and concerts and even air travel might be canceled. Kilmer believed that even if he and his team couldn't take an airplane, they could just drive to Austin and still screen \"Mark Twain Dreams of the Resurrection\" and, I don't know, will the festival into existence. He was undaunted by all the signs and portents that made it feel as if the world were dropping to its knees; he believed if he could get the film done and over to Austin, the rest would take care of itself. So when he asked me if South by Southwest would be canceled, I told him I didn't know. The surgeon general had started asking the public not to hoard surgical masks, and just that morning, Los Angeles had declared a state of emergency.\n\n\"You don't think we will be going to Cannes?\" Kilmer asked. \"How about the Olympics? The Olympics has never been canceled except in time of world war.\" You can't cancel the world, right? Bad things happen, but you still need art.\n\nAnd I thought: Right? Right! You still need art. You still need forward momentum. You still need to believe that all your effort wasn't for nothing, that we could -- we will -- survive a dark moment in history and that when that happens, we won't be left without the things that made those moments decipherable and meaningful and therefore tolerable.\n\nThe world outside had seemed to be getting so, so bad for so, so long, and this was the first whiff of overarching hope and positivity that I'd witnessed in I couldn't remember how many months or years now -- so much so that I almost couldn't identify it when I saw it. The last glowing embers of hope coming from Val Kilmer? The movie hunk of my youth, who disappeared unceremoniously and now presented with an entirely different appearance and a bizarre accounting of where he'd been? But there was something familiar about it, like a faint knocking that came from inside me: It was the special kind of optimism that maybe only the faithful have, the enduring belief that some force will come along and save us from the centrifuge of despair we've found ourselves in. When is the last time you saw that up close?\n\nBefore you can understand the story of what happened to Val Kilmer, you have to determine for yourself who he was in the first place. Trying to compare him to any movie star working either now or then will fry your mental circuit board: He was an upwardly mobile conventional movie star; he was equally a fringe weirdo who would soon disappear.\n\nHis first movie, \"Top Secret!\" (1984), about a rock star in East Berlin, was the follow-up to \"Airplane!\" by its creative team, and it was so funny, and such a strange thing to see this extraordinarily handsome young kid -- a jaw like the sharp-cut bottom half of a stop sign, that true-Swede golden hair, a Cupid's bow that lays in shadow of the plump convex swoop of his upper lip -- who also seemed to be in on the joke. The '80s were a time when a handsome young man with blond hair was mostly the butt of it.\n\nHe'd been on the road to something slightly more, say, classical when he was at Juilliard. He starred in \"Orestes\" and in \"The Wood Demon.\" He wrote a play with his classmates called \"How It All Began,\" which went on to run for a month at the Public Theater after Joe Papp himself saw it at the school. He starred in \"Slab Boys\" with Sean Penn and Kevin Bacon. He did \"As You Like It\" in Minneapolis with Patti LuPone.\n\nBut once Hollywood got a look at him, he was on too-fast a conveyor belt to safely step off. The success of \"Top Secret!\" begat a somewhat-starring role in \"Real Genius,\" meaning that his Chris Knight, the apathetic, irresistible prodigy who helps something laser chemical transmitter radio something, is the guy on the poster, but he's not the character with the clearest narrative arc; he's more of a wise fool in the Shakespeare tradition. Another hit.\n\nIdeas from The Times on what to read, cook, watch, play and listen to while staying safe At Home.\n\nThen in 1986 came \"Top Gun,\" and after that, everyone knew who Val Kilmer was. Because how could you not? Iceman, the fighter pilot Tom Cruise's Maverick is trying to best for the \"best of the best\" of the best position, has maybe 17 words in the whole movie, but it is there that you can see Val Kilmer's greatest gift, which is to make something out of nothing -- to breathe real life into a character who was only there to set the volleyball so that Maverick could spike it.\n\nIf you asked me then what beguiled me about Val Kilmer, I wouldn't have had the words for it. Instead, I would have pictured a man without a shirt (I am still hard-pressed to picture young Val Kilmer in a regular shirt), but it wasn't his body that stuck with me when the lights came on. No, it was his awesome physicality, him spinning that volleyball on his finger, him offering the most fraught '80s masculinity-soaked condolences ever when Maverick's radar intercept officer, Goose, buys it during a flight exercise -- there was something in his immense focus and his full-bodied commitment to just plain Being-in-the-Scene that took my breath away. I read somewhere that Kilmer was so dedicated to inhabiting the role that he created Team Iceman and Team Maverick factions in the \"Top Gun\" movie cast. What I also remember is Iceman's snapping his gum with his mighty jaw in nonresponse to Maverick's admitting that yes, he's dangerous. In that jaw snap -- which is my absolute favorite GIF to send to people -- there's so much more than a weird way to end a conversation: It's arrogance and pathos, frustration and whatever the emotion is where you know that laughing at someone will hurt them more than insulting them.\n\nThe next few jobs came relatively quickly: the crazed, greedy, delightful Madmartigan in \"Willow,\" shouting epithets at the hero of the story with a vitality and electricity that makes you somehow root for him; \"Kill Me Again,\" in which he plays a dumb investigator who becomes the mark of a con woman (played by his wife at the time, Joanne Whalley); \"The Doors,\" an Oliver Stone movie made extremely watchable by Kilmer's Method performance as Jim Morrison, so Methody and deep in the role, it's not so long into any kind of rewatching of that movie that I realize I can no longer remember what real Jim Morrison sounded or looked like. Then the beloved \"Tombstone,\" in which he once again went deep Method on the tubercular dentist, Doc Holliday, sweaty and yellow, gasping for breath through his puffs on his cigarette.\n\nIt was around this time that both Kilmer and his viewing public ran into a problem. If you're good at acting, and you're superhunky, and you look good with your shirt off and also are willing to take it off, you are an excellent candidate for a promotion, and so Val Kilmer leveled up. Pretty soon, he was cast as pure leads of what were or were designed to be blockbusters: \"Batman Forever,\" \"The Island of Dr. Moreau,\" \"The Saint.\"\n\nHe didn't do badly in any of those roles, exactly. It's more as if all the elements were there, but they couldn't unite to make a real person -- the whole was less than the sum of its parts. His Jack Andrews in \"Kill Me Again\" is supposed to be some kind of Everyman, but he's really the absence of a person, a body without a soul. In \"Thunderheart,\" Kilmer plays a regular-guy F.B.I. agent with some Native American lineage, and I couldn't really get through the rest. In \"Batman Forever,\" he barely moves his face, and well, here were the reviews: Janet Maslin in this newspaper said Kilmer was \"hamstrung by the straight-man aspects of the role,\" while Roger Ebert raved that he was \"completely acceptable.\"\n\nThere came reports of problems on sets -- that he was complaining constantly and making impossible demands; that he was rude to his co-stars and stayed in character all the time, never bothering with even small courtesies to the other people on set. That he fought with Oliver Stone about glorifying substance abuse in a movie that was literally about Jim Morrison; that Kilmer, committed to the Method even through casting, became too aggressive with a woman during an audition in front of Stone and the casting director as he became swept up in an emotionally charged moment. (The incident resulted in a settlement, though he maintains it was the actress who attacked him, and the casting director has said that both actors were physical with each other in the heat of this moment.) Joel Schumacher called him \"psychotic\" in an interview after directing him in \"Batman Forever,\" whose sequels Kilmer was supposed to star in. There are several different versions of why George Clooney replaced him -- Kilmer says it was because of scheduling difficulties with the other movie he had a contract for, \"The Saint\" -- but one factor was surely this assessment by its director. Multiple sources have claimed that on the set of \"The Island of Doctor Moreau,\" Kilmer touched his lit cigarette to a crew member's sideburn. (He claims this was an accident that resulted from the cinematographer's asking him to blow smoke from off camera very close to where a member of the camera crew was standing. \"What kind of person would singe a fellow worker he spends 15 hours a day with, often less than a foot apart? Madness.\")\n\nThis all begins to explain why it's hard to make sense of who exactly Val Kilmer was. His whole thing is telling stories, but at this point he didn't yet know which story he was telling.\n\nHe can put it all together now far better than he ever could back then. He'd had his pick of roles; he was being offered lucrative franchises. His talent was in doubt by absolutely no one. His gift was both so overt and so subtle that he was the most memorable part of the movies he merely supported. And yet suddenly he was radioactive.\n\nHe didn't know how to handle what was happening to him. He'd gotten into acting because he wanted to perform serious roles, but the bigger they came, the more empty and cavernous too.\n\n\"It was all silly to me,\" he said to me in his office. \"I'd been preparing to do 'Hamlet' for 10 years.\"\n\nHe always thought of himself as a character actor. He could do \"a hundred different voices\" and a million different impressions. \"I would've loved to have been on 'Saturday Night Live' as a regular,\" Kilmer said. \"Fame wasn't my priority, and I had it.\"\n\nIf you read his press around the time of \"Batman,\" all those interviews are mostly just him complaining about the suit; he liked to say he it was \"a battering experience\" because he loves wordplay. In interviews, he brought up Tom Cruise often, particularly his inclination for movies where instead of running from their oiled, volleyball-playing forms of yesterday, Cruise ran back toward them.\n\n\"I have very definitely had a different kind of career than Tom. You never know if a job has commercial success written all over it. I just think life's too short to worry about that.\" -- The Los Angeles Times, Dec. 31, 1993\n\n\"I have nothing against Tom Cruise, but he must have a large capacity to deal with the business side of movies.\" -- Details, June 1995\n\nInterviewer: \"How about Tom Cruise. You make fun of him sometimes?\"\n\nKilmer: \"You can't make fun of Tom Cruise. Poor thing.\" -- Interview, March 24, 2011\n\nMaybe he was jealous that Cruise was getting all those leads. Maybe he really couldn't take the leading-man pressure. Maybe he was burned out already from all that Methoding. But that doesn't seem right. The burnout theory ignores that he was still doing smaller roles on the side in the same magnetic way he had before: his Elvis-inspired cameo in \"True Romance,\" a movie in which he shines in a tiny role where they don't even show his face; his bank robber in \"Heat.\" Forget that amazing shootout sequence that everyone talks about; the movie's most mesmerizing moment is the 40-second microscene in which he watches a clerk verify that his fake license is real.\n\nNo, the problem was that he had been trained to inhabit any role he could find himself in; he just couldn't find himself in a normie, and by the time Kilmer came online as a movie star, normie roles were all there were, the '90s standard-issue regular guy in extraordinary circumstances. Kilmer's greatest roles were always supporting characters. The roles of troubled men with broken souls went to the other guys because who would believe that a guy who looked like him had real troubles or a broken soul?\n\nBut he couldn't reverse course and bow out, either. By then, he had been seduced by a lifestyle. Look at his face in a tabloid photo of him and Cher circa 1984. Look at the pride; look how much he enjoyed being on Cher's arm. It reminds him of something he heard once: \"God wants us to walk, but the devil sends a limo.\" He was invited to go to Toga by Tadashi Suzuki, whom he calls \"the Japanese Stanislavski,\" but he turned it down. He didn't want to say yes to Hollywood, but look at that picture again: How could you say no?\n\nBy the time he realized how miserable he was, it was too late. He tried to supplement these movies with other artistic endeavors that nourished his soul. He began working on a documentary about nuclear disarmament in 1983, when he was doing \"Real Genius.\" When he was filming \"Wonderland\" in 2003, as the porn star John Holmes, he holed up with Ali Alborzi, who had been a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Kilmer's friend the wildlife photographer Peter Beard, to photograph the set and then make collages of the photographs and pages from the film's script all over the walls of the Chateau Marmont, and also spill blood all over them, a complex art project I don't fully understand.\n\nHe took the roles, always imagining that when he had enough money, he could get out with enough to support both that giant Santa Fe ranch, with its animals and staff, and the artists he wanted to invite to it. \"I was gambling with being able to maintain the status, and I would've won my gamble, except for 2008.\" Not only did he lose his status in Hollywood, but the one spoil he escaped with, his ranch, lost half its value, and he was forced to sell most of it away. \"I just lost my home like a million other people. It was pretty awful.\"\n\nHis casting problem was solved for him when no one wanted to work with him anymore. The roles went to people who, presumably, were not known for unkindness toward movie crews; the phone stopped ringing. In his book, he sums up this period like this: \"In an unflinching attempt to empower directors, actors and other collaborators to honor the truth and essence of each project, an attempt to breathe Suzukian life into a myriad of Hollywood moments, I had been deemed difficult and alienated the head of every major studio.\"\n\nHe says this in an attempt not to apologize (clearly) but to make clear why he behaved the way he did. \"Everyone has to work out their own salvation,\" he told me. \"How to live and by what morality, and I found that the part that I feel bad about is hurting somebody in the process.\"\n\nHe remembered a story from his time as Batman. One day he was filming and about to take off the Batsuit when Warren Buffett and his grandkids came by. They wanted to see Batman, so Kilmer stuck around in the suit, but they didn't want to talk to him. They wanted to try on the mask and ride in the Batmobile. He understood then that Batman isn't meant to be a real guy. Batman is meant to be so anonymous that the person who is looking at him can see himself in him. \"That's why it's so easy to have five or six Batmans,\" he says now. \"It's not about Batman. There is no Batman.\" And so what kind of thing is that to play, a person whose job is to be as nonspecific as possible. He looked good in the Batsuit, but wearing it was torture. When he took it off, he was finally free.\n\nSee what he did there? See how it all worked out? That's a pretty happy ending to a sad story. The lesson here is Val Kilmer's perpetual lesson, that if you have enough faith -- if you can take the long view and remember that things will work out -- destiny takes over. I say that to prepare you for the story of what happened to his body, because if you think that turning the story of a blown-up career into a best-case scenario is impressive, wait till you see what the Val Kilmer story-optimizer does with cancer. So:\n\nBy 2014, he was living a life he loved. He was no longer under contract for franchises he couldn't put his heart into. He had some money, he had a place in Malibu, his kids nearby, and he could finally do what he wanted.\n\nHe began to pick the projects that mattered to him. It so happens that the animated short \"Mark Twain Dreams of the Resurrection\" is not the first movie Kilmer has made about Mark Twain. It's not even the second, and I've heard there's an additional screenplay for a feature-length script out there, too. But the main Mark Twain event is a film called \"Citizen Twain,\" and it was conceived as a live performance in which Val Kilmer dresses up as Mark Twain and does Mark Twain- and Christian Science-related stand-up comedy. Take a minute with that sentence. I went to see \"Citizen Twain\" one rainy Friday night at the College of Staten Island, a half-filled theater, which I remember a little like a fever dream. There's not a lot of marketing copy that can prepare you for its strangeness, and also its elaborateness, and also its sincerity, and also the delightful warmth of Val Kilmer, whom you will never see happier than when he is presenting this film of his -- though it started out as a half-filmed, half-live performance, it is now, in light of his vocal condition, a totally filmed performance that Kilmer merely introduces.\n\nThe subjects of \"Citizen Twain\" range from sarsaparilla to congressional representatives being idiots, from Mark Twain quotes to Mrs. Eddy quotes to quotes Val Kilmer only wishes either of them had said. Here he was, using his celebrity and his talent, along with some heavy rubber prosthetics -- Mark Twain was many things, but he was not a person who looked like Val Kilmer -- to finally do something he wanted, which was to work out for himself the relationship of two people he absolutely worshiped but who were at odds in almost every way. Samuel Clemens was a Christian and a rational man who seemed fairly appalled at Mrs. Eddy's interpretation of the Bible and its assumptions that healing from illness was something resulting from prayer, rather than medical treatment. He wrote a book about it called \"Christian Science,\" in which he clearly mocks all of it. But Kilmer believes he did this only because he was so drawn to it. With each project, Kilmer gets a little closer to making the universe conform a little bit more to what he wishes it were: a place where the two historical figures he loves most, Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy, are finally no longer polar opposites but magnetically aligned.\n\nVal Kilmer can't remember when it was that Mark Twain first re-entered his life. And he certainly doesn't know when he first realized that his life's work would be about trying to meld the visions of Mark Twain and Mrs. Eddy into one. And he certainly can't remember the year he started having symptoms of what other people (the ones with medical degrees who evaluated him) called throat cancer. Partly this is because he gets tired when he talks now, but mostly it's because it's hard to track time and mark space when you don't believe in them.\n\nAs near as I can tell, in 2014, as he was touring with \"Citizen Twain,\" Kilmer found himself in Nashville with a big lump in his throat. He was having a hard time swallowing. He canceled the show. He'd been having symptoms for a while and had woken up in a pool of his own blood a time or two back in Malibu. A doctor eventually told him it was throat cancer, or as Kilmer told me Christian Science calls it, the \"suggestion of throat cancer.\" Meaning that in Christian Science, \"the idea is rather than say I have it or possess it, there is a claim, there's a suggestion that this is a fact.\"\n\nHe knew the cure for him would be to work with his practitioner, Christian Science's version of a spiritual adviser, to pray his fear away so that his body would no longer \"manifest outwardly what can be diagnosed as a malady.\" Meaning it's not really cancer. It's just his fear expressing itself -- think of what he'd just been through losing all his land, reckoning with his career. He had to go away and pray to relocate his faith within himself.\n\nBut it wasn't so easy. He has kids, a grown son and daughter he had while he was still married to Joanne Whalley, and they're not Christian Scientists. His family couldn't let him go heal by himself; cancer, as they know it, is a thing that spreads. He relented. \"I just didn't want to experience their fear, which was profound,\" Kilmer said. \"I would've had to go away, and I just didn't want to be without them.\"\n\nHe had surgery that year, which was followed by chemotherapy and radiation \"that zapped my whole throat, and it's still dry as a bone\" and left him with the tracheostomy tube and a feeding tube. Shortly after, Kilmer was spotted wearing scarves, his head slightly askew, as if his neck couldn't properly hold it up. In 2016, Michael Douglas was doing a press junket after his own bout of cancer, and a reporter asked him about \"The Ghost and the Darkness.\" Douglas mentioned that Kilmer, his co-star in that movie, was suffering from the same illness he had suffered from. Kilmer denied this, posting on Facebook that he had \"no cancer whatsoever.\"\n\nI asked Kilmer why he said he didn't have cancer, when it seemed to me, judging by the fact that the thing he described is absolutely the treatment for throat cancer, that he perhaps definitely did.\n\nHe said, \"Because I didn't have cancer.\"\n\nI blinked a few times. \"They said I was denying that I had cancer, and when they asked me, I didn't have cancer. It was a bit like do you have a broken bone? And if you broke it in high school, you would say no.\" He continued: \"Suddenly suspect. I have had a bone broken, but why are you being so aggressive? I had a bone broken. It was broken in my leg. 'Oh, so you have a broken leg.' 'No, no, I don't,' I say. I did have a broken leg.\"\n\nIt's not exactly mind over matter. It is, he tells me, the lost art of Christian healing. \"\u2009'There is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so,'\" he said, quoting Mrs. Eddy quoting \"Hamlet.\" \"I prayed, and that was my form of treatment.\" The doctors did those other things, but it was the prayer that worked, he's sure. He is no longer suffering from cancer, he said. Or rather, he never was. No, he's suffering from something quite different. He pointed at his trach tube. \"That's from radiation and chemotherapy. It's not from cancer.\" His prayer, he said, was the true treatment; the medical response to cancer was the thing that hurt him. \"That 'treatment' caused my suffering.\"\n\nThe next day, Kilmer sat at a conference table in HelMel and opened up a red Igloo cooler and began to mix liquids together from various canisters before putting them into a syringe. He opened his shirt, uncapped his feeding port and injected the food into a tube. It was lunchtime.\n\nHe has no vices anymore. He watches all the food shows -- \"Top Chef,\" \"Chef's Table,\" \"Ugly Delicious\" -- yearning for the time he'll be able to eat again, though it has been years and he's not sure how much longer it will be. When it is, though, he said, making his arms into a food-shoveling gesture, \"I'm going to look like Orson Welles.\"\n\nHe's 61 now. He is still so handsome. His hair is still blond. His eyes are still the unimaginable green of Oregon grass right after the rain. His jaw is still the main event -- the nasolabial area of his cheek bookending the inferior jowl so that his superior jowl appears sunken and his face takes on romantic geological proportions. He was wearing a very heavy turquoise and coral necklace that his mother, who died last year, wore for 20 years straight, along with her turquoise bracelet.\n\nHe was never scared during his medical treatment, he told me; he never panicked. Right as he was graduating from high school, his younger brother, Wesley, who had received a diagnosis of epilepsy, drowned in the family's Jacuzzi. Wesley had been a \"supergenius,\" he said, a gifted filmmaker who made stop-motion animation ahead of his time. But Kilmer still talks to Wesley. Wesley shows up in his office, and they hash things out or trade ideas. His mother has appeared to him lately, too, as if \"she's at a party, saying how happy she is to be with her husband again and Wesley, my little brother, so happy.\"\n\nDeath isn't death in Christian Science. It's simply that humans have limitations, and one of them is that we perceive people only through our five senses. When a person dies, they aren't gone. They are just not showing up in our senses anymore. So if a Christian Scientist prays and still dies (according to standard definitions of death), it doesn't mean the prayer didn't work. As Kilmer said when he was dressed up as Mark Twain, all prayers work: \"It's just that sometimes we don't like the answer.\"\n\nSo how can you be scared of cancer when there's no such thing as cancer? How can you fear death when there's no such thing as death? The answer is you can't. \"Someone comes up to you and says you have only four months to live, and the concept of time is a human one. So, if you describe the divine concept of time, there is no time.\"\n\nHe's been off the trach tube a couple of times, though each time, he has a setback: a cough, a cold, a fever. But why all this talk about the time that fear manifested in his body? He addressed it. He made it through that, and now he's on the other side, and his life is finally what he wanted it to be. By the time I met him, he had taken \"Citizen Twain\" to more than 30 cities.\n\n\"I feel like I could not possibly be in a better place for attracting better and better roles,\" he said. \"If an actor is fortunate enough to do so, to steer their own course and own their own material, they control their own destiny, creating their own products.\" He talked about how Irwin Winkler and Francis Ford Coppola had each leveraged their wealth to get projects made. His slate these days is no different. \"I haven't picked subjects such as boxing, jealousy or uncontrollable madness. Mark Twain and Mary Baker Eddy are the subjects of the film I've dedicated 20 years of my life to, on and off.\"\n\nHe told me he's filmed five roles so far this year. The opportunities are coming in the way they do only when you're peaceful and not desperate about them. There's a \"Top Gun\" sequel coming out this year. Kilmer is in it. He's not allowed to say anything about the new \"Top Gun\" except that he's in it. And that instead of being enemies with Maverick, their relationship has changed. \"We're friends,\" he said. \"This time we're friends.\"\n\nAs I walked out of HelMel that day, Kilmer presented me with a gift: It was the abstract painting I admired the day before, with the swimmers diving into the waves. I told him I couldn't take it -- that Times policy was that I couldn't accept anything even close to this. I put it down. He picked it up. I put it on a desk. He told Brad Koepenick, who stayed with us until the end of the interviews, to carry it out to my car and not let me leave without it. So I took it and put it in the passenger seat with a seatbelt around it, just me and Val Kilmer's abstract swimmer art driving down Melrose, and honestly, I felt so good and so weightless -- spending the day with someone who doesn't believe in death is as fine an antidote to hearing all the stories of fear that were coming through the radio now as any -- that instead of passing Cahuenga Boulevard back to my hotel, I hung a right and went to the movies, the way I used to when I was young.\n\nI sat in the movie theater, watching \"Portrait of a Lady on Fire\" and thinking of stories Kilmer told me: about an accident his daughter was in, how she was walking and got hit by a car on Little Santa Monica and then thrown through a storefront window, but the storefront had been evacuated and so was empty, and even though she'd gone through the glass, she emerged unscathed; about a time he was driving to the airport from his ranch and a car wandered through the median, and he was going too fast to stop, and so his car went through this other car without colliding with it. He can still see the mole on the driver's neck as he went through him without causing material disturbance to either of their bodies or vehicles. These things happened because he'd been praying his whole life.\n\nBut the other thing he'd been doing his whole life was telling these stories, turning the way we are constantly walking along the edge of our imminent demise -- sure, imminent if you believe in time, demise if you believe in death -- and trying to make sense of what could happen to a person at any given moment: a religious person, a person who is trying to be good in the world. That his daughter could be hit by a car? That he could die on the way to the airport? That his reputation could be shattered? That he could have a hole in his throat? Who could blame a person who needed to make sense of the chaotic turns of his life with a story? But even more: What else was he supposed to do?\n\nWhen he told me those stories, I told him it was hard for me to imagine that a person could heal themselves or prevent certain disaster with prayer.\n\nHe said, \"It's not that difficult.\" When he said that, I realized that as the days had gone on, it had become easier to understand him.\n\nThe Times was calling for staff members to return to base and begin working from home, so I headed to the airport the next morning with my suitcase and my painting, which I promised myself I would mail back to Kilmer when I arrived at home. People were wearing masks on my flight and sanitizing the cups of soda they received during in-flight service, and I drifted off to sleep feeling bad for them.\n\nSouth by Southwest was canceled before I even landed. Cannes was postponed. Eventually, the Olympics were too. In the coming weeks, everything was canceled: school, outside, hugs. Peter Beard went missing, and Kilmer took a walk with Ali Alborzi, who was distraught. It was the longest walk Kilmer had taken in a long time, and he realized that two hummingbirds had been following him, had been following them for three days.\n\n\"Birds have always been a part of my family,\" Kilmer texted me. \"Being the harbingers of life and the story of death.\" He believed the hummingbirds had a message for them about Beard. By then, I thought, \"How beautiful.\"\n\nPerhaps we had created the coronavirus out of our fear and wickedness -- children in cages, the rich hoarding wealth; perhaps we had only the suggestion of a virus. I grew up with too many messianics in my household. I found this kind of thing too easy to believe, if only because it was more believable than the fact that in 2020, my young, healthy colleagues were in the hospital, the streets were bare, I was stuck inside my house and nobody knew how long that might go on for. For a few days, I stared at my beautiful painting, which I will absolutely return when it's safe to take a nonessential trip to the post office. It was so hard to parse all the fear that permeated society now -- what was real and what had come as a result of our own hysteria. During the day I'd think that it was the fear that was hurting us most.\n\nBut at night my husband would shake me to wake me up because I'd been crying in my sleep. More quickly than I could have imagined, the world took on the hallucinogenic quality of right before you fall asleep, when everything is outsize and nothing makes sense. The margins on my suspension of disbelief started to close in on themselves, and the borders of things began to diminish, and now the world seemed like a word you stare at so long that it becomes nonsense. I watched all the Val Kilmer movies again, but this time they struck me as representations of a world that never existed, that couldn't possibly exist: What is sweaty shirtless fighter pilot? What is dentist with tuberculosis? What is Downtown L.A. shootout? What is Batmobile? What is Lizard King?\n\nAmid all this, I received a phone call. One of my closest and oldest friends, Lydia, called me to tell me she had throat cancer. I had seen her a few weeks before, and she told me she had been having bouts of laryngitis. But now she had a diagnosis. It was Stage 0 -- it had not yet spread. I cried into the phone with her.\n\nBut also here I was, finding this out while writing an article about a man who had throat cancer. I called up Kilmer and told him about Lydia. I asked if he had any advice to give her. He did. Kilmer told me she could \"have a healing at any minute. It could happen right now, or when she's on her way to the hospital, or even while a doctor is operating on her.\" I called her and told her this, and it made us both giddy for some reason.\n\nBut then, a few days later, her surgery was postponed because of the coronavirus, and we aren't sure, even as of this writing, when it will happen, and now her cancer might spread. I felt stupid for trying to find meaning and hope in what was happening to Lydia; I felt stupid for trying to make this into a story for her and for us.\n\nIn just two weeks, the palm trees against the bright blue sky that hung over HelMel seemed like something I made up, as weird to think about as a Batman figure with a Mark Twain head. (Was that even real? I searched my phone and found a picture of it. Phew.)\n\nBy now I understood that the story I was telling about Val Kilmer, which I'd thought had been about a man's relentless faith and optimism, was really about reconciliation: the squaring of two opposing things into something we swear is true despite all evidence to the contrary. Your beauty can sentence you to misery; Val Kilmer uses a tracheostomy tube, but he can talk; his brother is dead but only to our senses. Mark Twain despised Mary Baker Eddy, until you can will him into a dream where he doesn't. God is good, and there are no ventilators. My beautiful friend has cancer, and the treatment exists, but it's unavailable to her right now.\n\nHere's the thing: Mark Twain, Kilmer's favorite storyteller, thought that storytelling couldn't (and shouldn't) try to capture an entire life, to draw its arc, to determine its meaning. He was suspicious of the kind of autobiography that Ben Franklin had done. He thought it should just be a mishmash of remembrances told not even in the right order lest a person be tempted to force a story into a certain direction and make themselves a more sympathetic character than they deserve. Here's another thing: I spoke to his daughter, Mercedes, who told me that she did have a miraculous recovery, but that a bone in her face had been broken and that she was in a wheelchair for a month and required major surgery.\n\nI spoke to Val Kilmer one more time. While we were on the phone, I stared at my painting, the divers diving in over and over -- What is HelMel? What is ocean? -- and I tried to remember how I felt when it was beside me in Los Angeles, in the passenger seat of the rental car. Kilmer told me that he and Alborzi were going to get in a car and drive to New Mexico, where he still has 160 acres of land. Meanwhile, Tom Cruise tweeted that the \"Top Gun\" sequel was moving to December, two of my colleagues were in the hospital and another's husband lay in his bed gasping for breath. I attended a Zoom shiva for a friend's mother, who was buried alone. Peter Beard lay in the woods, weeks away from being found. The Val Kilmer GIF snapped its jaw over and over forever in a text message. Lydia waited by the phone though she had not been told to expect a call, and Val Kilmer planned his road trip into the desert.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nA medical procedure doctors have used to treat novel diseases for a century has emerged as a focal point in the fight against Covid-19: convalescent plasma.\n\nConva-what-now...?\n\nConvalescent plasma is the term used for plasma that is removed from the blood of a person who has recovered from a disease, then transfused into a patient still battling it.\n\nYes, it sounds a little confusing. So allow us to break down everything you need to know about convalescent plasma -- and why it matters right now.\n\nOK, first: What, exactly, is plasma?\n\nLet's start with a little biology lesson. I promise it'll be fun.\n\nPlasma is the liquid part of your blood. It's light yellow, and made up of about 91 percent to 92 percent water. It accounts for around 55 percent of your blood, with the other 45 percent being red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets. (Platelets help your blood clot.)\n\nHere's why we're talking about it now: When your body is exposed to a foreign pathogen, your body's response is to produce antibodies, \"which are proteins that can bind to the virus and help to deactivate it, clear it from circulation and prevent it from invading the body's cells,\" according to Dr. Jeffrey Jhang, medical director of clinical laboratories and transfusion services for the Mount Sinai Health System in New York.\n\nThose antibodies -- your internal army working to vanquish foreign invaders -- are contained in plasma. And once you've recovered, or convalesced, from a given virus, those antibodies stick around in your plasma for a certain amount of time, ready to fight that virus if it comes back. That length of time varies, and each virus requires its own antibodies, meaning that SARS antibodies, for example, are powerless to stop MERS.\n\nBut here's the thing: Your soldiers can sometimes fight for other people. Doctors can extract convalescent plasma from a recovered patient, then transfuse it into a patient who is fighting the disease you recovered from. This means your antibodies may help that person's own immune system in its war against the disease by accelerating the time it takes to develop its own army of antibodies.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A $484 billion coronavirus aid package is headed to Trump's desk. McConnell rejects governors' pleas for aid as a 'blue-state bailout.' A death alters the coronavirus timeline. Did you already have it? See more updates Updated 17m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nHowever, before we get too excited, it's important to note that when it comes to Covid-19, we don't actually know yet if our antibody soldiers can fight for other people. More on that below.\n\nWait, that's crazy. Has this worked before?\n\nYes! Doctors have been using convalescent plasma transfusions to help patients fight diseases as far back as the Spanish Flu of 1918. More recently, the procedure has been used in patients with SARS, Ebola, H1N1 and more.\n\nThe name for this therapy is passive immunity. When you develop your own antibodies -- say, through a vaccine -- that's active immunity. But when you \"borrow\" them from another person via convalescent plasma, it's passive. This has been used when no other treatment options are available, and studies have suggested that it can help improve the condition of patients still suffering from various diseases, including H1N1 and SARS.\n\n\"Convalescent plasma has historically been used therapeutically and for prophylaxis\" -- as prevention -- \"typically in times when a new disease, virus, bacteria comes on the scene and we don't have any viral-specific therapies for that new or novel disease,\" said Dr. Erin Goodhue, executive medical director of the American Red Cross.\n\nWhat is particularly noteworthy about using convalescent plasma to treat Covid-19 is that the treatment has never been used as widely as is now being proposed, Dr. Goodhue said. This means that, for the first time, the medical and scientific communities will be able to conduct the type of rigorous studies of the procedure itself to better determine its effectiveness. That type of study hasn't been possible in previous uses of the treatment.\n\nIt is also used to treat burn, trauma and cancer patients -- a plasma explainer from the New York Blood Center calls it \"liquid gold.\"\n\nSo ... does it work for Covid-19?\n\nRemember when I said not to get too excited yet?\n\nAs we learned from our biology lesson earlier, once a person recovers from Covid-19, his or her blood -- more specifically, his or her plasma -- contains antibodies that can fight the virus. Since this coronavirus is novel -- no one had been exposed to it before this outbreak -- our bodies don't already contain the antibodies needed to fight it.\n\nThe medical community is racing to determine whether convalescent plasma will help those still battling Covid-19. But it's simply too soon to know conclusively whether it works -- the Food and Drug Administration only announced its initiative to collect convalescent plasma about a month ago. Some hospitals got a small jump on that, but it will likely be months before we have a definitive answer, experts said.\n\n\"I've heard anecdotes of some patients improving, but I don't have any results of any kind of rigorous nature to be able to share,\" Dr. Jhang said.\n\nDr. Goodhue echoed Dr. Jhang's caution in drawing conclusions, but said there are encouraging signs.\n\n\"I'm still continuing to hear positive anecdotal evidence,\" Dr. Goodhue said. \"But to balance that out, there have been some cases where it just hasn't seemed to work for a patient at all, unfortunately.\"\n\nStill, more convalescent plasma donations means more opportunities to study its effectiveness. As of Wednesday, about 35,000 people have reached out to Mount Sinai, in New York, to see if they are candidates; about 6,000 have been screened for antibodies; and more than 1,000 high-antibody producers have been identified. Mount Sinai has given plasma to more than 150 people and counting, according to a spokeswoman.\n\nThe Red Cross has \"distributed a couple hundred convalescent plasma products, and is projected to collect and process hundreds more this week,\" according to a spokeswoman. It is collecting donations at more than 170 locations nationwide, with more on the way. Thousands of potential donors have reached out to the organization, but less than 10 percent have met the F.D.A.'s eligibility requirements for donation.\n\nIs the donation process painful? Is it safe?\n\nThat's an easy one: no, and yes -- so long as you're OK with the prick of a needle.\n\nThe process takes between an hour-and-a-half and two-and-a-half hours. Though it's somewhat similar to a normal blood donation -- particularly the screening process during which donors are asked questions about their health history -- there are significant differences.\n\nIn a typical blood donation, a phlebotomist inserts a needle into a vein in your arm. That needle is connected to a hose, and that hose is connected to a bag. Your heart does the work here and pumps your blood into that bag, with the usual donation amount being about a pint.\n\nA plasma donation, however, is like a closed-loop system.\n\nIt starts the same as a regular blood donation, with a phlebotomist inserting a needle into an arm vein. But instead of your blood being pumped into a bag, it is drawn into a machine with a centrifuge, where the plasma is separated from the blood. The plasma is collected in a separate bag, and the blood that was drawn is returned to your body with a saline solution through the needle already in your arm. This process repeats a few times until the proper amount of plasma is collected, which varies based on weight. Side-effects are mostly similar to a normal blood donation, so you might feel a little faint or dizzy, but in most cases that's about it. (Your body will replenish the lost plasma in a day or two.)\n\nA single donation can result in two to four units of plasma, each of which can be transfused into an ill patient. Exactly what happens to your plasma after donation depends on where you donate, but it will undergo tests to identify transmittable diseases, per F.D.A. regulations. Eventually it will end up being used to treat Covid-19 patients.\n\nI've recovered from Covid-19. How can I donate?\n\nTo qualify, donors must pass normal blood-donation requirements and be symptom-free of Covid-19 for at least 14 days, and, in most cases, must have positive results from a test. (Other restrictions may apply, depending on the organization.)\n\nMany health care institutions nationwide are involved in plasma donations, including the Red Cross, so to find a location near you go to the website for the National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project or visit the Red Cross's website.\n\nI had Covid-19 symptoms and recovered, but was never tested. Can I donate?\n\nUnfortunately, probably not. The F.D.A.'s eligibility criteria include a positive diagnosis of Covid-19, along with being symptom-free for at least 28 days before donation; or at least 14 days without symptoms and a negative Covid-19 test.\n\nHowever, a regular blood donation is still an option. Check the A.A.B.B. (formerly the American Association of Blood Banks) locator, visit the Red Cross website or call (800) RED-CROSS. You can also find information through the America's Blood Centers website, or call (202) 393-5725.",

If you envision a race that is over quickly and without pain, you are setting yourself up for unnecessary frustration.

Their findings, published in BMJ, zeroed in on the importance of expectations. \"If expectations are unrealistically high, they could be the basis of disappointment and low satisfaction,\" wrote the authors. \"While the Danes are very satisfied, their expectations are rather low.\"\n\nMy creative partner Steve Magness, formerly an elite distance runner and now coach to professional marathoners, says that \"when you go into a race expecting it to be difficult, you can always be pleasantly surprised, which helps performance. But when you go into a race expecting it to be easier than it will be, the moment it becomes hard, you quickly spiral into panic, losing your ability to bounce back and run a good race.\"\n\nThe point is this: If you know something is going to be a protracted grind -- and you go into it with that expectation -- odds are you'll feel a lot better throughout the entire ordeal. Also understand that there will be highs and lows. Your job is to stay present throughout them, so you can respond, not react. When the highs occur, tell yourself: \"This is what is happening right now.\" When the lows occur, say the same thing: \"This is what is happening right now.\"\n\nWhen the best endurance athletes hit low points, they take productive action -- eat, drink, adjust their plan as needed -- and then they keep going. They also replace negative self-talk with kindness.\n\n\"If you are kind to yourself, most of the time you'll get through the dark spot in a better mood and without wasting precious energy ruminating,\" says seven-time mountain bike world champion Rebecca Rusch.\n\nIt is good to understand the goal down the road. But you've got to run the mile that you're in.\n\nPacing\n\nA common mistake among novice endurance athletes is when they notice they are feeling good early in a long race, they start moving faster, only to implode in the later miles. Veteran athletes, on the other hand, know the importance of showing restraint, even -- and perhaps especially -- when things are going well.\n\nYou've got to go slow to go fast. If you try to do too much too soon or overexert yourself at the beginning of a long haul, you usually pay for it later.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Modelers find that tens of thousands of U.S. deaths could have been prevented. All 50 states have begun to reopen, but vast discrepancies remain. Scientists express cautious optimism about developing a vaccine quickly. See more updates Updated 1h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nMario Fraioli, a 2:27 marathoner and writer of the popular running newsletter \"The Morning Shakeout\" explains: \"A successful marathon, regardless of what speed you are running at, is the person who slows down the least. You can't get too confident too early. You don't want to make big moves until close to the end, when you feel you've done everything right.\" Even then, he says, it cannot be a big surge. \"You've got to slowly chip away, very gradually increasing the pace.\"\n\nProcess (Over Outcome)\n\nA goal of finishing an Ironman triathlon is thrilling and energizing -- until you realize how hard it is to actually complete one. Focusing too heavily on the end game can demoralize and de-motivate you from the steps you need to take today to accomplish it.\n\nFocusing on the process means breaking a goal down into its component parts, and then concentrating on tackling those parts. It's a mechanism that keeps you in the here and now, even during the pursuit of distant goals. Studies show that a process mind-set creates regular opportunities for little victories, which can help sustain the motivation required to accomplish long-term goals.\n\n\"There is so much outside of your control in a race -- how the competition does, the weather, and to an extent how your body feels,\" says Magness. \"That's why it is so important to stay focused on what you can control in the race, things like your pacing, outlook and response to external forces. It's OK to keep the end goal in mind, but you've got to run the race mile by mile.\"\n\nPurpose\n\nIn 2017, shortly after Shalane Flanagan became the first American woman to win the New York City Marathon in over 40 years, I asked her what kept her going in the later miles of the race, when she was fighting through the proverbial \"wall\" that so many distance runners hit. She told me that she kept thinking about three things: her husband, who sacrificed so much so that she could pursue her dreams; the women she trains with; and the young girls watching on television across the country.\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 36 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\n\"I wanted to win for them,\" she said. \"Reflecting on this gave me the strength to keep going.\"\n\nFatigue has both physical and psychological components. Exercise science research shows that we constantly weigh our physical perceptions of effort associated with an activity (i.e., how hard something feels) against our motivation to do that activity. When perception of effort is greater than motivation, we slow down or ease up until the two are balanced.\n\nIt follows that the more motivated we are, the greater the perception of effort we are willing to tolerate. And when it comes to increasing motivation, studies show that doing something for others is generally far more effective than traditional incentives like money or reputation. The less we are consumed with ourselves, the more willing we are to do hard things for others.\n\nTake Meb Keflezighi, who, in 2014, became the first American to win the Boston Marathon in over 30 years. He credits his incredible performance to the inspiration he felt while running for those who had died in the terrorist attack the year before. He even wrote their names on his race bib. Representing both the victims of the prior year's attack, but also as the top American in the race, he ran with greater purpose and motivation.\n\n\"Toward the end I was remembering the victims who passed away,\" he said. \"They helped carry me through.\"\n\nPerhaps more than anything, we all need to remember, and keep remembering, that we are all in this together. Our shared purpose -- along with patience, pacing and focusing on taking productive actions throughout the process -- will help to fend off fatigue and despair and carry us through.\n\nBrad Stulberg (@Bstulberg) writes and coaches on performance and well-being.

        "body": "The new inflammatory disease is scary but thankfully rare and easy to spot.\n\nFor parents, one of the most reassuring aspects of the coronavirus has been that it largely spares children, only causing mild symptoms. But recent reports of a new life-threatening pediatric inflammatory syndrome are worrying many families. Children in Europe, Britain, and now the United States are being hospitalized for this mysterious illness, which can harm kids's hearts and other organs, often requiring intensive care.\n\nAccording to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, as of May 12, New York was investigating 102 cases of this syndrome and three deaths, and cases have been reported in 14 other states so far as well. Thankfully, this new syndrome is still quite rare and it is treatable, and most kids who develop it fully recover. Here's what parents need to know and what they should do if they're concerned about their children's health.\n\nDoctors suspect Covid-19 is involved, but they aren't certain.\n\nNo one knows for sure whether this new syndrome, which is now being called pediatric multysystem inflammatory syndrome, or P.M.I.S., is linked to the coronavirus, but many doctors think so. \"I do think that this is related to Covid,\" said Dr. Eva Cheung, M.D., a pediatric cardiologist and critical care specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, which has treated more than 35 patients so far with the syndrome.\n\nThe vast majority of children who've fallen ill in New York have either tested positive for active Covid-19 infection or have had antibodies suggesting that they were exposed to the virus at some point. A few kids have tested negative for both active infection and antibodies, and it's unclear what that means. It's possible that these negative tests were inaccurate, Dr. Cheung said, because many coronavirus antibody tests are unreliable.\n\nWhat's interesting, though, is that most of the children who've gotten sick -- even those whose tests indicated prior coronavirus exposure -- did not report having a recent respiratory illness. This suggests that these children were either exposed to the coronavirus but didn't get sick, or that they had very mild symptoms, said Dr. George Ofori-Amanfo, M.D., the division chief of pediatric critical care medicine at Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital.\n\nEven if Covid-19 is involved, it's unclear what happens to make these children so sick.\n\nDr. Ofori-Amanfo suspects that children who develop this syndrome were exposed to the coronavirus, and that their bodies for some reason mounted an exaggerated -- and ultimately dangerous -- immune response, much like the \"cytokine storms\" that have caused some adults to fall quite ill in the later stages of infection.\n\nThey may \"have an abnormal and aggressive immune response to Covid -- and that immune response is so aggressive that it affects other organ function and affects their ability to maintain their blood pressure,\" Dr. Ofori-Amanfo said. This may then cause their bodies to go into rapidly progressive shock, requiring medications and, in rare cases, the use of life support to take over the job of their heart and lungs.\n\nStill, doctors stress that no one yet knows for sure what is going on. \"We don't even exactly know what this disease is,\" said Dr. Rebecca Pellett Madan, M.D., an associate professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine.\n\nThe syndrome has been compared to several known conditions, but it's probably new.\n\nWhen it first arose, many doctors noticed that this new syndrome had features similar to Kawasaki disease, a rare condition that typically afflicts children under 5, causing their blood vessels to become inflamed. But although its symptoms are similar, and both are conditions marked by widespread inflammation, most doctors do not think this current syndrome is the same thing as Kawasaki. \"They may share features,\" Dr. Cheung said, but \"I truly do think that this is its own syndrome.\"\n\nThe pediatric inflammatory syndrome also looks a lot like toxic shock syndrome, which occurs when the body goes into shock because it has been exposed to toxins released during bacterial infections. But Dr. Ofori-Amanfo said that none of Mount Sinai's patients had evidence of a bacterial infection in their body, so it was likely that the pediatric inflammatory syndrome, again, looked similar to toxic shock syndrome but was not actually the same thing.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. The U.S. will reconsider its W.H.O. membership, president says. Trump says he is taking hydroxychloroquine, an unproven drug against the virus. Steven Mnuchin and Jerome Powell will face the Senate over emergency lending programs. See more updates Updated 12m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York The symptoms are noticeable and serious.\n\nThe good news is the new pediatric inflammatory syndrome is easy to spot -- its symptoms are serious enough that parents should be able to notice them. All patients developed a fever of 101 or higher that didn't go away, said Dr. James Schneider, M.D., a pediatric critical care specialist at Cohen Children's Medical Center in Queens, which has treated more than 40 patients so far with the syndrome. Dr. Cheung agreed, adding that kids with temperatures of 99 or 100 probably aren't at risk. \"That is not what we've seen here. The patients that we've seen that have needed admission to the hospital have had pretty moderate to high fevers,\" she said.\n\nMost kids also develop serious abdominal pain that get progressively worse over time. It's not a garden-variety kids' stomach ache; it's serious pain that is often accompanied by vomiting and diarrhea and is \"severe enough for the parent to be worried,\" said Dr. Ofori-Amanfo. For some kids, the pain has been so bad that parents and doctors assumed the child had appendicitis and needed surgery, said Dr. Nadine Choueiter, M.D., a pediatric cardiologist at the Children's Hospital at Montefiore in the Bronx.\n\nMany kids with the syndrome -- but not all -- develop rashes, too. The rashes are red and often appear on the hands, forearms and chest, Dr. Ofori-Amanfo said, although they can appear anywhere. They typically turn white when you press on them, and then turn red again when you stop. They also usually cover a large area -- a child's entire face, for instance, or a substantial part of their arms or legs. \"It's not like a tiny speck of a rash. It's pretty diffuse,\" Dr. Cheung said.\n\nKids with the syndrome sometimes also have red eyes, cracked lips, a sore tongue, swollen hands and feet and they might complain of muscle soreness and not want to walk. But these symptoms are not as common as the fever and abdominal pain, doctors said, and some of the symptoms may come and go. \"Sometimes the skin and the eye findings kind of wax and wane to the point that one doctor will go in the room and say 'I saw a rash,' and then another doctor goes in the room three hours later and the rash is entirely different,\" Dr. Choueiter said.\n\nDoctors haven't identified any conditions or medical histories that put children at risk for the syndrome -- except for coronavirus exposure.\n\n\"All our patients have been previously healthy patients, with no underlying illnesses,\" Dr. Ofori-Amanfo said. Some of the kids who developed the syndrome even had multiple siblings who remained perfectly healthy.\n\nDoctors are also seeing the syndrome in both sexes, but \"we are seeing it in slightly more boys than girls -- like 60 percent boys, 40 percent girls,\" Dr. Choueiter said. The age range is wide, too; the Children's Hospital at Montefiore has seen the syndrome in kids from 5 months to 20-years-old. It has not been observed in adults.\n\nThe one thing that clearly puts children at risk is living in an area with a lot of Covid-19 cases. But again, because kids who get sick with the syndrome didn't necessarily have any Covid-19 symptoms, it can be hard for parents to know if their children might be at risk.\n\nIf your child develops a fever and seems unwell, contact your pediatrician.\n\nIf you child has a persistent fever above 101 -- and especially if they develop other symptoms consistent with the syndrome, like a bad stomach ache -- contact your pediatrician. \"Ask to speak to them over the phone or do a telemedicine visit and have your pediatrician walk through the steps of what to look for,\" Dr. Pellett Madan suggested. Dr. Cheung agreed, noting that in geographical areas where this syndrome has appeared, hospitals are making sure that local pediatricians know what to look for and what to do.\n\nIf your child has a fever but is in good spirits and is eating and drinking and not complaining about pain, you don't need to rush them to the emergency room, but again, stay in touch with your doctor. On the other hand, if your child really seems unwell -- isn't eating or drinking, doesn't want to move much and especially if they develop a rash or red eyes along with a high fever -- it's not a bad idea to go directly to the E.R., Dr. Pellett Madan said.\n\nRemember that this syndrome is rare, and that most kids recover.\n\nIt's estimated that hundreds of thousands of children around the country have contracted the coronavirus, and the vast majority only have very mild symptoms. This serious syndrome is \"still a very rare occurrence,\" Dr. Schneider said. Your child is probably going to be fine.\n\nEven the few kids who do go on to develop this inflammatory syndrome usually get better. \"Some of them don't even go to the intensive care unit. They're with us for a few days, less than a week and they go home,\" Dr. Choueiter said. They're typically treated with what's called \"supportive care\" to ease their symptoms: They might get fever reducers to lower their temperature, IV fluids to keep them hydrated, medications to increase blood pressure if it drops, and steroids or other drugs to quell the inflammation. Ultimately, \"most of these children do fine,\" Dr. Choueiter said.\n\nMelinda Wenner Moyer is a mother of two and a science journalist who writes for Slate, Mother Jones, Scientific American and O, The Oprah Magazine, among other publications.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nFor all the attention to the science and politics of the coronavirus, another factor may be just as important in shaping life under the pandemic: the ways that people will change in response to it.\n\nChanges in how we think, behave and relate to one another -- some deliberate but many made unconsciously, some temporary but others potentially permanent -- are already coming to define our new normal.\n\nThis crisis may have little precedent, but there are certain patterns in how people and communities behave when thrust into long periods of isolation and danger.\n\n\"It was the first winter that you realized that this is going to last, this is your life,\" Velibor Bozovic recalls of the 1990s siege of Sarajevo, which brought life to a halt in that Bosnian city. \"And somehow you live. Just like people are adapting to the situation now.\"\n\nDuring the nearly four-year siege, people's sense of community, memory and even time all transformed, he said. Now, Mr. Bozovic and other survivors are already sensing echoes of that time in the slow-rolling pandemic, which is anticipated to last, barring a miracle, perhaps one to two years.\n\nResearch on the effects of epidemics and sieges, along with the emerging body of knowledge about the coronavirus, hint at what the coming months may look like.\n\nOur ability to focus, to feel comfortable around others, even to think more than a few days into the future, may diminish -- with lasting consequences. But we may also feel the tug of a survival instinct that can activate during periods of widespread peril: a desire to cope by looking out for one's neighbors.\n\n\"We are incredibly capable to adapt to any kind of situation,\" Mr. Bozovic, now a professor of photography in Montreal, said. \"No matter how bad it is, you adapt. You live your life as best you can.\"\n\nA World of Half-Closures and Intermittent Lockdowns\n\nUntil the virus is subdued either by a vaccine or by a global campaign of strategically coordinated lockdowns -- which one Harvard study estimated would take two years to work -- daily life is likely to be defined by efforts to manage the pandemic.\n\nThere is no master formula. But suggestions from public health experts tend to follow a pattern.\n\nLarge gatherings may remain rare. A report led by Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, said gatherings should be limited to 50 people or fewer.\n\nLatest Updates: Global Coronavirus Outbreak Combination of virus and oil glut yields chaos worldwide. Missouri files a lawsuit against China, blaming the country for the virus and seeking billions in damages. An Indonesian village was locked down, but 15,000 students, some infected, had already left.

It would rule out a full return to commuting by public transit. Many malls, gyms, restaurants, bars and places of worship might remain fully or partly closed. So would many offices and factories.\n\nTravel is likely to remain tightly restricted, particularly as societies that have controlled their outbreaks seek to keep new ones from breaking out.\n\nThere may be times and places where restrictions ease, either because cases have dropped off locally or in response to political or economic pressures. But as long the virus persists somewhere in the world, the threat of new local outbreaks, and a return to lockdown, will remain.\n\nWith conflicting messages coming from government officials, much of the day-to-day burden of deciding which behaviors are worth the risk will fall on regular people. Even if officials authorize the reopening of shops, for example, neither employees nor customers will return if they consider it prohibitively unsafe.\n\nGrasping for Control\n\nAs forces beyond our control, and perhaps even our understanding, dictate our day-to-day lives, the rules and norms may change rapidly.\n\n\"Loss of control of one's routines, sense of normalcy, freedom, face-to-face connections and so on\" defined much of people's experiences during the 2003 SARS epidemic, said Sim Kang, a psychiatrist at Singapore's Institute of Mental Health.\n\nStudies from the SARS, Ebola and swine flu outbreaks all recorded near-universal spikes in anxiety, depression and anger. But they also found behaviors focused on regaining a sense of autonomy and control increased as well: people reported working on their diet or hygiene, or reading more news.\n\n\"People, during times of prolonged, radical change, end up changing,\" said Luka Lucic, a Pratt Institute psychologist who studies the effects of war.\n\nHis study of Sarajevo siege survivors, for example, found that many had a super-heightened sense of spatial awareness -- a skill for evading bullets or bombs that they carried with them throughout life. And mask wearing remains widespread in societies hit by the SARS and MERS epidemics, even for routine colds.\n\nWhen the coronavirus outbreak is under control, aversion to strangers or large groups, and the threat of infection they could pose, might echo in our minds for years.\n\nMr. Bozovic, the Sarajevo survivor, recalled, as a metaphor for deeper changes, a street near his home that was often targeted by snipers. He avoided it during the war -- and, to his surprise, well after.\n\n\"I don't think I walked that street for months,\" he said. \"That lingers, that stays. And I'm sure it's going to be the same now.\"\n\nWhile deeper shifts are difficult to predict, he added, one seemed obvious: \"I think it will profoundly change how we interact physically with other people.\"\n\nSocial Animals\n\nThe greatest psychological shift amid widespread crisis may be toward what is termed \"prosocial behavior\" -- checking in on neighbors, caring for the needy, cooking for friends.\n\nEarly humans, trapped in a hostile environment, thrived when they cooperated, typically in groups of a few hundred.\n\nNow, as we are once again besieged by nature and isolated into small communities, our survival instincts are re-emerging.\n\nDuring the SARS epidemic, Dr. Sim said, people looked out for one another in ways they might not have done before. They are doing so again now, even in Singapore, a city known for capitalist striving and competition.\n\nThose changes in thinking, he added, can reflect not just in-the-moment altruism but deeper emotional growth that can outlast a crisis.\n\nDipali Mukhopadhyay, a Columbia University political scientist who studies how societies cope during conflict, said, \"All the different ways that people create solidarity in a crisis get activated.\"\n\nIn Daraya, a long-besieged suburb of Damascus, Syria, Dr. Mukhopadhyay found networks of charity and mutual support stronger than in many peacetime societies.\n\nNow, she said, she's seeing similar behaviors forming in New York, where, as in other stricken cities, neighborhoods are reorganizing around local support groups as people instinctively shift toward thinking in terms of their immediate community.\n\nResilience Through Acceptance\n\nIn the first stages of an epidemic, Dr. Sim said, people feel torn between wanting to resist their new reality, or adapt to it. They may torment themselves trying to preserve normalcy, or counting down the days to its return -- as many are now.\n\nLiberation, survivors say, comes only through accepting what many would find unthinkable in calmer times: You, as an individual, have little control over the forces upending, and at time threatening, your life.\n\n\"That's how people in Afghanistan live all the time,\" Dr. Mukhopadhyay said. \"It's an assumption that you have no idea how things are going to be tomorrow. And something terrible probably happened yesterday.\"\n\nAs a result, she said, \"People live in the moment.\"\n\nPlanning tends to be tentative and short-term. People cultivate moments of joy when danger recedes, knowing it might not last. Violence and disruption remain painful, but at least there is no expectation of normalcy or control to shatter. Pain runs deep, but so does resilience.\n\nIn the months of pandemic ahead, that may mean planning events like concerts or weddings only days or weeks out, as restrictions lift, knowing they could return at any moment. Travel, business opportunities, even relationships might grow more opportunistic and short-term.\n\n\"That to me is what it means to be resilient,\" Dr. Mukhopadhyay said. \"It's to be adapting and accommodating, rather than resistant to, the suffering. I think that's what it is to live through hardship for sustained periods of time.\"\n\nDeep Scars\n\nIn past crises, researchers find, the deepest traumas surfaced only after they had ended.\n\n\"The thing we know from war and trauma is that the trauma is well contained whilst you're doing the fighting, but the problems occur afterward,\" said Stephen Blumenthal, a London-based psychologist.\n\nUntil then, it can come out other ways.\n\nPeople may struggle to regulate their emotions, finding anger and panic come more easily. There could be upticks in insomnia and substance abuse.\n\nIn 2006, Mr. Bozovic suddenly developed symptoms of post-traumatic stress that had waited over a decade to emerge -- a cautionary tale, he said.\n\n\"We're all going to live with this somehow,\" he said. \"I don't know how those anxieties will translate, but they will be there.\"\n\nThis was a common prediction among survivors. We may surprise ourselves with how easily we return to many activities. But a year or more of fearing physical contact could alter something fundamental.\n\n\"That anxiety will linger for a long time, and it will profoundly change how people interact for a long time,\" Mr. Bozovic said. \"Maybe forever.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAs states across the country weigh options for reopening after weeks of stay-at-home orders, antibody tests have emerged as a potential pathway on how -- and when -- to do it.\n\nBut there are many caveats, as a recent study found that many of the antibody tests available currently provided inaccurate results.\n\nAntibody tests look for signs in the blood that a person has been exposed to the novel coronavirus. Knowing who has been exposed, along with how many people have been, may help to better understand the spread of the virus. This is especially important as studies continue to show that significant percentages of all coronavirus carriers -- in some studies, up to half -- show no symptoms at all.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration in the United States said this month that \"the question of when we can return to work and resume our normal activities is one of the most critical issues facing our nation. Antibody tests -- also known as serological tests -- may have the potential to play a role in this complex calculation.\"\n\nBut should you get one? Can you get one? What do they actually tell us? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nWhat is an antibody test, and how does it work?\n\nWhen your body is exposed to a foreign pathogen, like a virus that causes illness, your body's response is to produce antibodies that live in the blood and tissue. These are proteins that bind to and destroy the virus, preventing it from making copies of itself and further spreading the infection.\n\nThe antibody test, also called a serology test, looks at whether your body has developed those antibodies; the presence of them most likely means you were exposed to Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus. Some tests, like the one used by the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, can measure the level of antibodies in your system -- your titer.\n\nBut in general, most of the tests being made available across the country detect only whether the antibodies are present, said Dr. Jeffrey Jhang, medical director of clinical laboratories and transfusion services for the Mount Sinai Health System. A direct-to-consumer test announced on Tuesday from Quest Diagnostics -- more on that below -- measures only presence or absence.\n\nAntibodies can take generally anywhere from about a week to 14 days to develop, Dr. Jhang said, and the levels of antibodies vary based on time since exposure and a person's immune system. This means that a lack of antibodies does not necessarily mean you were not exposed to the virus.\n\nThe test is similar to other blood tests you may have had before: A sample of blood is taken from the patient and is then analyzed to determine the presence of antibodies. Most tests will generally return results within a few days, but that may vary, as some tests can return results in a few hours.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. New C.D.C. data suggests the virus death toll is higher than reported. Trump wants to keep open meat plants, many of which are virus hot spots. The U.S. surpasses 1 million known coronavirus cases. See more updates Updated 6h ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York If I have antibodies, I'm immune, right?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nThe antibody test does not test for immunity to Covid-19. There is no test yet that can tell if you are immune. It is simply too early to know if the presence of antibodies confers immunity, as this is a new virus, meaning we've never seen it before.\n\nBut experts generally agree that, based on experiences with other viruses, including SARS, the presence of antibodies most likely does confer some level of protection, though we don't know to what extent or for how long.\n\n\"The difficult thing is we do not have clinical evidence yet of whether the presence of antibodies actually prevents the individual from getting the disease again,\" Dr. Jhang said, adding, \"I think most people believe that the presence of antibodies in most cases would confer some protection given our experience with other viruses.\"\n\n\"But we really have to wait to see some evidence of that before we can be confident in being able to say that these antibodies can be protective,\" he said.\n\nIf I get an antibody test, can it tell if I have the virus?\n\nAn antibody test is not the same thing as a diagnostic test for Covid-19, and it will not diagnose whether you currently have it.\n\nRemember that antibodies take time to develop, so a lack of antibodies may just mean your body hasn't had enough time to develop them postinfection.\n\nDo I still need to practice social distancing if I have antibodies?\n\nYes. If you test positive for antibodies, it is important that you continue to practice social distancing and proper general hygiene, as we still don't know if antibodies confer immunity. Wear a mask, wash your hands regularly, socially distance yourself and clean your home often.\n\nWhy does this matter?\n\nAs we just learned, knowing your antibody level will help you determine whether you've been exposed to the coronavirus. This does not mean you're immune, and you should still practice all of the safety precautions you have been. But it does mean you may be eligible to donate convalescent plasma, which can potentially help patients still suffering from Covid-19 by allowing them to \"borrow\" your antibodies to accelerate their recovery time.\n\nWidespread antibody testing may also give us a clearer picture of the scope of the disease. Results from a random testing of 3,000 people in New York City recently suggested that as many as one in five residents -- or about 2.7 million people -- might have encountered the disease without realizing it. When describing the results, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that because the rate of infection might be far higher than initially thought, the death rate of the virus mighty be far lower than we thought.\n\nOnce the medical community determines whether antibodies confer immunity -- which experts say will take at least six months or so to determine -- we'll have a better sense of who may be less at risk emerging from lockdown.\n\n\"Once we understand that the antibodies are protective, then the testing means something,\" Dr. Jhang said, as it may help \"figure out who can go back to work and be protected and not spread the disease, or when kids can go back to school, teachers going in to teach.\"\n\nAre the tests accurate?\n\nA study of 14 available antibody tests published last week found that only three delivered consistently reliable results. The study, which has yet to be peer-reviewed, found that only one test never returned a false positive, which is when the test incorrectly confirms the presence of coronavirus antibodies in people who didn't have them. The other two tests with consistently reliable results returned false positives about 1 percent of the time.\n\nFurther, these three tests confirmed the presence of antibodies in infected people only 90 percent of the time.\n\nPart of the reason for the inaccuracies, Dr. Jhang said, may be what's called cross-reactivity: This is when a test misidentifies antibodies for a different, but similar, coronavirus.\n\nFlorian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York told The New York Times that false positives weren't necessarily an issue when determining how widespread the disease is, as a given test's false-positive rate can be accounted for in estimates. They do, however, matter greatly on an individual level.\n\n\"You don't want anybody back to work who has a false positive -- that's the last thing you want to do,\" Dr. Krammer said.\n\nAnd the World Health Organization, citing ideas for an \"immunity passport\" or \"risk-free certificate\" from some countries, last week advised against relying on the tests for policy decisions.\n\nShould I get a test?\n\nIf you think you currently have Covid-19, or have experienced in the last few days symptoms like coughing, fever, loss of taste or smell, or difficulty breathing, you should not get a test. Again, the antibody test is not the same as a diagnostic test for Covid-19.\n\nThe test is generally intended for people who either have had a positive test for Covid-19 and have recovered; or who think they were exposed to Covid-19 and no longer have symptoms.\n\nQuest Diagnostics, which on Tuesday announced it is selling a direct-to-consumer antibody test -- meaning you don't need to first see a physician to take it -- offered these guidelines for people interested in an antibody test:\n\nHave had a positive test for Covid-19 and it has been at least seven days and you want to know if you have detectable levels of immunoglobulin G, or IgG, antibodies.\n\nHave not experienced a fever or felt feverish in the last three days.\n\nHave not experienced new or worsening symptoms of Covid-19 in the past 10 days: loss of smell or taste, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, feeling weak or lethargic, lightheadedness or dizziness, vomiting or diarrhea, slurred speech and/or seizures.\n\nWhere can I get a test?\n\nWhile getting a test to diagnose Covid-19 is still somewhat difficult, antibody testing seems to be rolling out a little more smoothly. Many organizations nationwide are beginning to offer the test, perhaps most notably Quest, which is offering the test without a physician's referral at the 2,200 patient service centers it operates around the country, the company said.\n\nLabCorp, a competitor of Quest, announced on Monday that, with a physician's referral, patients could get an antibody test at any of its more than 2,000 patient service centers, as well as its 100 locations in Walgreens.\n\nIn New York City, the walk-in clinic CityMD said in an email to patients that, as of Tuesday, it would also offer antibody testing that would \"indicate with high accuracy if you had the virus in the past whether or not you experienced symptoms.\"\n\nCityMD advises that people \"wait two to four weeks after the end of symptoms to get the antibody test.\" For more information about getting tested through CityMD, click here.\n\nLast, you can just ask your doctor about antibody testing, as doctors can refer patients to many locations running the test nationwide. Most insurance providers should cover the test, but check with yours to be sure.",

        "body": "Before the coronavirus outbreak, Dr. Lindy Fox, a dermatologist in San Francisco, used to see four or five patients a year with chilblains -- painful red or purple lesions that typically emerge on fingers or toes in the winter.\n\nOver the past few weeks, she has seen dozens.\n\n\"All of a sudden, we are inundated with toes,\" said Fox, who practices at the University of California, San Francisco. \"I've got clinics filled with people coming in with new toe lesions. And it's not people who had chilblains before -- they've never had anything like this.\"\n\nIt's also not the time of year for chilblains, which are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions. \"Usually, we see it in the dead of winter,\" Fox said.\n\nFox is not the only one deluged with cases. In Boston, Dr. Esther Freeman, director of global health dermatology at the Massachusetts General Hospital, said her telemedicine clinic is also \"completely full of toes. I had to add extra clinical sessions, just to take care of toe consults. People are very concerned.\"\n\nThe lesions are emerging as yet another telltale symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. The most prominent signs are a dry cough and shortness of breath, but the virus has been linked to a string of unusual and diverse effects, like mental confusion and a diminished sense of smell.\n\nFederal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called COVID toe should be sufficient grounds for testing. (COVID-19 is the name of the illness caused by the coronavirus.)\n\nSeveral medical papers from Spain, Belgium and Italy described a surge in complaints about painful lesions on patients' toes, Achilles' heels and soles of the feet; whether the patients were infected was not always clear, because they were otherwise healthy and testing was limited.\n\nMost cases have been reported in children, teens and young adults, and some experts say they may reflect a healthy immune response to the virus.\n\n\"The most important message to the public is not to panic -- most of the patients we are seeing with these lesions are doing extremely well,\" Freeman said.\n\n\"They're having what we call a benign clinical course. They're staying home, they're getting better, the toe lesions are going away.\"\n\nScientists are just beginning to study the phenomenon, but so far chilblain-like lesions appear to signal, curiously enough, a mild or even asymptomatic infection. They may also develop several weeks after the acute phase of an infection is over.\n\nPatients who develop swollen toes and red and purple lesions should consult their primary care doctor or a dermatologist to rule out other possible causes. But, experts said, they should not run to the emergency room, where they risk being exposed to the coronavirus or exposing others if they are infected.\n\n\"The good news is that the chilblain-like lesions usually mean you're going to be fine,\" Fox said. \"Usually it's a good sign your body has seen COVID and is making a good immune reaction to it.\"\n\nPatients who get the painful lesions are often alarmed. They appear most frequently on the toes, often affecting several toes on one or both feet, and the sores can be extremely painful, causing a burning or itching sensation.\n\nAt first, the toes look swollen and take on a reddish tint; sometimes a part of the toe is swollen, and individual lesions or bumps can be seen. Over time, the lesions become purple in color.\n\nHannah Spitzer, 20, a sophomore at Lafayette College who is finishing the academic year remotely at her home in Westchester County, New York, has lesions on all 10 of her toes, so uncomfortable -- painful during the day, and itchy at night -- that she can't put anything on her feet, not even socks.\n\nWalking is difficult, and she has trouble sleeping. \"At first I thought it was my shoes, but it got worse and worse,\" Spitzer said. \"Most of my toes are red, swollen, almost shiny. It looks like frostbite.\"\n\nShe has used hydrocortisone and Benadryl to alleviate the discomfort, and said ice is also helpful. Doctors say the lesions disappear on their own within a few weeks.\n\nAdding to the mystery is that some teens and young adults with the lesions have tested negative for the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Amy Paller, chair of the department of dermatology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said one possible explanation is that these patients had such a mild disease and that viral replication was limited, making the virus undetectable.\n\nAnother possibility, she said, is that the lesions are what is called an epiphenomenon -- a symptom may accompany a disease without being causally related. For instance, perhaps more people are developing the lesions because they are staying inside and walking around barefoot more than usual.\n\nBut she also dismissed that idea as highly unlikely. \"I don't think that's it -- I think it's a mild inflammatory process manifesting in this way,\" Paller said. \"It's a real phenomenon. We don't really understand it at all.\"\n\nSpitzer had a test shortly after developing the lesions, and the result was negative, but she is convinced the toe lesions are a delayed response to an earlier infection that was so mild she barely noticed it.\n\n\"I've never had anything like this,\" she said. \"It's completely new.\"\n\nA recent paper by doctors in Spain, published in the International Journal of Dermatology, described six cases of patients with toe lesions and included pictures of the chilblain-like bumps that patients had emailed to their physicians.\n\nMost of the patients were teens or young adults, including one 15-year-old who found out he had COVID-19 pneumonia when he went to the emergency room seeking medical attention for his toes.\n\nAnother patient was a 91-year-old man who had been hospitalized with the coronavirus three weeks earlier, and had recovered and returned home.\n\nWhile dermatologists say it's not unusual for rashes to appear along with viral infections -- like measles or chickenpox -- the toe lesions surprised them.\n\nOther problems like hives have also been linked to the coronavirus, but COVID toes have been the most common and striking skin manifestation.\n\nPatients with viral infections often get a pink bumpy rash called morbilliform, or hives, Fox said, but added that the toe lesions were \"unexpected.\"\n\nThe toe cases make up half of all reports filed by skin doctors around the world to a new international registry started by the American Academy of Dermatology, which is tracking the complications.\n\nNo one knows exactly why the new coronavirus might cause chilblain-like lesions. One hypothesis is that they are caused by inflammation, a prominent feature of COVID-19. Inflammation also causes one of the most serious syndromes associated with the coronavirus, acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nOther hypotheses are that the lesions are caused by inflammation in the walls of blood vessels, or by small micro clots in the blood. (Clotting has been another feature of the disease.)\n\nThe lesions seen in otherwise healthy people appear to be distinct from those that doctors are seeing in some critically ill COVID-19 patients in intensive care, who are prone to developing blood clots.\n\nSome of these clots may be very small and can block the tiny vessels in the extremities, causing rashes on the toes, said Dr. Humberto Choi, a pulmonologist and critical care physician at the Cleveland Clinic.\n\n\\Some experts now believe COVID toe should be recognized as sufficient grounds for testing, even in the absence of other symptoms.\n\n\"This should be a criteria for testing, just like loss of smell, and shortness of breath and chest pain,\" Fox said.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nGood morning.\n\n(Here's the sign-up, if you don't already get California Today by email.)\n\nOn Monday, officials in Los Angeles County released preliminary results of a study that suggest roughly 4.1 percent of the county's adult population has already had the coronavirus, which translates to between 221,000 and 442,000 people, factoring in adjustments for statistical margin of error.\n\nThat's a much, much higher number than confirmed case counts indicate. (As of early Tuesday morning, the county had 13,816 cases.)\n\n\"We haven't known the true extent of Covid-19 infections in our community because we have only tested people with symptoms, and the availability of tests has been limited,\" Neeraj Sood, a professor of public policy at the University of Southern California and lead investigator on the study, said in a statement.\n\nDr. Barbara Ferrer, L.A. County's public health director, said in a statement that the early results pointed to the possibility that many people may have been unknowingly infected.\n\n[Read more about antibody tests.]\n\nThe study relies on rapid antibody tests, which my colleagues reported have faced concerns about accuracy.\n\nAnd as The Mercury News reported, a Stanford study that also showed higher rates of infection in Santa Clara County drew criticism, though that was largely from statisticians over the study's methodology.\n\nStill, experts have emphasized that more studies will help develop a clearer picture of the virus's true prevalence.\n\nIn any case, officials say it's crucial to continue to adhere to public health orders for many reasons, including that if more people are infected but asymptomatic, they could unknowingly spread the virus.\n\n[See confirmed coronavirus cases in each California county.]\n\nA change to the U.S.N.S. Mercy's assignment\n\nOn Monday, my colleague John Ismay and I spoke with leaders aboard the Navy hospital ship Mercy. Here's our dispatch about how their assignment has changed:\n\nIn the weeks since the Mercy arrived at the Port of Los Angeles from San Diego, the hospital ship's mission has been clear: Serve as a crucial relief valve for patients who haven't been infected with the coronavirus as hospitals fill up with patients sick with Covid-19.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Trump says he will suspend immigration as some governors take first steps to reopen states. Additional small business aid won't pass Congress until Thursday at the earliest. A review of death counts in 11 countries reveals the devastating trail of the coronavirus. See more updates Updated 12m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nIn recent days, the work has shifted, but that underlying goal has remained the same, the commanding officer of the ship's medical facility told us.\n\n\"FEMA, after having made an assessment of the situation and the local needs, has changed our assignment,\" said Capt. John Rotruck, the medical treatment team's commanding officer.\n\nThe Mercy has sent 40 medical staff members -- two family practice doctors, 16 nurses and 20 corpsmen, including two respiratory technicians -- to help care for patients who don't have Covid-19 at a state-run skilled nursing facility in Orange County.\n\n\"We're essentially augmenting their staff,\" Captain Rotruck said, as the anticipated surge in Covid-19 hospitalizations has, for now, been held at bay.\n\nThe capacity onboard will decrease to 250 beds from 1,000, in large part as a result of that staffing shift -- though officials emphasized that leaves more than enough space at the rate the Mercy has been taking in patients.\n\nAt the same time, leaders aboard the Mercy said that most of the military crew is moving off the ship to stay at nearby hotels in order to make it possible for crew members to keep their distance from one another as they work, eat and sleep.\n\nSailors will be bused from their hotels to work their shifts aboard the ship.\n\nThe move, which will decrease the number of crew members staying aboard the ship to roughly 140 from more than 800, came as the number of crew members who may have been exposed inched upward.\n\nBy Monday, Captain Rotruck said that nine crew members had tested positive for the coronavirus, and that about 130 people were in quarantine because they had come into what federal officials define as close contact with at least one of those nine. All of those in quarantine tested negative.\n\nAll nine who have Covid-19 were outpatients as of Monday -- meaning their cases weren't severe enough to warrant being hospitalized -- and their conditions are being closely monitored.\n\n[Read more about the Mercy's mission.]\n\nCaptain Rotruck said that moving crew members off the Mercy was unusual but not unprecedented.\n\nDuring a previous mission, for instance, some medical staff members flew to Vietnam to provide medical care to patients on the Mercy, though they didn't sleep on the ship.\n\nHowever, Captain Rotruck added, \"We have not done it to this scale,\" with the vast majority of the ship's crew members living ashore.\n\nA spokesman said on Friday that the crew aboard the Navy hospital ship Comfort, which is docked in New York City, recently moved most of its crew to hotels ashore as well.\n\nCaptain Rotruck said that the Mercy was ready to care for coronavirus-negative seniors living in nursing homes, as the governor has previously announced, but none had been transferred yet.\n\nSuch nursing home patients may be moved to the Mercy for care through the typical intake process, if, for example, a facility needed to free up space to care for Covid-19 patients.\n\nAs of Monday evening, the ship had taken in 65 patients total since it docked in San Pedro, and its crew had performed 22 surgeries. There were 13 patients still being treated onboard, meaning that 52 had been discharged.\n\nHere's what else to know\n\nWe often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

        "body": "A Manhattan man with autism was sent to a quarantine facility after his mother had symptoms of the coronavirus and died.\n\nDaysi D\u00edaz, 65, was afraid to see a doctor, despite a fever that wouldn't go away. If she was diagnosed with the coronavirus, she might have to be hospitalized. Who would look after her son, Junior?\n\nSo Ms. D\u00edaz stayed put in her ninth-floor apartment in a public housing project in Upper Manhattan, growing weaker. Relatives called her often to check in. During one such call in March, Ms. D\u00edaz collapsed. In her final words, she called out for Junior. But he was in a deep sleep.\n\nAfter his mother's death, Junior, who is 31 and has a developmental disability, was hospitalized and sent to a quarantine facility in Queens.\n\nHis stutter has worsened. He has struggled to make sense of his mother's death, wondering if she is in heaven. And he has wrestled with anxiety, said his aunt, Carmen Gonz\u00e1lez, who is Ms. D\u00edaz's sister-in-law.\n\n\"She thought she was going to live to take care of him,\" Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said.\n\nThe toll wrought by the coronavirus is forcing some families to confront a wrenching question years before they believed it would be necessary: If a caretaker dies, who will care for disabled adult relatives?\n\n\"As Covid-19 sweeps across our city and nation, a lot of parents are coming to the realization that they aren't going to be here forever and they need a plan,\" Jonathan Novick, an outreach manager with the Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities, wrote in an email.\n\nAdults with intellectual and developmental disabilities have been hit particularly hard by the coronavirus, which has torn through group homes. But the virus also poses a threat to adults with these disabilities who still live with their aging parents.\n\n\"We are going to see more and more cases like this one,\" said Dominic Sisti, an assistant professor of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile there's no indication Ms. D\u00edaz was ever tested for the coronavirus, Junior was recently diagnosed with a mild case of Covid-19, so it seems likely that his mother also died of the illness caused by the virus, Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said.\n\nInitially, that made finding a new home for Junior more difficult. But in recent days, a family friend has taken Junior in.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in New York Officials say 64 children in N.Y. have had mystery ailment. Who's getting sick now? Older people and those without jobs. College campuses in Connecticut may reopen by the fall. See more updates Updated 6h ago More live coverage: Global Markets U.S.\n\nJunior had lived with his mother for the past decade. An immigrant from Honduras, Ms. D\u00edaz worked as a seamstress and later as a home health aide, before injuring her back lifting a patient.\n\nMs. D\u00edaz was often vague when describing her son's disability to relatives. But his aunt, Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez, said she believed he was on the autism spectrum. A health care provider directly involved in Junior's care confirmed that to be the case.\n\nThe family did not make Junior available for an interview because Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said it might confuse him and leave him unsettled.\n\nHis father was not involved in his life, according to Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez. Junior spent his childhood in institutions after showing aggressive behavior at age 5 or 6, she said.\n\n\"He went from one place to another,\" said Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez, who is a retired teacher. \"His mom would go everywhere he went, all the time to visit.\"\n\nHe returned home around age 21, at which point Ms. D\u00edaz became her son's caregiver. It was often difficult. Tantrums often sent him onto the floor, where he would pound the ground with his fists. But with his mother's help, he began to exercise some independence.\n\nHe loved to look through coupons and fliers left in lobbies, always searching for a bargain. His mother would send him out shopping, an outing that he enjoyed.\n\nHis mother's daily worry was that he would behave in a way a stranger found inappropriate and that things would spiral out of control.\n\nOn March 21, Ms. D\u00edaz developed a headache and then a high fever. Soon she was coughing so loudly the neighbors could hear it.\n\nAt the time, hospitals were inundated with Covid-19 patients. The city was urging sick people to stay at home, if possible. Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said she received little guidance after calling 311 seeking help for her sister-in-law. \"Don't go to the emergency room,\" Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez recalled the operator telling her.\n\nStill, Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez urged her sister-in-law to try an urgent care center. But Ms. D\u00edaz was too weak to get anywhere on her own. She wasn't sure whether she had the flu or the coronavirus, but she was scared to find out.\n\n\"Truthfully, she was afraid of having the virus, because she didn't want to leave her son,\" Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said. \"What's going to happen to him, you know?\"\n\nOn the morning of March 31, Ms. D\u00edaz was on the phone with an aunt when she began to call out for Junior. Then the phone fell to the ground. Ms. D\u00edaz had collapsed, according to Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nAn ambulance crew arrived and tried to resuscitate her but failed. . Hours later, Junior was later taken by ambulance to NewYork-Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center, near his home in the Dyckman houses. There was nowhere else to take him.\n\nMs. Gonz\u00e1lez, 72, who is raising her 6-year-old grandson and also cares for an older sister, said she wanted to take Junior in, \"but my hands are totally tied.\"\n\nIn early April, Junior tested positive for Covid-19, though he showed only mild symptoms, Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said. He spent several weeks at the John A. Cook Center in Queens, a facility that ordinarily runs programs for adults with developmental or intellectual disabilities but is now being used as a quarantine center for disabled adults with Covid-19.\n\nHe passed the time watching documentaries. In phone calls with his aunt, Junior often brought up his mother.\n\n\"My mother was a loving mother and took good care of me,\" he said, according to Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez.\n\nBut the conversations also were unpredictable.\n\n\"Why don't they call 911 to put out the fire in hell?\" he asked his aunt once. She said she steered the conversation back to heaven, explaining that if he was good he'd end up there with his mother.\n\nIn early April, a family friend who has a son with special needs agreed to take in Junior. But Junior's Covid-19 diagnosis led to a delay of several weeks.\n\nThen last week, with Junior appearing healthier, he moved in with the family friend at her home in Yonkers. So far it has been a good fit, Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez said.\n\nIn recent phone calls with his aunt, Junior has started to grieve more openly.\n\n\"He asked me if it was OK to cry because his mom died,\" Ms. Gonz\u00e1lez recalled last week. \"I told him that it's OK and that he did not have to hold his feelings inside.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAfter working for 10 days at Bellevue Hospital in New York, Dr. Richard Levitan decided to share what he had learned about Covid-19. Too many patients were showing up at the hospital with perilously low oxygen levels, putting them at risk for severe complications and death.\n\nBut a simple home gadget called a pulse oximeter could help alert patients to seek help sooner, he said.\n\n\"In the hospital, when I'm trying to decide who I send home, a big part of the criteria is 'What is your oxygen? What is your pulse?'\" said Dr. Levitan from his home in New Hampshire, where he just finished self-quarantine as a precaution. \"With a pulse oximeter and a thermometer, Americans can be prepared and be diagnosed and treated before they get really, really sick.\"\n\nHealth officials are divided on whether home monitoring with a pulse oximeter should be recommended on a widespread basis during Covid-19. Studies of reliability show mixed results, and there's little guidance on how to choose one. But many doctors are advising patients to get one, making it the go-to gadget of the pandemic. We've answered common questions about the device, how it works and what to do with the information it gives you.\n\nWhat is a pulse oximeter?\n\nA pulse oximeter is a small device that looks sort of like a chip clip or a big clothes pin. You place your finger snugly inside (most require nail side up), and within seconds it lights up with numbers indicating your blood oxygen level and heart rate. Most healthy people will get an oxygen reading around 95 to 98 percent. Some people with existing health conditions may have a lower normal reading. You should check in with your doctor if the number falls to 92 or lower.\n\nThe device will also show your heart rate. A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from about 60 to 100 beats per minute, although athletes with a higher cardiovascular fitness will have a lower pulse.\n\nPro tip: One of the things to remember about reading a pulse oximeter is that many of them are designed to be read by someone facing you, not the person wearing it. The first time I tried my home device, it looked like my oxygen level was an alarming 86, but then I realized I was reading it upside down. (It was 98.)\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Georgia moves ahead with some reopenings despite plenty of misgivings. Reopenings in several states on Friday offer the first wider test for nation. Congress has allocated $2.7 trillion, but as jobless claims mount, states struggle to meet needs. See more updates Updated Just now More live coverage: Global Markets New York How does a pulse oximeter work?\n\nWhen you insert your finger into a pulse oximeter, it beams different wavelengths of light through your finger (you won't feel a thing). It's targeting hemoglobin, a protein molecule in your blood that carries oxygen. Hemoglobin absorbs different amounts and wavelengths of light depending on the level of oxygen it's carrying. Your pulse oximeter will give you a numerical reading -- a percentage that indicates the level of oxygen saturation in your blood. If you've been to a doctor in the past 20 years, you've experienced pulse oximetry.\n\nThe device works better with warmer hands than cold hands. And because oxygen levels can fluctuate, consider taking measurements a few times a day. Also try it in different positions, such as while lying flat on your back or while walking. Keep notes to share with your doctor if needed.\n\nDoes it matter what finger I use?\n\nMost health technicians will place the device on the index fingers, but a study of 37 volunteers found that the highest reading came from the third finger on the dominant hand. A close second was the dominant thumb. So if you are right-handed, use the right middle finger. If you are left-handed, use the left middle finger. The difference between fingers is small, so if you prefer the index finger, that's fine.\n\nDo long nails or nail polish make a difference?\n\nYes. Dark nail polish can affect accuracy of the reading. Very long nails would make it difficult to insert your finger properly in the clip.\n\nWhat happens if my oxygen level falls? What is the treatment?\n\nIf your number dips to 92 or lower, you should check in with your doctor. But don't panic.\n\nThe good news is that it's a lot easier to bolster an oxygen level that is just starting to drop than one that is dangerously low. When Dr. Anna Marie Chang, an emergency room physician in Philadelphia, tested positive for coronavirus in mid-March, she felt lousy but was reassured by daily checks that showed normal oxygen levels. Dr. Chang, an associate professor of emergency medicine and director of clinical research for Thomas Jefferson University, even started feeling better but kept up her daily monitoring with her pulse oximeter. One morning she felt severely fatigued and saw that her oxygen level had dropped to 88 percent.\n\n\"I texted my colleagues and said, 'I think it's time to go in,'\" she said. Once admitted, she was placed on oxygen with a mask. She spent her days resting in the prone position (on her stomach) because the position opens up the lungs and is more comfortable. \"I was there for four days and never needed to be intubated,\" Dr. Chang said. \"It was just supplemental oxygen.\"\n\nDr. Levitan noted that patients with Covid-19 can experience a potentially dangerous drop in oxygen saturation without having obvious breathing problems. Without a pulse oximeter, they might never know it or get very used to how they feel, despite very low oxygen levels. By the time they go to the hospital feeling shortness of breath, their oxygen levels would have dropped significantly, and they could have very advanced Covid pneumonia.\n\n\"They are still talking, thinking clearly, and not in obvious distress,\" Dr. Levitan said. \"If the level of oxygen became this low all of sudden, these patients would be unconscious, having seizures, or otherwise affected. What that means to me is there is a period of days where they were going silently down and they didn't know it.\"\n\nIs there a risk to monitoring oxygen levels at home?\n\nIt's possible that a home monitor could give a faulty reading or be used incorrectly, prompting a patient to seek care unnecessarily. If you or someone in your home shows a very low reading, you may want to test your device on a healthy person to confirm that it is working correctly and discuss it with your doctor.\n\nAnd home monitoring should not give you a false sense of security. Don't ignore physical symptoms even if your oxygen level is fine. You should still call a doctor if you have severe shortness of breath, a high fever, confusion or any other concerning symptom. The benefit of monitoring is that it potentially can flag a decline in your respiratory health before you feel it. And if you feel really lousy -- as many Covid patients do for a few weeks -- seeing a normal oxygen level can relieve some of the stress of the illness.\n\nAre home devices accurate? Which one should I buy?\n\nWhen Dr. Chang needed a home monitor, she called friends and told them to pick one up from Target. \"I literally said to my friend, 'Just find me one,'\" Dr. Chang said. \"It's fairly straightforward technology.\"\n\nThe research data on home monitors has been mixed, but they tend to be accurate within a few percentage points. In drugstores you can find monitors in the $20 to $50 range, while some sell online for $200 or more. Paying a higher price doesn't guarantee a better monitor.\n\nWirecutter, a New York Times Company that reviews and recommends products, suggests starting with the Food and Drug Administration's 510(k) Premarket Notification Database and searching for \"oximeter.\"\n\nGiven that pulse oximeters are in high demand, you may not find a model listed in the F.D.A. database right now and will have to settle for what you can find. One way to check how it's performing is to take your pulse manually and compare the result to the rate shown on the device. Remember, when you use a monitor, it's the trend that matters, not a single reading.\n\n\"Consumer models are very reliable,\" Dr. Levitan said.\n\nExperts advise sticking with the finger clip technology for now. Newer wearable devices and camera-based apps use a different technology to measure oxygen saturation, and so far most of these products appear to be unreliable. A 2019 study in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine tested three iPhone apps that offered pulse oximetry function, but they all fell dangerously short of the mark. The apps were \"inaccurate\" and \"had limited to no ability to accurately detect hypoxia,\" the authors concluded.",

Marianne's reply comes quickly, in a matter-of-fact tone: \"Smarter than everyone,\" she says. Based on the best-selling novel by Sally Rooney, \"Normal People\" follows the pair as they ricochet through an on-again, off-again romantic relationship. Their bond highlights issues of social class, as the pair -- one wealthy, one poor -- move from secondary school to university.

The playwright Richard Nelson first introduced the Apples, a fictional middle-class American family, in 2010, when the Public Theater staged \"That Hopey Changey Thing.\" That play saw the members of the Apple clan gather around a dinner table on the evening of the 2010 midterm elections. (The timing was real; it was actually the evening of the midterm elections.) The Public staged sequels in 2011, 2012 and 2013, with each play set around the same dinner table. But the family and their audience will have a different setup in this new addition to the cycle, in which the characters trade the dinner table for a Zoom conference call, and audience members swap the Public Theater for their laptop screens. Set in 2020, the play finds the family members catching up remotely, with the eldest Apple sister, Barbara (played by Maryann Plunkett), recovering from severe Covid-19 symptoms. It will be performed through a livestream beginning at 7:30 p.m. \"It's a way to embrace the moment,\" Jay O. Sanders, who plays Barbara's brother, Richard, said in a recent interview with The Times. \"This play isn't saying, 'Let's pretend we're in a theater.' This is saying: 'OK, we're at home.

That includes genomic sequencing of the virus to help scientists build an ancestral tree of cases, a re-examination of specific deaths, and thousands of old flu samples that have been repurposed to look for coronavirus.\n\nHere's a look at the evidence and what it shows:\n\nI got really sick in February. Did I have coronavirus?\n\nIt's possible, but it was most likely something else.\n\nThe Seattle area emerged as an early epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak at the end of February, but there is compelling evidence that, even there, the virus didn't yet have much of a foothold compared to the flu, which had a particularly potent season.\n\nA team that analyzes flu trends in the region has been able to review nearly 7,000 old flu samples collected from around the region in January and February, re-examining them for coronavirus. All of the samples from January were negative. The earliest sample that tested positive was Feb. 20.\n\nBased on that and later case counts, Trevor Bedford, who studies the evolution of viruses at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and who was part of the flu study team, estimated that there were probably a few hundred cases in the area by that point in February.\n\nBut even that would still be a small fraction -- perhaps less than 1 percent -- of the many thousands of people who had flu symptoms at the time.\n\nWhen did the coronavirus first reach the United States?\n\nThe U.S. first identified cases among travelers who had flown in from Wuhan, China, in the middle of January. Officials worked to contain them.\n\nThere is some evidence that the virus began getting a bit of traction around the end of January. To seed that late-February emergence in the Seattle area, researchers believe the spread could have begun with a traveler who arrived in the region from Wuhan on January 15, or it may have been another unknown case that arrived in the few weeks that followed.\n\nIn San Jose, tissue sampling from a woman who died on Feb. 6 revealed that she was probably the first known person in the U.S. whose death was linked to the coronavirus -- a strong sign that the virus may have been circulating in that part of Northern California in January.\n\nCoronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Count\n\nA detailed county map shows the extent of the coronavirus outbreak, with tables of the number of cases by county.\n\nBut was it part of a large, previously unrecognized outbreak?\n\nDr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco, theorized that perhaps the woman, who worked for a company that had an office in Wuhan, was one of only a small number of people who contracted the virus at that time and that transmissions probably petered out for some reason. Otherwise, he said, the region would have seen a much bigger outbreak.\n\n\"With that kind of early introduction, we should be seeing thousands of more cases,\" Dr. Rutherford said.\n\nDr. Sara Cody, the health officer for Santa Clara County, said local, state and federal officials were continuing to try to answer those questions.\n\nThere are other, less concrete signs of earlier infections. In Florida, where the first two official cases were announced on March 1, a state database now lists coronavirus cases in patients who may have had symptoms as far back as January. But the cases are all under investigation, and no one has confirmed that any of those patients had the disease that early.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. Fears grow over new outbreaks as more states lift restrictions on bars, beauty shops and other businesses. The latest retail sales report depicts the largest two-month decline on record. Who's enforcing mask-wearing rules? Often it's retail workers.

He said recently that he suspects he had the virus in the first week of January.\n\nWhat if the virus quietly arrived in December?\n\nDoctors in France have said that a patient's sample from late December has since tested positive for coronavirus. But so far, there is no comparable evidence of a similar case in the United States.\n\nThe strongest possible indicator so far is new evidence that emerged this week of two people in Snohomish County, Wash., who reported coronavirus-like symptoms in December. Both people later tested positive for antibodies, county health officials announced.\n\nBut Dr. Chris Spitters, the county's health officer, said that while it is possible that both people had the coronavirus in December -- even before officials in China had reported a cluster to the World Health Organization at the end of the month -- he is doubtful.\n\n\"It's possible and frankly, I think, more likely that they had a non-Covid respiratory viral illness in December and subsequently had an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic Covid infection subsequent to that,\" Dr. Spitters said.\n\nDr. Bedford said he also believed this was the more likely scenario, noting that up to half of people with coronavirus infections have no symptoms.\n\nThere could have been a tiny number of isolated coronavirus cases among travelers to the United States in December, Dr. Bedford said. But it's pretty clear that none of them spread.\n\nIn part, scientists can tell that by looking at the genomic fingerprints of each case. But another clue is the rapid rate at which the virus spreads, said Dr. Rutherford.\n\nIt appears that early in the outbreak, one infection was spreading to about four other people, on average, with an incubation period for new infections of about four days. So a case seeded in December would rapidly quadruple through new generations, likely growing exponentially to millions of cases from a single unbroken chain of transmission by the end of February. Researchers aren't seeing any chains that appear to go that far back.\n\nModelers looking back at the growth of outbreaks elsewhere have reached similar conclusions. One estimated that New York's outbreak could have begun with perhaps 10 infected people who contracted the virus sometime between the end of January to the middle of February, when the first cases of community transmission were identified and hospitals began seeing more cases.\n\nWhen did the virus begin in China?\n\nThe virus first emerged in Wuhan in December after a series of people developed symptoms of a viral pneumonia and an examination found that they had been infected with a new coronavirus.\n\nA group of researchers in China later examined the histories of the first 41 lab-confirmed cases at a Wuhan hospital, finding that many of them had connections to a seafood market. But the earliest case, in a person who developed symptoms on Dec. 1, had no connections to the market.\n\nThe information suggests that if the virus did originate from the market, it was likely circulating by November, early enough to reach that first person. Mr. Bedford said it was conceivable to him that the virus began as early as October, but that November was more likely.\n\nThere is no evidence that it started elsewhere. The virus mutates an average of twice a month, something researchers can see in the genomic sequences of individual cases, and all of the cases in Wuhan show close genetic links.\n\nAll the other thousands of cases that have been sequenced around the globe show the Wuhan version as an ancestor.\n\nWas the coronavirus made in a lab somewhere?\n\nSeveral unfounded theories that have gained traction suggest that the virus was created or accidentally released in a lab somewhere. The Chinese government speculated that perhaps Americans brought the virus in to China. President Trump has suggested it came from a virology lab in Wuhan.\n\nMr. Bedford said there is no evidence of genetic engineering in the virus, noting that it appears to be a genetic outgrowth of a virus circulating among bats. It likely reached humans through an intermediate animal, such as a pangolin, he said.\n\n\"There's no hallmarks of it having been manipulated in a lab,\" Mr. Bedford said. \"I think that's definitive.\"\n\nHe did not, however, rule out the possibility that some version of the virus being studied by scientists in Wuhan could have somehow escaped and spread from there. But he doubts that is the case. He said that the most prevalent theory about the virus's origins, that it spread naturally among animals at a live animal market in Wuhan, then jumped to humans, is the most likely explanation.",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nMy boyfriend broke up with me the week before they found my neighbor. The breakup happened in the evening; I had spent the day grocery shopping because the World Health Organization had just declared a pandemic.\n\nDetermined to remain optimistic, I was making chicken soup and blasting Motown when my boyfriend walked in looking pale and pained. I took one look at him and knew he either had a tragic update about coronavirus or our relationship was about to end.\n\nIt takes a particular kind of crisis to make your boyfriend breaking up with you the better news. As we hugged goodbye, he said, through tears, \"There's a social distancing joke in here somewhere.\"\n\nThe breakup surprised me, not only because the timing was horrific, but because I thought we still had a relationship to salvage. We had been together for six months and were good to each other, though we moved through the world in very different ways. I was tempted to chalk it up to the pandemic and hope he would change his mind. I drank two shots of whiskey and woke up with stomach pains and diarrhea.\n\nTwo days later, my symptoms persisted. I didn't know if it was a bug, coronavirus or the physical manifestation of emotional turmoil. The symptoms got worse: I thought I had a fever, but my thermometer was broken, so I slid a meat thermometer under my tongue, which seemed inaccurate and had a pointy tip that hurt. I thought longingly of my now ex-boyfriend in his apartment a mile away.\n\n[Sign up for Love Letter, our weekly email about Modern Love, weddings and relationships.]\n\nAfter a breakup, I usually try to reassert my independence and surround myself with friends, but now that was impossible. I worried that asking my ex for help so soon would seem needy, but I was too sick to care, so I texted him.\n\nWhen he showed up on my doorstep with Tylenol, Gatorade, Imodium and Pedialyte, I felt overwhelming gratitude. Was this a promising sign, or was he just being a mensch? The pandemic had wiped away the normal rules of a breakup, and we were in murky new territory.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. A $484 billion coronavirus aid package is headed to Trump's desk.

I opened the windows and doors for them so they wouldn't have to touch anything, then returned to the hallway and heard them report over the radio that he was dead.\n\nMy across-the-hall neighbors and I exchanged a glance of shock and shared responsibility.\n\nWhen the firefighters emerged, I asked how long ago my neighbor had died.\n\nThey said they wouldn't know until the medical examiner arrived.\n\nI had a sinking feeling. By touching the building's door knob a week earlier, had I passed on a virus to my neighbor that I didn't even know I was carrying?\n\nOverwhelmed by this bleak reality, I became consumed by a kind of panicked mania and began baking banana bread as my neighbors and I waited for the medical examiner. He arrived when the bread was in the oven, a cheerful man who told us the body already had begun to decompose, so it had been more than two days. He showed my neighbors a photo of the body on his digital camera so they could identify him, then said, \"Wow, something smells good! Are you making cinnamon rolls?\"\n\nMy neighbor dying alone in his apartment felt like a harbinger of more grief, and I was suddenly scared of being alone. I texted my ex to tell him what happened and to ease the unbearable loneliness this death had unleashed in me. We talked. It made me want to save him some banana bread.\n\nWhen I developed a fever and cough a few days later, I worried for the firefighters who had been in my apartment. My ex lent me his thermometer and tried to reassure me that the firefighters were certainly encountering the virus in other places.\n\nAlthough my ex and I lived alone in separate apartments, our continued contact meant we were effectively isolating together, ushering in a new relationship gray zone. We talked every day. He offered to do my laundry. And one night, after I was feeling better, we ate tortellini and watched a movie. We weren't worried about infecting each other because we had been in contact all along.\n\nNo longer romantic partners, we had become pandemic partners. Maybe, I thought, our relationship was on pause like the city, like the world. Or maybe, like so many couples, we were being kept together out of fear of being alone.\n\nMy ex didn't like to be alone, so I knew isolation would be hard for him. He was always socializing, biking, traveling, planning. Our first months of dating rolled over me like a tsunami: He gave me a toothbrush on our second date and a drawer in his bedroom the second month.\n\nWithin four months, we had gone on three vacations and met each other's families. But I worried that we had moved too fast without having done the slower work of really getting to know each other.\n\nSure enough, as we approached the six-month mark, we started to see how we perhaps weren't so compatible after all. While I wanted to analyze people and bare my soul, he wanted to talk about gadgets and problem-solve. I didn't know if these were simply differences to adapt to (I'm an artist; he's an engineer), if they indicated a deeper problem (would we not have enough to talk about?), or if, as he wondered aloud toward the end of our relationship, he didn't want to bare his soul because he wasn't ready for something serious (could he get ready?).\n\nIf we could just slow down, would we still have a chance?\n\nNow, slowing down was government mandated. Maybe isolation, with its solitude and time for reflection, was bringing us together again? Now that I had stopped pushing for intimacy, might he open up and offer it?\n\nNot really. And as my hopes for us shrank, my fear of being alone grew. I didn't know what to do. If I stopped seeing him, I wouldn't spend time with anybody for who knows how long. I was afraid of missing him, since I already missed everyone. The sirens began to blare more frequently outside my window, and I urged myself to accept the strange terms of our relationship so that it wouldn't have to end.\n\nUntil one night, 18 days past the onset of my symptoms, when he suggested I come over to bake Mexican wedding cookies. I felt encouraged by the title of the cookie he had picked (the \"wedding\" part), and I brought over renewed hope along with a load of dirty laundry. That night, we finally discussed our gray zone.\n\n\"What are the rules of a breakup in a pandemic?\" he said. \"No one knows! We'd have to go back to 1918 and ask.\"\n\nHe did open up that night, but only to reiterate his lack of interest in engaging in the heart-to-hearts I craved. When he said, \"I don't think we would make each other happy in the long term,\" I finally agreed.\n\nIsolation hadn't changed either of us; it had only clarified what we shared and what we lacked. Our mutual caretaking didn't change the fact that when I was with him, I felt lonely. I knew then that reliving my disappointment in our relationship every time I saw him was too difficult, and I had to face being alone. I told him we should stop talking and rolled my suitcase of clean clothes home, crying the whole way.\n\nYet being alone has its pleasures. I'm listening to Jane Austen audiobooks on my daily walks. Absorbed in her exacting social commentary, I feel engaged and free. It has taught me not all solitude is accompanied by loneliness, and it reminds me of how my neighbor used to read his book contentedly on the terrace.\n\nWhen the C.D.C. recommended wearing cloth masks, I ordered an extra one to give to my ex when I finally return his thermometer. While I'm no longer afraid of being alone, I also know that no one is self-sufficient, especially now, and that he and I will be there for each other for however long this lasts. Caretaking is the part we always got right.\n\nSarah Rosen, a writer, actor and filmmaker who lives in Brooklyn, is the author of \"Kosher Porn.\"\n\nModern Love can be reached at modernlove@nytimes.com.\n\nWant more?

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nAfter flight attendants and pilots criticized them for not doing more to protect employees, large airlines in the United States and around the world announced this week that they would require their crews and passengers to wear masks.\n\nAmerican Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines all said on Thursday that they would start requiring all passengers to wear a face covering in the coming weeks, a policy that will apply to their flight attendants and some other workers, too. The three join Lufthansa Group -- which owns its namesake airline, Swiss International Air Lines and Austrian Airlines -- as well as JetBlue and Frontier Airlines, all of which made similar announcements this week. Southwest Airlines has said a policy for flight attendants is coming.\n\nAs some states begin to relax or lift stay-at-home orders, lawmakers and unions representing flight attendants and pilots have stepped up calls for industrywide rules on masks to protect flight crews from passengers -- and passengers from one another.\n\nAirlines have been slow to require masks in part because they've been hard to come by. Early in the pandemic, many companies promised to make masks available for employees who wanted them, but some pilots and flight attendants complained that they were not always available.\n\n\"Things have changed rapidly in just two or three weeks,\" Robert Isom, president of American Airlines, said in a call with journalists on Thursday. \"As we take a look forward with sanitizer, we see ample supplies. With masks, it is a logistical issue of getting inventories to the right place, but we have sufficient quantities for our team.\"\n\nIt will be several weeks before the airline can distribute enough sanitizer and masks to offer them to all passengers who want them, Mr. Isom said. American's policy does not take effect until May 11.\n\nOn Wednesday, the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative Peter A. DeFazio, asked the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, Stephen Dickson, to require masks and take other steps to protect travelers and crews. It is \"essential\" that passengers wear masks and airlines space out seats, said Mr. DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nLatest Updates: Economy The news is terrible, but Wall Street had its best month in decades.

Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, urged the Transportation Department and the Department of Health and Human Services to put similar rules in place.\n\n\"The need for an emergency rule requiring face masks for all individuals engaged in air travel is both clear and urgent,\" the senators wrote in a letter.\n\nThe push for a federal mask requirement has been largely driven by labor unions. In a letter last week, the Association of Flight Attendants union, which represents workers at 20 airlines, including United and Frontier, asked the transportation and health departments for an emergency regulation on masks for passengers.\n\nOver the weekend, the union's president, Sara Nelson, posted a photograph on Twitter, which was widely shared, showing a packed American Airlines plane with some passengers who were not wearing masks.\n\n\"ENOUGH! This was TODAY on a four hour flight. This is not okay,\" Ms. Nelson wrote.\n\nSo far, the Trump administration has resisted a mask mandate.\n\nIn a statement, the F.A.A. said that Mr. Dickson had shared Mr. DeFazio's concerns and that the agency expected airlines to follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Department of Health and Human Services referred a request for comment to the C.D.C., which repeated its general recommendations.\n\nStudies have shown that people who don't display symptoms of the virus can infect others. That's why the C.D.C. recommends that masks or face coverings be worn in \"community settings,\" such as grocery stores, pharmacies or the confines of an airplane.\n\n\"If you're trying to control spread of a disease in a community, your most effective means is to control it at the source,\" said Dr. Henry Wu, director of the Emory TravelWell Center in Atlanta, which provides health services for international travelers. \"For an infectious disease, it would be the ill individual, primarily the ill individual who doesn't realize they are ill.\"\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, airlines have regularly pointed to the quality of their air filtration systems, which filter and recirculate the air in the cabin every few minutes. Such systems are \"quite good,\" Dr. Wu said, but they can't eliminate contagion.\n\n\"If you are sitting within six feet of others, obviously there are some immediate-proximity issues that even filtration systems can't address,\" he said.\n\nFor many flight attendants, the risk of infection has been mitigated by the nearly complete drop-off in air travel.\n\nWhile some flights, like the one photographed over the weekend, remain busy, most planes are flying virtually empty. But it won't remain that way for long. Since early March, airlines have sharply cut schedules, funneling the few people still traveling onto fewer flights. And some early data suggests that the air travel might be past its lowest point of the crisis.\n\n\"Whisper it quietly, but we may have reached the bottom,\" John Grant, a senior analyst at the aviation data provider OAG, wrote this week. \"Scheduled airline capacity has increased for the first time in nearly 10 weeks, and perhaps reassuringly those green shoots of recovery are in more than one market.\"\n\nUnlike the United States, Canada started requiring face coverings for passengers last week. That came as a relief to Yvette Nakamoto, a flight attendant with Air Canada who had been working through the pandemic, flying regularly between her home base in Calgary to Toronto and Vancouver.\n\nMs. Nakamoto said she wondered what had taken Canadian officials so long to require masks. She has other questions, too. \"Why aren't they taking temperatures?\" she asked. \"You go into a grocery store, it takes five seconds.\"",

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWhen a relative of mine recently became seriously ill with what seemed to be a coronavirus infection, my first question was about timing. How many days ago did your symptoms start?\n\nMarking your calendar at the first sign of illness, and tracking your fever and oxygen levels, are important steps in monitoring a coronavirus infection. Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has been unpredictable in the range of symptoms it can cause. But when it turns serious, it often follows a consistent pattern.\n\nWhile most patients recover in about a week, a significant minority of patients enter \"a very nasty second wave\" of illness, said Dr. Ilan Schwartz, assistant professor of infectious disease at the University of Alberta. \"After the initial symptoms, things plateau and maybe even improve a little bit, and then there is a secondary worsening.\"\n\nWhile every patient is different, doctors say that days five through 10 of the illness are often the most worrisome time for respiratory complications of Covid-19, particularly for older patients and those with underlying conditions like high blood pressure, obesity or diabetes. Younger patients who develop complications may begin struggling a little later, as late as days 10 to 12. Most people who reach day 14 without any worrying symptoms (other than feeling miserable and fatigued) are likely to be on the road to recovery.\n\n\"With any other disease, most people, after a week of symptoms, they're like 'OK, things will get better,'\" said Dr. Leora Horwitz, associate professor of population health and medicine at N.Y.U. Langone Health. \"With Covid, I tell people that around a week is when I want you to really pay attention to how you're feeling. Don't get complacent and feel like it's all over.\"\n\nIt's important to call a doctor if you have shortness of breath or any concerning symptom no matter what day of illness you are on. And don't panic if you still feel lousy after a week of illness. It's common for Covid symptoms to linger, and feeling unwell for more than a week doesn't always mean you need medical treatment.\n\nBut tracking symptoms and paying special attention as the illness nears its second week has taken on new urgency as more doctors are seeing patients arriving at the hospital with an insidious form of pneumonia. On scans, patients with Covid pneumonia have a finding called \"ground-glass opacities,\" a hazy appearance in the lower part of both lungs. Oxygen levels may drop so slowly that the patient doesn't even notice, a condition called silent hypoxia. Often it is not until oxygen saturation reaches dangerously low levels, causing severe shortness of breath, that they finally seek care.\n\nThe best way to monitor your health during this time is to use a pulse oximeter, a small device that clips on your finger and measures your blood oxygen levels. (There are phone-based apps meant to do this, but they have tested poorly) The normal oxygen saturation range is about 96 to 99 percent. If your blood oxygen reading drops to 92 percent, it's time to call a doctor.\n\nWhile at home, you can also increase the flow of oxygen to your lungs by not resting on your back. Resting on your stomach, in the prone position, can open parts of the lungs that are compressed when lying on your back. You can also change to resting on your left side or right side, or sit upright in a chair.\n\nDr. Anna Marie Chang, an associate professor of emergency medicine and director of clinical research at Thomas Jefferson University, was sick for about a week before her oxygen levels dropped to 88 on the ninth day of her illness. She went to the hospital and was treated with oxygen and rested mostly in the prone position for four days to recover.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. 3.8 million more workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, and that's probably an undercount. Federal social-distancing guidelines are 'fading out' as dismal economic news adds to the pressure to reopen. Trump officials are said to have pushed spies to hunt for unproven links between the virus and a lab in Wuhan. See more updates Updated 13m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nIt's not clear why relatively young, healthy patients like Dr. Chang, who is 38, sometimes take a turn for the worse.\n\n\"The first part is viral illness and everything else,\" said Dr. Chang. \"Your body is developing your immune inflammatory response and trying to fight off infection. That system can get over stimulated, and that seems to be what causes the acute worsening. We're seeing that around days seven to 10.\"\n\nDr. Chang cautioned that patients should listen to their bodies and not be too strict about following a timeline of symptoms. \"The human body does not follow the perfect manual,\" she said.\n\nThe problem, say doctors, is that the public health guidance so far has been to tell patients to ride out the illness at home and seek medical care or return only if they experience severe shortness of breath. As a result, too many patients are waiting too long to contact a doctor.\n\n\"From a public health perspective, we've been wrong to tell people to come back only if they have severe shortness of breath,\" said Dr. Richard Levitan, a well-known emergency room doctor from New Hampshire who has called for widespread use of home pulse oximeters during the first two weeks of Covid-19 illness. \"Toughing it out is not a great strategy.\"\n\nDr. Levitan notes that while many patients may take a turn for the worse five to 10 days into the illness, he hesitates to be too specific about the timeline because not every patient is clear about exactly what day their illness began.\n\n\"Patients will sometimes define a time course of illness differently than what you would expect,\" Dr. Levitan said. \"When you ask someone how long have you been sick, I find a patient says a few days and his wife will say, no, he's been sick for a week.\"\n\nBut what if you don't have a home pulse oximeter to monitor your health? The devices are now in short supply or can take weeks to be delivered.\n\nSome medical practices are sending their patients home kits that include pulse oximeters, so check with your doctor about how you might be monitored. Ask friends now if they have a pulse oximeter so you have a plan in place to borrow one for two weeks should you get sick (the device is easily sanitized).\n\nIf you are still feeling lousy a week into your illness and don't have a pulse oximeter, you can also check in with an urgent care clinic and ask them to check your oxygen level. If you are concerned, talk to your doctor about whether a visit to an urgent care center or the emergency room is warranted.\n\nIn the absence of a pulse oximeter, one rough measure of respiratory function is a self-test called the Roth score. It requires the patient to take a breath and try counting to 30. If a patient can't make it to the number 10 (or seven seconds) without another breath, it's likely their oxygen level has dropped below 95. If they can't count to the number 7 (or five seconds), their oxygen score may be below 90 percent. The test is not perfect, nor has it been studied in Covid-19. A University of Oxford team said the Roth score should not be used because it hasn't been validated and could give false reassurance.\n\nAnother physical but subtle sign of falling oxygen: Patients may start taking short, fast breaths to compensate, although they may not notice they are doing it. Patients with low oxygen levels might also have a blue tinge to their lips or skin. That's why a video conference with your doctor can be helpful if you're not sure about whether you need to go to the hospital.\n\nHere's a look at the timeline of Covid symptoms. While this can serve as a general guide, symptoms can appear at any time. Always listen to your body and consult with a doctor for guidance about your specific case.\n\nDays 1 to 3\n\nEarly symptoms of Covid-19 vary widely. It can start with a tickle in your throat, a cough, fever, headache and feeling winded or just a little pressure in your chest. Sometimes it begins with a bout of diarrhea. Some people just feel tired and lose their sense of taste and smell. Many people have several symptoms but no fever. Some patients with gastrointestinal symptoms go on to develop respiratory symptoms, while others don't.\n\nDays 4 to 6\n\nSome patients never develop more than mild symptoms, or none at all. Others begin to feel terrible, with an ever-present fever, aches, chills, cough and an inability to get comfortable.\n\nSome children and younger adults with mild disease may develop rashes, including itchy red patches, swelling or blistering on the toes or fingers, similar to frostbite. The exact timing isn't clear, and the symptom may appear early in the infection or after it has passed. That's what happened to Dr. Schwartz, who developed respiratory symptoms and then blisters on his feet. \"It seems that a lot of these individuals, including myself, test negative\" on coronavirus swab tests, he said. \"I presume it's a false negative. It could be that what we're seeing is an immunological phenomenon that occurs after the initial infection is on the mend.\"\n\nDays 7 to 8\n\nFor some lucky patients with mild illness, the worst is over after a week. Guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say patients whose symptoms have improved and who haven't had a fever for three days can leave isolation.\n\nBut some patients who have felt terrible continue to feel terrible or get worse. And some patients might start to feel better briefly then take a turn for the worse.\n\nPatients should monitor their oxygen levels and check in with a doctor if they start to feel unwell. \"We should instruct patients to have a lower threshold for contacting their doctor,\" Dr. Levitan said. \"I believe they should contact their physicians to have monitoring if they're feeling worse.\"\n\nDays 8 to 12\n\nMonitoring should continue for the second week of illness. Patients may feel better sleeping on their stomachs or sides.\n\n\"Days eight to 12 are when we have a really good idea if someone is going to get better or get worse,\" said Dr. Charles A. Powell, director of the Mount Sinai-National Jewish Health Respiratory Institute. \"The major thing we worry about is a worsening at eight to 12 days -- an increasing shortness of breath, worsening cough.\"\n\nDr. Powell said a home oxygen monitor can signal if someone needs to come in. Otherwise, patients should talk to their doctors.\n\n\"If it's difficult for the person at home to feel comfortable, and it's difficult for the family to feel things are manageable, that would lead a physician to suggest the patient come in for evaluation,\" said Dr. Powell. \"We don't want to wait too long for blood oxygen levels to get worse.\"\n\nDays 13 to 14\n\nPatients who had mild illness should be well recovered. Patients who had worse symptoms but maintained normal oxygen levels should feel mostly recovered after two weeks. However, patients with severe symptoms and those who needed additional treatment because of low oxygen may still feel unwell and fatigued and take longer to recover.",

        "body": "Good morning.\n\n(If you don't already get California Today by email, here's the sign-up.)\n\nToday, we have another dispatch from the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, written by Max Brimelow, Julie Chang, Pedro Cota, Kristen Hwang and Alex Matthews:\n\nOAKLAND -- In his 20 years in and out of homelessness, Ollie Harris, 69, has seen a lot of things. But what happened on a recent Friday was new.\n\nSitting outside his tent on a patch of ground he and his wife staked out near Lake Merritt, he watched a white van pull up and two women step out wearing surgical masks and latex gloves.\n\n\"Would you like to be tested today?\" one of them asked. \"I might as well,\" Mr. Harris replied. A nurse quickly swabbed Mr. Harris's nostrils and throat and then jotted down his information.\n\nMr. Harris was one of the first people tested under a new type of collaboration that has emerged as a distinctive feature in California's fight against Covid-19.\n\nSo far at least six new testing initiatives are led by health experts at California's top public and private universities. They aim to fill gaps in knowledge about the disease's prevalence, unravel mysteries about survivor immunity and answer other looming questions as California begins to ease its lockdown.\n\nSome universities are working independently, others in partnerships with county health departments and community clinics. Most are developing their plans on the fly as they race to get ahead of the fast-moving virus. So far, their work has raised as many questions as it has answered. But there have also been intriguing, if still tentative, findings.\n\nThe initiative that tested Mr. Harris, for example, has found just four positive cases out of the 233 homeless people it has tested so far. Another initiative found stark contrasts in infection rates based on whether a person was able to work from home or not. Other university-led studies suggest California remains a long way off from achieving the sort of herd immunity that would slow the virus's transmission from a gallop to a crawl.\n\n[See which California counties have the most coronavirus cases.]\n\nThe university health experts leading these efforts said they acted to fill a void. Eva Harris, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, Berkeley, said that watching the virus spread around the world while bickering government leaders hesitated to act was like witnessing the Titanic speeding toward the iceberg. \"We finally just said, 'OK, it hit,' and still nothing happened, so we need to get involved,\" she said.\n\nWhile governments at every level and in every region of the United States have struggled to provide enough testing, California has been notably sluggish.\n\nThe first known Covid-19 death in the United States happened on Feb. 6 in Santa Clara County. Three months later, government testing in the state remains spotty, in part because of its decentralized and tangled network of test providers spread across a population of 40 million. While California now conducts more than 30,000 tests per day -- compared with a few hundred a little more than a month ago -- only 26 of every 1,000 Californians have been tested, ranking the state 26th in the nation.\n\nAmong the vast numbers of the untested are many high-risk groups, but none more so than the 150,000 homeless people living throughout California. Their encampments, often crowded and lacking basic sanitation, could provide a place for the virus to flourish or rekindle.\n\nOne of the most aggressive efforts currently underway to examine the extent of infection in homeless encampments is being led by the Innovative Genomics Institute, a biochemistry lab at the University of California, Berkeley, best known for its work at the forefront of the CRISPR gene-editing process, and Lifelong Medical Care, a community health center also based in Berkeley. The two have begun expanding testing to low-income and homeless populations in Alameda County, including the test given to Mr. Harris at the Lake Merritt camp.\n\n[Read more about California's testing capacity.]\n\nThe institute offered Lifelong high-speed automated processing of 5,000 tests, with more to come. Lifelong, which serves about 66,000 patients, had performed fewer than 300 diagnostic tests before the partnership.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. W.H.O. gathers to push for global coordination amid a deepening rift between the U.S. and China.

See more updates Updated 14m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"If we can't help the vulnerable, what are we doing?\" asked Fyodor Urnov, the institute's scientific director for technology and translation.\n\nNot far from Dr. Urnov's office on the Berkeley campus, two professors in the School of Public Health have teamed up for a different kind of study. Dr. Harris, the infectious disease expert, and Lisa Barcellos, a genetic epidemiologist, are investigating the infection's spread throughout the Bay Area.\n\nThey are testing thousands of residents to look for the presence of active Covid-19 virus as well as antibodies in the blood. This could reveal patients who were exposed but never showed symptoms, and it could also shed light on how widespread the disease truly is in California.\n\nThe University of Southern California and Stanford University recently released preliminary results of their own antibody studies estimating that between 2 percent to 5 percent of the populations of Los Angeles County and Santa Clara County have been infected, higher than previously believed, but also a potential indicator that California is far away from achieving any possible herd immunity.\n\nHowever, both studies continue to draw attacks over unconventional methodologies, including the use of a test kit that is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAs first reported by BuzzFeed News, the Stanford study is now under scrutiny for not disclosing a potential conflict of interest.\n\nOne of the larger testing efforts comes from the University of California, San Francisco's Division of Infectious Diseases, which, in collaboration with community organizations and local health departments, recently concluded testing of nearly 5,000 people in two different communities -- the largely upscale oceanfront town of Bolinas in Marin County, and the Mission District in central San Francisco.\n\nThe two studies used diagnostic and antibody tests to understand how the virus moves through rural versus urban populations.\n\n[What are your chances of catching the virus outdoors? Here's what to know.]\n\nU.C.S.F. chose the Mission because the community's Latinx population was hit hard in the initial outbreak. Bolinas became part of the university's research focus when two of its residents, Cyrus Harmon, a biotech executive, and Jyri Engestr\u00f6m, a venture capitalist, proposed to get every person in their town tested. When they consulted U.C.S.F. for guidance, they were brought into the university's Covid-19 testing program for comparison with the Mission study.\n\nInitial results released in early May correlate the highest infection rates to low-wage and essential workers who, for economic reasons, have no choice but to work outside the home.\n\nOf the 2,959 people tested in the Mission, 62 tested positive. Of those who tested positive, 90 percent said they were unable to work from home and nearly as many said they earn less than $50,000 a year. Ninety five percent of those who tested positive were Latinx, although only 44 percent of the overall sample were Latinx.\n\nOf the 1,845 people tested in Bolinas, none tested positive.\n\n\"The virus exploits pre-existing vulnerabilities in our society,'' Diane Havlir, a physician involved in the U.C.S.F. study, said.\n\nCalifornia Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\n\"Unreasonably dark joke,\" read a coronavirus meme circulating on social media in recent weeks. \"Shouldn't we wait until after the pandemic to fill out the census?\"\n\nThe joke is dark, yes. But is it any darker than countless other coronavirus memes out there?\n\nEven more pointed is a spoof movie poster for \"Weekend at Bernie's,\" the 1989 film comedy about two buddies toting around a dead man on their partying adventures, called \"Weekend at Boris.\" It cast as the corpse Boris Johnson, the British prime minister, who at that point was still in intensive care for Covid-19, as the corpse.\n\nSince the pandemic took hold, the internet has been awash with coronavirus-centric joke memes, Twitter wisecracks and self-produced comedy sketches shot with smartphones in shelter-in-place kitchens and living rooms. And that's not counting what's happening in private conversations during quarantine.\n\nLaughing while others die may seem inappropriate, even tasteless, like concentration camp prisoners cracking jokes during the Holocaust. But in fact many did, according to a 2017 documentary, \"The Last Laugh.\"\n\nThroughout history, humor has played a role in the darkest times, as a psychological salve and shared release. Large swaths of the population are living in isolation, instructed to eye with suspicion any stranger who wanders within six feet. And coronavirus jokes have become a form of contagion themselves, providing a remaining thread to the outside world for the isolated -- and perhaps to sanity itself.\n\nBut who, or what, is an appropriate target for satire during a pandemic?\n\nYou can't laugh at the sick or dying, obviously, except in the main. \"A year from now, you'll all be laughing about this virus,\" reads one recent meme. \"Not all of you, obviously.\"\n\nThe virus itself deserves scorn and mockery, being the source of all this misery, although it is an elusive target, being inanimate and invisible. (\"I love being outdoors, crowded places and food markets,\" read a fake Tinder profile for \"Coronavirus, 29.\")\n\nAs late-night hosts like Seth Meyers and Trevor Noah have shown, politicians who seem to prioritize votes over lives are easily mocked. So too are other perceived villains of the pandemic that require no microscope to see: six-foot-space-cushion violators, say, or toilet-paper hoarders.\n\n\"What's next?\" Mr. Noah joked in a segment a few weeks ago about people getting into fistfights at supermarkets over jumbo packs of Charmin. \"Are people going to be running around Walmart, like, 'Ahhh, where's the car wax?'\"\n\nJudas on Zoom\n\nIn many ways, we are all our own best source of humor, racked with anxiety as we sit cloistered at home, surrounded by either too few people or too many. With little contact with the outside world beyond our smartphones, our jokey coronavirus memes and videos are like the S.O.S. messages that a bearded castaway fashions in the sand with rocks and seashells.\n\nSo far, quarantine humor tends to revolve around the same topics: overeating, marital bickering, sex (either too much or too little) and binge drinking.\n\n\"Your quarantine alcoholic name is your first name followed by your last name,\" reads one meme recently posted to a private Facebook group moderated by Lori Day, an educational psychologist and consultant in Newburyport, Mass., devoted to pandemic-themed videos and memes. Others show Jesus conducting the Last Supper via Zoom (\"Judas, you on?\"), or pleas for people to wash their hands because \"Covid-19 doesn't kill itself ... just like Epstein.\"\n\n\"It's the kind of edgy humor people don't feel comfortable putting on their own Facebook wall, for the risk of having their parents say, 'How could you?'\" Ms. Day, 56, said.\n\nTasteless or not, virus jokes provide her a fleeting distraction, and a needed smile, as the pandemic has put her life -- and consulting business -- on hold. \"It's very similar to the feeling I get looking at baby animals online, which is another thing I dose myself liberally with these days,\" Ms. Day said.\n\nThe same goes for other members of the group. Some members are ill with Covid-19. \"They're thanking me from their beds,\" she said. \"They're thanking me from their hospital rooms.\"\n\nHumor can divide as well as unite generations, made plain on the social media each favors. Baby boomers and Gen-Xers seem to be gravitating toward we're-all-in-this-together observational humor in the memes they post to Facebook (\"Anyone else starting to get a tan from the light in your refrigerator?\"), or gags that focus on specific villains (foot-dragging political leaders, say) and implicit solutions (throw the bums out!). \"Calm down, everyone,\" reads one such meme. \"A six-time bankrupted reality TV star is handling the situation.\"\n\nAs The Cut recently noted, the outpouring of coronavirus content among Generation Z types on TikTok runs the gamut: disgust, resignation, frustration, despair and hope. One could also add: barely-concealed nihilism, perhaps a response to the discovery that members of that generation are coming of age in a world that suddenly seems even more messed up than already thought.\n\nIn one TikTok video, by a 20-year-old in California named Andreas, his mother finds him still in bed at 4 p.m. as he sings, \"Oh hi, thanks for checking in, I'm still a piece of garbage.\"\n\nComedy professionals, meanwhile, have found it challenging to stay relevant and connected to their audiences as show business has ground to a halt.\n\nStephen Colbert and Mr. Noah, for example, have broadcast shows from their homes during the lockdown, without the reassuring rhythm of audible applause. \"On behalf of the socially anxious everywhere, let me just say, 'Way ahead of you,'\" Mr. Colbert said, dressed at least in the top half of a suit while submerged in a bubble bath at home. \"I've been avoiding human contact since before it was cool.\"\n\nTwo comedians -- Taylor Tomlinson, 26, and Sam Morril, 33 -- have turned their unexpected cohabitation in Los Angeles, after six months of dating, into comedy with a web series on Instagram called \"Quarantined as a New Couple.\"\n\nWith their standup careers on hold and potential audience members feeling simultaneously bored out of their minds and freaked out, they had little choice of material. \"People want to just take their minds off of it for a second,\" Ms. Tomlinson said, \"but it's also hard to think about anything else.\"\n\nIn one recent episode, Ms. Tomlinson suggests they watch the 2011 Steven Soderbergh film \"Contagion,\" about a deadly viral pandemic, that is currently a popular streaming option. Mr. Morril finds the suggestion insane.\n\n\"No way,\" says Mr. Morril, who is Jewish. \"We're in the midst of a tragedy. You need some distance before it becomes entertainment. That would be like if the Jews watched 'Schindler's List' during the Holocaust.\"\n\nSpeaking of Which ...\n\n\"Every day at the Art Cafe on Leszno Street, one can hear songs and satires of the police, the ambulence service, the rickshas, and even the Gestapo, in veiled fashion,\" wrote Mary Berg, a 15-year-old trapped by Nazis in the Jewish ghetto in Warsaw, in a diary entry from Oct. 29, 1941. \"The typhus epidemic itself is the subject of jokes. It is laughter through tears, but it is laughter. This is our only weapon in the ghetto.\"\n\nThat passage was included in \"The Last Laugh,\" a documentary about the role of humor among Jews during, and after, the Holocaust, which included interviews with survivors as well as commentary by Sarah Silverman and Mel Brooks, who once termed Jewish jokes about Nazis \"revenge through ridicule.\"\n\nFerne Pearlstein, the director of the film, said in an email that while doing research for it she and her team \"found that humor was not uncommon -- and was used as a coping mechanism in a situation of almost unimaginable horror, as a means of self-defense, a counterattack for people who had few, if any, other ways of fighting back, and even as just simple diversion.\"\n\nOne Auschwitz survivor, Renee Firestone, says in the film that she could not help but see the bleak irony after the infamous Nazi physician Josef Mengele told her during an examination: \"if you survive this war, you better have your tonsils removed.\" (Mengele was part of the SS machine that sent Jews to their death.)\n\n\"The instinct to laugh shows that we were still human beings while in the camps,\" Ms. Firestone says, adding, \"this inner sense of humor is what kept me alive.\"\n\nAnd soldiers in World War I would joke as they dug through muddy trenches, unearthing body parts of former comrades, as recounted in a 2014 episode of \"Hardcore History\" a popular podcast by Dan Carlin.\n\nThe episode quoted front-line accounts from the celebrated British wartime journalist Philip Gibbs: \"'Bit of Bill,' said the leading man, putting in the leg. 'Another bit of Bill,' he said, unearthing a hand. 'Bill's ugly mug,' he said at a later stage in the operation, when a head was found.\"\n\n\"As told afterwards, that little episode in the trenches seemed immensely comic,\" Mr. Gibbs added. \"Generals chuckled over it, chaplains treasured it.\"\n\nFar further back, the bubonic plague of the 14th century, known as the Black Death, killed large swaths of the population of Europe, but also spawned the pointed satire of the Church and other authorities in \"Decameron,\" by Boccaccio. The classic collection of novellas concerns a group of young people who flee pestilence-ridden Florence for a series of villas in the countryside (much like rich New Yorkers helicoptering off to the Hamptons in the current pandemic).\n\n\"Theirs was a world in which anyone with any modicum of wit should grasp what pleasure could be found in a hostile environment in which God's grace seemed absent and man's good will was far from certain,\" wrote Nancy M. Reale, a professor of liberal studies at New York University, in an email.\n\nIf those examples seem a little far away, consider how in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Graydon Carter, the Vanity Fair editor, said: \"I think it's the end of the age of irony.\" It was a pronouncement that lasted basically until the next evening's broadcast of \"The Daily Show\" with Jon Stewart, who mercilessly lampooned the nation's mass panic over an ever-present \"America Freaks Out\" chyron.\n\nNervous Laughter\n\nThere is a reason laughter has long been considered the best medicine. It releases bursts of dopamine, a hormone and neurotransmitter that signals pleasure and reward, and studies have indicated that it also can improve blood flow, immune response, pain tolerance and might even shorten hospital stays, said Scott Weems, a cognitive neuroscientist and the author of \"Ha! The Science of When We Laugh and Why.\"\n\n\"My favorite study even found that watching 'Friends' reduced anxiety significantly more than simply resting, which should make those of us watching a lot of Netflix lately feel a little better,\" Dr. Weems said.\n\nBut there's more to it than that. Apes, dogs, even rats laugh, often as a way of expressing anxiety over new and uncomfortable situations, Dr. Weems said.\n\nHumans, too, laugh as a way of dealing with awkward or unfamiliar situations -- colloquially known as nervous laughter -- which certainly describes the mood in the current pandemic. \"We've adopted this simple physical response as a way of sharing anxiety or confusion in a social way,\" Dr. Weems said.\n\nAnd not for nothing is laughter sometimes referred to as \"infectious.\" In a 2000 article for Psychology Today, Robert Provine, then a professor of psychology at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who spent a decade studying the science of laughter, described a mysterious outbreak of it at a girls' boarding school in Tanzania in 1962 that started with three girls giggling on Jan. 30.\n\n\"The symptoms quickly spread to 95 students, forcing the school to close on March 18,\" wrote Dr. Provine, who died in 2019. \"The girls sent home from the school were vectors for the further spread of the epidemic. Related outbreaks occurred in other schools in Central Africa and spread like wildfire, ceasing two-and-a-half years later and afflicting nearly 1,000 people.\"\n\nSound familiar?\n\nJust kidding.",

If she lost either tissue in the bedclothes, she would mewl, plaintively, \"Fresh tisssuueeeeeeee,\" until someone brought her a new one.\n\nI thought this was a unique weirdness, but it turns out that little kids fixate on inanimate objects fairly regularly. This week, Annie Gabillet explores why your preschooler wants to cuddle with a toothbrush and why we should pay attention to the objects our toddlers choose to nuzzle -- it's fascinating.\n\nAlso this week, Dr. Grace Farris, M.D., a New York City doctor treating Covid-19 patients in the E.R., has a beautiful, heart-rending essay about what it's been like to be away from her two children for the past month. She and her husband sent their boys to live with their grandmother so they would not be infected. \"I'm eager to know when I can scoop them up, sniff the tops of their heads and prepare snack plates that they won't eat,\" Grace wrote.\n\nThere's more: a comforting piece about why you shouldn't agonize about screen time; silent signs your kid may be stressed that you should be looking out for; and a delightful look at how llamas became the new hot toy -- they're relatably quirky (llamas, they're just like us!).\n\nWe want to hear from you: What's the weirdest inanimate object your kid has brought to bed?

        "body": "Monday: Officials are calculating risks ahead of fire season. Also: Beach closures were met with protest.\n\nGood morning.\n\n(Here's the sign-up, if you don't already get California Today delivered to your inbox.)\n\nToday, we have another dispatch from the University of California, Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism, written by Will McCarthy:\n\nIn the mountains of California, snow is melting, the days are ticking closer to fire season and officials responsible for fighting wildfires face an agonizing choice: Exacerbate the current crisis, or pile risk on to the next one.\n\nThis is the season when California's forests are thinned out with controlled burns to reduce the devastation that has become all too common during the fall wildfire season. But the smoke generated by setting fire to thousands of acres this spring could be lethal for Covid-19 victims fighting for every breath.\n\nWhile thousands have recovered, hospitals are caring for nearly 4,000 Covid-19 patients, with at least 1,100 in intensive care. Untold numbers more are suffering at home. Worse still, the effects of heavy smoke -- pneumonia, asthma, bronchitis -- are felt most acutely by older people with underlying health problems, the population most at risk from Covid-19.\n\n[Track every coronavirus case in California by county.]\n\n\"It's a hard call,\" said Dr. Mary Prunicki, who researches air pollution at Stanford University. \"It does put smoke into the air. But the downside is, 'Are we going to have bigger wildfires in the fall?'\"\n\nForestry officials have taken divergent approaches to this dilemma.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service, which oversees about 57 percent of the forest lands in California, halted its prescribed burns throughout the state for six weeks. When the decision was announced in March, a spokesman said that postponing burns \"will prevent any effects from smoke that might further worsen conditions for those who are at risk in our communities.\"\n\nYet a different branch of the federal government, the Bureau of Land Management, which manages more than a million acres in California, did not halt its controlled burns, nor did Cal Fire, the state agency charged with combating wildfires on land not under federal control.\n\n\"What is Covid-19? A respiratory issue,\" Scott McLean, a spokesman for Cal Fire, said. \"We're not na\u00efve to that, but we have to provide for the well-being of the public.\"\n\nThe contradictory policies reflect an absence of coordination between the agencies most directly responsible for fighting wildfires in California. According to Mr. McLean, the Forest Service did not consult with Cal Fire on its decision to suspend controlled burns. \"We found out when the news release came out,\" he said.\n\nBut the dueling approaches also reflected starkly different calculations of risk.\n\nForest Service officials said they were concerned that assembling a work force to conduct the burns would expose traveling employees to the virus and potentially contribute to its spread. They also raised doubts about how their fire crews could tend to burns while also abiding by social distancing directives.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. President Trump stepped up criticism of China, part of an international backlash over the outbreak. J. Crew becomes first major retailer to declare bankruptcy; Disney's empire faces vast challenges. The Supreme Court will hear arguments by conference call, and the public will be able to listen. See more updates Updated 16m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\nThey said they would continue to use other methods -- such as removing brush by hand and with heavy machinery -- that reduce combustible forest fuel without generating smoke.\n\nOn Friday, however, the Forest Service changed course and announced it would resume controlled burns in California \"as conditions and resources permit.\"\n\n\"We will continue to prioritize the health and safety of communities and firefighters during this global and national emergency, and will also conduct prescribed fire where feasible as an important tool to protect communities,\" Randy Moore, a Forest Service official, said in a statement.\n\nCal Fire plans to burn roughly 3,200 acres over the next two months. Its risk calculations have been influenced by recent catastrophes such as the 2018 Camp Fire, which killed 86 people in Paradise and surrounding towns, and last fall's wildfires, which left huge portions of the state without power for days at a time.\n\nAt the same time, officials at Cal Fire said they were taking steps to limit the health effects from their controlled burns, such as analyzing wind conditions to make sure smoke will not blow toward hospitals. Each burn, which can range in size from a few acres to several hundred, also requires advance approval from local air quality management boards, which in turn typically consult with local public health agencies.\n\nOfficials from several air quality boards and public health agencies downplayed the harm that controlled burns could inflict on those infected with Covid-19. \"If they're fighting for every breath, they're in the hospital and not exposed to the smoky air,\" said Lisa Almaguer, a spokeswoman for the Butte County public health department. \"If they have moderate to severe symptoms then they're home and in bed.\"\n\nState and local officials repeatedly argued that whatever the risks of controlled burns, failing to thin forests today could create conditions for a far greater calamity come fall. Dave Winnacker, chief of the Moraga-Orinda fire district east of Berkeley, worries what would happen if a failure to do adequate controlled burns means more intense wildfires in a few months. If Covid-19 is still a menace, what will that mean for the thousands of firefighters assembled to battle those wildfires, often in close quarters, often to the point of exhaustion? How will those firefighters evacuate thousands of residents while adhering to social distancing?\n\n\"Covid-19 has crowded out every other thing that people have the capacity to worry about,\" he said. \"But that doesn't mean the fire season is going to take a year off.\"\n\nMany residents of California know all too well what it is to suffer ongoing respiratory problems from fire seasons past. Laura Whitaker, a former resident of Paradise, said her lungs have never been the same since she survived the Camp Fire. \"I remember feeling that my lungs were full and that I couldn't breathe,\" she said. \"It felt like drowning.\"\n\nIn the years since, Ms. Whitaker said she could tell from her lungs when controlled burns begin anew. \"The smoke, definitely, it gets to me pretty badly,\" she said. And having just gotten over a bout of pneumonia, she said she was afraid this year's burns will make her more vulnerable to the novel coronavirus. \"When I heard that it affects the lungs, it puts the fear into you,\" she said.\n\nHer fears are well grounded, experts said. \"As you batter the lungs, which is what's happening when you breathe wildfire smoke, the defense mechanisms get overwhelmed,\" said Katharine Hammond, a professor of environmental health sciences at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n\"There's a big difference if there's a little bit of smoke or a lot of smoke,\" she added. \"Those are trade-offs that need to be carefully thought through.\"\n\nHere's what you may have missed over the weekend\n\nAfter Gov. Gavin Newsom moved to close beaches in Orange County, The Los Angeles Times reported that protesters showed up in droves to defy the order.\n\nThey were part of wider demonstrations against stay-at-home orders, including in Sacramento, that have been increasingly driven by antivaccination activists, The New York Times reported.\n\nOn Friday, Mr. Newsom sought to reassure restless Californians, saying that statewide restrictions would be eased in coming days.\n\nIn the meantime, neighbors have come together in new ways, as The Times shows in this visual piece. In Los Angeles, for instance, once-anonymous neighbors are picking and donating citrus.\n\nCalifornia Today goes live at 6:30 a.m. Pacific time weekdays.

        "body": "The pandemic pushed Medicare to make telemedicine more financially attractive. Now doctors, patients and regulators will see if they want to stick with it.\n\nIn late March, Mary Jane Sturgis got a call from her primary-care physician's office, saying that her doctor was working from home during the Covid-19 crisis and suggesting an alternative for her scheduled checkup. Would Ms. Sturgis agree to a video appointment on Zoom?\n\n\"I didn't know what Zoom was,\" Ms. Sturgis recalled. \"But I said if I could figure it out, sure.\"\n\nA retired college administrator, she contends with ailments that put her at high risk from the new coronavirus. Several autoimmune conditions. Damaged lungs, caused by radiation for breast cancer and requiring daily nebulizer and inhaler use. At 77, age itself.\n\nShe already found it tiring to drive half an hour from her home in Media, Pa., to Dr. Lisa Sardanopoli's office at Lankenau Medical Center; now, walking into a hospital also seemed dangerous.\n\nThe transition to telemedicine initially proved a bit rocky. Ms. Sturgis could see her doctor on Zoom. \"But I couldn't hear her,\" Ms. Sturgis said. \"And she couldn't see or hear me.\"\n\nSo at her doctor's texted suggestion, they switched to FaceTime, familiar to Ms. Sturgis from video chats with her grandchildren. \"I was surprised at how well it worked,\" she said.\n\nMs. Sturgis missed the way Dr. Sardanopoli sometimes placed a reassuring hand on hers when she worried. Otherwise, \"It felt like we were sitting and talking together as usual.\"\n\nAt the end of their appointment, \"I said: 'Do I send you money? How do I pay for this?'\" Ms. Sturgis recalled. \"She said, 'It's covered by Medicare.'\"\n\nJust weeks earlier, that would not have been true. For years, advocates and researchers have urged greater use of telemedicine -- delivered by video or phone, through online patient portals or remote monitoring devices -- particularly for older adults.\n\nBut Medicare adoption was slow. The Government Accountability Office reported in 2017 that just one percent of beneficiaries, most in rural areas, received care through telemedicine (a term used interchangeably with telehealth).\n\nThen came Covid-19 and its lockdowns, sending both small practices and major health systems scrambling to give patients access to health care without face-to-face contact. In response, federal agencies loosened restrictions and regulations, at least temporarily, that had stalled telemedicine for decades.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. New federal data is expected to show economic carnage caused by collapse of commerce. Trump will be tested daily after an aide was found to have the virus. Funding for small businesses has faltered. The Times tracked where some of the money has gone so far. See more updates Updated 2m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"This crisis has forced us to change how we deliver health care more in 20 days than we had in 20 years,\" said Dr. Robert McLean, a past president of the American College of Physicians, as well as an internist and rheumatologist with Northeast Medical Group in Connecticut.\n\nThough some practices and systems never acquired the necessary technology, Dr. McLean said, the major barrier to telehealth had been financial. \"It just wasn't getting paid for adequately,\" he said.\n\nIn traditional Medicare, payment had been lower than for in-person visits, a sure way to discourage use. (Most Medicare Advantage plans already covered some telehealth services; each plan determines what it pays for them.)\n\n\"Health care systems and hospitals are businesses,\" said Dr. Sirina Keesara, who researches health system design at Stanford University and co-authored a recent editorial in The New England Journal of Medicine. \"If they don't have a financial incentive to change, they'll stick with what they know.\"\n\nMedicare's restrictions hampered adoption in other ways, too. It limited services to rural patients and usually required them to travel to a clinic or office, rather than participate from home. It covered some services for \"established\" patients but not new ones, or insisted on office visits before it would reimburse for subsequent telehealth.\n\nBut in March, citing the need for flexibility in face of the coronavirus pandemic, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services removed those barriers. It also added scores of new telehealth services it would cover, including emergency-room visits, initial and discharge visits at nursing homes and remote monitoring for chronic conditions. And it agreed to pay the same rates as for in-person care.\n\nIt maintained a lower rate, at first, for audio-only phone visits. Professional associations objected, arguing that this policy reinforced the so-called digital divide, depriving older adults of remote care if they lacked computers, smartphones or broadband. \"People who rely on a landline cannot do video visits,\" Dr. McLean said.\n\nOn April 30, that obstacle fell, too, as Medicare agreed to reimburse equally for visits in person, by video or by phone.\n\nAnd another major hurdle was removed by the Department of Health and Human Services, which, in March, temporarily relaxed enforcement of HIPAA, the federal patient privacy law. It will waive penalties when providers use everyday platforms like FaceTime or Skype, which aren't HIPAA-compliant.\n\nDoctors and patients still need to be in the same room for some appointments, of course. Certain conditions mandate physical examination. \"Sometimes we need to have life-changing conversations,\" added Dr. Andrea Jonas, a pulmonologist and critical-care specialist at Stanford University and a co-author of The New England Journal editorial. \"Those are harder to do via telehealth.\"\n\nStill, by mid-April more than 20 percent of people over 70 had experienced a telehealth appointment since the start of the pandemic, a nationwide survey by NORC at the University of Chicago found. Almost half said they found the experience equivalent to an in-person visit; about 40 percent said it was worse.\n\nIn interviews, patients told me of similarly mixed reactions.\n\nLast month, Debra Reed, a management consultant in Ojai, Calif., sat in on her husband's Zoom visit with his internist in Santa Barbara. Her husband, 86, has dementia and is recovering from a stroke. \"It was odd and unsatisfying, unsettling,\" Ms. Reed said of the encounter. \"It leaves one lacking.\"\n\nDiana Hamlet-Cox felt differently. Her 89-year-old father, who recently moved in with her and her husband in Goodyear, Ariz., has had half a dozen video or phone appointments -- with a urologist, a psychotherapist, a neurosurgeon.\n\n\"I was glad we didn't have to drive 25 miles to wait in a building with other people and all those surfaces to touch,\" Ms. Hamlet-Cox said. \"I thought, why didn't they do this sooner?\"\n\nWhether Medicare will stick with these changes -- temporary measures allowed during the public health emergency -- is uncertain. A press officer said the agency would assess its policies after the pandemic ebbs. It will need to address concerns about privacy and fraud.\n\n\"I think there's going to be huge pressure to abandon all this,\" said Dr. Kevin Schulman, a hospitalist and economist at Stanford University and a co-author of The New England Journal editorial. \"Providers will want to go back to the way we used to do it.\"\n\nThe authors called for research to determine how well telehealth works during the pandemic.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease don't fare better using telehealth, for instance. \"Perhaps patients were encouraged to stay home instead of going to emergency rooms with more severe symptoms,\" Dr. Jonas said.\n\nFor now, though, expanded Medicare telehealth coverage is giving patients a glimpse of a different future, and some of them like it.\n\nMary Jane Sturgis, for instance. Last month, she began to fear that if she contracted Covid-19, she'd be hospitalized and placed on a ventilator without her consent; she asked Dr. Sardanopoli for an appointment to discuss her end-of-life wishes.\n\nThey spent half an hour on FaceTime, talking through the options, untroubled by their physical distance.\n\n\"I knew what I wanted, and she was completely respectful of that,\" Ms. Sturgis said. \"I felt better and calmer afterward.\"\n\n[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]",

        "body": "The chronic condition, typically thought of as an 'adult' problem, can affect up to 3 percent of kids between 3 and 7.\n\nA couple of years ago, long before the novel coronavirus was a threat, my son started calling out to us soon after we tucked him in at night. Sometimes he would ask for an extra kiss, back rub or drink of water. All normal for a 5-year-old. But occasionally, he would report that his room looked funny. \"Things that are close look far,\" he would say. \"And things that are far look close.\"\n\nWhen he continued to periodically describe his room like it was full of fun house mirrors, my husband decided it was time for an internet search. Alice in Wonderland syndrome, a neurological condition that causes a distorted sense of perception, came up as a potential cause. That was intriguing to us because condition can be affiliated with migraines. My son occasionally complains of headaches that I have always attributed to dehydration, congestion or bonks on the head. Even though I get migraines, I never considered them possible in a kindergartner.\n\nIt turns out headaches -- including migraines -- are more common in early childhood than I thought. By middle school, about 80 percent of kids have experienced a headache of some kind, often because of stress, a virus or another cause, said Scott Powers, Ph.D., a pediatric psychologist and co-director of the Headache Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.\n\nMigraines generally involve a pounding type of pain that worsens with activity. Adult migraines typically cause pain on one side of the head while migraines in children tend to cause pain that stretches across the forehead. Migraines may also cause a person to feel nauseous or throw up. In some people, they also come with auras, or visual distortions that can appear like zigzag lines or flashing spots in adults. In children, auras might produce altered perceptions of size and color that appear in Alice-in-Wonderland syndrome.\n\nMigraines, which can start as early as infancy, occur in up to 3 percent of 3- to 7-year-olds, up to 11 percent in kids ages 7 to 11, and up to 23 percent by age 15 in the United States, according to some estimates. They become more common as children age, eventually splitting by gender. By adulthood, about 18 percent of women and 6 percent of men get them. Migraines are a chronic, often lifelong condition, Dr. Powers said, with data suggesting that the majority of children with migraines become adults with migraines.\n\nAs common as migraines are among children, and adults, there is no objective medical test to identify them and young people don't always have the verbal skills to describe their pain. Older kids may be dismissed as faking to get out of school. Even the most well-meaning parents may not realize that kids can get migraines, said Dr. Amy Gelfand, M.D., an associate professor of neurology and director of Pediatric Headache at the University of California, San Francisco. In her practice, she often diagnoses parents at the same time as she diagnoses their children.\n\nStill, with adequate care, most children can reduce the number and severity of migraines they experience. \"We are very good at getting kids with migraines better,\" Dr. Powers said. \"There's a lot of hope.\"\n\nMigraines are a neurological condition, Dr. Powers said, and people who get them also experience changes in the brain related to pain- and emotion-processing, although it's not clear whether one causes the other. Certain circumstances -- like sleep disruptions, dietary changes, bright lights, the glare of the sun or strong smells -- can bring on a migraine in those who are susceptible.\n\n\"The way I explain it to kids is that your brain is just a little more sensitive to things happening than someone who doesn't have migraine,\" Dr. Powers said. So if you get too much or too little sleep, or if you're dehydrated, \"your brain is like, 'Hey, I don't like that,'\" he said.\n\nAccording to Dr. Gelfand, migraines in children younger than 7 may last just two hours, shorter than adult migraines, which typically last anywhere from four to 72 hours.\n\nTo diagnose a migraine in children, experts suggest looking for clues in their behavior. They might point at or grab their head, climb into bed and hide under the covers, or ask to retreat to a dark, quiet room. A loss of appetite may be a sign of nausea. Family history is another sign: About 60 to 70 percent of people with migraines have a parent or sibling who has had them or may have had them, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\nBabies and toddlers can get migraines, which surprised Katrina Swenson, a mental health professional in Washington State and mother of a migraine sufferer who is 5. Looking back, she said, her son started showing symptoms of migraines before he turned 2. Out of nowhere, he would get upset and lie on the floor, then vomit, act tired and fall asleep. Because he has a motor speech disorder, which makes it hard for him to talk, he couldn't explain how he was feeling, though he would occasionally hit his eye or claw at the side of his face. Eventually, he learned to sign that his head hurt. But it wasn't until he was nearly 4 that an occupational therapist mentioned migraines as a possibility. He was diagnosed a few months later. \"For over four years, migraines never even occurred to me,\" Swenson said.\n\nIf you suspect migraines in a young child, health experts recommend scheduling an appointment with a pediatrician, who may suggest that you keep a headache diary, visit a specialist or get an imaging test to rule out other potential issues that can cause headaches, such as stroke, a congenital brain problem or meningitis. Red flags that suggest something else include weakness or numbness on one side of the body, seizures, or confusion during a headache, Dr. Gelfand said.\n\nDiagnosing migraines in young children can require creativity, and many clinics supplement evaluations by asking children to draw their headaches -- a technique that, studies suggest, can accurately predict diagnosis 90 percent of the time. In pictures drawn by his young migraine patients, Dr. Powers said he sees a lot of crying and other visual representations of intense pain. \"You'll see kids draw stick figures with something like a knife pounding the head,\" he said. \"It kind of gives you that sense that it's a pounding, throbbing pain.\"\n\nFor children of any age, ibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol) work best when given as soon as a migraine starts. If your child is older, a doctor might recommend other medications, including anti-nausea medications, a liquid antihistamine called cyproheptadine, or a class of medication called triptans, which are often used to treat migraines in adults and some of which are approved to treat children. Laying in a dark room, putting a cold washcloth on the child's forehead and other comfort measures can also help.\n\nIf your child gets migraines frequently, certain regular habits might stop them before they start. Ensure your child is: receiving three square meals (plus one or two snacks) per day; getting the recommended daily activity levels for their age; hydrating enough; and sticking to a predictable sleep schedule. Some evidence suggests that certain relaxation and cognitive behavioral techniques, like deep-breathing exercises, can help too, Dr. Powers said.\n\nResearchers also continue to study the basic science of how migraines work, with the hopes of developing more treatments and preventive techniques.\n\nAs for my son, now 7, he stopped seeing the world through the looking glass after a while, and we never confirmed Alice in Wonderland syndrome or migraines. Regardless, I have become more vigilant when he says he has a headache. Instead of discounting it as a sign of fatigue or a cold coming on, I consider whether it could be a migraine. We don't know yet for sure, but at least now, the possibility is there.",

        "body": "Technology with potentially the biggest impact is often humdrum stuff that drags businesses and government agencies into the age of Google Maps and Zoom.\n\nThis article is part of the On Tech newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it weekdays.\n\nOverwhelmed government bureaucracy and technology has failed Americans trying to apply for unemployment benefits or business loans.\n\nBut some government technology is holding up well in this crisis.\n\nI talked to two people overseeing 911 emergency response systems whose digital modernization -- not trivial for resource-strapped government agencies -- is helping the helpers help us.\n\nIn New Orleans, recent upgrades to emergency systems have enabled paramedics to do video call assessments of people with symptoms of a coronavirus infection. In Manatee County, Fla., emergency responders can now more precisely pinpoint people's location -- necessary when a call comes from a boat in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIf you're thinking these upgrades seem basic, you're right. We like to imagine fanciful technology feats, but you don't need flying cars to save lives.\n\nTechnology with potentially the biggest impact is often humdrum stuff that drags businesses and government agencies into the age of Google Maps and Zoom.\n\nA little tech can make big improvements. New Orleans was hit in March with a double whammy: Almost every call to 911 or its 311 information line was about the coronavirus, and at times, up to 60 percent of emergency responders were off work because of potential exposure to the virus.\n\nWith technology from a company called Carbyne, the city created a triage system on the fly. Emergency responders were dispatched as usual to people who required medical attention fast. Callers who were assessed as having less serious symptoms would get video calls from paramedics.\n\nThe technology allowed New Orleans to prioritize emergency resources to those in the most need, still help people who didn't require lifesaving interventions, and protect paramedics from unnecessary exposure to the virus, said Tyrell Morris, executive director of the Orleans Parish Communication District.\n\nIn Manatee County on Florida's west coast, technology helped solve a different, thorny problem: Cellphone location data isn't precise enough for 911 operators to know whether a call is coming from the 30th floor of an office building or the first, said Jacob Saur, the county's director of public safety.\n\nUsing technology from RapidDeploy, the operators now have more precise location data even if callers can't give their exact location. Recently, Saur said, 911 operators were able to track someone on a boat who didn't know where he was and needed help for a friend who had been hit in the head with an anchor.\n\nIn the future, the same system could let dispatchers message directly with callers. Saur said someone reporting a traffic accident or fire could stream video of the scene for emergency responders to better assess how to respond.\n\nBoth counties said these improvements wouldn't have been possible without efforts across the country to retrofit telephone-based emergency operations for the internet. Again, boring stuff, but it's expensive and nerve-racking to rebuild a public safety agency where there's zero margin for failure.\n\nTechnology is not a cure-all for overburdened institutions, nor can it replace smart leadership and effective bureaucracy. But as these examples show, it can help do more with less.\n\nFacebook wants you to never leave\n\nFacebook is trying to be a little bit eBay.\n\nThe company introduced a new feature Tuesday called Shops, which will let businesses promote and sell products on their Facebook and Instagram accounts.\n\nSounds like a website, right? Yup, for a long time, Facebook has been trying to recreate the internet entirely within its walls.\n\nI have no idea if businesses will use the Shops feature in large numbers. But there's a sensible idea at the root: Why should a local toy store maintain a website when it can repurpose a Facebook or Instagram account it probably already has?\n\nMy colleague Mike Isaac, who writes about Facebook, called Shops \"a website in a box.\"\n\nShops has similarities to WeChat, the do-everything app in China that's often the only digital presence for businesses in that country.\n\nMany small business owners consider it essential to have a presence on Facebook. Customers expect to find their favorite shops and restaurants on Facebook (and Google), but most American businesses won't ditch a website. That means drumming up attention and sales on Facebook can be one more draining, expensive and maddening task.\n\nMike said Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's co-founder and chief executive, called the shots on Shops himself. It's another sign of Zuckerberg taking control of decisions that he once considered below his pay grade.\n\nBefore we go ...\n\nThey remind me of Wall-E, and they're not super useful: My colleagues Cade Metz and Erin Griffith write about robots and drones that have helped deliver groceries and other essentials to people during the pandemic. The problem is the little guys can't carry very much -- a couple muffins or croissants, one customer said -- and robots function effectively only in ideal conditions where sidewalks are plentiful and mean teens don't kick them over. (I'll have a conversation with Cade in tomorrow's newsletter.)\n\nBigger than Taylor Swift and UFOs: Welp, here's a discouraging analysis by my colleagues: The slickly produced, nonsense-filled \"Plandemic\" conspiracy video has gotten more interaction on Facebook than any other moment of digital drama during the pandemic so far -- way more than Taylor Swift's concert announcement and the Pentagon's videos of mysterious \"aerial phenomena.\"\n\nHow badly do you want fried chicken? Cheetah Express is a delivery service on Instagram that ferries KFC orders from the West Bank to Israel and through multiple checkpoints to Gaza. Food arrives cold many hours later, but Cheetah Express has provided \"a rare opportunity to enjoy American fast food in one of the most isolated places on earth,\" says this article in the publication Rest of World.\n\nHugs to this\n\nThe Porter brothers do Irish step dances on TikTok, and they're awesome.\n\nWe want to hear from you.

        "body": "The Coronavirus Outbreak\n\nWhen Maine finally announced this week that hair salons could reopen, Sarah Kyllonen, a stylist in Lewiston, stayed up late wondering what to do, feeling overwhelmed.\n\nThe virus still scared her. It seemed too soon to open up. Then again, her bills had not stopped and her unemployment benefits had not started, and she was starting to worry about next month's rent.\n\nAround midnight on Thursday, she finally drifted off. But she woke an hour later, and didn't sleep much after that.\n\n\"It's an extremely hard decision for all of us,\" she said. \"I want to go back to work. I want to have the money. I want to see people. But it's hard because I'm worried about the virus coming back around.\"\n\nShe added: \"I can't get my mind off it. It's very stressful.\"\n\nAs states begin to loosen restrictions on their economies, the act of reopening has come down not to governors or even to President Trump, but to millions of individual Americans who are being asked to go back to work.\n\nIt is not an easy decision. In homes across the country this week, Americans whose governors said it was time to reopen wrestled with what to do, weighing what felt like an impossible choice.\n\nIf they go back to work, will they get sick and infect their families? If they refuse, will they lose their jobs? What if they work on tips and there are no customers? What happens to their unemployment benefits?\n\nUntil recently, only those designated as essential workers had to face such dilemmas. On Friday, as at least 10 additional states, including Texas, began to lift stay-at-home orders or reopen some businesses, more Americans ventured out of their doors to work, but often with a sense of dread -- that they were being forced to choose between their health and their livelihood.\n\nLarge majorities still approve of shutdown orders as a way to protect public health, but the tremendous surge of jobless claims since mid-March has created a crosscurrent: An urgent need for income.\n\nThe hyperpartisan wrangling between Mr. Trump and governors over whether to reopen has obscured the way many Americans are thinking about the issue. They are not always neatly dividing into two political tribes, with Republicans wanting to see restrictions lifted and Democrats wanting to remain shut down. Even within each person there can be conflicting instincts.\n\nAndrea Pinson hasn't been paid since March 18, the last day she worked at her job at a bingo hall in Fort Worth, taking customers' orders and cooking and serving their meals. But earlier this week, she received a short text from her boss, telling her to show up for work on Friday, when Texas reopened restaurants, shops, churches and other gathering places.\n\nThe demand was direct -- be there at 5 p.m. -- and Ms. Pinson, 33, was agonizing over how to respond. If she stayed home, she could lose wages or even her job. If she went to work, she risked bringing the coronavirus back to her great-uncle, 73, who lives with her and has health conditions.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. As many businesses open their doors around the country, some governors face growing resistance. It's college acceptance day. But a lot of students appear to be avoiding the big decision. More than 4,000 workers in meatpacking plants have the coronavirus, the C.D.C. says. See more updates Updated 3m ago More live coverage: Global Markets New York\n\n\"We need the money for sure, but I don't want to put his life at risk just so we can have money,\" she said on Thursday. \"He's had open-heart surgery, he's got asthma, there's no way he could come back from that. I can't lose him.\"\n\nMs. Pinson said the bingo hall would require customers to wear masks, but she was sure people would take them off -- they would have to in order to eat the burgers, nachos, and other food that she makes.\n\nShe was leaning toward showing up, hoping that people followed the state's guidelines and kept their distance. If they did not, she said, she would probably ask her boss to let her take additional time off.\n\n\"Hopefully he would understand,\" she said. \"Me and him do have a pretty good relationship. But he just kind of expected me to show up to work.\"\n\nOn Friday afternoon, less than 5 hours before her shift was to begin, Ms. Pinson was relieved when her boss texted her again, saying the bingo hall was not allowed to reopen after all.\n\n\"I had so much anxiety over this,\" Ms. Pinson said. \"But now I don't have to worry about it.\"\n\nUnemployment benefits through states are tied to employment, and workers cannot keep their benefits once their bosses call them back, even if they believe it is unsafe to go to work. There are some exceptions, granted by the federal relief package known as the CARES Act: They include those who are sick with the virus or who are caring for children whose schools or day care centers remain closed.\n\nRepublican leaders in Iowa and Oklahoma have threatened to withhold unemployment benefits from people who refuse to return to their jobs. In both states, employers whose workers do not show up have been asked to report them to state authorities so that they can stop providing them with the benefits.\n\nAs Americans have started receiving unemployment benefits and stimulus checks, freeing some of them from having to worry as much about paying for food and rent, they have been able to shift their focus toward protecting their health.\n\nBianca, a dental assistant in Denver, said she was dreading getting called back to work. She and her wife are getting by on $600 in weekly unemployment, supplemented by an extra $600 approved for workers weathering the current crisis.\n\nBut her practice began seeing routine patients again this week as Colorado's stay-at-home order expired. And she is concerned her clinic does not have enough protective gear to go around.\n\n\"Most of us are afraid to go back, but dentists are like, 'I've got a business to run,'\" said Bianca, who asked to be identified only by her first name, for fear that she would get fired for speaking up.\n\nBianca cleans teeth inches away from people's faces and even before the coronavirus struck, she picked up colds and flus regularly from patients. She said she was petrified of getting infected at work or spreading the disease to her family, especially her father, whose immune system has been battered after he underwent six months of chemotherapy.\n\nIn Ohio, the authorities said manufacturers could begin operating on Monday. But Kim Rinehart, a worker at a transmission plant in Toledo, said she has heard nothing from her union or her company about when she might return to work. She is collecting unemployment and the additional $600 in benefits, and is feeling fine about staying home, particularly given the state's limited testing capacity and the virus's stealth.\n\n\"If you had a murderer in the plant, and you didn't know where but you knew he was there, would you go back into that plant?\" she said.\n\nIn Georgia, Gov. Brian Kemp allowed restaurants to start dine-in service on Monday. But a large group of Georgia restaurateurs and chefs this week pledged to remain closed for the time being, because it was safer.\n\nOne of the chefs, Craig Richards, the co-owner of Lyla Lila in Atlanta, said he didn't want anyone to get sick as a result of his decisions. And he is not excited about opening a place that is depressing to visit, with workers in masks.\n\n\"I don't want to open a restaurant that looks like an operating room,\" he said. \"That's not a restaurant. To me a restaurant is about connecting people.\"\n\nTo some degree, governors are leaving choices to individuals by design.\n\n\"It is the people themselves that are primarily responsible for their safety,\" Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota said this week, announcing a \"back to normal\" plan.\n\nThough she never issued a formal stay-at-home order, Ms. Noem said moving toward reopening would put the power back into the hands of the people, \"where it belongs.\"\n\n\"They are free to exercise their rights to work, worship and to play,\" she said, \"or to stay at home and to conduct social distancing.\"\n\nBut for many people trying to protect themselves in cities and towns that were reopening, the effort mostly felt clumsy and frantic.\n\nMorgan Bard has spent hours driving from supermarket to supermarket across Northern Colorado, scrounging the empty shelves for gloves, sanitizer, wipes and other supplies that are now required for retailers as they reopen to the public.\n\nMs. Bard and her father were reopening their business selling Celtic jewelry, crafts and art in the mountain tourist town of Estes Park, Colo., on Friday.\n\n\"It's hard to find anything,\" she said. She has enough hand sanitizer for herself, but not enough to set out for customers. She is low on disposable gloves.\n\nAfter agonizing over what to do, Ms. Kyllonen, the Maine hairstylist, has decided to brave it. The salon opened on Friday, but her first day back is not until Wednesday, because social distancing means only five hairdressers can work at once.\n\nShe will follow pages of state guidelines. Wear a mask, and a face shield. Have customers wait in their cars. Ask them about symptoms. Take their temperature. Disinfect seats and surfaces and change towels and gloves.\n\n\"I'm worried we are doing this -- I hate to say it -- too soon,\" she said. \"There's a lot of things we have to do and it's scary.\"\n\nReporting was contributed by Richard Fausset from Atlanta, Emily Badger from Washington, D.C. and Sarah Mervosh from Canton, Ohio.",

Y, desde marzo, el n\u00famero de usuarios de OKCupid que han participado en una cita por video se ha cuadriplicado.\n\nEstar soltero en una pandemia provoca una reacci\u00f3n extrema a ese estatus. Las primeras investigaciones al respecto del Instituto Kinsey indican que, aunque todos est\u00e1n m\u00e1s solos ahora, los m\u00e1s solitarios son los solteros. La psicoterapeuta Esther Perel me explic\u00f3 que esto se debe a que las crisis \"aceleran las relaciones\". Los matrimonios infelices llegan al divorcio. Los j\u00f3venes amantes se apresuran a vivir juntos tras la tercera cita. Y las personas solteras se dan cuenta de que no quieren morir solas.\n\nYo me di cuenta de eso.\n\nY, como era de esperar, entr\u00e9 en p\u00e1nico. Consider\u00e9 llamar a un ex (y despu\u00e9s lo hice). Respond\u00ed los mensajes de otras de mis exparejas que tambi\u00e9n estaban preocupadas -- y desesperanzadas -- en todo el mundo. Finalmente, vi el rostro cubierto con una mascarilla de un amigo del cual me hab\u00eda alejado hace un a\u00f1o, y consider\u00e9 casarme con \u00e9l. Despu\u00e9s de todo eso, llam\u00e9 a mi madre y le dije que se olvidara de los nietos. En parte, bromeaba.\n\nNo es que no sea feliz en este momento. Despu\u00e9s de una d\u00e9cada de relaciones seriales y un procedimiento de 15.000 d\u00f3lares para congelar mis \u00f3vulos con el fin de preservar mi fertilidad, saboreaba el placer de estar sola. Pero no planeaba estar encerrada con mi soledad para siempre.\n\nPerel, la experta en relaciones, me record\u00f3 que \"la gente ha encontrado el amor durante las guerras, las plagas y las hambrunas\". Ahora mismo, es dif\u00edcil imaginarlo.\n\nAntes de la COVID-19, todos ten\u00edamos mucho tiempo para pasar al siguiente cap\u00edtulo. Desde entonces, el tiempo pasa, pero no hay manera de progresar. Cualquier meta simplemente parece estar m\u00e1s lejos de nuestro alcance.\n\nEs ir\u00f3nico porque, incluso antes de esta crisis, las citas modernas a veces parec\u00edan interminables. Vivimos en una \u00e9poca de opciones ilimitadas, joyas raras y decisiones pospuestas. Cuanta m\u00e1s gente conocemos, m\u00e1s problemas tenemos para crear conexiones, y ya ni hablar del compromiso. Justin Garcia, del Instituto Kinsey, me asegur\u00f3 que ese es un efecto secundario com\u00fan de las citas. Los expertos lo llaman \"sobrecarga cognitiva\". Preferimos el valor de las opciones en vez de valorar a la persona que est\u00e1 frente a nosotros.\n\nEl coronavirus no ha cambiado esa paradoja de elecciones. De hecho, los datos de The League sugieren que ahora charlamos de manera simult\u00e1nea con m\u00e1s personas que nunca antes. Frente a frente ser\u00eda la receta perfecta para un contagio masivo. Pero llegar\u00e1 el momento en que desearemos compartir una entrada, rozar las rodillas o darnos un primer beso.\n\nLatest Updates: Coronavirus Outbreak in the U.S. There is a stark racial divide in how the virus has hit nursing homes. 2.4 million workers filed for unemployment benefits last week.

Las investigaciones indican que m\u00e1s del 60 por ciento de las personas han perdido inter\u00e9s en alguien tras besar a esa persona por primera vez. Imaginemos pasar meses de citas virtuales con alguien durante la pandemia solo para descubrir que hay cero qu\u00edmica. Esa es mi (m\u00e1s peque\u00f1a) pesadilla de la COVID-19.\n\nY aunque los besos son la manera m\u00e1s eficaz de evaluar la qu\u00edmica entre dos personas, tambi\u00e9n es la manera m\u00e1s efectiva de contraer el coronavirus. As\u00ed que, conforme nos alejemos de las pantallas, tendremos que empezar a tener citas de manera distinta.\n\n\u00bfC\u00f3mo se abordan las citas ahora? Las personas que sugieren tener una cita en la vida real son quienes podr\u00edan preocuparnos porque no son muy seguras. Quiz\u00e1 las aplicaciones de citas comenzar\u00e1n a dejarnos filtrar para controlar el coronavirus, lo cual en este momento parece m\u00e1s relevante que la altura, la religi\u00f3n o la afiliaci\u00f3n pol\u00edtica.\n\nSi decidimos reunirnos, \u00bfqu\u00e9 se puede hacer? Un paseo socialmente distante es la nueva segunda base despu\u00e9s de Zoom, pero no est\u00e1 claro que sigue a continuaci\u00f3n. Un hombre soltero (un m\u00e9dico) me dijo que, incluso cuando se reabran los restaurantes y los bares, se sentir\u00e1 m\u00e1s seguro al citar a personas en su departamento. Se dio cuenta de que las mujeres podr\u00edan mostrarse \"esc\u00e9pticas\" dados los \"estereotipos del llamado 'Netflix and chill'\", es decir, usar el pretexto de ver Netflix para realmente intentar tener sexo (sin mencionar a los asesinos en serie).\n\nThe Coronavirus Outbreak Frequently Asked Questions and Advice\n\nUpdated May 20, 2020\n\nHow many people have lost their jobs due to coronavirus in the U.S.?\n\nOver 38 million people have filed for unemployment since March. One in five who were working in February reported losing a job or being furloughed in March or the beginning of April, data from a Federal Reserve survey released on May 14 showed, and that pain was highly concentrated among low earners. Fully 39 percent of former workers living in a household earning $40,000 or less lost work, compared with 13 percent in those making more than $100,000, a Fed official said.\n\nIs 'Covid toe' a symptom of the disease?\n\nThere is an uptick in people reporting symptoms of chilblains, which are painful red or purple lesions that typically appear in the winter on fingers or toes. The lesions are emerging as yet another symptom of infection with the new coronavirus. Chilblains are caused by inflammation in small blood vessels in reaction to cold or damp conditions, but they are usually common in the coldest winter months. Federal health officials do not include toe lesions in the list of coronavirus symptoms, but some dermatologists are pushing for a change, saying so-called Covid toe should be sufficient grounds for testing.\n\nCan I go to the park?\n\nYes, but make sure you keep six feet of distance between you and people who don't live in your home. Even if you just hang out in a park, rather than go for a jog or a walk, getting some fresh air, and hopefully sunshine, is a good idea.\n\nHow do I take my temperature?\n\nTaking one's temperature to look for signs of fever is not as easy as it sounds, as \"normal\" temperature numbers can vary, but generally, keep an eye out for a temperature of 100.5 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. If you don't have a thermometer (they can be pricey these days), there are other ways to figure out if you have a fever, or are at risk of Covid-19 complications.\n\nShould I wear a mask?\n\nThe C.D.C. has recommended that all Americans wear cloth masks if they go out in public. This is a shift in federal guidance reflecting new concerns that the coronavirus is being spread by infected people who have no symptoms. Until now, the C.D.C., like the W.H.O., has advised that ordinary people don't need to wear masks unless they are sick and coughing. Part of the reason was to preserve medical-grade masks for health care workers who desperately need them at a time when they are in continuously short supply. Masks don't replace hand washing and social distancing.\n\nWhat should I do if I feel sick?\n\nIf you've been exposed to the coronavirus or think you have, and have a fever or symptoms like a cough or difficulty breathing, call a doctor. They should give you advice on whether you should be tested, how to get tested, and how to seek medical treatment without potentially infecting or exposing others.\n\nHow do I get tested?\n\nIf you're sick and you think you've been exposed to the new coronavirus, the C.D.C. recommends that you call your healthcare provider and explain your symptoms and fears. They will decide if you need to be tested. Keep in mind that there's a chance -- because of a lack of testing kits or because you're asymptomatic, for instance -- you won't be able to get tested.\n\nShould I pull my money from the markets?\n\nThat's not a good idea. Even if you're retired, having a balanced portfolio of stocks and bonds so that your money keeps up with inflation, or even grows, makes sense. But retirees may want to think about having enough cash set aside for a year's worth of living expenses and big payments needed over the next five years.\n\nHow can I help?\n\nCharity Navigator, which evaluates charities using a numbers-based system, has a running list of nonprofits working in communities affected by the outbreak. You can give blood through the American Red Cross, and World Central Kitchen has stepped in to distribute meals in major cities.\n\nFinalmente, est\u00e1 la pregunta de c\u00f3mo y con cu\u00e1ntas personas salimos. En el mundo antes del coronavirus, ser\u00eda una opci\u00f3n seguir viendo al ingl\u00e9s del s\u00e1bado y al director de fotograf\u00eda del jueves. Poco despu\u00e9s, quiz\u00e1 podr\u00eda ponerme un cubrebocas y dar un paseo socialmente distante con uno y despu\u00e9s con el otro. Pero en alg\u00fan momento -- cuando nos quitemos el cubrebocas y sintamos la chispa de un primer beso -- se tendr\u00e1 que tomar una decisi\u00f3n. No m\u00e1s sobrecarga cognitiva. Besarse, de pronto, implica dejar a todos los dem\u00e1s, o al menos mantenerse a dos metros de distancia de los dem\u00e1s durante 14 d\u00edas.\n\nYa comenzamos a tener conversaciones sobre el estatus del coronavirus, las credenciales de la cuarentena y la exclusividad que son tan inc\u00f3modas como nuestras primeras citas virtuales. Ese tipo de conversaciones no tienen precedente. Las nuevas parejas las abordan en cualquier relaci\u00f3n, a menudo en torno al sexo seguro. Ahora tendremos esas conversaciones \u00edntimas para algo tan inocente como un primer beso. Si queremos estar seguros, debemos hacerlo.\n\nConforme se abra el mundo, quiz\u00e1 comencemos a salir de manera m\u00e1s selectiva, m\u00e1s lenta y m\u00e1s sucesiva, con m\u00e1s anticipaci\u00f3n y atenci\u00f3n de la que hemos tenido en a\u00f1os.\n\nDesde este momento, hay menos distracciones: no hay men\u00fas ni meseros ni multitudes, solo dos personas que se miran a trav\u00e9s de una pantalla. Usamos palabras como \"desear\u00eda\", \"extra\u00f1o\" o \"me aterra\" antes de lo que nos habr\u00edamos atrevido antes de la pandemia. Nos estamos volviendo mejores oyentes, int\u00e9rpretes de miradas y entusiastas de las maneras creativas para conectarnos.\n\nY, seamos honestos, hay algo emocionante acerca de que los besos vuelvan a ser un tab\u00fa.\n\nQuiz\u00e1 eso es lo que necesit\u00e1bamos.\n\nNayeema Raza, quien produce videos para Opini\u00f3n, es documentalista y escritora.",
