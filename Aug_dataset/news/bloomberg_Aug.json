        "body": "WATCH: Toumazou demonstrates his coronavirus testing machine.\n\nA small DNA-testing company that just months ago was trying to get its footing in consumer genetics is now part of an effort to make U.K. hospitals safer during the pandemic.\n\nThe company, DnaNudge, won a 161-million pound ($211 million) order for 5,000 machines and a supply of cartridges to test patients for the new coronavirus in hundreds of the National Health Service hospitals.\n\nFor founder Christofer Toumazou, a professor at Imperial College London, it's the culmination of months of efforts to retool a toaster-size machine he originally developed to analyze key bits of people's DNA so users could tailor their diet to their heredity. Now his lab-in-a-box will be used to see whether patients arriving at hospitals for surgery, cancer treatment and other procedures harbor Covid-19 -- an unexpected detour in his contribution to the consumer genetics revolution.\n\n\"We could be entering a very new world when we come out on the other side of this pandemic,\" Toumazou said in an interview.\n\nHis machine, the Nudgebox, delivers a result in 90 minutes on the spot -- no need to ship samples to a lab -- based on either a nose swab or some saliva. It can also identify the flu and another common lung ailment known as respiratory syncytial virus.\n\nThe U.K. government this month also ordered 450,000 rapid tests from DNA testing company Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Innovative diagnostics are the latest examples of British science being deployed to fight the pandemic, along with the coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc and an Oxford study that established the life-saving potential of a cheap anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone.\n\nCoronavirus testing has become a sensitive topic in the U.K. after early efforts to speed up diagnosis floundered. Thousands of tests ordered last spring turned out to be flawed, preventing a scaling up of detection envisioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. Britain has suffered more than 46,000 deaths, the most of any European country.\n\nGraham Cooke, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said he was doubtful at first that Toumazou's device would be useful, but that it held up well under scrutiny.\n\n\"If you have someone coming in and you're not sure if they have Covid, you can make a decision about where they should go,\" he said. \"You don't want to put the wrong person in the wrong place.\"\n\nSome of the Nudgeboxes ordered have already been rolled out in eight London hospitals and health-care centers, where doctors and nurses can use them to quickly determine whether new patients should be isolated. DnaNudge may go public in a year or so, according to Toumazou.\n\nAs Toumazou, 59, watched the pandemic unfold and overwhelm NHS resources, his greatest worries were for his children, one of whom is immuno-compromised and would be at high risk if he caught Covid-19. But his thoughts also kept going back to the box whose technology was lying fallow as a result of the crisis.\n\nSo he went to his biggest investor, former Thai prime minister and mobile-phone magnate Thaksin Sinawatra, who agreed to plow more cash into the business to fund the transition.\n\nThe box went from being able to analyze human DNA to the narrower task of recognizing the genetic blueprint of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The rejig also added a feature that ensures a proper sample has been taken -- meaning it's easy to know whether a patient needs to be retested.\n\nToumazou said little in his background prepared him for the fields of health or science. The son of a Greek Cypriot-immigrant family that owned restaurants in England, he saw his outlook changed by an uncle who was an engineer.\n\nMegaphone.fm: DnaNudge Founder on Device That Finds...\n\n\"He inspired me,\" Toumazou recalled. \"At that time, Greek families were either in restaurants or hairdressing, and my family were in catering. I wasn't really meant for engineering.\"\n\nWhile his school didn't offer the exams that allow access to the U.K.'s top colleges, Toumazou enrolled in an electrical engineering program at what was then called Oxford Polytechnic.\n\nThere, he and his instructor John Lidgey began working on a new kind of circuit that drastically reduced the amount of power needed. As a research fellow at Imperial College London, he became the institution's youngest person to be promoted to professor, at age 33. He began using the technology in a variety of applications, including mobile phones and eventually implanted prostheses for deaf children, and became interested in the connection between tech and genetics.\n\nNow Toumazou spends most of his days at NHS hospitals in London and Oxford, overseeing the use of Nudgeboxes for Covid. They're performing hundreds of tests each day, and he still sees more opportunities for expanding applications. The devices could be used for quick testing in airports or businesses when people come down with symptoms, for example, or to quickly check volunteers for vaccine trials.\n\nAnd there's also the possibility of going back to DnaNudge's original mission -- helping people match foods to their genetic predisposition -- to avoid diabetes, kidney disease and other conditions that might make them more vulnerable to Covid.\n\n\"My dream has been to bring testing like this to the consumer,\" Toumazou said. \"A test that can demystify and simplify that quickly -- rather than leaving people in doubt -- is going to be very useful.\"",

        "body": "It's time to put renewed, coordinated emphasis on finding treatments for the novel coronavirus.\n\nNobody wants to go back to a national coronavirus lockdown. France's Emmanuel Macron and Spain's Pedro Sanchez are ruling out blanket stay-at-home restrictions, even as Covid-19 cases surge higher. Their motives are clear: Another round of widespread lockdowns would tank the economy and split society, and would also be an admission of defeat from politicians and public-health officials who -- like Sanchez -- insist we are \"better prepared\" to control the epidemic than we were in the dark days of spring.\n\nThe less draconian strategy of combining preventative measures, while waiting for a vaccine to emerge, is a commendable one. But there are limits here, too. Mask policies are becoming tougher and more complicated, risking confusion and hostility. International travel curbs, which haven't always proven effective or easy to enforce, are piling up again. And while testing and tracing are vital for improving our ability to catch cases, resource gaps remain. Spain is enlisting the army to help its efforts.\n\nThe tangle of rules will become harder to enforce as time goes on. History suggests citizens eventually chafe at epidemic edicts, from the mask \"slackers\" of the 1918-19 Spanish flu to the residents of 19th-century Naples who, as historian Frank Snowden tells it, protested anti-cholera rules by eating vast quantities of fruit the authorities might confiscate. There's a shelf life to such measures.\n\nNew emphasis needs to be put on the curative on top of the purely preventative. While vaccines loom large in the collective imagination, finding a treatment for the virus would be the real game-changer. It would likely be cheaper and quicker to manufacture than a vaccine and lessen risks such as low take-up or a fight over doses. Halting infection or deaths would rob Covid-19 of its most terrifying traits.\n\nSadly, seven months into this pandemic, there has been little progress. We are better at treating serious cases, but not by much. A paper last month by the French government's scientific advisory committee cited low-cost anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone -- found to lower deaths among patients needing breathing assistance -- and arthritis drug tocilizumab as showing effectiveness.\n\nThis is no ordinary virus, with multiple possible points of attack including provoking an out-of-control immune response. Finding a treatment requires resources. The Milken Institute counts 316 treatments currently being studied worldwide, alongside 203 vaccines.\n\nYet time has been wasted. Rushed clinical trials, intended to produce results quicker, have only sown confusion and stoked hype. So far there have been more disappointments, such as anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine or HIV therapies including lopinavir, than successes.\n\nThe result is that hospitals are still ultimately at the virus's mercy. A predominance of milder symptoms and more experience in treating Covid-19 has seen the estimated global case fatality rate fall, to 3.5%, but suggestions that the virus has mutated into a much less virulent form are still inconclusive. Hospitalizations and deaths, while rising much more slowly than cases, are starting to tick up again in countries such as France and Spain. Julien Carvelli, an intensive-care doctor at La Timone Hospital in Marseille, tells me his concern is a co-mingling of Covid-19 sufferers with other patients as winter draws near.\n\nThere are ways to improve the search for a treatment, such as adaptive clinical trials. More international cooperation would also boost their size and avoid duplication. It's incredibly dispiriting that multi-country trials in Europe like the France-led \"Discovery\" have failed to reach critical mass. Getting countries to work together is harder than devising no-fly zones, but the rewards will ultimately be greater.\n\nThe price tag for developing Covid-19 drugs, such as repurposing generics, could come to $200 million per treatment (a fraction of the $1 billion it can cost to produce a single vaccine). That's all the more enticing given that Covid-19 may end up requiring a cocktail of different therapies. Jeffrey Aronson, a clinical pharmacologist at the Center for Evidence-Based Medicine at Oxford University, last month likened using a mix of drugs to a siege strategy attacking all sides of the virus's castle: Preventing the virus from entering cells, stopping it from reproducing once it gets inside, and changing the body's immune response by boosting or suppressing it at relevant times.\n\nNone of this means that more immediate prophylactics such as masks and social distancing should be dropped. But scientific research needs to be supported and coordinated as part of the plan. If we are due a fresh spike in cases this fall, patient trials need to be ready.\n\nInstead of being trapped in a binary debate about dumb or smart lockdowns, the focus should be on finding a treatment that makes all kinds of lockdown obsolete. And it could be right under our masked noses.",

        "body": "Report criticizes lack of testing, failure to isolate guests\n\nFor a fresh perspective on the stories that matter for Australian business and politics, sign up for our new weekly newsletter.\n\nAn inquiry into why hundreds of passengers were allowed to disembark a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship berthed in Sydney earlier this year has blasted Australian health authorities for failing to conduct tests and isolate the infected.\n\nAt the time, the Ruby Princess was the single biggest vector of infection in Australia, linked to hundreds of cases and 28 deaths.\n\nAfter docking in Sydney on March 19, some 2,647 passengers were allowed to disembark, even as dozens of people on board suffered flu-like symptoms. With the first infections confirmed the next day, state and federal authorities blamed each other for the lapse, and health authorities raced to track down passengers who had dispersed across Australia and boarded overseas flights.\n\nA special commission of inquiry, appointed by the New South Wales state government, handed down its findings on Friday. The 320-page report is a catalogue of errors, including allowing disembarked passengers to travel interstate instead of making them isolate for 14 days.\n\nAn expert panel formed by the New South Wales health department should have noticed a spike in the number of passengers with acute respiratory illness or flu-like symptoms, and its decision to classify the ship as \"low risk\" was \"as inexplicable as it is unjustifiable,\" the inquiry found.\n\nState Premier Gladys Berejiklian, who was given the report Friday, said she released it immediately in the \"interests of transparency\" and would respond early next week.\n\nThe decision to allow passengers to disembark was made despite growing global concern about virus cases on cruise ships. The infection of more than 700 people on the Diamond Princess, also operated by Princess Cruises, showed how quickly the virus could spread while it was berthed off Japan in February.\n\nThe Ruby Princess was linked to an outbreak in Australia's island state of Tasmania that led to the closure of a major hospital, and 8 fatalities in the U.S. Of the 1,682 Australian passengers on board, 663 contracted Covid-19, as well as 191 crew members. The inquiry said the total number of people infected may never be known because about one-third of passengers were international guests who returned overseas.\n\nThe inquiry heard testimony from Princess Cruises employees and executives, health officials and infected passengers. A separate criminal probe is underway, though no charges have been laid.\n\nCommissioner Bret Walker outlined multiple failings and a lack of communication between government departments during what he termed a \"sorry episode.\"\n\nNSW Health and the cruise ship operator should have ensured that vessels were aware of a new definition of what constituted a suspect case of Covid-19. By the time the ship docked, 120 people fell into that category and should have been isolated in cabins.\n\nA shortage of swabs on board meant that too few people were tested, and the delay in obtaining results from the limited number that were carried out on the morning of March 19 was \"inexcusable.\"\n\nThe inquiry called for better communication between federal and state health departments, biosecurity officials and other departments and stronger protocols around allowing passengers to disembark.\n\nPrincess Cruises said in a statement the report confirmed that \"none of our people -- the captain, the ship's doctor, or members of our shore side port agency team -- misled public authorities involved in Ruby Princess being permitted to disembark guests.\"\n\nThe company will take time to consider the findings and will make no further comment due to ongoing legal proceedings.",

Campaign aides also declined to answer the same question during a press briefing last week.\n\nTrump, White House staff and journalists in the press pool are all regularly tested for the virus.

        "body": "The Pac-12 follows suit, choosing to delay football despite the wrath of powerful fans and the potential loss of millions of dollars in revenue.\n\nYou almost got the feeling these past few days that the so-called Power 5 college athletic conferences -- the Big 10, the Big 12, the ACC, the SEC and the Pac-12 -- were playing a game of chicken. Which would be the first to cancel the coming football season because of Covid-19? They all knew that whoever went first would bear the brunt of criticism from football fans, including, in all likelihood, the one in the White House.\n\nSure enough, when the announcement came Tuesday afternoon that the Big 10 was canceling football -- or rather, postponing it to the spring -- the hellfire began raining down almost immediately.\n\n\"Dreams crushed, local economies destroyed, lives forever changed because of decisions based on fear,\" one tweet read. \"Shameful day for college football.\"\n\n\"Whoosh. That's the sounds of all the elite athletes leaving the Big 10,\" another read.\n\n\"18 months of no college sports, that's not acceptable and the Big 10 presidents and their leaders should be held accountable for the disastrous decisions they're making,\" the conservative sports commentator Clay Travis said.\n\nAnd that was just on Twitter. Football-loving alumni were said to be furious. A staff member from a prominent Big 10 program was \"Sad. Speechless. Shocked\" and described players as devastated, according to a plugged-in ESPN journalist. One Big 10 school, Nebraska, was openly defiant, issuing a statement indicating it would try to find a way to play football despite the conference's decision.\n\nThe drama began on Monday, when sportscaster Dan Patrick reported that the presidents of the Big 10 universities had voted 12 to 2 to cancel the season. (Yes, there are 14 schools in the Big 10.) He also said that the Pac-12 was going to cancel its season, that the Big 12 and the Atlantic Coast Conference were on the fence, and that the Southeastern Conference fully intended to play the season, no matter what.\n\nSoon after Patrick's report, Pete Thamel of Yahoo Sports tweeted that he had just been informed by a Big 10 spokesman that \"no vote has been taken by our presidents and chancellors.\" Meanwhile, Trevor Lawrence, Clemson's star quarterback in the ACC, began tweeting out the hashtag #WeWantToPlay. Other players joined in. They put together a list of safety-oriented demands that began \"We Want to Play Football This Season.\" Prominent coaches such as Nick Saban of Alabama added their voices to the chorus; Saban said that players were safer within the confines of the Alabama football program than at home.\n\nAnd who chimed in after that? You guessed it: President Donald Trump. \"Play College Football,\" he tweeted Monday afternoon. He retweeted Lawrence's #WeWantToPlay post. His press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, brought up college football at the White House press briefing. Vice President Mike Pence joined the chorus:\n\nLike so much else about this pandemic, the decision to play or not play college football was becoming more about politics than science and common sense.\n\nWord soon began to leak out of the Big 10 that at least five conference athletes, all of whom had been infected by Covid-19, had contracted myocarditis, a rare and potentially dangerous heart ailment. \"The Covid-19 virus has been linked with myocarditis with a higher frequency than other viruses, based on limited studies and anecdotal evidence since the start of the pandemic,\" reported ESPN, which had received the leak. With this leak, the Big 10 was setting the stage for what would soon follow.\n\nIn his statement on Tuesday afternoon, Big 10 Commissioner Kevin Warren made it sound as though the decision to postpone football (and other fall sports) was completely rooted in those medical concerns. \"As time progressed and after hours of discussion with our Big Ten Task Force for Emerging Infectious Diseases and the Big Ten Sports Medicine Committee,\" he said, \"it became abundantly clear that there was too much uncertainty regarding potential medical risks to allow our student-athletes to compete this fall.\"\n\nI don't doubt Warren's sincerity. Even aside from potential heart issues, it's pretty hard to be socially distant when you're playing football. There won't be a bubble like the NBA; teams will have to travel to different cities, stay in hotels and interact with people who are not part of their group. As Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith said after the decision: \"The reality is, the game is not like sitting in a classroom, it's not like walking across campus, it's not like wearing masks when you're in a lab. It's full contact.\"\n\nStill, it's worth pointing out that a few other issues were lying just beneath the surface. One was money. The only way the Big 10 -- and the rest of college football -- can avoid a complete financial disaster is if the season is made up in the spring. That is what the Big 10 is promising to do.\n\nIt had better pray that the pandemic has loosened its grip by then. According to data compiled by Patrick Rishe, the director of the sports business program at Washington University in St. Louis, canceling football could cost $4 billion, mostly from television revenue, with each of the 65 athletic departments in the Power 5 losing an average of $62 million. If there's no spring football, there will be a financial bloodbath.\n\nThe second issue, of course, is amateurism. Most Big 10 schools are instituting all sorts of pandemic protocols for returning students, including \"the use of appropriate face coverings, physical distancing, hand hygiene, limited density in indoor spaces, control of the flow of traffic into and around buildings, continued employee teleworking when possible, testing, symptoms tracking and contact tracing.\" (Those are some of Ohio State's protocols.) If football players are tackling one another while everyone else on campus is required to maintain social distancing, it becomes nearly impossible to deny they are employees.\n\nIndeed, the only reason this was a wrenching decision for the Big 10 is because the revenue involved is so extreme. They need their unpaid players to generate the revenue that keeps the enterprise afloat. The Ivy League Conference, where the money is negligible, canceled fall football weeks ago.\n\nAt a news conference late in the day, President Trump again called on universities to play football. \"These are young, strong people. They won't have a big problem with the China virus. ... They'll be able to fight it off. And hopefully, it won't bother them one bit,\" he said, ignoring the evidence to the contrary. Of course, if his administration hadn't bungled the pandemic response in the first place, there is a good chance that the Big 10 would be playing football this fall.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the SEC still seemed pretty sanguine about going forward, despite the potential pitfalls. Then again, the SEC is the closest thing the National Football League has to a minor league. Several players expressed a desire to play. The ACC was said to be leaning closer to playing in the fall than it had been just a few days earlier. The Big 12 was said to be moving forward with the intent of playing.\n\nAnd the Pac-12? An hour and a half after the Big 10 announcement, it issued a statement saying that it, too, would postpone its fall football season and possibly play in the spring. I looked on Twitter right after the announcement. The wrath was much more subdued. The Big 10 took one for the other conferences. Common sense triumphed over politics and money -- for now. It's usually the other way around.",

        "body": "Initially mild symptoms worsen later in thousands of Americans\n\nA growing contingent of Covid-19 patients whose symptoms were initially mild are now facing mysterious long-term neurological problems, including memory and sleep disturbances, dizziness, nerve pain and what survivors refer to as \"brain fog.\"\n\nThe phenomenon, involving thousands of patients with symptoms lasting months at a time, complicates the Trump administration's argument that most illness is mild so the U.S. can quickly reopen the economy. These frightening long-term cases aren't captured in official statistics that show that the vast majority of younger adults survive the virus.\n\nWhile lingering lung issues might be expected given the nature of the virus, some of the most common and surprising problems involve the nervous system. For Americans with these symptoms, there are few answers available on why they surface, how long they'll last and what permanent problems they may cause. Neurologists are only just starting to study the trend.\n\n\"A very large number of the symptoms fall within the brain and nervous system,\" according to Natalie Lambert, an Indiana University School of Medicine researcher who surveyed more than 1,567 members of an online support group for people with longer-term symptoms in a push to map out their effects.\n\nAdrian Owen, a neuroscientist at Western University in Canada, has been \"completely inundated\" with emails from people who have found themselves with cognitive problems months after their initial infection, he said in an interview.\n\n\"It is becoming completely obvious that many of them are suffering from neurological deficits,\" Owen said. \"Even if this only affects 10% of people, that can be a massive societal and economic burden a year from now.\"\n\nFor Eli Musser, a 42-year-old copywriter in Astoria, Queens, the first weeks of Covid-19 were nowhere near as bad as what came later. In late March, Musser came down with a low fever and fatigue for a few days followed by a recurring cough that lasted several weeks.\n\n\"And then I got walloped,\" he said in an interview.\n\nFor months, Musser was so debilitated doing more than sitting on the couch and resting was too much. He's had tremors and shaking in his arms, dizziness, muscle weakness so severe he sometimes had trouble dressing, panic attacks and depression. One terrifying day in May, he couldn't move his legs. In June, he experienced intermittent fits of seizure-like sweating and shaking.\n\nNow, five months after his initial symptoms, he's still on medical leave and only recently received a diagnosis for his neurological symptoms. Meanwhile, Musser's fianc\u00e9e, who also fell ill in March but recovered in about 10 days, spends hours each day caring for him.\n\n\"A good guess is it won't last forever, it'll get better with time,\" Musser said. \"But also, how much time? How much better? What can I reasonably expect?\"\n\nTo get a handle on questions like this, the neuroscientist Owen is working with University of Toronto researchers to survey 50,000 coronavirus patients with lingering neurological symptoms to determine who might be most at risk and what the long-term effects are.\n\nThey're using a series of self-reported questionnaires and brain games done online. Other studies, looking at symptoms more broadly in fewer people and with more detail, are just beginning elsewhere as well.\n\nMany patients have been sharing their experiences in a Facebook group called \"Survivor Corps\" that today counts more than 96,000 members.\n\nDiana Berrent founded the group after contracting Covid-19 in March. Since then, she's partnered with Lambert to survey its members. The symptom list they gathered was pages long, including difficulty concentrating or focusing, anxiety, memory problems, heart palpitations, blurry vision and neuropathy in feet and hands.\n\nWith researchers just starting to study Covid-19's long-term consequences, reliable numbers are hard to come by. A recent federal study found that about 35% of people who tested positive for Covid-19 were still experiencing symptoms two to three weeks later, including many young adults.\n\nWhile patients 50 and older had the highest risk of long-lasting problems, more than a quarter of those under age 35 had continuing symptoms, including many who had no previous health problems.\n\nMeanwhile, a survey of 143 patients who had been hospitalized for Covid-19 in Italy found that two months later only 12.6% were completely symptom-free, and more than half said they still had 3 or more ongoing symptoms.\n\nThere's no doubt that coronavirus infection can cause nerve complications. One early study from Wuhan, China found that 36% of patients had neurologic symptoms ranging from headache to impaired consciousness.\n\nSince then, researchers have reported a variety of strange neurologic syndromes, ranging from Miller Fisher syndrome, a nerve disease that can paralyze eye muscles, to acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, a nerve-lining inflammation that can resemble multiple sclerosis flareups, to autoimmune encephalitis, and inflammation of the brain's temporal lobes, which can cause confusion and hallucinations.\n\nBut with case reports just emerging, it's been hard to prove cause and effect.\n\nEven when people clear the virus and test negative, they \"can feel out of sorts for weeks and weeks,\" almost similar to chronic fatigue syndrome, said Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during a Facebook live interview on July 16th. But it may take a year or more to understand whether the virus produces truly long-lasting complications, he said.\n\nAlso see: Covid malaise poses economic drag long after virus abates\n\nThere are logical reasons why people who were hospitalized could have residual neurologic effects lasting for months. These patients may have been so sick that organ failure limited oxygen flow to the brain, said Igor Koralnik, who is chief of neuro-infectious disease at Northwestern Medicine and leads its neurology-focused Covid clinic. Blood clots in the brain or widespread inflammation could also impact brain function, he said.\n\nBut the neurological symptoms now being seen in people who had milder cases of Covid-19 are more mysterious. Even the loss of smell that's been a high-profile symptom of Covid-19 is considered neurologic, likely caused by dysfunction of olfactory nerves or nerve support cells, Koralnik said.\n\nIt's possible, for instance, that small amounts of the virus still remain in outer reaches of the body, hiding out and continuing to wreak havoc. There's precedent for continuing symptoms with other viruses, including the coronaviruses SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. Lingering virus has also been posed as an explanation in those settings.\n\nSo far, though, there's not strong evidence that Covid-19 infects the brain.\n\nA more likely scenario is that the body's immune system continues to fire, even after the virus has been dispatched, according to Dipa Jayaseelan, a consulting neurologist at University College London Hospitals, who has studied neurological complications of Covid-19. In that case, she said, numerous antibodies and immune cells activated by the virus could go awry in subtle ways.\n\n\"It isn't the virus itself, but it's the body's reaction to the virus,\" Jayaseelan said. \"The body goes into overdrive\" in fighting Covid-19 and may continue to overreact even after the virus is upended.\n\nAllison Navis, a specialist in neuro-infectious diseases at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, has seen about 50 long-haulers in the last month. She believes there isn't one common cause, but rather a variety of different explanations. \"It's a big mystery,\" she said. \"Everyone's commenting that they're starting to see this.\"\n\nAn immune reaction may have caused Musser's dizziness and vertigo.\n\nAfter a video consultation this month, Northwestern's Koralnik diagnosed him with Covid-related inflammation of his inner ear nerves and prescribed a motion sickness drug along with specialized physical therapy. It was \"truly relieving\" to find out that he had something treatable, Musser said in an email.\n\nCovid-19 patients who continue to grapple with symptoms aren't alone. Some survivors of SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome reported symptoms like fatigue and depression for years afterward.\n\nEbola survivors often suffer from everything from headaches to joint pain to eye problems long after they recovered from the disease, studies have found. And Zika virus outbreaks have been linked to an higher incidence of Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder where antibodies attack the nerves, sometimes leading to paralysis.\n\nAnd while long-term brain and lung damage are key concerns with Covid-19, there is also a growing realization that the virus may cause subtle damage to other organs, including heart inflammation.\n\nTracking the cause of the neurological issues could take a while, given the difficulty of linking far-ranging immune effects to the virus. During the AIDS epidemic, a surge of patients coming in with dementia kick-started the field's focus on infectious disease. But it took years after HIV was discovered for the concept of HIV-related dementia to become firmly established in the medical community.\n\nAt the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, neurologist Avindra Nath said he's received about 200 emails from patients reporting long-lasting neurological complications, including \"brain fog,\" burning sensations in the hands and feet, headaches and sleeping problems.\n\nHe's starting two small studies to look at the neurological complications in detail, and plans to bring in dozens patients for batteries of tests to figure out what might be going on. He suspects some of the burning sensations reported in patients could be an atypical form of Guillain-Barre syndrome or a peripheral neuropathy.\n\nOne study will focus on Covid-19 patients whose symptoms are similar to a disease called myalgic encephalomyelitis, a mysterious virus-linked illness better known as chronic fatigue syndrome.\n\n\"The effects on the brain are under-recognized at the moment,\" Nath said. Finding out what is going on \"is all we are thinking about right now. This is the number one top priority.\"\n\nFor some long-haul patients, exhaustive testing has turned up specific abnormalities. Rachelle McCready, a 57-year-old critical care nurse educator in London, Ontario, was hospitalized for eight days in mid-April after coming down with the coronavirus.\n\nShe never needed a ventilator or other extraordinary measures. Still, for weeks after she got out of the hospital, she was so exhausted and out of breath she spent most of the day in bed, too tired to do much more than make coffee or do the laundry.\n\n\"It feels like you have been hit by a truck, the truck then reversed and hit you again, and you are recovering from that,\" says McCready. \"I never would have thought it would still be impacting my life here at month five.\"\n\nEven after she recovered enough to return to work on a part-time basis in June, she noticed subtle neurological symptoms including trouble finding words and learning new procedures. After an echocardiogram, a heart nuclear medicine scan, a chest x-ray, and other tests came back negative, doctors finally ordered a lung CT scan in early July.\n\nIt found subtle damage to the airway walls in her lungs, a condition linked to lung infections and often found in cystic fibrosis patients. Doctors connected it with the coronavirus and, since then, her doctors prescribed oral steroids and asthma inhalers that have reduced her symptoms significantly, she said.\n\n\"People need to know this really isn't quick for some people,\" she says. \"I think we are going to be seeing the effects of this for years.\"",

So even as the virus recedes in some of the locations where it first hit -- richer, densely populated urban centers like Sao Paulo -- the country's curve has yet to flatten.\n\nThe country reported 49,970 new cases Saturday and added 905 new deaths, bringing with the total fatality count to more than 100,000.\n\nThere's no relief in sight. Cases will likely increase to 4 million within a month, and the true rate of infection is likely six or seven times the number of positive tests, according to Domingos Alves, the coordinator of the Health Intelligence Department at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\n\"The fact we are getting to 3 million cases and 100,000 deaths at the same time shows the gravity of the pandemic in Brazil,\" he said in an interview.\n\nBrazil has recorded over 200,000 infections and 7,000 deaths a week for two months.\n\n\"That's five full Boeing planes falling over our heads a day,\" Luiz Henrique Mandetta, the first of two health ministers who departed in the midst of the pandemic after disagreeing with the government's response, said in an interview last month. \"It's incredibly grave.\"\n\nInfections Breach 5-Million Mark in Latin America: Virus Wrap\n\nMandetta, who was fired in April after repeated clashes with President Jair Bolsonaro, has become a harsh critic of Brazil's response to the pandemic. The lack of a national approach, a shortage of testing and a push to reopen before the disease recedes have made the country a global hotspot, second only to the U.S. in number of cases and deaths.\n\nThe mish-mash approach has also made it harder to pinpoint when the infection will start to recede -- already a tall order in a country of 210 million people with some states the size of France where many live in poverty and can't afford not to work.\n\nThe Northeastern state of Bahia, which in early June had fewer than 20,000 cases, now counts more than 180,000 infections. In Minas Gerais, in the center of the country, cases went from 10,000 to 140,000 in the same span. In the South, Santa Catarina went from 9,500 infections to almost 100,000.\n\nMeanwhile, major cities like Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, where the virus first arrived, continue to ease restrictions on movement and work as the pace of new infections slows. While Sao Paulo alone has 10,000 deaths, field hospitals are being disbanded and more businesses allowed to reopen. In Rio, occupancy rates at intensive care units in public hospitals have fallen to about 60%.\n\nRead More: The Pandemic's Worst-Case Scenario Is Unfolding in Brazil\n\nThe Southeast, which includes the hardest-hit states of Sao Paulo and Rio, still accounts for most of the cases and about half of the deaths in the country. The Northeast, which has a little over half of the population, follows in both counts.\n\nThe regional differences also show in mortality rates. The virus has been far deadlier in the north, killing 66 out of every 100,000 inhabitants. Early in the pandemic, health systems in cities like Manaus and Belem, often the only places were medical care is available, were overwhelmed by the disease. The area has the lowest number of ICU beds per capita in the country -- 0.9 per 10,000, compared to 2.7 in the more developed Southeast, according to medical association Amib.\n\nThe poor are likely to be hit hard by the economic toll of the virus. Policy makers have cut interest rates to a record low, but Latin America's largest economy is still expected to contract by 5.7% this year, according to analysts surveyed by the central bank. Data this week showed the unemployment rate in the three months through June rose to 13.3%, the highest level in over three years.\n\nAs the pandemic rages, Brazil is considering extending emergency payments to informal workers past September, when they were due to expire, people with direct knowledge of the matter said this week. In the meantime, officials are also betting big on finding a vaccine.\n\nOn Thursday, Bolsonaro signed a bill granting 1.95 billion reais ($359 million) to acquire 100 million doses of a formulation being developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, and produce more of it locally starting in December. In parallel, the state of Sao Paulo is working with Sinovac's CoronaVac, which could go into production in October if tests are successful. Brazil has also joined global tests of Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE vaccines.\n\nBrazil Says WHO Got Covid Response All Wrong: LatAm Virus Wrap\n\nWhile the search for the vaccine continues globally, Bolsonaro has doubled down on his defense of the use of antimalarial medication chloroquine and its sister drug hydroxichloroquine. Since being diagnosed with the virus in early July, Bolsonaro has attributed his mild symptoms and recovery to the drug, unproven against Covid-19. He often wields a box of the medication in his social media broadcasts.\n\nHis focus on the controversial drug and constant dismissal of the disease -- on Thursday, he lamented the high number of deaths but said people have to move on -- has led to repeated clashes with local governments. It has also made the response to the disease a heated and politicized matter: Public hospital doctors say they're being pressured into handing out hydroxychloroquine by worried patients.",

        "body": "Redfield says positive tests need to be below 5% by flu season More than 30 U.S. states are above that target level today\n\nThe head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warned that many regions in the U.S. need to drive the rate of Covid-19 cases sharply lower to avert a dangerous convergence of the pandemic with flu season.\n\nCDC Director Robert Redfield said in an interview Thursday that he's optimistic they'll do so, because newly recorded cases have declined from their recent peak in July and most areas of the U.S. are in a \"downward trajectory.\"\n\nEven so, there's a great distance for most of the country to go to reduce the burden of Covid before flu season arrives. Redfield said states need to have less than 5% of Covid tests return positive -- ideally even lower.\n\n\"We'd like to see those prevalence rates down under 3%, 2% of tests positive,\" he said, noting that the U.S. never brought cases down as dramatically as Europe did.\n\nMore than 30 states have reported over 5% test positivity in the past seven days, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. In Texas it's 23.7%, and 6.9% in California.\n\nSeasonal influenza sends hundreds of thousands of Americans to hospitals each year. Health officials fear that a bad flu season could collide with the Covid pandemic, sickening millions with similar symptoms and straining hospitals. But the country has a window in the next few months to avoid that scenario, by driving down coronavirus cases and inoculating more Americans with flu shots.\n\nRedfield said he believes more people will embrace universal mask wearing, social distancing, hand hygiene and the flu vaccine.\n\n\"There's evidence that the American public are listening,\" Redfield said. \"That evidence is grounded in the changes we're seeing across the nation in the number, not just of cases, but the number and the percent positive.\"\n\nIf health officials fail to control Covid before flu season, the outlook could be grim. The flu on its own has filled hospitals beyond their normal limits, just as the novel coravirus did earlier this year.\n\n\"If you had them both simultaneously, you could have very stressed health system,\" Redfield said.\n\nThat's why the stakes are so high to get the flu vaccine to as many people as possible. Almost 200 million doses should be available this year, a more than 10% increase compared with last year. The CDC itself purchased more than 9 million shots for adults, compared with 500,000 in a normal year, and additional shots for children.\n\nThe normal fall push for flu shots in clinics, drugstores and workplaces will be complicated by Covid's disruption, and it's likely to look different this season. Officials are considering delivering vaccines in new settings, such as drive-up sites that minimize the risk of spreading the infectious disease.\n\n\"The public may still have some reservations about going to any place where they're indoors around people they don't know,\" said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer with the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.\n\nAbout 63% of children and 45% of adults got the flu vaccine last year. Coverage varied widely by state, and Black, Hispanic, and Native Americans were least likely to be vaccinated. The CDC is working especially to make vaccines available in community clinics that serve low-income populations and expand outreach to Blacks and Hispanics, as well as workers and residents in long-term care facilities.\n\nThe goal is that \"anybody who wants the vaccine this year can get it safely,\" said Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.\n\nIn the U.S., localized flu outbreaks can begin as early as October, though the season typically peaks in January or later. The CDC encourages vaccination by October. It's recommended for all people over 6 months of age, but especially for young children, older adults and people with underlying illnesses.\n\nIn the best-case scenario, the same measures to prevent Covid -- wearing masks, staying 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart, canceling mass gatherings -- combined with widespread flu vaccination could significantly reduce flu illness. Sharp movement restrictions in response to Covid in the spring tamped down flu as well, and globally, flu activity is lower than expected so far this year.\n\nBut a lot of variables are in play, including how well the flu vaccine matches the strains that wind up circulating in the Northern Hemisphere, and whether fear of Covid keeps people from getting vaccinated.\n\n\"You never know beforehand whether it's going to be a bad flu season or not,\" said Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. The illness has sickened from 9 million to 45 million Americans each season in the past decade, according to CDC data.\n\nDeaths number in the tens of thousands annually. Severe flu seasons have triggered state emergency orders, crowded emergency rooms and occasionally forced hospitals to cancel elective surgeries.\n\nThe convergence of flu and Covid could aggravate the persistent testing challenges that have hobbled America's Covid response, Monto said, because some tests for flu use the same reagents as Covid tests.\n\nTesting companies say they're anticipating high demand, and clinicians are concerned about strains on testing and treatment if flu and Covid converge.\n\n\"Right now we're so limited we don't really want to test everybody with the sniffles for coronavirus,\" said David Battinelli, chief medical officer at Northwell Health in New York.\n\nHospitals in New York and elsewhere have learned how to handle spikes in Covid patients, converting other units to intensive care and putting beds in atriums and cafeterias. But those surges haven't coincided with the swell of flu patients hospitals see each year.\n\n\"A regular busy flu season, with no Covid, we're kind of primed for that,\" Battinelli said. \"It's really whether both things happen at the same time.\"",

        "body": "CDC Suggests Partial School Closings as Option in Virus Guidance\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance for reopening schools on Friday to include advice on what to do with students who come down with Covid-19, filling a gap that left administrators on their own to determine the best approach.\n\nThe guidelines are largely common-sense, though noteworthy after a week in which several large colleges have reversed plans for in-person learning and after several school districts sent students home after outbreaks.\n\nSick children should be isolated, areas where they've been disinfected, and health officials and close contacts should be notified, the CDC said. Maintaining a goal of keeping schools open, the CDC laid out a possible hybrid strategy that could include temporary building closures or halting certain activities like sports or assemblies \"to allow time for local health officials to gain a better understanding of the Covid-19 situation and help the school determine appropriate next steps.\"\n\nCDC Director Robert Redfield said on a call with reporters Friday that it's important for schools to \"have a well-thought out step-by-step approach\" and emphasized, as President Donald Trump has, that students should get back to in-person learning as soon as possible.\n\nWhen making any decisions about closing buildings or suspending activities, local health officials should take into account the number of Covid-19 cases in the area, not just in the school, the CDC said.\n\nRedfield highlighted a CDC study also released Friday that showed low secondary transmission of Covid-19 in child-care facilities in Rhode Island. Of 666 facilities that were open the last two weeks in July, state officials identified four where someone at the center passed the virus on to someone else there. The study attributed the low spread to a limit on class sizes and mask-wearing by adults at the facilities.\n\nHowever, since many children don't present symptoms, the study concedes some cases were likely undetected. It also notes the virus had a significant impact on the facilities, which had the capacity to care for almost 19,000 children. During those two weeks, 101 possible Covid-19 cases were identified, leading to the quarantine of 687 children and 166 staff.",

The U.S. issued a do not travel advisory for Mexico due to Covid-19.\n\nThe Philippines now has the worst outbreak in Southeast Asia, overtaking Indonesia, with cases surging to almost 120,000.

Click CVID on the terminal for global data on coronavirus cases and deaths.\n\nVictoria reported 450 new cases on Friday, down from 471 a day earlier, with 11 more people dying from Covid-19 in Australia's second-most populous state.\n\nPremier Daniel Andrews said about 150 people who were supposed to be self-isolating were not found at their homes when authorities carried out inspections on Thursday.\n\nThe state is under lockdown and residents in the capital of Melbourne this week started a six-week curfew between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m.\n\nVietnam's capital may place some high-risk virus areas under social distancing, according to a post on the city government's website, which cited information from a meeting on Thursday.\n\nThe statement did not provide details on what areas are being considered or what activities could be curtailed. The city has recorded as many as 94,000 returnees from Danang, the epicenter of the new outbreak, presenting a high risk of new infections that could possibly overwhelm the ability of medical units to engage in thorough contact tracing, according to the post.\n\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine said he's tested negative for Covid-19 after taking two PCR tests follow an earlier positive result.\n\n\"This test is known to be extremely sensitive, as well as specific, for the virus,\" his office says in a statement on the PCR test. PCR, or Polymerase Chain Reaction, amplifies the genetic material to indicate if someone is infected.\n\nThe earlier test was taken as part of the standard protocol to greet President Donald Trump on the tarmac when he arrives at Burke Lakefront Airport in Cleveland.\n\nThe U.S. State department issued an advisory to not travel to Mexico, noting that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a Level 3 Travel Health Notice for the country.\n\nThe State Department earlier lifted a global Level 4 health advisory in effect since March 19 that counseled U.S. citizens to avoid all international travel.\n\nMexico reported 6,590 new Covid-19 cases, bringing the nation's total to 462,690, according to data released by the Health Ministry. Deaths rose by 819 to 50,517.\n\nNegotiations on a virus relief package ended Thursday night with the White House and Democrats making progress on a few issues but still no closer to making headway on the biggest obstacles in the talks.\n\n\"There are a lot of issues we are close to a compromise position on,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said after a more than three hour meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. But they remain \"very, very far apart on some significant issues.\"\n\nMnuchin and White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows said there are still disagreements on the topline numbers for a stimulus bill and on individual provisions, including aid to state and local governments.\n\nDespite imposing the longest, strictest lockdown in Southeast Asia, coronavirus cases in the Philippines have now surged to almost 120,000, eclipsing Indonesia to become the region's biggest outbreak.\n\nThe country imposed a second lockdown on Manila and nearby areas to curb the spread of infections, even as the economy suffered its deepest contraction on record, shrinking 16.5% in the second quarter from a year ago.\n\nAfter enduring a strict lockdown from mid-March to the end of May, the Philippines re-opened its capital although new cases were still growing by up to a thousand every day. As people returned to offices and families gathered again, infections surged 500% in over two months of easing before the government re-imposed a lockdown this week.\n\nNevada broadened its criteria to receive unemployment benefits during the pandemic under a law signed Thursday by Governor Steve Sisolak.\n\nPeople generally can't receive benefits if they don't apply for or take \"suitable work.\" The new law, which passed the state Legislature during a special session, requires state employment officials to determine that Covid-19 is a \"good cause\" for refusing work. The law, effective immediately, also aims to streamline the state's inundated unemployment system by allowing people to receive documents electronically instead of via mail or in person.\n\nA large proportion of U.K. health-care workers may have been infected with coronavirus early in the pandemic, according to a survey suggesting that loss of smell and taste may be a guide to determining its prevalence in populations.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the London National Health Service staffers surveyed reported diminished ability to taste or smell -- one of the prominent, early symptoms of Covid-19 -- just weeks after the coronavirus arrived in the U.K., according to research published in The Lancet Microbe journal.\n\nJapan's Obon holiday period is synonymous with summer holidays, as many leave densely populated cities and travel to meet family in rural areas. But with national and local officials giving conflicting signals over the risk of travel as the period approaches, the holiday threatens to boost the spread of the pandemic, as cases continue to rise across the country.\n\nA day before many were due to travel, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike made a belated call for residents to refrain from going to their hometowns or otherwise traveling. The advice conflicts with that of the national government, which has pointedly refrained from calling for curbs on traveling home for the holidays, even after virus cases hit daily records in many parts of the country.\n\nWith cases flaring in population centers nationwide, the government's lack of direction against travel has been met with criticism. Some regions little touched by the virus have called on people not to return, fearing the specter of infected but possibly asymptomatic young people leaving cities and transmitting the disease to elderly relatives.\n\nBrazil, the second-most infected country, reported a total of 2.9 million cases, 53,139 of which were recorded in the last 24 hours, according to Health Ministry's press office.\n\nThe country added 1,237 new Covid-19 deaths, with a total fatality count of 98,493.\n\nThe health ministry also said Brazil will begin production of a vaccine in December as part of an agreement with AstraZeneca and University of Oxford.\n\nTravel curbs and border restrictions are upending lives around the globe, with some people resorting to chartering planes on their own or paying many times the regular ticket price to get back to their jobs and homes.\n\nEight months into the pandemic, the push to normalize is seeing some try to travel internationally again, whether for a long-delayed but essential business trip or to return to where they live. Yet with global coronavirus cases surpassing 18 million and rising, airlines are only reluctantly adding flights to their bare-bones schedules, and virus resurgences have some countries imposing new travel rules.\n\nSupport groups have sprung up on Facebook and Wechat for those who have been stuck thousands of miles from their jobs, homes and families. Unable to get tickets, some are attempting to organize private chartered flights, while travel agents say they're having to bribe airlines for limited seats. Others are shelling out for business or first-class tickets, only to be turned away for lack of the right documentation.\n\nCases in the continent have surpassed 1 million and the actual number of infections could be several times higher with a lack of testing, the Associated Press reported, citing global health experts. Some countries have only one testing machine, it said, and some have had fewer than 500 tests per million people.\n\nSeparately, South Africa reported 306 additional deaths and 538,184 cases.\n\nUber generated more revenue from delivering food than transporting people for the first time last quarter. Food delivery has become a central part of that strategy, even more so after the $2.65 billion deal to buy Postmates Inc.\n\nStill, it failed to offset a steep and prolonged decline in ridership brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, mirroring the overall contraction of the travel industry.\n\nCoronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 1.3% compared with the same time Wednesday to 4.85 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase was higher than the average 1.2% daily gain over the past week. Deaths rose 1.3% to 159,433.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds signaled she'd overrule any local officials who impose outdoor mask-wearing requirements. While businesses, school districts and local governments can legally require people to wear face masks inside their premises, anything beyond that would be subject to reversal by the governor, Reynolds said.\n\n\"We don't believe during a public health emergency that the local governments have the authority to supersede what is in place at the statewide level by the governor,\" Reynolds, a Republican who has refrained from issuing a statewide stay-home order, said Thursday.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Rutte told the Dutch public the country can \"prevent a second lockdown if we don't throw away the head start we achieved together.\" National measures may be required to rein in the virus, Rutte said on national television, after new cases almost doubled this week compared to the previous week.\n\nThe Netherlands lifted most virus-related restrictions on July 1. A 1.5-meter (5-foot) distancing rule remains in effect nationwide.\n\nFrance reported 1,604 new cases, marking the first time since April that the country has counted more than 1,600 infections on two consecutive days. Another seven deaths increased the total to 30,312, according to the Health Ministry.\n\nFrench authorities are increasingly ordering people to wear masks outdoors and indoors and warning of a pandemic resurgence as soon as September.\n\nThe U.S. death toll could almost double to 295,000 by December if the pace of the pandemic doesn't change, though 70,000 of those deaths could be avoided if everyone immediately wore masks, according to modeling by the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation.\n\n\"We're seeing a roller coaster in the United States,\" Christopher Murray, the institute's director, said in a statement. People wear masks and socially distance more frequently as infections increase, then let their guard down and \"the potentially deadly cycle starts over again,\" he said.\n\nApplications for U.S. unemployment benefits fell more than expected last week to the lowest since the pandemic began in a broad decline across nearly all states, suggesting the labor market is improving.\n\nThe drop, the largest in almost two months, comes as U.S. lawmakers are still working toward a stimulus package that would once again bolster the size of millions of Americans' unemployment checks.",

The tally has receded by 33% since peaking on July 22.\n\nThe state recorded 4,455 new cases, though the figure left out data from one of the hardest-hit regions, Nueces County, because Corpus Christi officials were dealing with a backlog of test results, according to a notice on the health department's website.\n\nThe statewide positivity rate climbed to a new record -- 20.99% -- but questions have been raised about the handling of more than 1 million test results classified as \"pending assignment\" and how that may have skewed the calculations. The health department didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is considering rules that would permit border officials to temporarily block American citizens from returning to the U.S. from abroad if authorities believe they may have Covid-19, the New York Times reported.\n\nA draft memo said the prohibition would apply \"only in the rarest of circumstances,\" and it's unclear when it might be approved or announced, the Times reported. A spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security declined to comment to the news outlet, while a CDC spokesman said he would seek to gather more information.\n\nBoris Johnson's government said it allocated 300 million pounds ($392 million) of funding to shore up hospital emergency services in England ahead of a potential winter resurgence in the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe funding, from an already announced 1.5 billion pound boost to capital spending, will be used to upgrade accident and emergency facilities, including widening waiting areas and increasing the number of treatment cubicles, the government said in an emailed statement. That's intended to ensure social-distancing measures can be maintained, it said.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom said trends point to \"encouraging signs\" in California's virus outbreak, even as the state recovers from several data glitches that caused it to undercount new infections for more than a week. Hospitalizations have dropped 19% in the last 14 days, while the number of people in intensive care fell 13% over the same period, Newsom said at a news briefing.\n\nLate Sunday, the director of the Department of Public Health, Sonia Angell, abruptly resigned from her post, without publicly stating a reason. Newsom wouldn't discuss the reasons for her departure in detail or confirm that it was the result of the data problems.\n\nConfirmed virus cases in the U.S. rose 0.9% as compared to the same time Sunday to 5.07 million, according to data from collected from Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News.

Deaths rose by 545 to 163,252.\n\nCalifornia reported 7,751 new cases, a 1.4% increase and higher than the seven-day average of 7,240. Hawaii experienced a 4.5% increase in cases, bringing the total to 3,498.\n\nFinland will quarantine travelers from most of the world to halt the spread of Covid-19. Just 25 countries are currently exempt from the mandatory quarantine, Krista Kiuru, minister for family affairs and social services, told reporters on Monday.\n\nPassengers who fail to comply face at most three months jail time or a fine and airlines will be required to disclose transit passengers to avoid attempts to circumvent the rules. The government will also allow authorities to conduct mandatory testing of passengers for Covid-19, Kiuru said, adding that the new restrictions will come into force as soon as possible.\n\nNew Jersey's virus transmission rate fell below 1 for the first time since July 25, Governor Phil Murphy said Monday, suggesting that the state is slowing the spread of Covid-19 but \"only by a hair.\"\n\nThe number of coronavirus patients hospitalized and occupying intensive-care beds in New York state has reached a new low, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday.\n\nThere were 535 people hospitalized and 127 in the ICU statewide on Sunday, the lowest since the pandemic began in March, he said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nOf the 54,002 tests conducted, 0.88% were positive, and there were two virus-related fatalities, he said.\n\nStarting next Monday, Greece will require visitors arriving on flights from Sweden, the Czech Republic, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands to test negative for Covid-19 no later than 72 hours before arrival, a government spokeswoman said. The same requirement will apply to all people entering Greece via its land borders except for Greek citizens or legal residents.\n\nPublic events including concerts where people stand are prohibited until further notice. Greece is also canceling the 85th Thessaloniki International Fair scheduled for Sept. 5 to 13.\n\nA World Health Organization mission to investigate the virus's origins would start in Wuhan, where the first cases were identified, Maria Van Kerkhove, the group's technical lead officer on Covid-19, said in a briefiing.\n\nThe organization plans an extensive study of individuals' exposures and activities like travel, occupation and daily life before they developed symptoms. Mike Ryan, head of the WHO's emergencies program, said the first case of an illness to be identified is not always in the location of the first cluster. He noted that it took years to determine the zoonotic origins for the 2012 MERS outbreak, and that the genesis of the 2002-2003 SARS outbreak has never been fully established.",

        "body": "Who should get tested? Patchwork of guidelines makes it hard to keep up\n\nWho should get tested for Covid-19? Depends who you ask.\n\nThe controversy sparked by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recent shift in guidance, saying asymptomatic people exposed to Covid-19 shouldn't necessarily be tested, highlights a growing frustration for doctors and health officials: Differing guidelines, rules and practices determine how the country's limited testing supply is allocated.\n\nShortly after the CDC issued its recommendations, the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut called them \"reckless\" and said they won't follow them. They're \"a recipe for community spread and more spikes in coronavirus,\" according to the American Medical Association.\n\nThat leaves health-care providers, individuals, employers and schools to navigate the chaotic mix of federal, state and local recommendations and mandates in deciding what to do.\n\n\"You're trying to do the best for your patients, trying to make sure you hit all the regulatory requirements,\" said Kara Mascitti, an infectious disease physician at St. Luke's University Health Network in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania and medical director for its infection prevention program. \"Frankly, you feel like your head is spinning sometimes.\"\n\nPublic-health experts say that deferring to state and local authorities, which has long been the White House strategy, is problematic for just that reason.\n\n\"Lack of guidance on a federal level creates mass confusion,\" said Leana Wen, a physician who formerly served as Baltimore's health commissioner and is a visiting professor of health policy and management at George Washington University. The CDC guidance change will result in \"even more of a piecemeal approach\" to public health, she said.\n\nAs the CDC dialed back testing recommendations, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services issued new rules for nursing homes, for the first time requiring facilities test workers.\n\nCovid-19 has killed almost 50,000 people in U.S. nursing homes, whose residents are particularly vulnerable to the virus. But testing practices have been inconsistent as CMS had merely recommended it and state policies varied widely.\n\nFor example, Michigan requires weekly tests for staff, as well as for residents in facilities where there were recent cases.\n\nBut repeated testing of asymptomatic residents strained labs and exacerbated waits for results, said Bart Buxton, an executive at McLaren Health Care, a Michigan health system. Processing delays mean some residents were tested again before earlier results were in, he said. But providers have to keep up with guidelines regardless.\n\n\"You've got all of that on top of a pressured supply line, and you've got chaos,\" Buxton said. \"We're leading through chaos.\"\n\nThe U.S. has performed more than 70 million Covid-19 tests, and is testing around 4.7 million per week, according to data from the Covid Tracking Project. That's down from a peak of more than 5.7 million in late July.\n\nBut to contain the virus, the U.S. should be testing many more. Ashish Jha, head of the Harvard Global Health Institute, told NPR in June that it would take 1 million tests a day to contain it, 4.3 million to suppress it. But supply shortages and challenges getting results quickly have hamstrung efforts to test more Americans.\n\nThere's a tension in deciding who should be tested when supplies are limited. Screening people, including those who have no known exposures or risks, can spot carriers of the virus and prevent them from spreading it. But doing large-scale surveillance testing can exacerbate bottlenecks at labs, delaying diagnoses.\n\nWith about 1.2 million Americans living in nursing homes, testing weekly would take up a quarter of the current number of weekly tests being performed.\n\nPremier Inc., a large purchasing group that works with hospitals, nursing homes, and other medical providers, recommends combining testing with other prevention strategies and is advocating for federal funding to help facilities install electronic systems to better keep track who may be at risk.\n\n\"Blind testing of all nursing home residents regardless of risk factors is likely a waste of resources,\" said Soumi Saha, senior director of advocacy at Premier.\n\nPressure will likely increase as schools, colleges, and workplaces count on screening tests to bring people back safely, she said. \"Scarce resources are only going to become worse as society returns to normal.\"\n\nEarly on, the lack of widespread testing allowed the virus to spread invisibly, blindsiding health officials. Since then, the country has sharply increased production of tests as well as the supplies required to perform them. But doctors warn there still isn't enough to do blanket surveillance.\n\nSo groups including the AMA urged the Trump administration this month to update guidelines \"to ensure that the limited testing resources available are directed at those with a medically-indicated need for tests and those identified by well-defined public health surveillance efforts.\"\n\nThe CDC guidance shifted away from testing those who were in close contact with to a diagnosed case. But the AMA letter recommended that tests go first to people with symptoms, known exposures to Covid-19, or those who needed tests before medical procedures, citing the surge in demand from students, employees, and people seeking a clear test to travel.\n\n\"We simply do not have the resources to meet the huge demand for testing by asymptomatic individuals without exposure to Covid-19,\" the AMA wrote.\n\nWeekly testing of the nation's 3.7 million teachers or 20 million college students would quickly outstrip capacity.\n\nYet some places are attempting to test at that pace. Undergraduates and grad students in Columbia University dorms, for example, will begin the semester with weekly surveillance testing, according to the university's plan. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign aims to screen twice a week with a new saliva-based test it developed.\n\nTesting plans are as rooted in what a group can afford as they are in anything else. Tests are being used \"not necessarily according to the value of the information, but more often according to the ability to pay for these tests,\" said Blythe Adamson, an infectious disease epidemiologist and economist who serves as an adviser to the nonprofit Testing for America. The group is working with historically Black colleges and universities to help them use testing to safely reopen.\n\nLynn University hired CVS Health to test students and staff on campus in Boca Raton, Florida. The school of about 3,200 students will prioritize people who are showing symptoms or may have been exposed, said Chief Strategy and Technology Officer Christian Boniforti. Under the agreement, Lynn can do between 30 and 90 rapid tests a day, with the option for more as needed.\n\nThat colleges and other groups are using frequent testing for students who lack symptoms isn't \"necessarily a negative thing,\" because it's something the rest of the country can learn from, said Wen, the former Baltimore health commissioner.\n\n\"Is this something that's effective? Can we actually rein in coronavirus this way?\" she said. The aggressive testing of National Basketball Association players or by the University of Illinois may show whether it's a viable strategy to fight transmission, \"especially if they're in places of widespread surge,\" Wen said.\n\nSome businesses also see the value of repeat testing, but wonder whether they can sustain it.\n\nTalon International, a Los Angeles-based supplier of zippers and trim for clothing, began testing its 30 local employees each week in May. It worked with a company called Kyla, with Talon's insurer picking up the tab.\n\nThe frequent screening allowed Talon to identify an employee who tested positive and quickly quarantine the individual and re-test staff, said Chief Executive Larry Dyne.\n\nBut in mid-July, Talon's insurer said it would stop paying, Dyne said. The facility is now shut down and when it reopens, he's not sure what they'll do.\n\n\"We certainly would like to get back to a weekly or bimonthly testing of some sort, to at least give people some amount of confidence that the workplace is remaining sterile and completely staying sanitized,\" he said.",

        "body": "Trump wants classrooms reopened to 'virtually immune' students\n\nChicago Public Schools will begin the academic year with all-virtual classes this fall after administrators bowed to pressure from nervous staff and parents, rebuffing President Donald Trump's calls to reopen classrooms to avoid further strain on the U.S. economy.\n\nThe Wednesday decision by the nation's third-largest district leaves only New York among major U.S. systems planning on in-person classes; Governor Andrew Cuomo has said he will make a final decision this week. The national rush to all-remote learning will keep parents struggling to work and teach their children simultaneously, businesses navigating those conflicts, and the virus-wracked country that much farther away from normality.\n\n\"It's a huge blow to the economy, and to the long-term potential for growth,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton in Chicago. \"Unfortunately we've put ourselves in a position where it's getting harder to see how we're going to sustain a rebound in the third quarter.\"\n\nIn Chicago alone, the decision affects 355,000 students -- kids whose parents had expected them to be in classrooms starting Sept. 8. Other major school districts that have already opted for virtual instruction for at least the start of the year include Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Miami, Atlanta and Houston. If New York City joins in, that would affect the families of another 1.1 million students.\n\nThe cities are taking these steps as Covid-19 infections spike across the U.S., choosing to be cautious amid conflicting data about how susceptible kids are to contract or spread the disease. The decisions are being made against unrelenting pressure from Trump, whose theories on the topic aren't always supported by his own health experts.\n\n\"This thing's going away -- it will go away like things go away and my view is that schools should be open,\" Trump said Wednesday on Fox News. Children \"are virtually immune from this problem. And we have to open our schools.\"\n\nAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has rejected this claim, however. There are parts of the country where schools shouldn't open to in-person teaching, the doctor told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday, and testing for the disease needs to improve, especially in the speed to obtain results.\n\nThere is conflicting data about how Covid-19 is transmitted to and from children,\n\nA study published in JAMA last month -- based on work in a Chicago pediatric hospital -- suggests infected kids with even just mild symptoms can still have 10 to 100 times the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in their noses and throats as older kids or adults, making them more likely to spread it. An earlier Chinese study, however, found that most children with Covid-19 admitted to a hospital lived in households with previously infected adults, indicating the child caught the virus from the adult rather than transmitting it.\n\nFauci Says Virus Testing Too Slow as Trump Says 'Best Ever'\n\nA small number of kids have died or required intensive care as a result of either the respiratory failure commonly associated with the virus or an inflammatory condition sometimes described as similar to Kawasaki disease that causes heart or circulatory problems.\n\nThat leaves school officials largely at the mercy of their local health officials for guidance. In Chicago, the district will work with the city Department of Public Health to assess if it is safe to open with hybrid learning in the second quarter on Nov. 9.\n\nThe economic effects of keeping children out of school go beyond matters of convenience and pocketbook. The also expose imbalances in the economy, with some children unable to access the internet as easily as others.\n\n\"The first-order short-term economic impacts will be likely centered around what this does to families needing childcare; loss of school meals for the kids making hunger worse; and whatever furloughing the district is doing,\" said Diane Schanzenbach, professor at the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. \"Long term, the costs of all of this lost learning will be with us for decades.\"\n\nSenate Republicans have proposed a bill that would provide $70 billion to K-12 schools, but that may not be enough to safely reopen, or even to go remote and provide needed tech to low-income families. More than $116 billion will be needed to safely reopen the nation's public schools, according to an estimate from the American Federation of Teachers union.\n\nCongress is scheduled to hold a remote hearing on safely reopening schools Thursday with former Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. The hearing follows current Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's threat last month to defund schools that don't open in person full-time.\n\nThe teacher's unions have been lobbying heavily against in-person school, citing budget restraints and health risks for staff and pupils. In Chicago, educators already went on strike last year to demand more nurses, librarians and counselors. The Chicago Teachers Union estimated last month that it would cost between $450 million and $1.7 billion to reopen the city's public schools safely, depending on the model.\n\nNew York City officials say they are still on track to open in September with a hybrid of in-class and remote instruction. While schools will get cleaned daily and masks are mandatory, the plan has been criticized by state officials, who have described it as more of an outlier. Mayor Bill de Blasio says they will shut down if the city's infection rate exceeds 3% over seven days.\n\n\"We are trying to maximize in-person learning for the good of our kids because we know it makes a world of difference,\" de Blasio said during an Aug. 3 news briefing. \"Online is a tool we will use when we need to use it, but it's inherently imperfect.",

Canada's border patrol turned away a mother driving her daughter to McGill because of her U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe back-to school rituals of America's college-bound have always entailed some drama: long journeys, family squabbles and children away from home for the first time. But they're nothing compared with 2020, the year that Covid-19 transformed higher education.\n\nUntil now, colleges moved in a kind of lock-step. The most selective ones charged similar $70,000-plus annual prices, bragged about small classes and doting professors and marketed life-long networks forged in dorms and dining halls.\n\nToday, in Massachusetts alone, the variety is dizzying. Northeastern University has gone all in on in-person instruction. Long famed for promoting work experience, it is now trumpeting another specialty: an on-campus lab to process 5,000 Covid-19 tests a day.\n\nOr consider Tufts University. Colleges, eager to win over new donors, have long welcomed parents to help kids decorate or hear from administrators in orientation. Tufts said some students will have to move into their dorms without any help from parents or loved ones.\n\nHarvard University, where all classes will be virtual, isn't requiring students to come at all. Only a quarter of undergraduates will be on campus, and they'll face a world where they'll be tested regularly and have to attest daily they are symptom free -- or, in its parlance, are \"Crimson Clear.\" Some 20% of freshmen decided to defer enrolling -- postponing the hottest ticket in higher ed.\n\nMeanwhile, Williams College is doing the unthinkable. Acknowledging the reality of a diminished, socially distant semester, it is offering a 15% discount.\n\n\"It's a tough time for students who dreamed of the college experience they saw in movies and TV,\" said Christopher Marsicano, an assistant professor who studies higher education at Davidson College in North Carolina.\n\nSome will have it worse than others. At Duke University in North Carolina, junior Shrey Majmudar will be trading a dorm for his own room at the college-owned Washington Duke Inn & Golf Club. The school reserved lodgings there to provide more social distancing. Yet, there will be sacrifices, as well. In a school known for its spirit, Duke is restricting gatherings to 10 students or fewer.\n\nA third of four-year nonprofit and public colleges are opening entirely or mostly in person, 27% are fully or primarily online and 21% are a hybrid, or a mix of the two, according to Davidson's College Crisis Initiative, which is tracking universities' responses. In the last week, 40 schools, or 3%, switched from partly in-person to fully online.\n\nThe about-faces can be tough. Princeton University student Juan Nova will drive 17 hours from his home near Orlando to New Jersey, so he can live in an off-campus apartment. As a sophomore, Nova wasn't due to return in-person until the spring but had wanted to take part in whatever campus life he could in the fall. He and his two roommates signed a lease before the school switched to entirely online. By then, they were locked in.\n\n\"It was an abrupt change,\" said Nova, 19. \"I understand the decision to stay safe.\"\n\nThe $600 billion-plus higher education industry is doing what it can to stay solvent. About 60% to 80% of revenue comes from tuition and fees, according to the National Association of College and University Business Officers. College communities rely on the institutions as engines of employment, tourism and economic innovation.\n\nNormally, as students return, administrators like to schmooze with families. But, in perhaps a first, Notre Dame President John Jenkins had to issue a mea culpa for standing too close to students. The school has reported 19 Covid-19 cases.\n\n\"Even I was swept up in the excitement and celebration of your return. In a few instances, over recent days, I stopped for photos with some of you on the quad,\" Jenkins wrote last week.\n\nFew can match the drop-off ordeal of Vivian Mamelak, whose 18-year-old daughter Leena Demers is starting her first year at McGill University in Montreal. She and her husband rented a house not far from the campus, so they could quarantine for the required two weeks. Mamelak, unlike her husband and daughter, isn't a Canadian citizen.\n\nTo make the case that the family should be together, Mamelek brought her marriage certificate, as Canadian officials had instructed her to do. No dice. Border agents turned her away, since Canada has restricted travel by Americans amid the coronavirus. The family had to drive back to Plattsburgh, New York, so Mamelak could rent a car to return home to New York City. Her daughter is scheduled to start later this month and will live in a dorm while taking class mostly online.\n\n\"I wanted to take my daughter to university and get her settled into her dorm room and have that whole rite of passage with her and I was sent away,\" Mamelak said. \"It was very sad.\"",

        "body": "UNC shuttered in-person classes after reopening without tests\n\nMany universities see Covid-19 testing as the only way to safely bring students back to campuses this fall, but their approaches vary as widely as their mascots.\n\nSome are requiring test results before a student gets to school, others are offering screenings upon arrival. Still others are relying on symptom screening and random surveillance testing. And the lucky ones with their own labs are putting them to work, regularly testing swabs or saliva from those on campus for the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe costs of not testing were starkly illustrated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill this week. The school didn't require a test before returning and the rate at which results for on-campus tests were coming back positive shot to 13.6% from 2.8% just a week after classes began, bringing the total infected to 135 Tuesday. It canceled in-person classes Monday and is moving most students off campus.\n\nThe University of Notre Dame, like UNC, invited students back early in August but required them to be tested before arrival. Still, it saw results surge, hitting 147 on Tuesday, less than two weeks after the first case was diagnosed. Contact tracing efforts found that most cases traced to seniors living off-campus.\n\nThat prompted President John Jenkins to move all undergraduate classes online for at least two weeks and clamp down on activity, restricting students in off-campus housing from coming to campus. Public spaces on campus were closed and residence halls were restricted to those who live there, and gathering limits were cut in half to 10 people.\n\nThe school had partnered with Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings and administers tests at its football stadium where those with symptoms can be tested. Jenkins said in an on-line address on Tuesday evening that \"we will in coming weeks both enhance our testing of those experiencing symptoms and our surveillance testing of those without symptoms.\"\n\nIf those measures contain the spread, in-person learning could resume, Jenkins said. If not, students would be sent home as they were in the spring semester.\n\nSchools across the U.S. are finding no easy answers for how to institute and police the new regimen of masks, distancing and screening for students who yearn to resume not only their educations but also their social lives, with parties and gatherings with friends.\n\n\"Many schools are handing out a mask and a bottle of hand sanitizer and saying, 'OK, go behave yourselves,'\" said A. David Paltiel, a Yale University professor of public health who co-authored a study that concluded schools should test every few days with rapid, inexpensive tests. \"And I think that's just setting students up to fail. And not only that, but be blamed for the failure.\"\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't recommend testing all returning students, faculty and staff upon their return to campus. It does, however, recommend broad screenings of individuals who don't have symptoms in some settings, like residence halls, lab facilities and lecture rooms where the novel coronavirus could spread rapidly.\n\nMany students who return to campuses will experience some form of testing, but the frequency of the tests has become a major differentiator between colleges.\n\nRuby Davis, an incoming freshman at Binghamton University in New York, will take a nasal swab test when she arrives on campus on Aug. 21 for her 11 a.m. appointment. She should get her results within 30 minutes. With a negative test, she said, she'll be allowed to join freshman orientation.\n\nBinghamton spokesman Ryan Yarosh said researchers are developing 3-D simulations to study indoor and outdoor movements and behaviors of students during high-traffic times at the school's busiest locations to help develop guidelines. It also plans to randomly test a percentage of on-campus students each week.\n\nDavis said she feels \"a bit safer\" knowing the school is trying to be vigilant. Still, the 18-year-old said, \"I'm nervous for many reasons but Covid's just adding a lot to that.\"\n\nNortheastern University in Boston will require three negative tests before a student can begin in-person classes. They'll test every two to three days with medical professionals observing them as they self-swab in either a central sports facility or a separate facility intended for those who had close contact with someone who tested positive. The university aims to test students every five days thereafter for the rest of the semester.\n\nThe university built a new lab at a campus in Burlington, Massachusetts, where it aims to process up to 5,000 tests a day and partners with the Broad Institute in nearby Cambridge for added resources.\n\n\"Truly if any of us didn't think we could do this safely, we wouldn't do it,\" provost David Madigan said. \"This is not a commitment to reopen come hell and high water. This is a commitment to reopen so long as we can do it safely.\"\n\nColleges that embrace testing are likely to face the same challenges that laboratories across the country have faced: Having enough supplies and getting timely results. Even so, experts say, it's better than waiting until students, faculty and staff report symptoms to start testing.\n\n\"A school that tests and responds only when symptoms have been observed is like a fire department that responds only when a house has been burnt to the ground,\" Yale's Paltiel said. \"Any school that can't work its way through some of these minimum screening standards we have suggested should be asking themselves, Do we have any business reopening?\"\n\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is preparing to screen about 60,000 students, faculty and staff twice a week.\n\nWhen it began developing its testing strategy in May, the need for frequent screenings with quick turnaround times quickly became clear. But even state-of-the-art testing \"was never going to get us there,\" said Marty Burke, associate dean of research for the Carle Illinois College of Medicine who led the school's testing and tracing program.\n\nSo Illinois developed a new test for which it's seeking emergency authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Similar to one developed by Yale researchers and funded by the National Basketball Association that won emergency authorization on Aug. 15, Illinois's test uses saliva, allowing for easier collection at about 20 tents scattered across campus. The school is setting up a company to make the technology more broadly available.\n\nTests will be conducted at a converted veterinary lab, where they're usually looking at illnesses in cows and pigs, Burke said. The shorter process streamlines logistics and requires less machinery and supplies. It also brings down costs to about $10 per test and aims to have capacity to process 20,000 tests a day, according to Burke.\n\n\"We are humbled by the challenge but we are really very hopeful that we can succeed,\" Burke said.",

        "body": "Sign up here for our daily coronavirus newsletter on what you need to know, and subscribe to our Covid-19 podcast for the latest news and analysis.\n\nA consensus is building among public health experts that it's better to keep university students on campus after a Covid-19 outbreak rather than send them home as many are doing.\n\nIt's easier to isolate sick or exposed students and trace their contacts if they stay put, said Ravina Kullar, epidemiologist and spokesperson for Infectious Diseases Society of America. Sending students home risks exposing other people there as well as along the way, and makes contact tracing all but impossible.\n\n\"There's just inevitably going to be an outbreak,\" she said. \"Colleges need to take on the burden of having these students kept at their campus and taking care of them.\"\n\nThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill was one of the first to reverse in-person learning, sending students home to complete the semester remotely after the school had an outbreak. Colleges including Towson University and East Carolina University have done the same.\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced Aug. 27 that schools in the state would switch to online learning for two weeks if they record 100 cases or 5% of the population gets infected, keeping students in place while tamping the virus's spread. The University of Notre Dame adopted the same strategy, and announced Friday that it will resume in-person classes on Sept. 2.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump spoke of the risk this month while urging campuses to reopen, saying that sending students home after an outbreak could put relatives at risk. \"Instead of saving lives, a decision to close universities could cost lives,\" he said.\n\nNotre Dame President John Jenkins had initially leaned toward clearing the campus when cases shot up to 147 less than two weeks after the first person was diagnosed. The county's deputy health officer, Mark Fox, persuaded him to make classes remote and clamp down on interactions first to see if that could slow the spread.\n\nNotre Dame had a solid plan for reopening its campus, Fox said. The challenge was the magnitude and the velocity of cases, he said. When it hit, the school ramped up testing, added more isolation beds and expanded contact tracing. Together with tight restrictions on interactions between those living on and off campus, Notre Dame slowed cases from jumping to communities surrounding the school.\n\nFor schools that send students home, contact tracing to help ensure they and their communities stay safe gets harder, especially for out-of-state students.\n\nIf students live relatively nearby or are in-state, tracers can do their job, said Howard Koh, former assistant secretary for health for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health professor. If students leave the state to go home, it's less effective.\n\n\"That will make the job very difficult, if not impossible,\" he said.\n\nContact tracing can help manage outbreaks when done correctly. The U.S. has struggled with it for many reasons, including getting people to answer the phone and respond truthfully. That's even harder at college, when students worry about being disciplined for violating rules: Many schools have limited parties and other gatherings to reduce Covid-19 risks. Young people also relish finally being back with their friends.\n\n\"The more contacts a person has, the harder contact tracing can be,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. \"People may not even know who they're in contact with, especially if they are drinking.\"\n\nEffective programs interview a patient as soon as possible after a diagnosis to find out where they went while contagious, then contact anyone they encountered about their possible exposure. It's usually recommended those contacts quarantine and monitor for symptoms.\n\nIn Chapel Hill, sick Tar Heels were isolated, and UNC quarantined anyone who was exposed when it announced it was sending students home on Aug. 17.\n\nThose who went home were advised to self-isolate for 14 days, according to Ken Pittman, campus health executive director. Contact tracers have been effective in mitigating further spread, he said. Still, the UNC Covid dashboard showed another 26 new cases on Aug. 28.\n\nEast Carolina reported 370 total positive cases from students as of Aug. 24. ECU's contact tracing coordinator, Kelli Russell, said although they've run into issues with voice mailboxes that are full or not set up, students are answering their phones and speaking with the trained contact tracers, and have been transparent about where they have been and whom they have been in contact with.\n\nUNC's staff and student health services work with county officials to locate cases on campus or nearby and traces close contacts of students testing positive even if they've left campus, Pittman said. They'll coordinate with local health departments when a close contact who isn't a student is identified, even out of state.",

        "body": "Lindsay Ruck was just starting her Father's Day brunch shift at the Cheesecake Factory in Chandler, Ariz., when her boss told her a co-worker had Covid-19. In between making bloody marys, Ruck shared the news with several of her colleagues, who'd been worrying about such a moment since the restaurant reopened the month before. At the end of Ruck's shift, when she went to the back office to count her cash, her boss and another supervisor were waiting.\n\nHer boss, the general manager, told her she wasn't allowed to mention the coronavirus case to anyone, including fellow staff. The company was informing only the people who'd worked during the sick employee's last shift, and, per Cheesecake higher-ups, even the information that any worker had tested positive was deemed private, Ruck recalls. Realizing she could be among those kept in the dark about the next sick colleague, she filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board and took a couple of weeks off while awaiting the results of a Covid test and weighing whether to keep working there. After getting a negative test result, she returned to the restaurant, in need of the paycheck.\n\n\"I don't know what kind of risk I'm putting on my family,\" says Ruck, who has young kids, plus an elderly mom nearby. She's worked for the Cheesecake Factory for about 13 years but says it suddenly feels a lot tougher to trust that the company, which promises its staff \"unlimited smiles,\" will keep her safe.\n\nCheesecake Factory Inc. said in a statement that it was \"balancing its obligation to protect private and confidential health information\" while allowing discussion of Covid issues. A Cheesecake lawyer asked Ruck to withdraw her NLRB complaint in exchange for the company posting a notice at her restaurant affirming that employees have the right to discuss health and safety issues, she says. She agreed after learning that the labor board can't levy punitive damages. \"It doesn't feel like it has a lot of teeth,\" Ruck says. \"I'm not convinced it will ultimately change their behavior, or any other company's.\"\n\nIn the past few months, U.S. businesses have been on a silencing spree. Hundreds of U.S. employers across a wide range of industries have told workers not to share information about Covid-19 cases or even raise concerns about the virus, or have retaliated against workers for doing those things, according to workplace complaints filed with the NLRB and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\n\nWorkers at Amazon.com, Cargill, McDonald's, and Target say they were told to keep Covid cases quiet. The same sort of gagging has been alleged in OSHA complaints against Smithfield Foods, Urban Outfitters, and General Electric. In an email viewed by Bloomberg Businessweek, Delta Air Lines told its 25,000 flight attendants to \"please refrain from notifying other crew members on your own\" about any Covid symptoms or diagnoses. At Recreational Equipment Inc., an employee texted colleagues to say he'd tested positive and that \"I was told not to tell anybody\" and \"to not post or say anything on social media.\"\n\nAmazon, McDonald's, and Target dispute the allegations. REI says it doesn't prohibit employees from, or punish them for, raising concerns or discussing their own health. General Electric Co. says it hasn't threatened employees for discussing Covid-related concerns, and Delta says it hasn't punished staff for sharing diagnoses. Smithfield Foods Inc. says its policy \"is the opposite of the allegations in the complaint.\" Urban Outfitters Inc. says it encourages employees to report concerns and that OSHA has found no wrongdoing on its part. Cargill Inc. says it considers health information private.\n\nOne complaint says trailer manufacturer Great Dane LP set as its policy \"Don't ask, don't tell.\" According to another complaint, plastics company Jeans Extrusions Inc. told workers not to discuss infections, because \"they cannot afford to quarantine us all.\" According to another, beverage store LiqGo told employees anyone who revealed they had Covid-19 would be fired. Jeans Extrusions says the complaint was untrue. \"We are very, very friendly, family-oriented,\" says plant manager Vince Lewandowski, \"not slave drivers at all.\" Great Dane and LiqGo didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nTeachers say they're getting gag orders, too. At the end of July, as Florida prepared to resume in-person classroom teaching, the school district in Jacksonville's home county of Duval emailed a warning to employees. Any social media posting that would \"reflect badly\" on the district's reputation \"may lead to disciplinary actions,\" according to the email, later viewed by Businessweek. The school district says the email wasn't meant to prevent employees from expressing views on reopening.\n\nIn many cases, workers say their bosses have cited employee privacy to justify the gags, including federal privacy laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. But such laws don't require companies to silence employees on safety matters. On the contrary, federal laws, including those that created OSHA and the NLRB, guarantee employees the right to communicate about and protest their job conditions. The federal bodies have failed to make companies obey the law. Many thousands of OSHA complaints about coronavirus safety issues have yielded citations against just two companies -- a health-care company and a nursing home -- totaling about $47,000. \"The agency continues to field and respond to complaints, and will take the steps needed to address unsafe workplaces,\" the U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA's parent, said in a statement. The NLRB declined to comment.\n\nEmployer crackdowns on free speech threaten to mask another wave of Covid infections and make the end of the year far deadlier than it otherwise might be. \"In many places, workplace exposures are driving the pandemic,\" says epidemiologist David Michaels, who ran OSHA under President Obama and is now a professor at George Washington University. \"To stop this pandemic, workers need to be listened to rather than silenced.\"\n\nIn mid-July, Irma Cruz returned to work at a McDonald's in Gilroy, Calif., a couple of days after she'd called in sick with a cough and breathing trouble. Cruz, a single mother of three, says she would have stayed home longer except that her boss was refusing to pay for her sick days. When she got a headache, a co-worker gave her an Advil and a manager told her to stay on the job. The next day she learned she'd tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nCruz says she asked a supervisor to inform her co-workers, but the supervisor said not to worry, that the virus wasn't contagious unless you spent more than 10 minutes with someone. The supervisor also said the news was \"confidential,\" Cruz recalls. Alarmed, she started calling and alerting co-workers herself. Then, she says, the supervisor called back, angrily berating her for disclosing her diagnosis.\n\nStaffing was the problem, says Cruz, who filed a complaint with the county environmental health department. Previously, when a co-worker had reported contracting the virus, other employees refused to come to work. \"I don't want anyone else to get sick,\" she says. \"I don't want that on my conscience.\" In a statement relayed by McDonald's Corp., the franchise owner of Cruz's restaurant said her allegations \"completely mischaracterize the extensive steps we have taken to create a safe experience for everyone who enters our restaurants.\" He said his restaurant provides paid sick leave and notifies staff when they may have been exposed to a sick co-worker, while being sure to protect sick workers' privacy. Cruz says she hasn't been paid for her time in quarantine.\n\nHealth confidentiality is a common refrain when ordering workers not to discuss Covid. In a recording that Target Corp. employee Milo Wright made of a conversation with a manager in Shreveport, La., which Wright shared with Businessweek, the manager says someone at the store has tested positive for Covid, then says workers are \"prohibited\" from talking about the matter on social media. \"We want to make sure we get the right information out, and you know how once people start talking amongst themselves, the right information gets distorted, and the wrong information is coming out,\" the manager can be heard saying on the recording.\n\nWright, who was terminated in June, has filed complaints against Target with the NLRB and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and says the company made staff sign a document agreeing not to disclose Covid cases to the public. \"While we are considered essential, we are also considered expendable,\" says Wright. Target says the firing was unrelated to the coronavirus and that it doesn't ask staff to sign documents prohibiting Covid discussion. \"We provide as much information as possible, while also keeping medical information confidential,\" the company says.\n\nSo far, companies have had little to fear from federal oversight. Trump-era NLRB rulings have expanded companies' discretion to restrict activist workers' speech on subjective grounds such as offensiveness. And the scant number of inspectors under OSHA's purview -- 862 as of January, enough to inspect each workplace once every 165 years -- has left it at a nadir. OSHA hasn't issued any regulations to address the pandemic. It's received more than 8,000 related health and safety complaints, while state agencies have received more than 24,000. The Labor Department says OSHA is recruiting inspectors.\n\nOSHA is supposed to protect whistleblowers against retaliation by their employers. The agency has a separate process for complaints in this vein, but it's tough to win restitution that way. Workers have only 30 days to file and must rely on OSHA to decide to sue the companies on their behalf, which it rarely does. OSHA released data in August showing it's closed more than 600 Covid-related whistleblower complaints against companies including Burger King, FedEx, General Motors, Halliburton, 7-Eleven, Tufts University, Walmart, and Warby Parker Retail.\n\nBurger King Corp. says it hasn't created or sanctioned any policy restricting staff from raising Covid-19 concerns. General Motors Co. and Halliburton Co. deny retaliating. Walmart Inc. says it has a strict nonretaliation policy. FedEx Corp. says safety is its top priority. Tufts and Warby Parker Retail Inc. say they were never informed of any complaint. 7-Eleven Inc. didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nOn Aug. 14, the inspector general overseeing OSHA issued a report that found the agency had trouble finishing whistleblower investigations in a timely manner even before the pandemic, with the average investigation running for more than nine months. By the end of May, OSHA had received more than 1,600 whistleblower complaints related to Covid-19, and the report warned that worse delays would have consequences: \"When OSHA fails to respond in a timely manner, it could leave workers to suffer.\"\n\nThe Labor Department said in a statement that 86 Covid-related complaints have been settled and that OSHA is evaluating others for possible litigation. \"OSHA will continue working around the clock to find ways to protect whistleblowers,\" according to the department.\n\nIn early July, a supervisor at Maid-Rite Specialty Foods LLC told workers OSHA would be visiting the plant because some staff had complained, according to one of the employees. If they had concerns, they should instead raise them with management, the supervisor said, according to the worker, a mechanic who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation. Then the supervisor added, as though he was joking, that once the company figured out who'd gone to OSHA, \"you won't see them anymore.\"\n\nBy then, several employees had filed OSHA complaints about the Dunmore, Pa., plant, which supplies frozen meat products to military bases, nursing homes, and schools. One was the mechanic, who in April told the agency he didn't feel safe because the company wasn't telling them about Covid cases there. \"About half the plant is out sick,\" another worker wrote in April. \"I'm scared to go to work every day.\"\n\nThe mechanic says OSHA called him to say it would be sending Maid-Rite a letter instead of coming to inspect the plant, and that was the last he ever heard from the agency about his complaint. Letters between OSHA and Maid-Rite show OSHA told Maid-Rite in April to investigate worker allegations itself, and Maid-Rite wrote back saying that it was providing and mandating masks and that 6-foot distancing sometimes wasn't feasible.\n\nThe next month, other employees at the plant filed a fresh OSHA complaint, alleging they were in harm's way because of insufficient masks, excessive line speeds, and \"elbow-to-elbow\" close quarters. Later, in a sworn affidavit, another worker said he told the human resources department he'd tested positive for Covid, but HR told co-workers he hadn't. Seven weeks after the May complaint, OSHA sent an inspector to Maid-Rite -- but in a break from typical protocol, it gave the company a heads-up. \"OSHA is here, so do everything right!\" a supervisor told staff during the inspection, the mechanic later wrote in an affidavit. Fifteen minutes later, the supervisor returned to say \"Never mind,\" because the visit was over, the mechanic wrote: \"As soon as OSHA left, everything went exactly back to the way it was.\"\n\nA couple weeks later, three workers filed a rare lawsuit against OSHA to try to force action by the agency, which had rejected their plea to designate their case an \"imminent danger.\" In a July 31 hearing on the suit, an OSHA compliance officer, who'd worked for Amazon.com Inc. the year before, acknowledged that she alerted Maid-Rite the day before the inspection. Higher-ups had told her to do so, she said, to make arrangements to ensure she'd be safe. The workers say they still aren't.\n\nMaid-Rite denies the allegations. \"We run a clean, safe plant,\" Executive Vice President Michael Bernstein said in a statement. \"I am confident that the truth will prevail.\" The Labor Department says OSHA began investigating the company on June 2, a process that can take six months. The government said in a filing that the inspector \"reasonably determined that no imminent danger exists\" at the plant.\n\nSuing OSHA is one of a few Hail Marys labor activists are trying to employ. Another one is nuisance laws: Workers in fast food, meatpacking, and retail businesses have used the kinds of laws typically invoked against noisy concerts to sue their employers for mishandling the pandemic in ways that have harmed the public. Amazon employee Barbara Chandler, a plaintiff in one such lawsuit, alleges she contracted Covid at the com\u00adpany's warehouse in Staten Island, N.Y., and brought it home to her cousin, who developed coronavirus symptoms and died in April. When Chandler told an HR rep on March 26 that she'd tested positive, she says, \"he just told me, 'Don't say nothing to nobody -- just keep it confidential.'\u200a\" She says Amazon claimed it would alert workers who'd been in contact with her, but didn't ask who those people were and took another four days to send a text message alerting the workforce. Chandler's suit seeks compensation for employees' unpaid Covid-19 sick leave, as well as a court order requiring improved safety measures.\n\nAmazon said in a statement that it tells everyone at its facilities when a co-worker tests positive for the coronavirus and that it's spent more than $800 million on pandemic-related safety measures through June. In legal filings, the company has said that Chandler's lawsuit is an attempt to \"exploit the pandemic\" and that the law requires workers to take such claims to OSHA.\n\nThe NLRB's and OSHA's authorities limit local governments' discretion to act on workers' behalf, but there are steps they can take. In June, Philadelphia's mayor signed an ordinance that bans firing or otherwise punishing workers who disclose Covid hazards. The new law puts the burden of proof on employers to establish that such firings weren't illegal retaliations and allows the workers to seek penalties in court on behalf of the city.\n\nIn July, Colorado's governor signed a similar law, making it illegal for companies to require workers to keep health concerns private or retaliate against workers who raise them. A few days after the Colorado bill signing, Virginia's state safety board passed its own binding Covid regulations, including a ban on retaliation against workers who raise reasonable concerns at work or on social media and a requirement that companies notify co-workers and the state about coronavirus cases.\n\nOther states should adopt such standards and could go further by alerting the public about companies with clusters of cases, says Terri Gerstein, a former labor bureau chief for New York's attorney general's office and now a fellow at Harvard Law School. \"It's a matter of public health,\" she says, \"and of opening the economy in a long-term way instead of start-and-stop sputtering.\"\n\nFor now, data-sharing has been among employees' best defenses. While Amazon workers around the country protest the firings of colleagues who'd organized to demand safer practices, including Chandler's former shiftmate Chris Smalls, they're also taking steps to better inform one another of safety risks. Amazon, which has denied retaliating against the organizers, has declined to release statistics about its Covid problem, despite pressure from state attorneys general. So Jana Jumpp, a former worker at an Amazon warehouse in Indiana, has spent the past several months sharing and updating her own Google spreadsheet of confirmed cases across the company's U.S. network.\n\nJumpp left Amazon in July. Now she's cleaning offices and Airbnbs instead. Still, she's continued to spend her spare time on the phone and Facebook, collecting notifications Amazon has issued to individual warehouses and sharing the tally of sick workers with other Amazon employees and reporters. Besides informing people about the risks of Amazon's facilities, she says, she's trying to remind workers in its warehouses that they aren't invisible and they don't have to be silent. \"I want them to know that there's somebody counting,\" Jumpp says. \"There's somebody keeping score for them.\"\n\nRead next: Big Pharma Needs a Covid-19 Vaccine to Redeem Its Reeling Reputation",

However, still birth and newborn death rates were low among these babies, the researchers found.\n\nThe researchers analyzed 77 studies that included 11,432 hospitalized pregnant and recently pregnant women with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infections.

These patients were less likely to report symptoms of fever and muscle pain than non-pregnant women with the disease, according to researchers led by Shakila Thangaratinam of the WHO Collaborating Center for Global Women's Health and the U.K.'s University of Birmingham.\n\nOlder mothers and those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and being overweight were most likely to have severe cases of Covid-19, they said.",

        "body": "Seeing disease in moral terms seems to be the American way. But scientists still have a lot of questions.\n\nThere are some weird things going on in the coronavirus data. It's curious that cases dropped so fast, and have stayed pretty low, in the spring hot zones -- New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. And why did cases remain so low in Idaho and Hawaii until recently?\n\nThe mainstream narrative is that it's all about good behavior when cases go down -- mask wearing and giving up our social lives for the greater good. And conversely, bad behavior must be what makes them go up. We talk about certain regions having the virus \"under control,\" as if falling cases are purely a matter of will-power. A sort of moral reasoning is filling in for evidence.\n\nBut why, then, have cases plummeted in Sweden, where mask wearing is a rarity?\n\nThis is the time to use scientific methods to understand what's happening. The pandemic has gone on long enough to reveal patterns in the way it spreads. If it's all about behavior, that's a testable hypothesis. If, as a few speculate, dramatic drops in some places have something to do with growing immunity in the population, we can also turn that into a testable hypothesis.\n\n\"The issue with data is one can manipulate it to show anything you want if you have an agenda,\" says YouYang Gu, an independent data scientist. Cherry picking is easy -- prediction is much harder, and Gu is getting some attention for the fact that models he's been creating since April actually forecast what's happened with the spread of the disease in the U.S.\n\nHe recently took to Twitter to urge public health officials to apply scientific thinking. He pointed to data on Louisiana, where cases were rising earlier in the summer and seemed to level off after various counties issued mask mandates.\n\nBut breaking the data down by county, he says, revealed a different story. Mask mandates varied in their timing, but places that implemented them late saw no more cases or deaths than those that did so early. \"I don't think there's currently enough evidence to support the fact that recent policy interventions (mask mandates, bar closures) were the main drivers behind the recent decrease in cases,\" he wrote.\n\nThat's not to say that individual behavior doesn't matter a lot -- and the cancellation of big gatherings and other potential super-spreading events is more important than ever -- but there may be more factors than we know driving the bigger picture.\n\nA few scientists are examining the possibility that previously hard-hit areas are now being affected by a buildup of immunity, even if it flies in the face of the widespread understanding that the disease has to run through at least 60% of the population to achieve so-called herd immunity. (So far, antibody tests show only some 10-20% of the U.S. population has had the disease.)\n\nThe term herd immunity is a little vague in this context. It was created to characterize the impact of immunization. It refers to the percentage of the population that must get immunized in order for a pathogen to die out -- a quantity that depends on the nature of the virus, the efficacy of the vaccine and the behavior of the hosts. If natural immunity is starting to help in some places, that would suggest herd immunity is a reasonable and worthy goal of an immunization program.\n\nBut scientists have little experience applying herd immunity to a natural infection, and what understanding they have is changing. Scientists have started to investigate the possibility that there's another critical factor here -- heterogeneity in the way humans interact, and in our inherent, biological susceptibility to this disease.\n\nIn a Science paper published in June, University of Stockholm mathematician Tom Britton and colleagues calculated that herd immunity might be reached after as few as 43% of a very heterogenous population becomes infected. People mix unevenly in a way that could lead to little pockets of immunity, slowing the spread of the virus long before the world achieves herd immunity.\n\nWe may also be heterogeneous in our biology. A recent paper in Science suggests that many people who've never been infected with SARS-CoV-2 carry a kind of immune cell, called a T-cell, which recognizes this novel virus and may partially mitigate an infection. These cells may be left over from infections with related viruses -- the coronaviruses that cause the common cold.\n\nWhile scientists who authored the paper warn that it doesn't imply that people with pre-existing T-cells can't get infected, they leave open the possibility that it might account for some of the vast variability in symptoms.\n\nWhatever the source of this heterogeneity, we know it exists. Most people on the contaminated cruise ship Diamond Princess remained uninfected, while others got asymptomatic infections and still others got severely ill.\n\nThose differences can inform disease models, says statistics professor Gabriela Gomes of the University of Strathclyde in Scotland. \"What we see is that infections do not occur at random, but that people who are most susceptible to infection get exposed first,\" she says, leaving a pool of ever-less susceptible people behind.\n\nSo far, her predictions of the spread in the U.K., Belgium, Spain and Portugal have aligned well with reality. Her models showed small, shallow second peaks that would concentrate away from the places where the pandemic was most rampant last spring. For example, in Spain, the first outbreak was around Madrid, and now a smaller outbreak is happening around Catalonia.\n\nShe says her models keep predicting declines after the infection reached between 10% and 35% of the population. That doesn't mean the virus has gone away -- only that by her models, it won't explode in those same places again. Gu's models, too, predict no big second waves in New York City or Stockholm, but leave open the possibility of new outbreaks in relatively unaffected areas, just as Hawaii is now fighting outbreaks and New Zealand has imposed a new, short lockdown.\n\nShe says she didn't expect to come up against resistance to her models in the scientific community. While she's starting to get some attention in the media, she said journal editors told her that her modeling ideas, in preprint, posed the danger of making people feel entitled to relax their vigilance. Maybe the opposite is true, she suggests. Maybe censoring all but the most pessimistic views could discourage action by making the problem seem endless.\n\nThe controversy mirrors one that took place a few years ago when renowned cancer researcher Bert Vogelstein dared to suggest that the very nature of cancer had a random element and therefore some people who did everything right would get cancer through bad luck. He was pilloried for the view, not because it was untrue, but because it was deemed a dangerous invitation for people to be bad.\n\nPublic health in the United States has a tendency toward moralizing against indulgences. We were told obesity was caused by indulgence in high-fat food even though the evidence pointed elsewhere, and it took years to recognize that opioid addiction is a disease and not a sin. That attitude may be ingrained in the culture, but it shouldn't get in the way of the search for the truth.",

His doctor wanted to spare him mandatory quarantine -- the shelters are mostly hellholes -- so she sent him home. Government agents learned where he was and moved him to a center in a western slum.\n\n\"I spent three days sleeping on an aluminum chair,\" he recalled, asking that his family name not be published to avoid trouble. \"They fed us cold rice, lentils and arepas. The place was controlled by armed militias and Cuban doctors.\" He was moved to a stadium in the city's south, where he's been for two weeks.\n\nVenezuela, which registered few cases in the first months of the pandemic, is now facing a spike and is embracing China's approach of forced isolation combined with other top-down measures.\n\nBut with a hollowed-out health system, far too few tests and a dysfunctional public sector, patients are terrified. They say they're crammed for weeks into filthy warehouses with little to eat, spotty water supply and increased risk of infection. This, along with the detention of dissident doctors and public shaming of violators, has led to a sense of impending disaster.\n\nPatients and their doctors are avoiding tests to stay away from state-run quarantine centers, leading to greater risks and skewed data.\n\n\"This worked in China, which has a much more robust public health system,\" said Maria Graciela Lopez, head of Venezuela's Society of Infectology. \"Venezuela was already very short on medical staff. People are afraid. Now patients arrive immediately needing intensive care because they lived with the disease at home until they just couldn't any longer.\"\n\nA number of countries, including Vietnam, Malaysia and New Zealand, have successfully used forced quarantine to reduce spikes in caseloads.\n\nLuis, a 39-year-old electrical engineer, has spent weeks in forced quarantine with nearly 30 others inside a classroom in the western city of San Cristobal after testing positive on the Colombia border. It took him 45 days to walk to Venezuela from Peru, after losing his job there.\n\n\"We sleep on old, very worn mats, it's almost like sleeping on the floor,\" Luis said through calls and text messages. The arepas are so small they call them \"botones,\" or buttons, he said.\n\n\"Today I gave mine to a child,\" Luis said. \"They are always hungry.\"\n\nPresident Nicolas Maduro, under punishing U.S. sanctions, has made a point of announcing that Venezuela is following the model of one of its allies, China.\n\n\"Venezuela has paid attention to every single step and learned big lessons from China,\" Maduro said in April after a phone call with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping. \"It has inspired our decisions in how to face this pandemic.\"\n\nA group of Chinese doctors visited 10 days before to offer guidance. Venezuela quickly converted elementary schools, public gyms, library halls, police headquarters, motels and concert stadiums into quarantine centers.\n\nBut things haven't gone well. Quick tests often give false positives so healthy people are mixed in with the sick. Ailing adults and children have gone hungry. Few tests are taken and the results rarely come in on time, if at all.\n\n\"The conditions at these centers suggest there's violations of basic human rights and protections,\" said Kathleen Page, professor at the Johns Hopkins University Division of Infectious Diseases. \"This feels punitive and will certainly be a disincentive to testing. More transmission will occur in the community as people who don't get diagnosed with Covid are not likely to self-isolate.\"\n\nVenezuela's health ministry and vice-presidency, which oversee the response to Covid-19, didn't respond to several requests for comment.\n\nThe government has also used public strong-arm tactics to send a message. It's not uncommon to see people forced to sit in city squares in the sun or gathering trash or doing push-ups under the watch of soldiers. They have all been accused of violating mask or quarantine rules. In the eastern state of Bolivar, there is a so-called Coronabus where violators ride around and listen to police lectures on rule following.\n\nFearful of mandatory isolation, some Venezuelans with symptoms are turning to a black market to avoid any state involvement. A private physician in Caracas, who asked not to be identified for fear of reprisals, said he charges patients $30 for rapid tests he bought privately.\n\nIt's been more than a month since Venezuela received 40,000 molecular tests--the most reliable -- from Turkey. About 800,000 quick tests came from China a week earlier. Last week, on a short visit to Caracas, Turkey's Minister of Foreign Affairs Mevlut Cavusoglu said he brought \"a symbolic number of rapid tests.\" None others have been reported.\n\nAnayel Miquilena, a 31-year-old surgeon in Zulia state near the Colombian border, spent 36 days in forced isolation after being exposed to the virus at the hospital. Some days, she says, she wasn't fed until 6:30 p.m. and she lost eleven pounds. Constant power outages meant suffering in the sweltering heat.\n\nAfter she was discharged, her sister who lived next door tested positive.\n\n\"It was horrifying. I begged the infectologist not to take her,\" Miquilena said. \"They didn't at the end. I think they forgot about her.\"\n\nSome medical professionals have been even less fortunate. Dr. Jaime Lorenzo, director of the nonprofit group Medicos Unidos, said at a press conference last week that the government has detained in recent months 13 members of the profession. One remains in prison.",

The trials will involve 1,300 high-risk patients from across the globe and focus on preventing hospitalization for people with early or mild coronavirus symptoms, with initial results possible before year-end.\n\nGlaxo and Vir are among a number of drugmakers seeking to fight, or even prevent, Covid-19 with monoclonal antibodies, which aim to mimic the body's natural immune response. Such treatments could provide a short-term solution before a vaccine becomes available, and may also be necessary for older or more vulnerable people who don't respond as well to a shot.\n\nAstraZeneca Plc also said last week it had started human trials for a combination of two antibodies, while early data from a pair of antibodies being tested by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. are due in September. Eli Lilly & Co. started final-stage trials for its drug in U.S. nursing homes this month.\n\nA successful treatment could bypass the need for the body to produce its own antibodies, which is especially important in the absence of an effective vaccine, said Hal Barron, Glaxo's head of research. The companies are also planning further studies looking at preventing infection and treating more seriously ill hospitalized patients.\n\n\"A vaccine is incredibly important for the impact it can have at scale,\" Barron said in an interview. \"But we do believe this monoclonal antibody in particular is unique and that the class in general will potentially play a very important role in this pandemic.\"\n\nGlaxo and Vir, which signed a $250 million Covid-19 pact in April, are also looking at potential vaccines for the disease, as well as treatments and shots for other coronaviruses. A mid-stage trial for a second antibody treatment that could also act as a prophylactic T cell vaccine is due to start later this year.\n\n\"The need for these antibodies is likely to be so large that no one company will be able to provide it all,\" George Scangos, Vir's chief executive officer, said in an interview.",

But they're spiking in places like Iowa and South Dakota, signaling what may be a new phase in the country's virus fight as progress in one state is repeatedly offset by infections in others, with little improvement overall.\n\nPolitics plays a role, as do events like college reopenings and the Sturgis motorcycle rally. But it's also a sign of fatigue, the frustration and exhaustion Americans feel after months of masks and hand sanitizer, social isolation, shuttered businesses and closed beaches. People are putting their guard down, experts agree, leaving room for the virus to continue spreading as the country seeks to reopen the economy.\n\n\"It's going to be kind of this rolling fire, with certain flare-ups that occur in different parts of the country at different times,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. \"This is a virus that's established itself into the population.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Anthony Fauci, the U.S.'s top infectious disease expert, urged that infected college students be kept on campus, as sending them back home would help spread the virus over the holiday.\n\nOverall, U.S. cases this week surpassed 6 million. In the Midwest, positivity rates have reached alarming levels.\n\nIn Iowa, for instance, 10.3% of Covid-19 tests came back positive on Monday, slightly below the 14-day average of 11.1%, according to state data. Overall, the state, which currently has no state-wide mask mandate, has recorded 65,478 cases, with new cases rising 50% in the last two weeks.\n\nIowa State University, in Ames, reported Monday that 28.8% of the students, faculty and staff tested in the most recent week had the virus, although school officials have focused their testing on people showing symptoms or those who have been exposed to someone with the virus. The University of Iowa has reported 922 cases within its campus population.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds, a Republican, acknowledged the jump in cases at a news conference Wednesday.\n\n\"For weeks my team has been working on developing a testing strategy with Iowa's colleges and universities to ensure that they have the testing resources and support that they need to manage the health of their students, staff and communities this academic year,\" Reynolds said.\n\nWhile many of the new cases are among younger people, Reynolds said it's important to keep elderly residents safe and prevent community spread, adding that aiding long-term care facilities \"has been a priority since day one.\"\n\nIn Ohio, Covid-19 first started as an urban scourge in the cities of Cleveland and Columbus. But the spread is now making waves in rural regions spurred by social gatherings and the return to school, Ohio Governor Mike DeWine said Tuesday during a news conference in Cedarville.\n\n\"The virus is not going away,\" DeWine, a Republican, said. \"We think a significant part of this is caused by our colleges going back as well as our grade schools going back.\"\n\nColleges experiencing outbreaks didn't necessarily reopen too soon, according to Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The problem, he said in an interview Tuesday, was that the schools did not have \"the capability of dealing with students who got infected.\"\n\nSchools should have tested students before they returned and planned \"intermittent surveillance\" to watch for rising cases, as well as creating a way to isolate students when they \"inevitably\" get infected, he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ohio reported 1,453 cases -- the most in more than a month -- and the state isn't seeing signs of the virus relenting. Despite mask mandates, a rule closing bars at 10 p.m., and myriad other health orders, the state's 21-day average of new cases sits around 1,000.\n\nPer-capita, nine of the top-10 counties for increasing cases are rural, DeWine said. A car-pool trip to a lake led to two businesses closing from an outbreak. A card-game resulted in all family members present contracting the virus, he said.\n\nSocial gatherings like this are creating \"a real movement into our rural areas,\" DeWine said.\n\nIllinois, too, has seen a resurgence of the virus over the last two months, reversing the progress that had lowered counts in May and June. On Aug. 22, statewide daily cases hit the highest since May, and on Tuesday the death count reached the most since June 26.\n\n\"We do not want to be part, here in Chicago, of this surge that we're seeing broadly across the Midwest,\" Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said Tuesday.\n\nShe noted Iowa, which ranks first in cases per capita, is among the states on the city's quarantine list and Indiana may be added next week given clusters developing in college towns. In Indiana, the counties in which the University of Notre Dame and Ball State University are located are contributing to a surge in virus cases, according to public health authorities.\n\n\"It is not the time to relax your guard,\" she said.\n\nBut that seems to be happening in Chicago and across Illinois with more cases developing when people at weddings, reunions and other gatherings don't wear masks, watch their distance or wash hands feequently.\n\nOutbreaks are going to continue to crop up because many states still don't have the ability to do widespread testing, tracing and isolating, Johns Hopkins's Adalja said.\n\n\"Until they have that capacity, they're going to always run the risk of these chains of transmission getting started,\" he said. \"Until we get to the point of being able to do the simple public-health measures in all 50 states, we're going to have this risk occurring and I do think we will periodically have these flares that occur in different states at different times.\"\n\nEven within states, public health officials have struggled to make consistent progress across all of their cities and counties.\n\nCalifornia, for instance, managed to stifle outbreaks in the urban San Francisco and Los Angeles areas only to see cases spike in the rural Central Valley.\n\nMark Ghaly, secretary of the state Health and Human Services agency, said the outbreak appeared to have been driven in part by the valley's big farms, which employ large numbers of migrant workers. Those workers, mostly Spanish speakers, weren't hearing the state's messages about wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, Ghaly said.\n\nWhile California is now pouring resources into tamping down the valley outbreak, Ghaly said more may follow, even as the state's overall virus numbers improve. The number of Californians hospitalized with Covid-19 has now dropped below 4,000, after peaking above 7,000 in July.\n\n\"We are continuing to learn how to address this broad geography,\" Ghaly said. \"I'm sure we'll have some counties that experience increased transmission in the months to come. We feel we're better prepared than we were in the summer and certainly in the spring.\"",

        "body": "Download rates and privacy have limited digital tracing so far\n\nAt the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, contact tracing was considered the best hope for getting people back to offices and schools safely without a vaccine. The tech industry was optimistic that apps would provide a faster, more effective alternative to the usual painstaking human process of calling and interviewing the networks of infected people to figure out possible sources of exposure.\n\nIt hasn't worked out that way. All efforts in the U.S. are so nascent that Citizen, known for location-based crime alerts, on Thursday launched a feature called SafePass that it's already calling the largest private contact-tracing network, with only 700,000 people testing its product.\n\nThe app allows users to upload their health status every day, then updates them on how many people they have walked past who are also using the product. If someone in the network is infected, that person will be immediately notified, as will the other SafePass users their phone pinged. SafePass will provide a map and time of the possible infection, and ask users if they think they were exposed. If so, Citizen will send them an at-home Covid-19 test for no charge.\n\nOn Citizen, users can also create a list of friends whose names and health status they will be able to see whenever they want, to help decide whether it's safe to hang out.\n\n\"We are basically building a Covid social network right now,\" Andrew Frame, Citizen's chief executive officer, said in an interview. He imagines people will ask their contacts to use the app for a few days before attempting a vacation or event together. \"Everyone in the world wants to see their friends and they want to ask them, 'Have you been tested? What are your symptoms? Have you been safe?' All those questions can be answered by SafePass,\" he said.\n\nContact tracing works best when the rate of infection in a community is small, and someone can easily pinpoint the source of their exposure. In many U.S. communities, the benefits have waned with rising numbers of Covid-19 cases. Americans who are most vulnerable to the illness live in low-income communities with high-density housing, and are the least likely to have access to their own smartphones.\n\nCitizen said it's working with the government in Stockton, California -- a city particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus -- and will be aiming for more partnerships with municipalities and businesses. But so far, in the U.S. and other countries, voluntary apps haven't seen enough adoption to become effective.\n\nAlphabet Inc.'s Google and Apple Inc. worked together on a system allowing governments to build contract-tracing apps. The program faced a series of problems, with some countries saying privacy controls blocked them from collecting crucial data to tracking the virus' spread. By the end of July, 16 regions and countries around the world had launched an app built on top of the system, Google said. The state of Virginia earlier this month launched the first app in the U.S. based on the Google-Apple system.\n\nPrivacy could be a barrier for Citizen, too. The app stores its users' Bluetooth location data for 30 days, so that they can accurately notify them about possible infections. Users who get a Covid-19 test through the Safepass system will have their results automatically uploaded to all contacts. Friends on the app may find out about someone's positive result before they do. That's by design, because stopping the spread is a matter of urgency, Frame said.\n\n\"We've had almost no requests for the ability to hide their positive status,\" he said. \"There's no shame whatsoever in getting Covid, and a lot of people are getting Covid. It's not their fault. This thing is sweeping through America.\"",

Hansson, the general-secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, wrote in an opinion piece with economics professor Lars Calmfors.\n\nThey argue a \"a proper reboot\" of the contagion strategy is needed using measures that the Swedish health authorities have so far been skeptical of, including face masks in public spaces and putting travelers from high-risk areas in quarantine even if they show no symptoms.\n\nFor now at least state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell remains committed to his country's policy of sustainable restrictions, which continue to draw scrutiny as countries around the world again impose lockdowns amid new waves of infections.\n\nBut the architect of the Swedish response has admitted a need for more testing and quicker tracing, something his critics are also pushing for.\n\n\"When we go sort of into the second phase, the rapid finding of what could be a potential cluster is going to be crucial,\" Tegnell said in an interview with The Local.\n\nEven though the number of deaths in Sweden has dropped to an average of about two per day from a peak of almost 100 in mid-April, health experts fear what may happen when vacationers return to work and schools reopen, especially after an uptick of infections among people in their twenties.\n\n\"There are some warning signs that we may be heading in the wrong direction, especially when it comes to the rather large increase we are seeing among young adults,\" Tegnell told reporters in Stockholm earlier this week.",

        "body": "Stigma and fear led some to avoid tests and quarantine Experts say India could have 3 million cases by August end\n\nAs India passes the grim milestone of two million virus cases and new hotspots emerge in villages, experts are worried infections will now rise exponentially in the world's second-most populous country, overwhelming its under-prepared hinterland.\n\nIn the remote Valad village in the southern state of Kerala, 236 people have been found positive in the last two weeks. In Katapali village in eastern Odisha, nearly 200 people were infected and the area locked down for almost 50 days before the outbreak was controlled.\n\nIt's still early days for Katapali, where hundreds more risk becoming infected. Many villagers who were mostly asymptomatic were afraid to be tested over concerns they'd be forced to leave their families to be quarantined in the local Covid-19 care center. Living in a strictly-policed containment zone for more than six weeks meant their fields were neglected and many could not venture out to find work. Although restrictions have lifted in most areas, money remains tight.\n\nAuthorities struggled to check the spread of virus in the village, with its over crowed houses in narrow lanes, said Jyoti Ranjan Pradhan, the main administrative officer of the Bargarh district, where the village is located. \"This village has the characteristics of an urban slum,\" Pradhan said, where it is a challenge to provide support to citizens.\n\nThe disease is now widespread outside metropolitan areas, said Bhramar Mukherjee, professor at the School of Public Health, University of Michigan. \"We need commitment and collective sacrifice from people of rural India to keep contact diaries, symptom diaries, and to not feel stigmatized if they test positive or have symptoms, so that the disease does not infest villages like an enemy in the dark.\"\n\nEmerging rural hotspots, where health care infrastructure is fragile and living conditions are already difficult, pose a challenge to the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as it attempts to rein in infections and kickstart the country's ailing economy.\n\nThe epidemic in India is now one of the world's fastest growing, with more than 50,000 new cases added each day. It trails only the U.S. and Brazil in the total number of confirmed infections.\n\nThe virus has spread to about 711 of 739 districts, including 100 of the country's poorest rural areas.\n\n\"Even if people need hospitalization, they are unlikely to be able to reach a Covid facility in time,\" said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy, which has offices in Washington and New Delhi. \"It is going to be a tough few months ahead but there is effectively no brake on the virus and I don't expect a decline for quite some time.\"\n\nSeveral districts in nine major states -- Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Odisha and Gujarat -- all of which have sizable rural populations, are highly vulnerable to new infections, according to a Lancet study. And this vulnerability extends beyond infections to their socio-economic conditions and the ability of the local health system to handle the challenge of surging infections.\n\n\"Under testing may be an even more serious problem in rural areas due to lack of sufficient testing infrastructure,\" said Rijo M. John, a Kerala-based economist and public health policy analyst who consults for the World Health Organization. \"The increasing presence of undetected cases can potentially lead to super spreader events which, in turn, can have devastating consequences.\" He expects India to report as many as three million infections by the end of the month.\n\nMukherjee also believes the worst is yet to come.\n\n\"This is a long and painful crisis till we have a vaccine,\" said Mukherjee. \"I know we are all tired but we cannot surrender.\"",

Vulnerable nursing home residents, anyone on a college campus, bus drivers and factory workers. Ubiquitous testing, the argument goes, can detect the virus's silent spread and allow carriers to isolate before they pass it on.\n\nBut we don't have enough supply to test everyone all the time. So health officials, doctors, employers and schools must decide how to allocate the tests we do have. Those decisions must balance the public health need for surveillance - picking up unknown, invisible infections - with diagnostic tests needed to tell whether a sick person's illness is Covid or not.\n\nRight now, the decisions often seem more random than based on clear evidence for when a test is warranted. Some nursing home residents are tested weekly, a vigilant surveillance regime. But because of bottlenecks at labs, they sometimes don't have the results back before it's time to take a new test. Some college campuses are testing students weekly, while others select a sample group or test those who show symptoms.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention escalated the confusion last week when it changed a guideline on its website to suggest that people who have close contact with someone who tested positive for Covid-19 may not need to get tested themselves. The move was widely panned as political and denounced by doctors and infectious-disease experts.\n\nA new, low-cost test from Abbott Laboratories is set to boost the supply this fall, which could ease the trade-off between surveillance and diagnostic testing. But until the virus in the U.S. is tamed to much lower levels, or testing capacity exponentially increases, the question of who, when and how often to test won't be easy to answer. -John Tozzi\n\nIts strategy has been controversial. Sweden's Covid-19 death rate is considerably higher than in many other countries. But the pace of new infections and deaths has slowed markedly since June.

Britain had one of the longest lockdowns in the region as the government struggled to control the pandemic. Figures released by the ONS Tuesday showed deaths in the week ended August 7 fell 21% to 152 compared with a week earlier.\n\nThere is evidence that the disease has disproportionately affected individuals from ethnic minorities and those in one-person households, the ONS said in a separate report.",

        "body": "A proposed new rule would allow poultry plants to process diseased chickens. That's the last thing Americans need.\n\nHere's one unexpected consequence of the Defense Production Act: Your food is less safe.\n\nWhen President Trump invoked the act three months ago, as a means to bolster American food security, it marked the beginning of a campaign to deregulate the meat industry.\n\nRecall that the president first pressured meat-processing plants to remain open after many had become Covid-19 hotbeds. Since then, federal agencies have suspended meatpacking worker protections, lowered plant inspection standards, eased labeling rules for manufacturers and relaxed enforcement of pollution restrictions for chicken and pig farms.\n\nThe president has justified the rollbacks by claiming they'll prevent dangerous meat shortages during the pandemic. But the argument is flawed. Meat exports have been surging in the U.S. over the past few months. Poultry demand has declined slightly in the U.S., yet sales to China have been higher than ever. The most likely outcome of this deregulation is to further imperil, rather than strengthen, the security of our food supply.\n\nConsider the decision last month by the agriculture department's Food Safety and Inspection Service to allow poultry plants to process diseased chickens for human consumption.\n\nIn July the FSIS approved a petition from the National Chicken Council requesting that slaughterhouses be allowed to process broilers infected with Avian Leukosis -- a virus that causes chickens to develop cancerous lesions and tumors. Inspectors would no longer be required to examine the first 300 birds of each flock for signs of the disease, and processors would be able to cut off tumors and lesions and then process the rest of the bird. The approval has led to a proposed rule change that is now before the food safety administrator Paul Kiecker.\n\nHere's what we know about Avian Leukosis: A small percentage of birds (less than 1%) are diagnosed with the virus each year, but it spreads quickly through flocks and tens of thousands of chickens are condemned annually due to exposure. While it's unlikely that the virus could transfer from chickens to humans, it's not impossible. There is some evidence that workers exposed to birds infected with the disease in the U.K. have developed antibodies, indicating a transfer of the virus from animal to human.\n\nParthapratim Basu, who served as the Chief Public Health Veterinarian for the FSIS from 2016 to 2018, explained that Avian Leukosis is caused by a retrovirus and can become a systemic disease that passes through the blood, at which point cutting out tumors would fail to eliminate the virus. \"We have always had a motto in food safety: If it's systemic, condemn it,\" said Basu.\n\nWhile the FSIS did not grant me an interview, Tom Super, the NCC communications director, offered the following statement by email: \"As a taxpayer and a consumer of chicken, I would much rather have the government focus their efforts on things that might actually make someone sick and have a real impact on public health, rather than looking for lesions, bumps and bruises that are easily trimmable.\"\n\nBut the timing of a rule change seems absurd. \"We are dealing right now with a pandemic that transferred into humans from an animal source,\" Basu added. \"Sooner or later it will mutate,\" he said of Avian Leukosis. \"A poorly regulated meat industry could very well become the source of a new epidemic.\"\n\nThe CDC reports that \"more than six out of every 10 known infectious diseases in people can be spread from animals, and 3 out of every 4 new or emerging infectious diseases in people come from animals.\"\n\nOther efforts to deregulate the chicken industry are similarly worrisome. The USDA is considering another proposed rule change requested by the NCC, which would allow all U.S. poultry factories to increase line speed rates from processing 140 to 175 birds per minute. (As Basu pointed out, it's hard enough for line workers to detect symptoms of Avian Leukosis at current line speed rates -- nearly three birds per second in many plants.)\n\nThe agency has already allowed dozens of poultry processors to increase processing line speeds to this rate, prompting America's largest meatpacking union to sue over unsafe working conditions and legislators to introduce bills 1 to prevent faster production line speeds.\n\n\"To speed up lines, when during a pandemic they should be slowing them down, is unconscionable,\" said Tony Corbo, a senior lobbyist for the group, Food and Water Watch, who helped write the bills. \"In my 20 years working on food safety law I have never seen anything like this.\"\n\nThe solution to this latest food-safety imbroglio is clear: Kiecker should reject these proposed rule changes. Whatever Big Chicken would gain by being able to process more chickens per minute, as well as diseased chickens, does not outweigh the possible threats to public health.\n\nIf the Trump administration was really concerned about food security, they'd recognize that the chicken sandwich has been one of the most popular food items during the pandemic. Messing with the recipe would be the wrong move.",

Better treatment of the disease and improved procedures for identifying Covid-related deaths also help lower the death toll, Ford said.\n\nWith European countries gradually re-opening their economies, including greenlighting travel in mid-June, officials have been bracing for a surge as more people come into contact again. But after economies were decimated from lockdowns, they're loath to revive stringent restrictions on activity.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, who won plaudits for her handling of the initial phases of the pandemic, advised her peers to avoid renewed lockdowns and coordinate actions. The focus instead is on targeted measures such as stepping up the use of face masks, restricting operations of bars and restaurants and requiring travelers returning from hard-hit areas to quarantine or prove they're not infected.\n\nRead more: Merkel Warns Europe Against Reviving New Virus Lockdowns\n\nSpeedy drug trials could be partly responsible for the death toll remaining in check, with therapeutics like the low-cost, anti-inflammatory dexamethasone found to reduce the mortality of severely ill Covid-19 patients.\n\nA number of countries have also changed how deaths are calculated in recent weeks. The U.K. toll fell by more than 5,000 earlier this month after the government said a fatality would only be classed as Covid-related if the person died within 28 days of a positive test.\n\nSince infections in most European countries began climbing only days or a few weeks ago, deaths could rise again too. Given the lag between infection and death, it's important countries don't develop a false sense of security, said Graham Cooke, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London.\n\n\"There's always a significant delay between a spike in cases and a spike in deaths, which is in the region of weeks,\" said Cooke. \"It's possible that if more of the transmission early on is between younger groups that there will be more of a delay before we see the rise in mortality.\"",

Still, about 70% of children at risk of infection had symptoms that didn't get picked up, researchers said Friday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics. In fact, 93% of pediatric cases would have been missed if doctors had focused on testing symptomatic patients alone, they said.\n\nThe findings indicate that there's \"no other good alternative\" to extensive testing for early detection of Covid-19 cases, Jong-Hyun Kim of the Catholic University of Korea, Eun Hwa Choi of the Seoul National University College of Medicine and colleagues reported. That may be difficult in the U.S. -- where schools and colleges are reopening -- after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shifted its guidance this week away from testing asymptomatic individuals.\n\n\"A surveillance strategy that tests only symptomatic children will fail to identify children who are silently shedding virus while moving about their community and schools,\" Roberta DeBiasi and Meghan Delaney at Washington's Children's National Hospital, wrote in an accompanying editorial. In regions where face masks aren't widely accepted or used by the general public, asymptomatic carriers may serve as an \"important reservoir\" that allows the virus to spread, they said.\n\nStill, new 15-minute tests from Abbott Laboratories that cost $5 each may encourage more widespread monitoring of students and other populations. The U.S. is spending about $750 million to purchase 150 million of the diagnostics, almost all that the company will produce this year.\n\nThe researchers tested and tracked 91 children under 19 years of age who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection and were hospitalized or isolated across 22 centers in South Korea in February and March. Among those with upper respiratory tract infections, the coronavirus was detected for an average of 18.7 days. Those with a lower respiratory tract infection were positive for an average of 19.9 days.\n\nEven among asymptomatic children, virus was detectable for a mean of 14.1 days, which the researchers called \"alarming.\"\n\nThe scientists weren't able to tell whether a positive test indicated the presence of infectious virus or non-contagious viral \"debris.\" The former would indicate \"the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in children and its effect on the community might be greater than expected,\" they said.\n\nAs School Looms, What We Know About Kids and Covid-19: QuickTake\n\nAmong the 91 children:\n\nA separate study from the U.K. involving 651 young people under the age of 19 confirmed that children have less severe Covid-19 than adults, and death is exceptionally rare, occurring only in children with serious underlying conditions. Black children were disproportionately severely affected, University of Liverpool researchers said in the study published Friday in the BMJ medical journal.",

        "body": "The head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration walked back his claim that an experimental therapy had provided a dramatic benefit to Covid-19 patients, a rare reversal for an agency that has prided itself on rock-solid science and public trust.\n\nOn Sunday night at a press conference with President Donald Trump, FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said that blood plasma from Covid-19 survivors given to new patients could save huge numbers of lives.\n\n\"What that means is -- and if the data continue to pan out -- 100 people who are sick with Covid-19, 35 would have been saved because of the administration of plasma,\" Hahn said. Hahn's remarks followed similar comments by Trump, who said that the therapy is \"proven to reduce mortality by 35%,\" and by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.\n\nOn Monday night, Hahn reversed himself.\n\n\"I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma. The criticism is entirely justified,\" Hahn said in a tweet. He went on CBS on Tuesday morning to continue walking back the claim, telling the network that \"I could have done a better job of explaining that at the press conference.\"\n\nHahn had spent much of Monday taking heat from health experts, including two former FDA commissioners, for his remarks.\n\n\"That was not the way that I would have worded it,\" said one of the doctors who led the blood plasma study, Arturo Casadevall, chair of the department of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health. \"I hope they will issue a clarification,\" he said earlier Monday.\n\nWhat the data do show is that a higher dose of blood plasma is better than a lower one. And while there are promising signals that it will lead to a real benefit when compared to a placebo, that's not known yet.\n\n\"Until we have a randomized controlled trial, we don't know definitively,\" Casadevall said.\n\nThe administration's misrepresentation of the data may raise fears about how Hahn and the rest of the administration will treat data on a vaccine for the virus. Trump has said he expects one to be ready in time for his potential re-election, and on Saturday accused unnamed members of the \"deep state\" at the FDA of slowing work to hurt him politically. The \"deep state\" is a term used by Trump to describe employees of government agencies that he believes are manipulating policy to work against his interests. There is no evidence this is happening at the FDA.\n\nIn another interview, with Reuters, Hahn said he had seen no evidence that anyone at hte FDA was working against Trump.\n\n\"I have not seen anything that I would consider to be 'deep state' at the FDA,\" Hahn said to Reuters.\n\nThe 35% statistic about blood plasma's effectiveness has several fatal flaws. Since everyone in the program received blood plasma, it's not known what would have happened compared with patients who didn't get the therapy. And scores of variables, like how sick the patients were and when they were treated -- that could have skewed the results.\n\nRobert Califf, the FDA commissioner under President Barack Obama, said that he thought Hahn had misspoken. \"It would be good for Steve to publish a correction,\" Califf said on Twitter earlier Monday.\n\nAzar and Hahn both have extensive experience with drugs and therapies. Azar is a former pharmaceutical executive, and Hahn has spent several decades treating patients and researching cancer. Before joining the FDA, he was the chief medical executive of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, a leading oncology treatment and research hospital.\n\nIn a tweet posted earlier Monday, Hahn said that the agency will \"reevaluate our emergency use authorization (EUA) based upon new incoming data that we receive.\"\n\nHe emphasized that the decision to allow emergency use of the therapy had been made based on science alone.\n\n\"The data we need, which is a risk-benefit assessment for an emergency use authorization, were met by the data we received,\" Hahn said in the CBS interview. But he noted that clinical trials of the therapy, which he expects will provide firmer evidence for or against its use, have had trouble attracting participants -- which can happen when patients and doctors can access a therapy through other channels.\n\n\"There's ongoing clinical trials, unfortunately they're not accruing like we'd like them to,\" Hahn said to CBS.\n\nBlood plasma from recovered patients is being used around the world, with the hope that its infection-fighting antibodies can help combat the virus. It doesn't appear to pose a major safety risk, and on Sunday the Trump administration announced an emergency FDA measure to make it more widely available. Several studies have shown promising signs of efficacy.\n\n\"Based on the data we have today, it's very likely that plasma is reducing mortality,\" Casadevall said. \"The one thing we are missing is a randomized controlled trial,\" the gold-standard test that will tell researchers and regulators if blood plasma is a breakthrough, an incremental help or something in between.\n\nTo understand the confusion over the 35% figure, it's important to look at two concepts: relative risk and absolute risk.\n\nImagine a clinical trial to test an experimental drug, with 2,000 patients split into two groups. The first 1,000 patients don't get the drug, and in that group 10 people die. The other group of 1,000 patients gets the drug, and five people in that group die.\n\nUsing relative risk, that's a 50% improvement -- a tremendous number. But using absolute risk, the imaginary drug only decreases the likelihood of death by 0.5%. That means 5 more of those 1,000 people treated with the drug would live, not the 500 implied if you mistakenly use the 50% relative risk number.\n\nThe claim of a 35% mortality benefit made by Trump, Azar and Hahn uses the first measure -- relative risk. But because clinical trials of plasma therapy haven't been completed, how many lives it actually saves -- the absolute risk improvement -- still isn't known.\n\nHahn, in his tweet Monday, said he had muddled the difference. \"What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction,\" he said.\n\nThe FDA analysis was pulled from a subset of data in the trial -- typically a no-no for credible studies. And despite a day of criticism online from doctors and researchers, Hahn's correction wasn't enough for some.\n\n\"You need to correct the 35 lives saved per 100 sick with Covid-19 so people understand that was absolutely wrong, Steve,\" Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California, said on Twitter. \"That there is no evidence to support that. That there is no evidence at this juncture to support *any* survival benefit.\"\n\nDoctors and patients rely on the FDA to put out authoritative information about the safety and efficacy of drugs, vaccines, medical devices and other products, guiding their use not just in the U.S. but around the world. The agency has historically carefully guarded its reputation and scientific independence,\n\nHahn's comments about 35 out of 100 people being saved were still posted to the FDA's official twitter account as of Monday afternoon.\n\nMiller, the FDA spokeswoman, repeated the error in a tweet after the press conference, saying \"convalescent plasma has shown to be beneficial for 35% of patients.\" While she clarified the error in a follow-up message about an hour later, the FDA's main twitter account still carries Hahn's misstatement.\n\nAlyssa Farah, a White House spokeswoman made a similarly misleading tweet, saying that the therapy cuts mortality by 30% to 50%. And Michael Caputo, Azar's chief spokesman at HHS, echoed the claim: \"If you're one of the 35 people out of a hundred who survive severe COVID symptoms because of convalescent plasma, you're damn right this is a BREAKTHROUGH.\"\n\nFarah didn't respond to emails requesting comment. Caputo deferred comment to the FDA, though his tweet with the incorrect information was still up as of Tuesday morning in New York.\n\nHahn's predecessor Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner under Trump from 2017 to 2019, said he thought the FDA was right to allow convalescent blood plasma for emergency use. But he suggested the press conference hadn't given the correct picture of what health regulators actually know from the data.\n\n\"When we overstate findings it erodes confidence in science and undermines public trust in regulatory decisions. The right message was this 'may' provide a benefit, it could be meaningful for some patients, but we need more evidence to prove it, Gottlieb said in a tweet.\n\n\"The way the public part was handled will erode precious public confidence,\" he said. \"You earn public confidence in small drops and you loose it in buckets.\"",

The U.S.-China dispute is accelerating on the tech front, there are new theories about the virus's early spread, and there's a stimulus stand-off. Here's what's moving markets.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump signed a pair of executive orders prohibiting residents from doing business with the Chinese-owned TikTok and WeChat apps beginning 45 days from now, citing the risk of leaving Americans' personal data exposed. Shares of WeChat's owner, Tencent Holdings Ltd., fell as much as 10% and the offshore yuan weakened. The move coincides with Trump's push for the sale of popular video app TikTok to an American company. Transactions subject to punishment could include purchases of ads on the apps and agreements to make TikTok or WeChat available in app stores, according to a person familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, a high-powered group of U.S. regulators said stock exchanges should set new rules that could trigger the delisting of Chinese companies, following mounting concerns that investors are being exposed to frauds.\n\nA large proportion of U.K. health-care workers may have been infected with coronavirus early in the pandemic, according to a survey. About two-thirds of the National Health Service workers surveyed reported diminished ability to taste or smell -- one of the prominent, early symptoms of Covid-19 -- just weeks after the virus arrived in the U.K., according to the Lancet. Global cases reached 19 million overnight, and a hospital in Moscow is offering staff inoculation with a vaccine developed by Gamaleya Institute and set for registration next week. Finally, Finland's government is considering whether to allow free travel with neighboring Sweden, saying the Covid-19 situation there has recently improved.\n\nNegotiations on a virus relief package for the U.S. ended Thursday night with the White House and Democrats making no headway on resolving their biggest difference, bringing the talks to the brink of collapse. It was unclear whether the two sides will resume negotiations on Friday. \"There are a lot of issues we are close to a compromise position on,\" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said after meeting for more than three hours with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. But they remain \"very, very far apart on some significant issues.\"\n\nDistilling giant Diageo Plc has started arbitration proceedings against LVMH, saying the French luxury giant failed to pay it 181 million euros ($215 million) in dividends for 2019. Diageo has owned a minority stake in LVMH's Moet Hennessy drinks business since the 1990s.\n\nStocks in Asia dropped on the U.S.-China tensions, and European stock futures are pointing slightly lower. Today's London-heavy earnings agenda includes real estate platform Rightmove Plc, broker TP ICAP Plc, and investment managers Standard Life Aberdeen Plc and Hargreaves Lansdown Plc. On the economic front, get ready for trade data from Germany and Italy after China reported a 10% rise in July exports from a year earlier. U.S. non-farm payrolls are due in the afternoon.\n\nThis is what's caught our eye over the past 24 hours.\n\nIf headlines that global shares have erased their losses for the year don't match with what you're seeing in your portfolio, then you probably don't have much exposure to U.S. technology stocks. The top five companies in the MSCI World Index -- which make up more than 14% of the benchmark -- are high-flying American tech behemoths including Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp. The MSCI World gauge excluding U.S. shares and the equal-weighted global benchmark both remain down about 8% for the year, while of the 93 primary indexes tracked by Bloomberg, just 13 are in positive territory. Of course down 8% in the midst of the biggest pandemic in more than 100 years is in itself worthy of note. The relative robustness serves to remind us once again of the uneasy disconnect between bullish signals from the stock market and bearish signs in other asset classes like bonds and gold that are more in tune with what is happening in the global economy.\n\nCormac Mullen is a cross-asset reporter and editor for Bloomberg News in Tokyo.",

    "Forced Isolation May Be the Only Way to Stop Resurgence of Virus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Controversial policy faces backlash from some populations\n\nFlare-ups from Australia to Japan show the world hasn't learned an early lesson from the coronavirus crisis: to stop the spread, those with mild or symptom-free coronavirus infections must be forced to isolate, both from their communities and family.\n\nIn Australia, where Victoria state has been reporting record deaths, some 3,000 checks last month on people who should have been isolating at home found 800 were out and about. In Japan, where the virus has roared back, people are staying home but aren't in isolation: 40% of elderly patients are getting sick from family members in the same apartments.\n\nThe failure to effectively manage contagious people with mild or no symptoms is a driving factor behind some of the world's worst resurgences. But lessons from Italy, South Korea and others that have successfully contained large-scale outbreaks show that there's a tried-and-tested approach to cutting off transmission: move them out of their homes into centralized facilities while they get over their infections, which usually doesn't require longer than a few weeks.\n\n\"A laissez-faire approach naively trusting everyone to be responsible has been shown to be ineffective, as there will always be a proportion who will breach the terms of the isolation,\" said Jeremy Lim, adjunct professor at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.\n\nFaced with a new cluster this week after 102 days without a locally transmitted case, New Zealand has quickly enacted this strategy, placing 17 people -- including two children below the age of 10 -- into centralized quarantine.\n\nBut other countries facing sustained spread like Australia and the U.S. are not broadly enacting the policy despite its proven track record. Their unwillingness -- or inability -- to do so underscores the challenges faced by liberal democracies whose populations are less likely to tolerate measures that require individual sacrifice for the greater good.\n\nThe existence of a large group of carriers who hardly feel sick is a unique feature of the coronavirus crisis, and a major factor that has driven its rapid spread across the globe. Unlike in previous outbreaks like the 2003 SARS epidemic, many infected people don't feel ill enough to stay home, and so spread the pathogen widely as they go about their daily lives.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that 40% of Covid-19 infections are asymptomatic.\n\nIn Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus first emerged last year, mildly sick patients were originally turned away from hospitals and told to rest at home, given that the overwhelmed health-care system needed to tend to the most severe cases. But health experts soon found that these people would infect their family members and others as they moved around in the community, precipitating a deluge of cases.\n\nBringing mild or asymptomatic patients to designated facilities -- re-purposed convention centers, hotels and stadiums -- for basic medical care marked a turning point in the city's fight against the coronavirus. Simply separating them from healthy people halted the pathogen's silent spread through the community.\n\nThe strategy has since been used in Italy, Singapore and South Korea at the height of their own coronavirus outbreaks earlier this year. Faced with a resurgence last month, Hong Kong converted an exhibition center to accommodate mild Covid-19 patients and is building more such facilities.\n\nIn New Zealand, the government put \"a lot of thought\" into enacting the policy, and is asking family members of confirmed cases to go into centralized quarantine with them if they require care, said director general of health Ashley Bloomfield.\n\nThe approach is effective firstly because it prevents people from infecting family members in the same household -- over 80% of cluster infections in China cities were in households after mild patients were allowed to stay home, said a Lancet study. In Europe, the surge of household infections drove Italy's Milan to start putting such cases in hotels, enabling the country to gain control over its outbreak in early May.\n\nBeyond household spread, the strategy is necessitated by a facet of human nature that's been seen time and again across countries and cultures: left to their own devices, some people just won't follow the rules.\n\nIn Australia and Japan, infected people who've been told to stay home have gone out for a variety of reasons -- some can't work from home and need the income, while others want to pick up groceries and supplies. One woman in Tokyo traveled cross country by bus after having her infection confirmed.\n\n\"It is far better to be more aggressive in the short term with even mild cases than it is to allow such cases to slip under the radar,\" said Nicholas Thomas, associate professor in health security at the City University of Hong Kong.\n\nBut forcibly moving mild or asymptomatic patients into centralized facilities has been met with backlash in some countries where citizens are not as accepting of government directives. Some people might lose their jobs if they disappear for two weeks, or have caretaking responsibilities for young children or older parents where it's unfeasible to be separated.\n\n\"People would be wondering what on earth they're doing locked up in a hospital,\" said Stephen Leeder, emeritus professor of public health and community medicine at the University of Sydney. \"From what I know about the Australian psyche, I don't think it would go down all that well.\"\n\nIn places like Venezuela and India where conditions in quarantine facilities are poor, the prospect of being taken away has caused some to avoid being tested or to lie to contact-tracers for fear of being found positive, making the work of health officials more challenging.\n\nIn an emailed response to Bloomberg News queries, the Department of Health and Human Services in Victoria said the government provides alternative accommodation for quarantine, but that these are for health workers \"who may not be able to safely live at their normal address\" and other vulnerable groups.\n\nRather than forcing isolation on mild cases, authorities have locked down 5 million residents in Melbourne and are tightening restrictions until new cases come under control.\n\nOfficials are using a combination of stepped-up checks and fines of A$4,957 ($3,550) to convince infected people to stay home, while repeat offenders risk a A$20,000 penalty in court. More than 500 military personnel are helping the police conduct checks on 4,000 households every day to ensure those who are supposed to be staying home are there.\n\nTo be sure, aggressive and thorough contact-tracing and case follow-up have successfully contained outbreaks in countries like Germany without a centralized quarantine strategy. But these places relied on an army of efficient workers hunting down every chain of transmission, a resource not many governments have had time to build up.\n\n\"The classic practice in public health is to identify, trace and quarantine,\" said Yang Gonghuan, former deputy director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. \"But how that is carried out depends on popular sentiment and the country's resources.\"",

        "body": "Europe's governments are better equipped to deal with the second wave of the pandemic, but no one can definitively rule out more general lockdowns.\n\nThe resurgence of the coronavirus in Europe has reignited fears that governments will have to lock down their economies again in the autumn. Some political leaders, including President Emmanuel Macron of France, have rushed to dismiss this possibility, saying the collateral damage from a new bout of confinement would just be too high.\n\nEurope's second wave of Covid-19 is certainly different -- and, so far, less alarming -- than the first. There is plenty that politicians and the general public can do to avoid a return to the most draconian measures of March, April and May. Localized lockdowns have been effective in particular towns or regions that suffer sudden infection spikes.\n\nHowever, it's impossible to rule out a new round of generalized isolation. A full shutdown isn't an optional policy, but a last resort against the epidemic should it spiral out of control again. As we saw in the springtime, tens of thousands of deaths and overwhelmed hospitals are not politically acceptable in most countries. We've yet to see what will happen in the colder months, when more people are forced inside and governments try to keep workplaces and schools open.\n\nAfter a quiet start to the summer, Europe is experiencing a sharp rise in cases. Spain and France have registered more than 3,000 and 4,000 new infections per day respectively, and Germany and Italy are seeing more cases too. The pressure on hospitals remains manageable, but it's slowly increasing. Public-health officials, who are generally working hard to trace the contacts of those who test positive, face an increasingly difficult job.\n\nThere's no doubt this phase of the virus is unlike the first. Many more people are being tested and the percentage of those who test positive is significantly lower. In Italy it is barely above 1%; in March it was regularly in excess of 20%. There's a much higher proportion of people with few or no symptoms. This means that the number of counted cases is much closer to the \"real\" figure than it was a few months ago. Back then, most of the testing was of people with severe symptoms, meaning the scale of contagion was inevitably much larger.\n\nMoreover, governments have designed better tools to keep the situation in check. For a start, they can seek to circumscribe the outbreak actively via contact tracing. They can also rely on more help from the public. While there's growing evidence of \"distancing fatigue,\" where people are letting their guard down by not wearing masks and ignoring guidelines on socializing, the severity of the first outbreak is still fresh in everyone's minds. Finally, doctors have got better at treating Covid-19 patients, even though there's no definitive cure yet.\n\nThis explains why Macron and others believe they can avoid another full economic lockdown. Of course, there will be sacrifices: It's unlikely that governments will permit events with large crowds, or the reopening of nightclubs. There are also fears over how students will be allowed back into schools and universities, given the potential for widespread contact and evidence that youngsters can carry a similar load of the virus as their parents. But relying on smart, localized lockdowns, as Macron aspires to do, is indeed the ideal course of action. It would help avoid the calamitous economic and psychological costs of a second generalized lockdown.\n\nHowever, politicians cannot simply wish away a strategy of confinement. Countries such as Italy, Spain and Britain had to force people to stay home because the pandemic was out of control and their health systems were overwhelmed. There were simply not enough hospital beds and intensive care units to deal with the severe cases. Prioritizing Covid patients also had a dramatic impact on the lives of those who needed treatment for other diseases, such as cancer, who often couldn't receive adequate help.\n\nIt's also difficult to avoid the financial consequences of a raging pandemic, even if you keep the economy open. As people become scared, they avoid shops, restaurants and hotels. Sweden didn't introduce a hard lockdown in the spring, but its gross domestic product contracted more in the second quarter than neighboring Nordic states that imposed harsher measures.\n\nHandling the pandemic will require a \"hammer and dance\" strategy, in which governments have to impose a strict confinement strategy (the \"hammer\") and then lift it while keeping the pandemic in check (the \"dance\"). The hope is that the enforcement of more severe restrictions can be limited to selective closures of affected regions, or certain activities. But it's foolish to rule out wider interventions; we simply don't know how the epidemic will evolve. Governments should prepare for the worst, and hope for the best.",

        "body": "After a fiasco over examinations and the economy in a mess, reopening schools is the country's biggest priority.\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has vowed to get children back to school next month, but there is a sense of dread that the country is walking into another crisis after all that has gone wrong with his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever traumatic the fiasco over exam grading for teenagers, it only involved two academic years. The start of the school year affects every child in a country that recorded more deaths than anywhere else in Europe.\n\nThe government sees reopening England's 24,000 schools as mission critical, and there's no room for error. Without parents back at work, there's scant hope of emerging from the continent's deepest economic slump.\n\nBloomberg spoke to government and union officials and education professionals across the country, many of whom asked not to be identified as they discussed their concerns. Teachers expressed their anxieties about going back to work, a sense of not being prepared for the challenge of keeping children apart, and of the effect on the mental health of families and themselves.\n\nSeveral expressed doubts about the leadership of Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, already under pressure after a U-turn on how grades were awarded to school-leavers for examinations they never sat.\n\nThen there's the issue of getting parents on board when the well of public confidence is drying up. Pupils were sent home in the chaos of mid-March, and most haven't been back since. Now Johnson wants all children back in class when the summer vacation ends at the start of September.\n\n\"We suspect that the biggest challenge will be winning confidence among some parents that it is safe for children to return to school,\" said Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders.\n\nThe British education system has been lauded by Johnson as a pillar of the country's prestige as it tries to assert its new independence after leaving the European Union. The problem now is that it's beginning to stand out for the wrong reasons. While other countries have faced the dilemma of how to get kids back into school, few governments have so much at stake to get it right.\n\nThe Department for Education said it has set out clear guidelines on staggered starts to the school day, minimizing contact between pupils and social distancing for teachers. Scotland, whose academic year started already, implemented its own similar measures.\n\n\"Making sure all children are back in the classroom full-time in September is a national priority,\" a department spokesperson said by email in response to questions for this story.\n\nIndeed, many schools say they are ready. At St Monica's RC High School in Manchester, head teacher Chris Foley said students at will be arranged into \"bubbles\" based on their year group, for both classroom teaching and socializing at break times.\n\nAt the end of each lesson, pupils will wipe down their desks, sanitize their hands and follow the school's new one-way system to their next class. \"The school is dripping in hand sanitizer,\" Foley said. \"We are taking all the precautions we can.\"\n\n\"Everyone who is a teacher wants to get back to teaching,\" he added. \"The environment we will create is safe, and the children need to be back in the building.\"\n\nElsewhere there is less confidence. A group of London school heads met last month to discuss how they would respond to an outbreak of coronavirus. The U.K. government guidance was clear: they had to contact their local director of public health. The problem, they realized, was that none of them knew how to reach them.\n\nSchools have also complained about apparent contradictions in the guidelines. These state that bubbles can be as big as a year group -- which in some secondary schools means 200 students. Year groups aren't supposed to mix, and neither are schools.\n\nBut many children have siblings in different years or at different schools, so one household infection is likely to affect multiple bubbles. At some schools, after-hours care will involve children from different bubbles looked after together.\n\nOne teacher said she felt the Department for Education had made the bubble system up, with no concept of how modern teaching works. It had left her with no confidence in the government's ability to put proper guidelines in place.\n\nOn government advice, students will be sent home if they have coronavirus symptoms. One primary school teacher said this will mean her monitoring her class of six-year-olds, which will be an impossible task because most children tend to experience some sort of cough or cold across winter.\n\nTeachers also raised concerns about their own health given the difficulty in maintaining a distance from pupils. The guidelines state that \"those who are clinically extremely vulnerable can return to school,\" provided that the school have the suggested controls in place. One teacher in a vulnerable category said she was eager to return to the classroom and had started therapy to keep her anxieties at bay.\n\nThe issue of teacher mental health was raised by the deputy head of one large London secondary school, who pointed to the stresses her colleagues had been under as they tried to allocate grades to pupils to simulate the cancelled exams, and then deal with the fallout. Now, she said, she knew many were worried about returning to work.\n\nStaff absence rates matter because running a school is a huge logistical exercise. Every class has to have a teacher and a room for every hour of the day. On a normal day, a large school might expect an absence rate of just under 10%. Cover has to be found for every missing teacher.\n\nIn March, as large numbers of teachers started calling in sick with the virus, there were many days when the usual teacher agencies were unable to send any emergency staff. The fear this time around is staff being instructed to stay home because they've had contact with an infected person. If a teacher can't be found for every class, the school has to consider closing.\n\nThe issue is made even more complicated by the staggered timetables, making it hard for one teacher to cover a colleague's class. Then there is the question of rooms. The government has said it wants schools to teach a full curriculum, but also that they should stay in one room as much as possible. That creates a problem for subjects such as science and art, usually taught in dedicated spaces.\n\nThere simply isn't anywhere in most schools to park children while rooms are cleaned after one class has left and before the next goes in. And with budgets tight, there isn't the cleaning staff to do the job.\n\nOn top of concerns over the new arrangements, teachers are apprehensive about what students will have missed throughout lockdown depending on their home life. The government has allocated 650 million pounds ($850 million) to help teachers fill in gaps in things children have missed while out of school.\n\nThen there's the question of whether an increase in cases will lead to another lockdown, something governments across Europe are at pains to avoid. Scotland has seen a rise in infections, including at some reopened schools, though the administration in Edinburgh said they are under control.\n\n\"We would also like to see the government provide schools with funding so that they can afford the costs of implementing the safety controls,\" said Barton at the Association of School and College Leaders. \"It is essential that it comes up with a Plan B in the event of a second national shutdown.\"",

        "body": "History shows that once the price rises above fair value, it has a tendency to keep going.\n\nTo get John Authers' newsletter delivered directly to your inbox, sign up here.\n\nAs I write, gold has surged to yet another record, topping $2,050 per ounce. Is it overpriced?\n\nThe question is impossible to answer. Gold's value rests in the eye of the beholder, and over recorded human history people have continued to find it beautiful. It pays no income, and its intrinsic value is set by the market. Valuation techniques that work for other assets won't work for gold.\n\nThe fact that we will never scientifically arrive at a \"correct\" price need not stop us from trying, however. And after going through the various valuation exercises, the rally looks rational. While the current price looks expensive, it could easily rise further.\n\nOne way to measure gold is to compare it to other commodities. Back in the 1970s, the oil-price shocks could be seen as a way for petroleum exporters to keep the value of their product constant in gold terms, once the dollar's peg to the metal had ended. On this basis, gold looks expensive. The ratio of oil to gold, or the amount of metal it would require to buy a barrel of crude, hit its lowest since the peg's end earlier this year as oil tanked. There has been a rebound since, and a further recovery for oil would help gold, but the shiny metal is plainly not cheap on this basis:\n\nAnother possibility is to look at money illusion. The gold price in dollars depends on the value of the currency as much as on the value of the metal. The dollar has weakened sharply in the last few months. But if we look at gold in euro and yen terms, there is more to this than dollar weakness. Gold hit an all-time high against both these currencies last year. It is currently at a record in all three:\n\nThen we come to the issue of inflation. Gold is seen as a store of value. This value will naturally tend to rise when people expect inflation ahead. On this basis as well, gold might initially seem overpriced. The Federal Reserve has received a lot of deserved criticism for its handling of the U.S. economy over the last two decades. But on one important measure, it has been undeniably successful -- nobody has ever thought that inflation will take off. The Fed's target is to keep inflation between 1% and 3%. Since 1998, 10-year inflation expectations derived from the bond market have never exceeded 3%, and have dipped below 1% only very briefly.\n\nInflation expectations have been rising fast following the Covid shock, which helps explain the rise in gold, but remain at a level that makes an all-time high look hard to justify:\n\nBut now we come to the most important influence on gold, which is the real yield available on bonds. Gold doesn't pay an income, and this becomes less and less of a problem as bonds pay less in real terms. At present, real 10-year yields are more negative than they have been since inflation-linked bonds became widely available. One crucial development of the last year is that the U.S. has joined Germany in having very negative real yields (which presages a weaker dollar, as well as higher gold prices):\n\nReal yields form the backbone of one of the most interesting models of \"fair value\" for gold, produced by City of London veteran Charles Morris, the founder of ByteTree.com. The model, described here and here, is essentially a zero-coupon 20-year Treasury inflation-protected security, or TIPS, and thus rises as long-term real yields fall. In brief summary, the factors included are:\n\nMajor factors:\n\nMinor factors:\n\nHere is how the model's \"fair value\" has compared to the actual gold price over time:\n\nThe key points are that fair value has risen sharply to reach its previous record in recent weeks, and that the actual price is significantly higher. The premium as of early trading Aug. 5 was 23.7%. This chart shows how the premium/discount to fair value has moved over time:\n\nThe point for a trader is that when gold is in a bull market, it has shown a propensity to move even further above fair value. So gold is expensive, but it is still significantly less expensive than at the previous peak in late 2011.\n\nFor those wanting to play the dangerous game of predicting a speculative surge, Morris offers another important data point. Equity bull markets tend to peak when retail investors are sucked in, a process that appears to be happening for stocks. The same was true for gold during its massive peak in real terms in 1980, when news bulletins were full of footage of people happily emerging from shops having converted their life savings to a small pile of gold sovereigns (transactions that would have taken decades to work out), and again in 2011 when the weight of gold-buying through exchange-traded funds reached a high. This rally has plainly been fueled by something other than ETF-buying:\n\nThe bullish scenario is that central banks keep doing what they're doing. squashing real yields ever lower, and continuing to raise the fair value for gold. Then inflation at last begins to come untethered and rise toward or even above its upper 3% target (which is conceivable but still some years away). And then retail buyers enter in a big way. A while after this, gold would probably go splat, but the ride to get there would be lucrative.\n\nThe risks would come in a change of central-bank behavior -- just as the last gold peak turned into a bear market once the Fed started to try to move away from its unlimited asset purchases. Such a change looks less likely this time. Gold does look expensive then, but there is little reason to expect it to fall much anytime soon.\n\nSome good news on the coronavirus. The Sun Belt's single scariest Covid-19 outbreak came in Arizona, where the state health department's website added to confusion by adopting a very conservative policy over when to add new cases and hospitalizations to its running totals. The single most useful data it offers are the number of positive or suspected Covid patients in hospital. As physicians know how to recognize Covid symptoms these days without waiting a week for test results, this is the best real-time indicator. And it is obvious that the virus is now coming under control:\n\nMeanwhile, cases are worryingly on the rise in the upper Midwest and the virus is showing signs of establishing itself in rural areas.\n\nRather than focusing on cases in the Sun Belt, I suspect we need to get used to looking at some new charts. First, and very hopefully, far fewer people are dying of Covid-19. Will this continue, or will deaths begin to rise as patients in the Sun Belt who have been hospitalized for weeks finally succumb? If deaths in Florida and Texas, two states in focus because their Republican governors made a big deal of reopening their economies, stay at current levels, it will suggest that risks are more manageable than had been thought:\n\nBeyond the U.S., developments in Europe are of growing importance. Spain and Greece, two Mediterranean countries with huge tourism industries, have had differing experiences to date. Greece largely avoided Covid-19 while Spain had one of the world's worst outbreaks. But attempts to reopen for tourism have seen daily new cases rise to a fresh high in Greece, and also increase in Spain. These are worrying developments. It begins to look as though we cannot rely on the coronavirus to stay stamped out. It also looks as though it is proving too early to reopen for tourism, so prospects for a return to other forms of travel look grim:\n\nIf lockdowns won't make the disease go away, and medicine cannot eradicate the harm done (which it cannot), then two options lie ahead to return us to normality. One is the prospect of \"herd immunity,\" where enough people have the disease and develop immunity that it can no longer spread; the other is in a vaccine.\n\nIt is possible that the Sun Belt states have unwittingly adopted a \"herd immunity\" strategy. But the most interesting test will be in Sweden, the one significant developed economy that deliberately eschewed lockdowns in favor of attempting to build herd immunity. Denmark, joined to Sweden by a bridge, provides a natural comparison. It went through a strict lockdown. Until now, this doesn't appear to have helped Sweden much economically. But it should be well positioned for herd immunity. Here are the cases per day for the two countries:\n\nEvidently, Sweden has suffered on an altogether greater scale than its neighbor. But what next? The following chart shows the ratio of Sweden's new cases per capita to Denmark's (the horizontal line marks the level of 1, where they are equal). Sweden has had more cases constantly since Denmark locked down in March; but the ratio is now down to only 1.23. Will it invert?\n\nIf it does, and Denmark has to lock down again while Sweden suffers fewer cases and is able to keep its economy humming, the great Swedish experiment in herd immunity will have proved a success. For the time being we cannot say this; but if the pickup in infections elsewhere in Europe comes to Scandinavia, we will have a very useful experiment:\n\nSo what of the vaccine? There is intense interest in the numerous different attempts to develop one. The looming issue is that it may prove impossible to get enough people to take a shot. A recent poll in Canada found that a third of Canadians would wait, and try to make sure there were no side effects. In the U.S., a Politico/Morning Consult poll found 64% of Americans saying they were prepared to wait and wanted developers to take their time. In the U.K., a poll by YouGov found about 6% of Britons would definitely not get vaccinated, while 10% would \"probably not,\" and 15% weren't sure.\n\nSuch levels of hesitancy are far too high for the pandemic to be eradicated, even if an effective vaccine with minimal side effects can be found. The notion that the hunt will have a binary outcome, with a successful vaccine meaning the end of Covid-19, is wrong. Distrust of the vaccine, of the profits that the manufacturers could make, and the speed with which they are working, is even more prevalent than the coronavirus. This isn't great cause for confidence.\n\nAfter spending some time researching that piece by reading through anti-vaccination campaigners' websites, I feel the need to return to the simpler, structured and courteous world of Jane Austen. If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice yet, you really should. If you haven't seen the 1995 BBC adaptation with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth as Lizzie Bennett and Mr Darcy, you've missed the best televised costume drama yet made. It's on BritBox.\n\nThere's no shortage of modern adaptations. Bridget Jones' Diary is a great start (featuring Firth as a character called Darcy). Or, streaming on BritBox, you can find the wonderful Lost in Austen, about a modern young woman from Hammersmith in West London, who somehow gets caught in a time warp and switches places with Miss Bennett. The late great P.D. James even turned Pride and Prejudice into a whodunnit. It's great to escape into a world with no social media.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "In March, Ellen Ross's business came to a standstill. Ross is a psychotherapist, accustomed to sitting across from patients, helping them deal with their deepest traumas and fears. When the pandemic started shutting the economy down, Ross shut her San Jose office, too. She nixed plans to hire another therapist and began adjusting to video therapy, which meant, among other things, building breaks in between sessions.\n\n\"I can't look at a screen as long as I can interact with human beings,\" says Ross, who spent years counseling in hospitals before setting up her own practice in 2017. And then there was the Google problem. In the beforetimes, Ross spent about $20 a day on search ads to promote her practice. That worked well enough. People would search for things like \"therapist near me\" and she would bid for those terms at Google's silent auction. If she won the auction, ads for her practice, True North Psychology, would appear at the top of search results. Google charged for each click. In 2019, she spent about $5,500.\n\nStarting in April, Ross's calculus changed. Americans were stuck at home, some juggling home-schooling and work, others newly jobless. They were anxious and searched the web for help, sometimes looking for video counseling. Ross noticed that the prices for her regular keywords jumped sharply. She was still finding patients, though they often arrived after trying one of the proliferating virtual therapy startups, such as BetterHelp and Talkspace, and it was becoming prohibitively expensive to buy the Google ads to attract them.\n\nRoss wasn't sure what to do. Google, as she well knew, has a near monopoly in web search -- it has 87% of the U.S. market by some estimates. Its next-largest competitor, Bing, has about 7%. So Ross knew she couldn't simply stop buying Google ads. If she did, she'd lose out on any new business. But continuing to pay so much didn't seem sustainable either. \"I'm a fairly good psychologist,\" she says. \"I'm a terrible marketer.\"\n\nRoss is one of millions of small-business owners whose reliance on Google has only grown during the pandemic, when the internet has become the main avenue of commercial life. That dependence is at the heart of the most high-profile antitrust showdown since Uncle Sam went after Microsoft Corp. in the 1990s. The U.S. Justice Department and almost every state attorney general are preparing antitrust cases that are expected to allege that Google's dominance is illegal. \"High prices in and of itself isn't an antitrust violation, neither is being big,\" says Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School. \"The bigger question is whether Google is abusing its power.\"\n\nGoogle got a preview of the government's likely argument on July 29 during a five-hour congressional antitrust hearing. It opened with questions about Google's stranglehold on search and included lawmakers calling four tech chief executives \"cyber barons\" and unregulated bullies.\n\nSundar Pichai, Google's well-dressed and reserved chief executive officer, began by ticking off family-owned U.S. companies that have benefited from Google ads and services. \"Nearly one-third of small-business owners said that, without digital tools, they would have had to close all or part of their business during Covid,\" he said via video feed from Google's headquarters. The company gave out $340 million in ad credits to small companies as part of its pandemic response. In his testimony, Pichai also asserted that the company operates in competitive global markets. The point was reinforced the following day, when Google announced that its ad intake fell for the first time ever because of the crisis. The company still finished the spring quarter with $121 billion in cash on hand.\n\nWhen it comes to advertising, Google likes to broadly define the market it competes in to include even television. And it likes to point to its fierce rivalry with Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. But for therapists, lawyers, and anyone offering a service, this argument is bogus. People peruse Facebook for the latest news or baby photo, not for psychological care. No one goes to Amazon to buy a therapy session. Other search engines are afterthoughts. Ian Palombo, a therapist in Denver, bought Bing ads right after the pandemic hit, but it was such a throwaway proposition, he didn't even check to see how they did. \"I mean, it's Bing, right?\" he says.\n\nTherapists talk about Google like they would about any utility. It's just another check, only this one goes to the fourth-biggest company in the world and comes with no guarantees. \"It's a lot like a poker table at the casino,\" says Daniel Wendler, founder of Marketing for Therapists. \"Anyone can play, but unless you know what you're doing, you're likely to get rolled.\"\n\nThe last time the global economy cratered, in 2009, Google released its first \"Economic Impact\" report. Regulators and other critics were questioning its sway over web publishers, whether the search engine was too big and powerful. Peppered with glossy, smiling photos of mom and pop business owners in each state, Google's report showed that, far from consolidating economic power, the company was helping the little guys. A bookstore in Mishawaka, Ind., a lighting supplier in Kennebunk, Maine, a remodeling service in Aberdeen, S.D. -- each had grown, Google said, thanks to Google ads.\n\nSelling therapy, though, isn't as straightforward as selling a book or a light fixture. It can be expensive and, for some, still comes with a stigma. \"There is just a really significant human need that a lot of us struggle with,\" says Wendler, who's been helping therapists buy Google ads for the past five years. At 32, with his rectangular glasses and untidy facial scruff, he could pass for an engineer at the Googleplex. He also has Asperger's syndrome and wrote a guidebook, Improve Your Social Skills, full of tips for others with it.\n\nThose interests prompted Wendler to pursue a career as a counselor. While in grad school, he set up a marketing practice for therapists and now handles the budgets for roughly 20 of them a month. He wrote another book, Clicking With Clients: Online Marketing for Private Practice Therapists. In the first months of the pandemic, he saw the prices of keywords related to therapy jump as much as 50%, with some terms that had once cost $7 or $8 fetching $10 a click. Prices went higher as searches and buyers piled on. \"There's only so much inventory,\" he says, referring to the slots available for search page ads. \"That is driving prices up, up, up, up.\"\n\nPrices are a problem. But even more frustrating for Wendler and other search buyers are the tweaks Google has made in recent years as it pushes to automate wherever it can. Today there are two basic ways to buy search ads. A business owner can pick out search terms manually or take the approach Google prefers: Hand over a budget, select an industry, and let Google's software figure out which ads will get the most clicks. In Google-ese, this is known as Smart campaigns. The idea is to make search-ad buying as simple as possible, while Google uses what it promises is the latest and greatest in machine intelligence to maximize profits for itself and its customers. \"Our advertising tools are designed to help small businesses compete on a level playing field with large businesses, even Fortune 500 companies,\" says a Google spokesman. \"Local businesses, even those without marketing expertise, can create compelling ads in minutes that reach the right audiences.\"\n\nBut automation doesn't work terribly well for therapists. Many are specialists, focusing on, say, couples counseling or trauma -- distinctions that Google's software doesn't necessarily make. As a result, some therapists who use the automated approach end up entering auctions for broader keywords where the clicks don't lead anywhere. For one of Wendler's clients, Google's system once suggested \"PTSD,\" a search many people make for idle research rather than to find an expensive counselor. Another client wasted a tenth of his $2,000 monthly Google ads budget this way before Wendler caught the problem. In another feature, Google even automatically writes ad copy. \"If you're selling a widget or something, maybe that works for you,\" Wendler says. People are less thrilled with psychologists who sound like they've been programmed.\n\nThat hasn't stopped Google from pushing therapists to adopt Smart campaigns. Wendler recalls Saturday calls from Google representatives asking him to turn on automated ads for his clients. He politely declines and asks them not to call again. They wait three months and call again. \"Google is essentially competing with itself,\" he says. \"I think Google's ultimate goal is that you give them your credit card and that's the only thing you do.\"\n\nThe control such companies as Google exert over their markets is one key reason lawmakers are trying to check Big Tech's monopoly power. Consider Amazon's \"subscribe & save\" feature, which lets shoppers place a standing order for Raisin Bran or toilet paper. It's convenient -- and it reduces the incentive to try competitors. \"It locks you in,\" says Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. The same could be said of Google's Smart campaigns.\n\nBut Wendler and other search marketers say Google's drive to automate has dovetailed with a reduction in the quality of customer support. For years a search-ad buyer could call a Google help line and get someone on the phone. Starting about two years ago, Google began outsourcing these services, and, buyers say, the quality of support quickly diminished. \"It feels like you're speaking to someone who's just talking out of a binder,\" says Matt Coffman, founder of Therapy Practice Accelerator, a health-care marketing firm.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Coffman says, he hasn't been able to get a human on the phone at all; Google moved its customer support to chatbots. The Google spokesman says the company \"scaled back\" support services because of Covid-19.\n\nPractically every antitrust investigator who's looked into Google has seen a web presentation called \"Focus on the User.\" It was created in 2014 by Yelp and TripAdvisor, local review sites and longtime Google critics whose central complaint was that Google was expanding its ambitions beyond mere web search in ways that hurt small companies. As rivals tell it, Google's search engine once did one thing: Spit out a list of 10 blue links. But starting in the mid-2000s, search results began to include, above the links, actual answers to questions like \"How hot is the sun?\" and \"What are the signs of heat stroke?\" Google pulled these facts from other websites, resulting in searches where consumers don't bother clicking on any links. Yelp and others argue this represents a theft of their intellectual property, siphoning off their web traffic.\n\nGradually this extended to phrases like \"Where is the best Sichuan food in London?\" with the top results from Google Maps. After Maps, Google did the same with its own services in travel, hotel booking, and shopping. In each case, Google says it shows the best results for consumers. Competing businesses say this is an open-and-shut abuse of monopoly power.\n\nGoogle has done something similar with health care. At times the company has seemed intent on capitalizing on Doctor Google -- that ubiquitous modern phenomenon of self-diagnosis-by-web-search. In 2015, Google teamed up with the Mayo Clinic to begin listing symptoms and treatments directly in search results rather than showing web links. At that point, Google said 1 in 20 searches were health-related.\n\nAbout two years ago, the company hired David Feinberg, a hospital executive and former psychiatrist, to lead a new division, Google Health. Feinberg's remit is to create an electronic medical records system for hospitals that functions like Google search and to help revamp Google searches about health. His division created a special search page for anything related to Covid-19 in May and rolled out features specifically about mental health. People can now book virtual care appointments directly in Google Maps. Searches for terms such as \"anxiety disorder\" or \"PTSD\" now produce buttons linking to a clinically validated questionnaire and other resources.\n\n\"A lot of folks come to Google and ask us questions,\" Feinberg said in a May interview with YouTuber Dr. Mike Varshavski. \"You can do your own, in essence, screening for depression and anxiety. So then you can see that you're not alone.\" That he was speaking on YouTube, Google's in-house streaming service, was fitting. Those self-assessments happen directly on Google, rather than on the sites of would-be competitors such as WebMD or Zocdoc. Feinberg, through a representative, declined to comment. Google says that he doesn't control paid ads.\n\nThese Google-owned mental-health checkups on Google's own search engine compound a problem marketers have complained about for a decade -- namely, that it's very hard to attract users without paying Google for ads. If someone near Google's headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., searches for \"treat depression,\" they might see ads for One Medical, a concierge health service in which Google is itself an investor; PlushCare, a tech company that specializes in online prescriptions; and BetterHelp, a virtual counseling service. To the right, they'd see an information box where Google lists various treatment options. The so-called organic search results -- the old 10 blue links -- come below all of that. In fact, so many search results are stacked with ads that one health-care investor says his firm advises portfolio companies not to bother tweaking websites to inch higher in Google search listings. Only paid results matter.\n\nThis has propelled an entirely new kind of competitor that is, more or less, the inverse of someone like Ross: Marketers that have a sideline in therapy, such as BetterHelp and Talkspace. When Ross loses Google auctions, it's mostly to these therapy consolidators. They have hundreds of millions in venture capital and corporate backing, and use an Uberlike contract labor model, acquiring customers and sending them to a sprawling, nationwide network of counselors and coaches.\n\nRoss holds a doctorate in clinical psychology, which required six years of graduate school. She usually charges $250 an hour. BetterHelp's therapists need to be licensed counselors, clinical social workers, or psychologists with a master's degree and at least three years' experience. The company charges from $35 to $50 a session. (Full-time therapists earn from $15 to $30 an hour.) \"I could probably make more money working at the grocery store,\" Ross says. \"They pay terribly. It's abysmal.\"\n\nAlon Matas, president of BetterHelp, says retention is high among his company's 11,000 therapists. Some therapists with thriving private practices in affluent areas can earn more than they could online, he says, but \"there are providers on the platform who make six figures annually. Definitely not 'abysmal.'\u2009\"\n\nGoogle is, in a way, a co-conspirator in turning the business of mental health into a marketing game. BetterHelp's app has been downloaded 600,000 times so far in 2020, a 41% increase from the same period a year ago, according to research firm Sensor Tower. During the first couple of months of the pandemic, new customers complaining of stress and anxiety doubled from the year before, Matas says. The app saw a similar influx of independent therapists joining its platform, many of whom had no choice but to try online care while the pandemic shuttered physical businesses. The Google spokesman says a range of companies and nonprofits have bought search ads related to mental health. He notes that the company doesn't set ad prices and that its auctions operate fairly for all advertisers.\n\nBetterHelp and others like it have another advantage: They don't have qualms about asking customers for testimonials to display on their websites or paying social media influencers to tout their networks. That helps them boost their rankings on Google, which favors businesses with reviews. Many licensed therapists consider that kind of marketing an ethical violation.\n\nOne could argue that the rise of these virtual therapy providers is a positive development, making therapy affordable and available at a time when everyone seems to need it. But that would cast BetterHelp, whose parent company brought in more than $550 million in sales last year, in the role of the scrappy challenger, and Ross, a sole proprietor, as the incumbent. David Cicilline, the Democrat representative from Rhode Island who led the antitrust hearings, challenged Pichai's contention that Google helps small businesses. \"Google just shows what's most profitable for Google,\" Cicilline said. Gary Reback, an attorney with Carr & Ferrell LLC who worked on the Microsoft antitrust case, watched that and saw a clear signal that the Justice Department should be more confident to pursue a case against Google. \"There are so many issues, and it looks like Google is on the bad side of all of them,\" he says.\n\nBy summer, Ross's practice was picking up again. A couple of patients who'd left town continue seeing her via video. New patients are coming in, stressed by the unrelenting pandemic, dissatisfied with whatever they'd been trying as relief. She's even reopened her office for those who truly need in-person care. To prepare, Ross spent hours searching for Clorox wipes before finding a reliable supply at her local liquor store. She's also improved her video backdrop, adding new wallpaper, a potted plant, and a smart-looking wooden desk and bookshelf. Since more people seem to be seeking care, she's back to paying Google about $20 a day. She says she's feeling better about her business. She's also telling her patients that she's preparing herself for two more years of pandemic dislocation.\n\nGoogle could be in for even more political hurt. It may have to pay record fines and make deep changes to its ad business. Politicians from both parties opened a probe into a data-sharing arrangement Feinberg's health division set up with hospitals. Google has waited more than nine months to close its $2.1 billion acquisition of Fitbit, which makes fitness trackers. Regulators, politicians, and critics have denounced the deal, worried about handing over a company that tracks our bodies to one that knows so much about our minds. To win approval, Google has promised that it won't use any data from Fitbit's devices for its primary business of selling ads.",

The prime minister's attempts to get people back to work have been undermined by a lack of confidence in measures to protect people from the disease and confusion over lockdown restrictions.\n\nThe investment in new technology also comes amid reports the existing coronavirus testing program is struggling to keep up with demand. Some people applying for tests have been asked to drive hundreds of miles because their local centers are overbooked.\n\nPublic Health England wrote to schools as they reopen this week to say requests for tests should be limited only to children with symptoms to avoid the system being overwhelmed.\n\nHancock acknowledged \"operational challenges\" but said the \"vast majority\" can test locally and get a result the same day or within 24 hours.\n\n\"I want to solve the problem by having the next generation of tests at a radically bigger scale, and you can't do that on the current technology very easily,\" he said.\n\nCovid-19 testing has been a contentious issue in the U.K. throughout the pandemic, after officials decided in March to conserve capacity by halting tests in the community. The government then faced issues ramping up production and was heavily criticized for falling behind countries including Germany.\n\nHancock emerged from a week in self-isolation with Covid-19 symptoms at the beginning April to pledge a huge ramping-up of the testing program, which now has capacity for about 350,000 a day.\n\nThe next challenge is how to produce a testing program with results available in about 20 minutes, which could ultimately mean people get repeat testing -- even on a weekly basis -- to break chains of transmission more quickly.\n\nThe U.K. is working with 100 different companies on developing the tests that will allow social-distancing rules to be relaxed and for life to return to something closer to normal, Hancock said. But asked directly during his media round if the tests could be the \"game changer\" -- a term previously used by Johnson -- Hancock was cautious.\n\n\"I hope if this mass testing regime comes off, if the new technologies we're working so hard on work, than I hope we can have a happy and loving Christmas that people yearn for,\" Hancock told the BBC. \"We will do absolutely what we can to keep people safe.\"",

She said she is asymptomatic and will isolate herself for two weeks.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said the state is seeing progress \"across the spectrum\" in its virus fight, even as wildfires raging in the San Francisco Bay Area spur evacuations and affect testing.\n\nThe state reported 4,946 new cases Monday, a 0.7% increase and well below the 14-day average of 7,622. There were 18 additional deaths, compared with its two-week daily average of 128, but those figures tend to be lower on Mondays because of delays in reporting over the weekend.\n\nHospitalizations from the virus decreased 2.1% to 4,467 patients, the lowest since late June, and are down 20% over a 14-day period, Newsom said at a briefing. The average rate of positive tests over the past week has reached 5.6%, compared with more than 7% last month.\n\nNewsom said virus testing has been disrupted by the wildfires, with 11 state labs \"impacted very directly\" by the blazes. Still, the state is testing more than 100,000 people a day.\n\nSouth Africa is \"over the plateau\" in its outbreak, said Salim Abdool Karim, the chairman of the Ministerial Advisory Committee on the virus, said durin ga briefing Monday.\n\nWhile new cases doubled every two days in March, that rate has now slowed to doubling in as many as 79 days, Karim said. Hospital admissions in all of South Africa's nine provinces have declined, and the testing positivity rate now averages about 13%, from a peak of 27% in the week ended July 23.\n\nCoronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 0.6% as compared with the same time Sunday to 5.72 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. The increase was lower than the average daily gain of 0.8% over the past week. Deaths rose by 0.2% to 176,991.\n\nFrance reported 1,955 new Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours, less than half the previous day's figure that was a four-month high.\n\nMonday's number was well below the 4,897 recorded a day earlier and fit into a recent pattern of lower new cases at the start of each week. Fatalities rose by 15 in the past 24 hours to a total of 30,528, according to a health ministry statement.\n\nGermany plans to scrap a requirement for people returning from high-risk areas to be tested for the coronavirus as capacity is stretched.\n\nSuch travelers will still be subject to a two-week quarantine, which can be ended after five days if a test result shows they don't have the virus, state health ministers said Monday in a joint statement. The officials favor making the change in mid-September or the start of October.\n\nTesting materials and staff are tight across Germany, Dilek Kalayci, the top health official for the state of Berlin, said in the statement. The changes also reflect the decline in travel at the end of the summer holiday season as well as preparation for dealing with the pandemic later this year, according to the statement.\n\nSpain's new coronavirus infections fell on Monday after cases spiked in recent weeks in regions including Madrid and Catalonia.\n\nThe country recorded 2,060 infections in the past 24 hours, down from 3,349 on Friday, according to Health Ministry data published on Monday. New cases rose to a near four-month high last week. The ministry doesn't disclose virus data over the weekend and the number of infections recorded on Mondays tends to be lower than on most other days.\n\nThe infection rate in New York state as of Sunday was 0.66%, the lowest since the start of the pandemic, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Monday.\n\nOf the more than 62,000 tests conducted, 408 were positive as of Aug. 23, he said. The number of hospitalizations was 482, and there were seven virus-related deaths.\n\nState officials are monitoring an increase in positive Covid-19 cases in Western New York. Cuomo said there have been clusters at a steel plant in Erie County, a food-processing factory in Chautauqua County, and two nursing homes in that region. The five-day average of new daily cases is up to 63 from 34 a week ago in the Buffalo region, Cuomo said.\n\nFlorida reported 602,829 Covid-19 cases on Monday, up 0.4% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 0.7% in the previous seven days. The daily increase of 2,258 was the least since June 15.\n\nCase numbers are typically lower in the early part of the week due to reduced lab hours on weekends, but the seven-day rolling case total fell to the lowest since June 24, according to the health department report, which includes data through Sunday.\n\nThe new daily rate of people testing positive for the first time fell to 5.2% for Sunday, down from 5.7% a day earlier. The 5% reading for Friday was also the lowest since mid-June.\n\nAuthorities in Zurich, Switzerland's most populous canton, or state, announced new limits on large gatherings in response to an uptick in Covid-19 infections. Events such as theater performances, concerns, church services and private parties will be limited to 100 participants unless masks are worn. As of Thursday, people in shops will also be required to wear masks.\n\nModerna Inc. said it plans to provide 80 million doses of its experimental coronavirus shot to the EU.

Hong Kong officials warned that cases can still rebound.\n\n\"Two to three days of lower cases cannot really show if there is a downtrend,\" said Chuang Shuk-Kwan, head of communicable diseases at the Center for Health Protection. \"The number of cases is still very high, the number of unknown origin is also high. At this moment we can't slacken ourselves.\"\n\nOfficials in the former British colony imposed their strictest measures yet last month in an effort to control the outbreak, including banning gatherings of more than two people and requiring mask wearing at all public venues, both indoors and outdoors. The measures were extended Monday for another week, to Aug. 11.\n\nAuthorities in Hong Kong are also working to ramp up the city's testing and hospital capacity. After opening two community isolation centers that can each host 350 and 500 patients with mild symptoms, the government is studying where and how to open more makeshift hospitals when needed.\n\nChina is offering assistance, aiming to help boost Hong Kong's coronavirus testing capacity to as many as 200,000 samples daily -- 20 times its current ability. More details of testing are expected to be announced in the coming two weeks, local media reported, citing the city's lawmaker Cheung Kwok-kwan.\n\nThe mainland-sponsored testing push has fanned suspicions that authorities will collect DNA samples from residents, which the Hong Kong government denied Monday, saying that the claims are unfounded and that test samples will not be transported to the mainland.\n\n\"The Hong Kong government should decide the length of its coronavirus testing program based on its organizational ability and public cooperation,\" said Jiao Yahui, a National Health Commission official, at a briefing in Beijing on Wednesday. The central government will \"provide fast and full assistance when Hong Kong requests help,\" she said.",

        "body": "A small DNA-testing company that just months ago was trying to get its footing in consumer genetics is now part of an effort to make U.K. hospitals safer during the pandemic.\n\nThe company, DnaNudge, won a 161-million pound ($211 million) order for 5,000 machines and a supply of cartridges to test patients for the new coronavirus in hundreds of the National Health Service hospitals.\n\nFor founder Christofer Toumazou, a professor at Imperial College London, it's the culmination of months of efforts to retool a toaster-size machine he originally developed to analyze key bits of people's DNA so users could tailor their diet to their heredity. Now his lab-in-a-box will be used to see whether patients arriving at hospitals for surgery, cancer treatment and other procedures harbor Covid-19 -- an unexpected detour in his contribution to the consumer genetics revolution.\n\n\"We could be entering a very new world when we come out on the other side of this pandemic,\" Toumazou said in an interview.\n\nHis machine, the Nudgebox, delivers a result in 90 minutes on the spot -- no need to ship samples to a lab -- based on either a nose swab or some saliva. It can also identify the flu and another common lung ailment known as respiratory syncytial virus.\n\nThe U.K. government this month also ordered 450,000 rapid tests from DNA testing company Oxford Nanopore Technologies. Innovative diagnostics are the latest examples of British science being deployed to fight the pandemic, along with the coronavirus vaccine being developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc and an Oxford study that established the life-saving potential of a cheap anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone.\n\nCoronavirus testing has become a sensitive topic in the U.K. after early efforts to speed up diagnosis floundered. Thousands of tests ordered last spring turned out to be flawed, preventing a scaling up of detection envisioned by Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. Britain has suffered more than 46,000 deaths, the most of any European country.\n\nGraham Cooke, a professor of infectious diseases at Imperial College London, said he was doubtful at first that Toumazou's device would be useful, but that it held up well under scrutiny.\n\n\"If you have someone coming in and you're not sure if they have Covid, you can make a decision about where they should go,\" he said. \"You don't want to put the wrong person in the wrong place.\"\n\nSome of the Nudgeboxes ordered have already been rolled out in eight London hospitals and health-care centers, where doctors and nurses can use them to quickly determine whether new patients should be isolated. DnaNudge may go public in a year or so, according to Toumazou.\n\nAs Toumazou, 59, watched the pandemic unfold and overwhelm NHS resources, his greatest worries were for his children, one of whom is immuno-compromised and would be at high risk if he caught Covid-19. But his thoughts also kept going back to the box whose technology was lying fallow as a result of the crisis.\n\nSo he went to his biggest investor, former Thai prime minister and mobile-phone magnate Thaksin Sinawatra, who agreed to plow more cash into the business to fund the transition.\n\nThe box went from being able to analyze human DNA to the narrower task of recognizing the genetic blueprint of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The rejig also added a feature that ensures a proper sample has been taken -- meaning it's easy to know whether a patient needs to be retested.\n\nToumazou said little in his background prepared him for the fields of health or science. The son of a Greek Cypriot-immigrant family that owned restaurants in England, he saw his outlook changed by an uncle who was an engineer.\n\n\"He inspired me,\" Toumazou recalled. \"At that time, Greek families were either in restaurants or hairdressing, and my family were in catering. I wasn't really meant for engineering.\"\n\nWhile his school didn't offer the exams that allow access to the U.K.'s top colleges, Toumazou enrolled in an electrical engineering program at what was then called Oxford Polytechnic.\n\nThere, he and his instructor John Lidgey began working on a new kind of circuit that drastically reduced the amount of power needed. As a research fellow at Imperial College London, he became the institution's youngest person to be promoted to professor, at age 33. He began using the technology in a variety of applications, including mobile phones and eventually implanted prostheses for deaf children, and became interested in the connection between tech and genetics.\n\nNow Toumazou spends most of his days at NHS hospitals in London and Oxford, overseeing the use of Nudgeboxes for Covid. They're performing hundreds of tests each day, and he still sees more opportunities for expanding applications. The devices could be used for quick testing in airports or businesses when people come down with symptoms, for example, or to quickly check volunteers for vaccine trials.\n\nAnd there's also the possibility of going back to DnaNudge's original mission -- helping people match foods to their genetic predisposition -- to avoid diabetes, kidney disease and other conditions that might make them more vulnerable to Covid.\n\n\"My dream has been to bring testing like this to the consumer,\" Toumazou said. \"A test that can demystify and simplify that quickly -- rather than leaving people in doubt -- is going to be very useful.\"",

        "body": "Lindblad Expeditions' formula involves no human contact, no busy ports, and lots and lots of nose swabbing.\n\nAdventure cruise operator Lindblad Expeditions thinks it's cracked the code for safe cruising during a pandemic: Shelter passengers in a moving bubble of protection from viruses, prestart to finish. Chief Executive Officer Sven Lindblad says guests would not only travel together but also quarantine in the same hotel -- isolating for long enough to get two negative Covid-19 tests per passenger before departure. The company hopes to restart cruises in Antarctica as soon as November.\n\nLindblad is not the first cruise line to begin operations again, but it's the most thorough in its approach. In mid-July, Norway's Hurtigruten thought it had the magic ticket to return to sailing safely, only to have its public-health procedures immediately break down. After two weeklong, 400-passenger sailings to the Arctic, dozens of crew and guests tested positive for the virus.\n\nMSC Cruises, meanwhile, returned to the Mediterranean Sea on Aug. 15, having required all of its travelers to undergo an antigen swab test directly before boarding. How that pans out remains to be seen.\n\nAs a purveyor of expedition travel, Lindblad is especially well-positioned to make its virus-free bubbles work. Its fleet of 10 small ships focuses on underpopulated, naturally pristine places, minimizing (or even eliminating) the need for human interaction at its various ports of call.\n\nThis is Lindblad's plan: Say the Smiths, party of two, want to go on a once-in-a-lifetime cruise to see penguins, whales, and icy landscapes in Antarctica. They book a trip on the new, 126-passenger National Geographic Endurance -- a cutting-edge vessel noteworthy for its smooth ride, fuel efficiency, and reduced emissions.\n\nFive days before they leave their home in the U.S. -- for logistical reasons, the cruises will only be available to Americans at first -- the Smiths will be required to have a PCR nasal swab test at a facility in their hometown, chosen with Lindblad's help if necessary. Assuming their result is negative, they'd then travel to a jumping-off point somewhere in the 48 contiguous states, where, upon arrival, Lindblad would issue another Covid-19 test (either PCR or the quicker-but-less-reliable antigen test, depending on local turnaround times).\n\nTheir noses sufficiently prodded, the Smiths would spend a mandatory night at a designated hotel, where Lindblad would reward them with room-service dinner, allowing them to quarantine from their fellow travelers while they await next steps.\n\nHaving the second test before joining the group eliminates false negatives, says Dr. David Lorber, Lindblad's consulting physician. And quarantining in between the two tests means anyone who does have the virus would not have interacted with other passengers. (Infected passengers would be sent home and likely refunded, though details are still being finalized.) Although it's possible that someone could get a false negative on the second test and/or contract the coronavirus en route to the departure city, Lorber's probability modeling shows it to be unlikely.\n\nWith their health clearances in order, the Smiths would ride in a carefully sanitized van to join their fellow vacationers on a private charter flight to Ushuaia, Argentina, where their ship to Antarctica awaits. Costs would be mostly unaffected by the privatized flights, which will average out to the same price as commercial or just slightly higher. Every aspect of the group's travel would be tightly controlled, including by the Argentine government, which will have to open its borders to Americans for the trips to proceed.\n\nAll the same protocol would apply to the crew. \"Any break, a crew member just zipping into a drugstore to pick up some shaving cream, that's all it's going to take,\" Lorber says. \"You can't have that.\"\n\nLindblad's ships will sail at about 80% capacity -- the volume determined by them appropriate for social distancing.\n\nStill, the Smiths would be required to wear masks in public areas and when out exploring on Zodiacs (but not while paddling single or double kayaks). Some shipboard facilities would be closed, such as the buffet, hot tubs, and infinity pools. Dining, gym access, and visits to the bridge to hang out with the officers would be staggered. In addition to strict housekeeping standards, the facilities would literally clean themselves; Lindblad has coated its ships with ACT CleanCoat, a veneer that automatically breaks down microbes and allergens on contact.\n\nThere would be a physician on board and likely a nurse, too. And each day, guests and crew would be required to undergo temperature checks and fill out health questionnaires.\n\n\"You can count on everybody saying, 'Joe, the waiter was coughing this morning,' or you can ask Joe to fill out a form every day and make sure he isn't coughing. But you want to encourage both,\" Lorber says. Those with symptoms would be tested and, if the results are negative, tested again within a 48-hour period, using tests that can be analyzed right in the guest's room.\n\nAt some point during the voyage, which could last anywhere from two weeks to 35 days and start from $15,000 per person/double occupancy, guests would likely receive at least one more round of testing -- with any positive results sending the guest and their close contacts into dedicated quarantine cabins.\n\nLindblad is still preparing for a worst-case scenario. As such, its ships will be equipped with a ventilator that the staff doctor will be trained to operate, and a medical evacuation plan -- currently being developed by the International Association of Antarctic Tour Operators (IAATO) -- will include prearranged agreements with local hospitals.\n\nOf course, in Antarctica, there's no such thing: Once you're beyond the Drake Passage, the only air ambulance is from King George Island to Punta Arenas, Chile. In the event of a large outbreak, the ship would have to turn back.\n\nStaying away from people is easy in Antarctica. The only human interaction might come at research stations, which Lindblad used to include on weather-permitting trips. Now the company is planning not to visit them until scientists agree or the pandemic fully subsides.\n\nIn other destinations where Lindblad soon hopes to again operate its 48- to 148-passenger ships, such as Baja, Mexico, the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands, and Tahiti, civilization would be avoided -- which flies in the face of some of the line's sustainability goals.\n\n\"It's a conundrum,\" says CEO Lindblad. \"We want to provide [local communities] with some economic value.\" Selling local artwork shipboard may be one way, he says; other ideas are under development.\n\nThese workarounds will likely be necessary well into 2021. Even if there's a vaccine, it wouldn't be 100% effective, explains Lorber.\n\nAnd yet, about 40% to 45% of the company's past guests have indicated they're ready to cruise again. Says Lindblad: \"I think there will be an acceleration of interest in places that are remote. That just naturally feels safer to people. Bouncing around big cities, not so much.\"",

        "body": "The emergence of a handful of people reinfected by SARS-Cov-2 -- including individuals in Hong Kong, Italy and the U.S. -- has sparked panic over the future course of the pandemic.\n\nIt's not difficult to see why. One of the great hopes in tackling the new coronavirus is that partial herd immunity can slow its spread, as the number of cases continues to rise globally. A vaccine -- seen as the real game changer in the fight against the pathogen -- also relies on inducing some form of long-lasting antibody reaction in inoculated individuals.\n\nBut what if immunity wanes, plunging humanity into a never-ending cycle of relapses? This is the stuff of nightmares.\n\nFortunately, things may not be so bad. For now, there are very few cases of confirmed reinfections, suggesting they may be rare. Some doctors also believe that most relapses will be milder than the first infection. (That happened in the Hong Kong reinfection, although not in the U.S. case.) This weakening of the virus's impact will depend on our body learning to fight it, for example via the development of suitable so-called T-cells.\n\nA crucial question to gauge the risk of reinfection is how many individuals develop antibodies and how long they last. Some experts worry that only those who suffer the worst Covid-19 cases produce an immune response that's both sizeable enough and protracted enough to build up adequate antibodies. If this is true, the lucky ones who escape the worst symptoms -- including most kids and young adults -- will be more vulnerable to reinfection.\n\nA study on the pandemic in Iceland published in the New England Journal of Medicine offers some evidence to dispel such fears. The researchers have looked at serum samples from 30,576 individuals, using six different types of antibody testing (since different techniques often produce conflicting results).\n\nThe paper's central findings are that, out of 1,797 tested people who'd recovered from Covid, 91.1% produced detectable levels of antibodies. Moreover, these levels hadn't declined four months after the diagnosis. The immune response was higher among older individuals -- who are at greater risk of developing a more dangerous form of the coronavirus -- and among those who presented the worst symptoms.\n\nBut the broader immune response is potentially good news for the efficacy of any vaccine and appears to confirm that reinfections, at least shortly after the first illness, may indeed be rare.\n\nWhile it's also theoretically good news for herd immunity, that doesn't mean we're anywhere near achieving that happy state. It is thought that about 70% of a population would need to have antibodies to effectively stop the spread of the virus. The study estimates that less than 1% of the Icelandic population came in contact with SARS-CoV-2. This is even lower than the corresponding estimates for Spain, the U.K. and Italy, and shows how far many countries are from group immunity.\n\nIt is also too early so say whether these antibody findings will hold over a longer time period. It's possible that immunity will fade as time goes by, leaving us more exposed to the virus. But, for now, there's no reason to fear the worst. The development of vaccines is happening at breakneck speed, and available evidence shows the human body is indeed developing some form of protection. In a year of overwhelmingly grim news, this is very welcome.",

        "body": "Students, teachers, parents agonize about how in-person learning could put the most vulnerable at risk of Covid-19\n\nFor some students, going back to school could be deadly.\n\nRebecca Tabor is one. Three years ago, she had a heart transplant and takes medication that suppresses her immune system to keep her body from rejecting it. So when the University of Louisiana at Lafayette brought students back to campus this month, she concluded going back was too big a risk. Instead, she'll take classes virtually from her parents' home. For exams, though, she'll still have to commute to campus, over two hours away.\n\nTabor is a senior and needs to take a science lab to graduate. That, along with any semblance of a normal 21-year-old's life, will have to wait. A school spokesperson said it's up to students with special needs to work out accommodations with professors or, if that doesn't work, contact administrators. However late Monday, the school decided to make courses entirely virtual for the week in advance of tropical storms Marco and Laura.\n\n\"I've had to do a lot of work to make sure everything is both safe and feasible for me to accomplish,\" Tabor said.\n\nRelatively little is known about how Covid-19 affects young people: research indicates that a small percentage may suffer long-term symptoms after infection. Advocates of reopening say that places like Northern Europe where classrooms never closed or opened with few problems show that the young are less likely to transmit the virus or get seriously ill. But teachers in many states have pushed back on efforts to refill classrooms, saying protective measures are inadequate. Those with health conditions that make them more vulnerable to Covid-19 see school as just one more way the pandemic has upended their lives.\n\nOn Friday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated guidance to recommend schools offer remote work or learning opportunities for anyone at higher risk due to other health conditions.\n\n\"Everyone's constraints are really different,\" said Emily Oster, an economist at Brown University who has studied school reopenings. \"We're all kind of facing a lot of choices, which we basically have no idea how to make.\"\n\nThe concern has heightened as outbreaks force more schools to revert to remote learning. And for many like Tabor, even a small risk is a massive gamble.\n\nDave Kitzinger is a 64-year-old heart transplant recipient. His 15-year-old son \"desperately wants\" to go back when his suburban Pittsburgh high school reopens, but they're worried. The district voted last week to stay on-line for the first nine weeks of the semester, though, giving them more time to consider the options.\n\n\"He wants to see his friends. He wants to be back in that environment. But he's concerned he's going to go and bring something home,\" Kitzinger said. When contacted for comment, the superintendent said that anyone uncomfortable with in-person instruction will have a virtual option. Kitzinger said, though, that he feels going back remotely would be hard on his son. \"It's a crummy position to be in. I'm so concerned about him losing such a big part of his early adulthood.\"\n\nShauna Perry works with immune-compromised patients in Maine as a nurse. Her husband recently received a transplant that resulted in complications, prompting them to rethink what to do as their daughter starts kindergarten. They needed a creative plan that lets Perry work without risking her husband's or patients' health. So their daughter will stream kindergarten classes from her preschool, which has just a few kids.\n\n\"There were no other options,\" she said. \"We don't have a lot of family support. I am the main income provider and I have our health insurance. So we really didn't have a choice.\"\n\nHer daughter's kindergarten didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nPerry, Kitzinger and Tabor are members of a Facebook group for transplant recipients, and what to do about schools is a regular topic. There's no consensus, so participants share the plans they've cobbled together to help the others with ideas on how to protect their health without compromising education.\n\nNationally, about 61% of kindergarten through high school students will attend school virtually, according to a survey of public-school districts by Burbio, a New York-based data service. About 20% will have in-person classes and more than 18% are hybrid, Burbio found. One percent are undecided. About 75% of the top 700 U.S. universities plan to allow students on campus, even those staying online.\n\nThe CDC recommends schools prioritize bringing students back, but any decision needs to be based on local guidance. Mass testing isn't recommended, while symptom screenings, masks and temperature checks are. President Donald Trump has pushed for all levels of schools to bring students back, saying \"virtual is not as good as being there.\"\n\nBut even low case numbers in the community don't shield schools enough, according to Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute. There isn't enough testing and contact tracing in place to safely reopen for anyone, he said.\n\nAnd \"if you're immunocompromised, even if you're healthy, it's a risk,\" he said.\n\nIn Muskogee, Oklahoma, Madison Shoemaker, 22, and her mother care for her 7-year-old niece, who was diagnosed in early March with primary immunodeficiency disorder and must avoid public spaces. \"She can't even fight off a cold right now, so fighting off Covid is not an option,\" Shoemaker said.\n\nThe district has a fully online option, but keeping the first-grader home means Shoemaker, who plans to finish college in December and has two jobs, has to cut back on work. \"That's going to be a huge financial impact on us,\" she said.\n\nThe district encourages masks for those in second grade and below and requires them above that age and said its E-Learning Academy will be available beyond this year. The \"superintendent feels that providing an online option is part of the future of education,\" according to an emailed statement.\n\nShoemaker is also concerned about her niece's mental health as she's \"super isolated.\" Still, normalcy isn't an option now.\n\n\"People want to get back to work,\" she said. \"They don't understand that there's other situations besides their own that are much more complicated.\"\n\nThe nuances of these situations generate lots of tension, Oster said.\n\n\"If you send your kids back to school, it's because you don't care about public health, and if you don't send your kids back to school, it's because you're a paranoid loser,\" said Oster, who has two youngsters. \"It's dialed up a lot of the judgment, which, of course, doesn't make it any easier to make these decisions.\"\n\nFor Nancy Souza, a 58-year-old special-education teacher from Manteca, California, going back to work has meant socially distancing from her husband, who has brain cancer.\n\nThe district has brought teachers back while students attend remotely, since \"teachers deserve to have equitable access to their learning environment and all the resources and tools unique to their subject area,\" said Victoria Brunn, the district's community outreach director. Souza's assistants are required to wear masks and socially distance in the classroom, measures that her husband's doctor said lowered the risk enough for her to return.\n\nBut two weeks ago, an assistant tested positive and they had to self-isolate. Since then, she's kept away from her husband and slept in a different room. Souza said her principal allowed her to shift to online. Thirty-five others have also been allowed to work from home, Brunn said.\n\n\"We didn't even go back to school with students and we are already on quarantine,\" Souza said. \"If I can't even go to school with adults using precautions, then how am I supposed to be able do that with 16 students?\"",

        "body": "Amit Shah, the man leading India's fight against Covid-19 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's top lieutenant, has been among government leaders touting the country's low death rate as a success story.\n\nIn late June, Shah said India had seen much fewer deaths from the virus than the global average and other nations like the U.S., Brazil and the U.K. That showed a \"country like India, even when compared to developed countries, has fought this fight very well,\" he told New Delhi-based Asian News International in an interview.\n\nOfficially India's death rate is nearly 20 times lower than the U.S., even though it has the world's fastest growing epidemic and the third highest number of total cases -- now including Shah, who confirmed on Sunday that he was hospitalized with the virus. But independent experts are warning India has failed to properly record fatalities, and say better data collection is needed if the country is going to get a handle on the epidemic.\n\n\"The problem is a mix of poor data culture and a bloated, corrupt bureaucracy,\" said Steve H. Hanke, professor of Applied Economics and the founder and co-director of the Johns Hopkins Institute for Applied Economics, Global Health, and the Study of Business Enterprise at the Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, pointing to a report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\n\"Missing or low-quality data are always a major problem when attempting to form public policy in the health -- or any other -- field,\" he said. \"It's equivalent to the pilot of an aircraft flying blind.\"\n\nThe country of 1.3 billion has more than 1.8 million confirmed infections and close to 40,000 deaths, according to the most recent data from the Johns Hopkins University. Its mortality per 100,000 is about 2.82 compared to 47.33 in the U.S and 44.92 in Brazil, the data shows.\n\nBloomberg contacted officials in the capital New Delhi, the financial hub Mumbai and the southern industrial center of Chennai to obtain data for total deaths in each month from March to July for 2019 and 2020. Figures from Chennai showed overall deaths this year were higher than last year, with a spike in June, while Mumbai provided two different data sets that couldn't be compared. Multiple calls to municipal corporation officials in Delhi yielded no data.\n\nIndia's death registration data was patchy even before the virus struck. The vast majority of deaths, especially in rural villages, take place at home and routinely go unregistered. For others the cause of death listed is often anodyne -- old age or heart attack. Experts believe that only between 20%-30% of all deaths in India are properly medically certified.\n\nThe pandemic has stretched the country's already ramshackle health infrastructure to near breaking point, highlighting every fault-line that already existed. Data collection is a prime example. Covid-19 data from the federal and state governments is either without any breakdown of gender and age -- crucial when assessing the impact of disease -- or lacking comparisons with deaths recorded over similar periods in previous years.\n\nFor now, India's infections show no signs of peaking. Last week the country was adding more than 50,000 infections almost every day, while cities and states that appeared to have the epidemic under control are reporting grim stories of overwhelmed hospitals. Given India's testing rate is one of the lowest in the world among hard hit countries, experts say the true extent of its epidemic is likely far higher than official data indicates.\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Family Welfare didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nAt least three major Indian cities -- New Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai -- revised their Covid-19 death data significantly upwards in June. The reasons for revisions varied. In New Delhi, local municipal bodies said hospital death data didn't tally with reports of virus-related burials and cremations. In Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu state, and Mumbai delays or bureaucratic lapses in collecting data from multiple sources were cited.\n\nLast week, Tamil Nadu once again revised death data -- this time for the entire state -- adding more than 400 deaths from March to June. There have been a slew of news reports about other cities ignoring the death reporting guidelines of the main medical research organization, the Indian Council of Medical Research, that state all 'suspected' Covid-19 deaths should be included in the death tally.\n\nMumbai Raises Virus Death Tally by 38% on Data Filing Delays\n\n\"Mortality data are essential as they provide unbiased estimates of the trends in Covid deaths,\" said Prabhat Jha, professor of Global Health and Epidemiology at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto. Jha is one the leading experts on India's mortality data and the chief investigator of the Million Death Study in India. \"Data are the best way out of the epidemic,\" he said, urging governments \"to release a lot more data quickly on cases, deaths and hospitalizations.\"\n\nMissing death data will worsen as the virus sweeps through India's villages, said T. Sundararaman, a New Delhi-based global coordinator of the People's Health Movement, an organization which brings together local activists, academics and civil society groups working on public health. The problem with under-reporting virus deaths is compounded by all the delays in how data is collected and travels through India's bureaucracy, he said, as well as the time between infection and death.\n\n\"The mortality data released today relates to the cases of infections reported 15 days back -- in those 15 days we've added 500,000 new cases,\" Sundararaman said in a telephone interview. \"We're looking at the current number of deaths by the current number cases\" instead of dividing by the cases from two weeks ago. \"In which case our mortality rate will actually rise to 6% which is where I think it should be -- at about 4% to 6%.\"\n\n\"All these deaths that are missed, all these cases that are missed are clusters in the making,\" he said. \"The real problem is that you're failing to follow a properly data driven public health policy.\"\n\nIndia's poor quality of health data is a symptom of its overrun public health system.\n\nAs the disease progressed every infection-hit city or state began to announce additional hospital beds for Covid-19 patients. Tens of thousands of beds were added -- yet there was no explanation of how these beds were being medically staffed.\n\nSetting up beds is easy, but there is no point unless you have the extra staff to care for the patients in those beds, the managing director of a prominent private hospital in north India said, asking not to be identified citing privacy concerns. In the end, India's mortality rates will be among the highest in the world, the director said, offering a lesson in how not to manage a pandemic.\n\nIt's a gap Sundararaman also notes. \"We've increased the beds but the recruitment is not on pace. Nurses, paramedics, lab technicians -- we need to provide jobs now.\"",

In this edition: Biden calls for national mask mandate, 6% of the U.K. caught Covid-19, and coronavirus misinformation killed hundreds of people.\n\nIsrael and the United Arab Emirates agreed Thursday to establish full diplomatic ties in a U.S.-brokered deal that forces Israel to delay plans to annex West Bank territory, long sought by Palestinians for a future state.\n\nThe move means the UAE would join Egypt and Jordan as the only Arab countries with fully normal ties with Israel. Trump said he'll host Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at the White House in the next three weeks to begin a wide range of talks.\n\nThe deal, hailed by Trump as a \"truly historic moment\" and by Netanyahu as a \"new era of peace with the Arab world,\" was assailed by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas as a betrayal by the UAE in line with \"treason.\"\n\nTrump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who said talks between Israel and the UAE had been going on for 18 months, called the Palestinian response \"fairly predictable that we've seen time and time again to all types of things that help make their people's lives better.\"\n\nA spokesman for Hamas, the U.S.-designated terrorist organization that runs the Gaza Strip, said the move was a \"stab against the Palestinian cause\" that'd spur Israel \"to commit more aggression against our people.\"\n\nThe agreement is a key foreign policy win for Trump ahead of the 2020 election.

        "body": "Speranza says contagion limited, low impact on health service\n\nItaly has ruled out imposing a new nationwide lockdown despite an upsurge in coronavirus cases, as the country struggles to emerge from the worst recession in living memory.\n\nThe increase in contagion has been limited, with very low impact on health services, Health Minister Roberto Speranza said in an interview with Bloomberg News.\n\n\"I exclude the hypothesis of a lockdown for our country now,\" Speranza, 41, said at his Rome office Wednesday. \"We have few cases and the situation is under control, with pressure on hospitals that is very low, minimal.\" The minister noted that during the peak of the virus crisis Italy had 4,068 patients in intensive care, compared with just 66 as of Tuesday.\n\n\"A generalized lockdown is not a prospect for us, also because we have reinforced the health service, we are faster at doing tests,\" said Speranza, a lawmaker from junior coalition party Article One. \"We're also doing tests at airports for people who come from at-risk countries.\" The average age of people who've tested positive in the last week is 30, and most have mild symptoms or none at all, he said.\n\nThe three-month national lockdown in Italy, the original European epicenter of the virus, took a heavy toll on the economy. The government forecasts that GDP will contract 8% in 2020, while analysts see a 10% decline.\n\nThe number of new cases has increased almost daily in recent weeks, with about half involving Italians returning from vacations either within the country or abroad. The increase is, however, smaller than in other European countries including Spain, France and Germany. Italy registered 876 new cases Tuesday, with the total number of infections now at 261,174.\n\nRead More: Italy Lockdown Success Challenged by New Europe Virus Surge\n\nAsked how much the government weighs economic factors in deciding on restrictions, Speranza said, \"I believe it's a serious mistake to set the health issue and the economic and financial issue against each other. Winning the health battle is the premise for an economic and financial recovery.\"\n\nNoting that Italy has often been praised for how it contained the pandemic, Speranza said the government has always focused on public health, which triggered what was a \"very, very serious, rigorous lockdown.\" Italians broadly complied with rules on wearing masks and social distancing, he added.\n\n\"I hear people say that Italy is a model, but I am very cautious,\" Speranza warned. \"We still have much to do. God forbid people should think that the battle has been won.\"\n\nReopening the nation's schools, set for Sept. 14, will be the next test for the Rome government, and opposition politicians have already accused the administration of being unprepared and failing to produce precise guidelines.\n\nThe government is working to ensure \"maximum security\" at schools, Speranza said, noting that any positive cases among students or staff would trigger contact tracing but not necessarily lead to school closures.\n\nSperanza said he's hopeful that a vaccine being developed at Rome's Lazzaro Spallanzani Institute, which started human trials Monday, could produce \"the first solid results\" by the end of the year.",

The Home Affairs Committee's report is a taster of how difficult that process will be.\n\nThe committee said that from March 13 to June 8, there were no quarantine or isolation requirements for any travelers without symptoms, and no testing or screening at the border. This meant the virus \"spread faster and reached more people,\" committee chair Yvette Cooper, a member of the opposition Labour Party, said.\n\n\"The U.K. was almost unique in having no border checks or quarantine arrangements at that time,\" Cooper said in a statement. \"That alone should have rung loud alarm bells for ministers and made them think again. Many times ministers told us they were following the science, but we cannot find any science at all behind their completely inexplicable decision.\"\n\nMeanwhile Parliament's Health Committee, led by Johnson's former leadership rival Jeremy Hunt, has announced it will begin commissioning an independent grading of the government's record on delivering pledges, rating them from \"outstanding\" to \"inadequate.\"",

        "body": "Beirut (AP) -- Lebanon on Friday began a two-week partial lockdown and nighttime curfew after coronavirus cases increased sharply following an explosion in Beirut that killed and injured thousands of people.\n\nConfirmed cases of the virus have increased from 5,417 a day after the massive blast on Aug. 4 to nearly 11,000 on Friday, leading officials to announce the lockdown.\n\nOn Thursday, Lebanon's Health Ministry tallied a record 605 confirmed new cases in the previous 24 hours, raising the total registered cases since late February to 10,952.\n\nThe pandemic has killed 113 people in the tiny country, which was successful in limiting the spread of the virus during the early months.\n\nMany businesses were closed Friday morning in Beirut even though some sectors, including banks, groceries, book shops and pharmacies were allowed to open. Restaurants, night clubs, beaches and clothes shops are among the businesses ordered to close by the Ministry of Interior.\n\nVirus cases had already been on the rise since the beginning of July, when an earlier lockdown was lifted and Lebanon's only international airport was reopened. At the end of June, Lebanon registered 1,778 cases. That number has since multiplied more than five times in seven weeks.\n\nBut the numbers shot up dramatically following the Aug. 4, explosion of nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate stored at Beirut's port. More than 180 people were killed, more than 6,000 injured and a quarter of a million people were left with homes unfit to live in. The blast overwhelmed the city's hospitals and also badly damaged two that had a key role in handling virus cases.\n\nAfter the blast, medical officials have warned of increased risk of catching the virus because of crowding at hospitals and funerals, or as people searched through the rubble. Protests and demonstrations also broke out after the blast as Lebanese vented their anger at authorities.\n\nThe virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying health problems.\n\nLebanon's health sector has been challenged by the pandemic that hit amid an unprecedented economic and financial crisis.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, a health official warned that nighttime curfews and lockdowns could resume in parts of the country as coronavirus case numbers spike.\n\nDr. Saif al-Dhaheri of the UAE's National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority made the comments late Thursday in an interview aired on a state-owned television channel.\n\nAsked if those measures could be taken, al-Dhaheri said: \"Yes. If we found that the number of cases is increasing in a specific area, we could.\"\n\nReturning to lockdowns could hurt Dubai, the skyscraper-studded city that's reopened for tourists just a few weeks ago. It also could affect the UAE's efforts to host the Indian Premier League beginning next month.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, the UAE discovered over 400 confirmed cases of the virus, its highest numbers in about a month amid an aggressive testing campaign. Officials have blamed the rise in infections on the public not taking wearing masks and social distancing seriously.",

        "body": "Medicine could be third Covid drug in U.S. treatment arsenal Trial results could come as soon as this month or September\n\nMerck & Co.'s experimental antiviral pill has the potential to unseat the handful of authorized treatments for Covid-19, that are already weighed down by questions about their effectiveness.\n\nResults from mid-stage studies indicating the therapy's promise could come as soon as this week, raising the possibility that a new medicine may reach the market before the end of the year. That could put the maker of Keytruda -- one of the world's fastest-selling medicines -- back in the spotlight. Positive data could also assure investors that Merck has a promising pipeline beyond the cancer drug which makes up almost a third of its sales.\n\nSince the onset of the pandemic, the focus has been on vaccines and a handful of potential treatments for the novel coronavirus. Countries around the globe are focused on stockpiling inoculations and getting them through regulatory hurdles quickly, but scientists are already saying the first vaccines may not be all that effective for very long, and treatments for the virus will still be needed.\n\nMerck's more measured efforts on the vaccine front mean the company trails other developers that have already entered large-scale, late-stage studies, but its experimental antiviral could be the next blockbuster treatment for Covid-19 with more than $1 billion in annual sales, one Wall Street analyst has said.\n\nOne of the early standouts in the war doctors and scientists are waging against the disease was Gilead Sciences Inc.'s remdesivir, now known as Veklury. But clinicians have yet to see Covid-19 results from either Veklury or plasma products that show a definitive benefit in extending people's lives.\n\nRelated: Where Are We in the Quest for Coronavirus Treatments?: QuickTake\n\nPhase 2 results from two studies of Merck's antiviral pill -- one in hospitalized patients with Covid-19 and one in outpatients -- are expected in the next few weeks.\n\nIf those results \"are positive and arrive in a timely manner, we believe Merck could begin phase 3 trials in September, which could support an emergency use authorization before year-end, inline with\" Veklury's approval timeline, SVB Leerink analyst Daina Graybosch wrote in a note.\n\nThe pill called, MK-4482, stops the virus from replicating. It was discovered by scientists at Emory University and is being tested with collaborator Ridgeback Biotherapeutics LP. The pill form gives it an edge over Veklury, as well as convalescent plasma, a treatment that the Food and Drug Administration has given the go-ahead for widespread use. Both need to be administered via an infusion, though an inhaled formulation of Veklury is also being developed.\n\nMerck's pill could offer convenience as well as greater therapeutic benefit, according to Graybosch, who pointed to the medicine's 5-day course in non-hospitalized patients.\n\n\"MK-4482 could become the go-to option for patients who present with symptoms\" even before a confirmatory test, she said drawing parallels to the flu treatment Tamiflu which peaked at roughly $3 billion in annual sales over a decade ago.\n\n\"We have secured manufacturing capability to produce many millions of doses of the drug before the end of this year,\" Roger M. Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, told investors on the company's second-quarter earnings call last month. The medicine also appeared active in lab tests against viruses with mutations that made them resistant to Veklury, he said.\n\nMerck plans to kickoff two new pivotal trials in September, one for outpatients and one for those hospitalized. A large phase 2 outpatient study under the auspices of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is also in the works.",

    "Mystery Grows Over Virus Spread Via Contaminated Food Packaging": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Experts say freight transmission is possible but not likely\n\nEvidence shows that food is an unlikely route of transmitting the coronavirus across borders, but contaminated items continue to grab the spotlight, deepening the uncertainty over whether the $220 billion cold chain industry could be implicated in the spread of Covid-19.\n\nChina has repeatedly found traces of the pathogen on packaging and food, raising fears that imported items are linked to recent virus resurgences in Beijing and the port city of Dalian. In the nation's strongest action since it began testing food items in June, a major Chinese city on Sunday banned imports of frozen meat from coronavirus hotspots.\n\nCold-storage facilities and meat processing plants are ideal environments for the virus to spread, as the pathogen thrives in cold and dry environments. But there has been no concrete evidence the virus can be transmitted through food, and experts remain doubtful that it's a major threat.\n\n\"We know that viruses usually can survive being frozen. So that means in theory it's possible that infection could spread that way,\" said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong. \"But in reality, it's a very low risk that that would happen because so many steps would need to be involved.\"\n\nThe virus would need to survive freezing and then defrosting. It would need to get onto someone's hands and then into their nose or mouth, and still survive. \"I don't think it would be a frequent mode of transmission, but it is possible,\" he said.\n\nAmid a lack of conclusive proof, China is taking precautionary steps, creating major disruptions with its trading partners. The Cold Chain Association of China's southern coastal city of Guangzhou ordered all member companies to suspend imports of frozen meat and seafood from coronavirus-hit areas.\n\nThe order was issued after the local government in the nearby city of Shenzhen found the virus on a surface sample of chicken wings imported from Brazil. Hong Kong has also suspended imports from that plant.\n\nChina has otherwise refrained from wider nationwide moves against imported meat due to the reliance of its population on the food source.\n\nNew Zealand originally considered the possibility that a new cluster, which suddenly emerged last week after 102 days without a local virus case, could have been linked to a cold-storage plant, as the first person to test positive worked at an Auckland Americold facility.\n\nBut preliminary findings from environmental testing at the plant have debunked the theory that the route of transmission was through chilled surfaces on materials arriving from overseas, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said Tuesday.\n\n\"The full report will have the details but it seems clear now that the possibility is being ruled out from that investigation,\" he said.\n\nA key unanswered question is whether the traces that China has detected on the packaging and surface of frozen foods are still viable and infectious, or whether they're just dead and harmless vestiges of the pathogen.\n\n\"What we know publicly and what we've seen so far is that yes this virus can survive outside people for up to a few days, depending on the environment,\" said Sarah Cahill, senior food standards officer at Codex Alimentarius Commission, the body responsible for developing food standards under the World Health Organization and the United Nations.\n\n\"But what are we actually detecting when we do these tests?\" she said. \"Are we just detecting RNA, which just means maybe this virus is no longer viable, or is that virus still an infectious agent?\"\n\nIt is not uncommon for a wide array of viruses, bacteria and parasites to be transmitted through contaminated food. The WHO estimates that almost one in 10 people in the world fall ill after eating contaminated food, leading to 420,000 deaths every year. Salmonella and the norovirus on produce or uncooked meat and seafood can cause symptoms like diarrhea and inflammation in the stomach and intestines.\n\nWhile diarrhea can be one of the symptoms of Covid-19 as well, experts are more focused on the possibility of the virus jumping from surfaces to human respiratory systems when people touch their faces after coming into contact with a contaminated item. Even then, some consider that scenario far-fetched.\n\n\"Theoretically, it's possible ,\" said Takeshi Kasai, WHO's regional director for the Western Pacific region, during an online briefing on Tuesday. \"But so far our observations or the evidence coming from the past seven months of epidemiology: it is unlikely.\"",

Should both tests return negative, the individual can return to work. During that day-long period, the individual who tested positive will be isolated and kept outside the facility, he said.\n\nAllen Sills, the league's chief medical officer, described the measure as a \"two-step confirmatory procedure\" on a conference call with reporters Friday. \"Not every positive test result means a new Covid infection,\" he said.\n\nThe change comes a week after Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was erroneously put on the Covid-19 reserve list following a false positive. Stafford was removed from the list on Tuesday, according to a statement from the Lions.\n\nKelly Stafford, the quarterback's wife, called out the NFL earlier this week on her Instagram account for the handling of his results.\n\n\"I was approached in a grocery store and told I was 'endangering others,' my kids were harassed and kicked off a playground, I was told I needed to wait in my car when trying to pick up food, and people closest to us had to get tested just so they could go back to work,\" she wrote. \"I blame the NFL for not holding themselves accountable. These are people's lives and livelihoods that are in those results in THEIR test sites.\"\n\nThe new procedure aims to hone in on \"persistent positive\" and \"unconfirmed positive\" tests, in which someone with a previous Covid-19 infection who has since recovered can still test positive intermittently. Scientists believe in that case, screenings are probably picking up dead viral particles that linger in the body, but patients may not even know they were previously infected, Sills said.\n\n\"Our opportunity here is to really contribute to the medical knowledge about these issues and to do so in a very short time,\" Sills said, adding that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and others were eager to see the league's data because \"that's really data that hasn't really been collected\" in widespread screening programs.\n\nU.S. testing infrastructure has struggled to meet a surge in demand from individuals with and without symptoms since the country began reopening. One challenge has been getting timely results, with test-takers complaining of waits that are more than a week.\n\nThe NFL has performed about 75,000 tests for its players, coaches and staff over the last two weeks, a measure that's paired with other safety precautions such as face coverings, Sills said. The \"overwhelming majority\" of screenings have returned negative, he said.",

There were 5 virus-related fatalities and 579 hospitalizations as of Aug. 6, according to the latest state data.\n\nThe largest U.S. system, with 1.1 million students, is defying a national rush to online education. The spring's scuttled semester had parents struggling to work and teach their children simultaneously, forced businesses to navigate those conflicts, and kept the virus-wracked country that much further away from normality.\n\nMajor school districts that have opted for virtual instruction for at least the start of the year include Los Angeles, Chicago, San Diego, San Francisco, Miami, Atlanta and Houston. But Cuomo said New York is ready.\n\n\"We are probably in the best situation than any other state in the country right now,\" Cuomo said. \"If anybody can open schools, we can open schools.\"\n\nThe decisions about travel, business and education are being made against unrelenting pressure from Trump, whose theories on the topic aren't always supported by his own health experts.\n\n\"This thing's going away -- it will go away like things go away and my view is that schools should be open,\" Trump said Wednesday on Fox News. Children \"are virtually immune from this problem. And we have to open our schools.\"\n\nAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has rejected this claim. There are parts of the country where schools shouldn't open to in-person teaching, the doctor told Bloomberg Television on Wednesday, and testing for the disease needs to improve, especially in the speed to obtain results.\n\nA New York City Department of Education survey to which 400,000 parents responded said 75% wanted their children to return to school. Mayor Bill de Blasio had said New York City wouldn't open schools unless the city remains below a 3% citywide infection rate over a seven day rolling average.\n\n\"We are trying to maximize in-person learning for the good of our kids because we know it makes a world of difference,\" de Blasio said during a news briefing Monday Aug. 3. \"Nothing replaces in-person learning.\"\n\nA city plan called for cleaning schools during the day and at night, with enforced social distancing in classrooms and hallways, mandatory face coverings for all, featuring hand washing and hand sanitizer stations. \"I feel like we're where we need to be to get ready for opening day,\" de Blasio said during an interview on NY1, a local all-news cable channel.\n\nThere is conflicting data about how Covid-19 is transmitted to and from children,\n\nA study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last month suggests infected kids with even just mild symptoms can still have 10 to 100 times the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in their noses and throats as older kids or adults, making them more likely to spread it. An earlier Chinese study, however, found that most children with Covid-19 admitted to a hospital lived in households with previously infected adults, indicating the child caught the virus from the adult rather than transmitting it.\n\nFauci Says Virus Testing Too Slow as Trump Says 'Best Ever'\n\nA small number of kids have died or required intensive care as a result of either the respiratory failure commonly associated with the virus or an inflammatory condition sometimes described as similar to Kawasaki disease that causes heart or circulatory problems.\n\nThat leaves school officials largely at the mercy of their local health officials for guidance. In Chicago, the district will work with the city Department of Public Health to assess if it is safe to open with hybrid learning in the second quarter on Nov. 9.\n\nThe economic effects of keeping children out of school go beyond matters of convenience and pocketbook. They also expose imbalances in the economy, with some children unable to access the Internet as easily as others.\n\n\"The first-order short-term economic impacts will be likely centered around what this does to families needing childcare; loss of school meals for the kids making hunger worse; and whatever furloughing the district is doing,\" said Diane Schanzenbach, professor at the School of Education and Social Policy at Northwestern University. \"Long term, the costs of all of this lost learning will be with us for decades.\"\n\nSenate Republicans have proposed a bill that would provide $70 billion to K-12 schools, but that may not be enough to safely reopen, or even to go remote and provide needed tech to low-income families. More than $116 billion will be needed to safely reopen the nation's public schools, according to an estimate from the American Federation of Teachers union.\n\nThe teacher's unions have been lobbying heavily against in-person school, citing budget restraints and health risks for staff and pupils.",

Both came together this week when the CDC changed its testing guidelines in a way that had public health scientists baffled.\n\nThe new guidelines say people who don't have symptoms of Covid-19 don't need to be tested -- even if they think they were exposed. \"CDC is driving us all crazy,\" says Barry Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard. \"This just makes absolutely no sense.\"\n\nYou don't have to be a scientist to see this as bizarre, after mass fear of asymptomatic spread caused millions to be shut up in our homes last spring, and remains the impetus behind mask mandates and other restrictions that treat all of us as potentially contagious no matter how healthy we feel.\n\nThe change also comes at a time when the technology exists to start scaling up Covid-19 tests that are cheap, painless and quick. Massive-scale, regular testing was the way many experts envisioned a return to normal life after all the lockdowns. That way, the small fraction of people who actually have an active infection could be quarantined, and the rest could live with much more confidence and freedom in the long months it could take to achieve widespread immunity through a vaccine. While the public has been blamed for being too impatient to stay locked down longer, the real blame lies with those who didn't use the time we bought them to prepare a testing strategy and communicate it clearly.\n\nTake the new CDC guidelines. \"If you look at what they say, there are a bunch of weird contradictory guidelines,\" says Harvard epidemiology professor William Hanage. The CDC is saying they don't advise you to get a test, but you might be advised to get a test. It's left up to individuals to decide, he says.\n\nWorse still, the test technology we've employed is the wrong one to stem the infections. The technique, known as PCR, is accurate but takes too long to get results -- a few days at best and several weeks at worst.\n\nBy then, the results might be almost worthless for identifying clusters or contacts early enough to prevent future outbreaks. Those who are positive have already spread the disease to most of the people they were likely to give it to. \"It's all about speed and speed is one thing we don't spend enough time talking about,\" says Hanage.\n\nEven with the wait, though, experts say you should get tested if you were exposed to a known or suspected case -- whether or not you feel feel sick. And ideally, people who work in healthcare, nursing homes and prisons should be able to get routine testing.\n\nSpeeding up the process would undoubtedly make all of this much more helpful. And a number of existing tests can deliver results in minutes. They don't have to be sent to central labs to be processed but work more like home pregnancy tests. If those could become widely available, then many more people could be tested routinely, and even those without high-risk jobs could take an instant test before going to a restaurant or visiting friends and relatives.\n\nBloom says the advent of do-it-yourself testing will give the public a much-needed sense of control. Quicker test results can also help scientists understand how the disease is spreading. In Japan, Iceland and other countries with a more coherent testing strategy, contact tracing goes backwards as well as forwards. That is, if a person tests positive, public health workers would find out not just who they might have passed the disease to, but where they might have gotten it, and who else got it from the same source.\n\nThis is particularly likely to help contain Covid-19, says Hanage, because many cases don't transmit to anyone, but a few give it to many in so-called superspreading events. A recently released study he co-authored used genetic fingerprinting of the virus to examine the outbreak that happened at a meeting of Biogen executives in Boston in late February. They found evidence that this superspreading event seeded about a third of all cases seen across the state, including several hundred in a homeless shelter.\n\nMany of these cases could have been avoided had the outbreak been identified earlier. In Japan, he says, by working fast, a so-called cluster-busting approach has helped keep the disease levels low.\n\nThe big hurdle to getting faster testing is FDA approval. A number of small biotechnology companies have been given NIH grants to develop and scale up such tests, but some are not quite as accurate as the standard PCR test.\n\nOr at least that's the perception. PCR tests will give a positive result if people still carry traces of the genetic material of the virus long after infection, even if they are no longer capable of transmitting the virus to others. The quicker tests might be just as good at detecting people who are capable of seeding new clusters of disease -- people who are carrying active virus rather than just remnants or fragments.\n\nBut FDA rules won't allow approval of any test that's less sensitive than the current standard, even if, in a practical sense, it's a vast improvement. Those rules can be important for keeping bad drugs and diagnostics off the market, but in this case the criteria could be expanded as to what constitutes a superior test. With U.S. deaths crossing 180,000, a faster, less-accurate test might be just as valuable as a slower, more-accurate one. (One 15-minute test did demonstrate enough accuracy to be granted approval for emergency use - a $5 test kit developed by Abbott Laboratories. The U.S. government bought up most of the supply for $750 million.)\n\nIt's becoming clear that there will be no single savior, but we'll make progress against the pandemic through a combination of vaccines, better treatment, better understanding of how the disease spreads. Faster testing, though, has the potential to make the most dramatic improvement in the shortest time. The CDC should be doing all it can to encourage more and faster testing -- not standing in the way.",

        "body": "New York and New Jersey, the early hot spots of the U.S. coronavirus pandemic, are getting tough on parties, anti-maskers and out-of-town visitors that are raising the risk of a resurgence.\n\nIn New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy cut the indoor-gathering limit by 75%, to 25 people, after a spate of house parties led to almost 100 cases. The state's virus transmission rate, a key spread indicator, has jumped to the highest since early April.\n\nInspectors in New York issued 106 violations to restaurants and bars over the weekend for not following containment orders. Governor Andrew Cuomo said gatherings ignoring social-distancing rules -- including a party boat with 170 guests aboard cruising around Manhattan and a rave that drew hundreds beneath the Kosciuszko Bridge in Brooklyn -- will lead the virus to boomerang around the country.\n\nWhile the U.S. reported a rise in new cases of less than 1%, below the 1.4% average of the past week, states that suffered the most in March and April saw causes for alarm. They've joined Connecticut in requiring visitors from almost three dozen states deemed as trouble zones to self-quarantine, and are taking a cautious approach as the start of school nears.\n\n\"It's Florida, it's Texas, it's the Midwest, it's California, 'oh it's back to New Jersey' is on the rise, 'oh it's back to Massachusetts' is on the rise,\" Cuomo said Monday. \"It will continue, this ricocheting across the country, because that's what viruses do.\"\n\nIn Houston, Mayor Sylvester Turner told police to start issuing warnings and citations for anyone not wearing a mask.\n\n\"There are too many street parties, house parties, zydecos on the corners, backyard parties, and more happening in our city especially when individuals are not wearing masks,\" Turner said in a post on Twitter on Monday.\n\nGeorgia, one of the first states to reopen, had been a success story as cases didn't start rising as people ventured out more. But on Sunday, a state report showed 235 new infections per 100,000 people last week, while the national average is 137 per 100,000.\n\n\"Georgia continues to experience a high plateau of case incidence and saw an increase in testing positivity over the past week,\" according to the report.\n\nSome states reported positive indicators on Monday, though weekend delays can skew data. Arizona recorded 1,030 new cases, the lowest since late June, though its positivity rate -- the percentage of people tested who turn out to have the virus -- remains critically high at 12.9% statewide.\n\nIn California, Governor Gavin Newsom signaled the state may be turning a corner after a surge of infections in July, with the seven-day average for new cases falling 21% from last week. The average positivity rate over seven days has slipped to 6.1% from a peak of 8% late last month.\n\n\"It is encouraging,\" Newsom said at a briefing Monday. \"At the same time, we can quickly find ourselves back to where we were just a few weeks ago, a month ago, with significant increases, if we do not maintain our vigilance.\"\n\nAnother hot spot, Florida, reported a drop in its positivity rate to 9.1% Sunday, the lowest since late June. However, state-run testing sites were shut for several days as authorities prepared for the arrival of Hurricane Isaias.\n\nCoping with hurricanes during the pandemic will be a particular challenge, as the season hits new records for the number of named storms this early in the year. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis appeared with President Donald Trump on Friday at a briefing on the matter. He said that concern about the virus spreading in storm shelters that can't allow for social distancing could lead authorities at times to opt against evacuation orders in favor of sheltering in place.\n\nWhile Isaias had weakened as it hit Florida this weekend, winds are expected to increase in speed to a Category 1 hurricane. It's expected to make landfall in the Carolinas, where they have readied emergency shelters if evacuations are required. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said anyone fleeing the storm and coming to a shelter will be screened for Covid-19 symptoms, and anyone who tests positive will be sent to another location to be isolated and get treatment.\n\nSurge warnings have been issued through New York. Storm barriers and sandbags have been deployed, especially in the Wall Street area, to defend against rising water, with the worst of the rain and wind for that area expected Tuesday.\n\nThe U.S. surpassed 155,000 deaths and cases reached 4.69 million Monday. Together California, Florida, Texas and New York account for about 40% of cases nationwide.\n\nIf the numbers don't come down nationally, \"we're going to have a really bad situation in the fall,\" Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview online with the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n\"As you get indoors and you get the complication of influenza, that's something that we're going to have to deal with,\" Fauci said.\n\nDecisions on how to return students to school safely loom as well. In Pennsylvania, some schools may have to reconsider fall sports, Governor Tom Wolf said Monday. The state had peaked in early April with about 2,000 cases in one day. It dropped below 400 daily cases in June, then surpassed 1,000 multiple times in July.\n\nThe country's two largest school districts are New York City and Los Angeles, respectively. In New York, a decision will be made this week on whether classes will resume in person. The Los Angeles teachers union reached a deal with the district for virtual learning, allowing but not requiring teachers to work from their classrooms.\n\nBack in New Jersey, Murphy said all 1.37 million students in New Jersey will be required to wear masks, except if disability or health conditions make it impossible. He said it's crucial for the state's transmission rate to drop below 1, the indicator that the infection is spreading. While it's understandable for people to want to resume pre-pandemic activities and get out and socialize, it's not time yet, he said.\n\n\"There's this 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore'\" attitude after months of restrictions, he said. \"It's human nature, so as the clock has gone on, folks have begun a little bit to fall off the wagon.\"",

        "body": "South Bend, Ind. (AP) -- The University of Notre Dame on Tuesday canceled in-person undergraduate classes for two weeks after a spike of coronavirus cases that occurred since the semester began Aug. 10.\n\nUniversity president the Rev. John Jenkins said there have been 147 confirmed cases of coronavirus on campus since the start of classes for the university's approximately 12,000 students.\n\nJenkins said he decided against sending students home after consulting with the St. Joseph County Health Department. Instead, university officials decided steps could be taken short of closing the campus while still protecting students' health and safety.\n\nThe university is advising off-campus students not to visit the campus and on-campus students not to venture off-campus and is restricting student gatherings to 10 people or less. The university is allowing graduate student access to research laboratories and libraries. Athletic teams subject to surveillance testing can continue to gather for sanctioned activities, but will be closely monitored.\n\n\"The virus is a formidable foe,\" Jenkins said in announcing enhanced testing for students experiencing symptoms and surveillance testing for those without symptoms. \"For the past week, it has been winning. Let us as the Fighting Irish join together to contain it.\"\n\nAccording to Jenkins, the university has traced the spike in COVID-19 cases to off-campus gatherings where neither masks were worn nor physical distancing observed. He said students infected at those gatherings passed it on to others, who in turn passed the virus on to others, resulting in the positive cases, with all but one a student.\n\nJenkins asked students to help in identifying others who have been flagrantly violating safety protocols.\n\nThe action by Notre Dame follows the decision by officials of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to switch to remote learning starting Wednesday, and is making arrangements for students who want to leave campus housing. UNC officials said clusters of COVID-19 were discovered in dorms, a fraternity house and other student housing.\n\nCoronavirus outbreaks earlier this summer at fraternities in Washington state, California and Mississippi provided a glimpse of the challenges school officials face in keeping the virus from spreading on campuses where young people gather in close quarters.\n\nThe virus has been blamed for over 170,000 deaths and 5.4 million confirmed infections in the U.S.",

        "body": "Even though theaters are reopening, patrons won't line up until they feel safe.\n\nMovie theaters are starting to open their doors again, but they probably won't find many patrons lining up for tickets as Covid-19 fears continue to weigh on consumer decisions.\n\nOn Thursday, AMC Entertainment Inc. will reopen 170 of its theaters around the country, including in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Indianapolis, Miami, Nashville, Philadelphia and St. Louis. That's in addition to 115 other AMC cinemas that resumed operations last week. The company has a goal of getting two-thirds of its 600-theater circuit up and running in time for Warner Bros.' Sept. 3 release of \"Tenet,\" a spy film directed by Christopher Nolan that was originally scheduled to have its box-office premiere in mid-July. Regal, a subsidiary of London-based Cineworld Group Plc, and Cinemark Holdings Inc. are also reopening the majority of their U.S. theaters timed to the \"Tenet\" premiere.\n\nBringing back cinemas isn't just about being able to go see a movie again. Their reopening symbolizes a greater return to normalcy -- the ability to venture back out unafraid. But a sense that it's safe to do so and that the virus is under control needs to come first. In a Morning Consult poll of 2,200 U.S. adults conducted in early August, 74% said they were unlikely to visit a movie theater in the next month; 60% of respondents who are considered frequent moviegoers said the same. About a third prefer to stream \"Tenet\" from home, while 13% said they would be willing to pay for an at-home digital rental.\n\nMorning Consult also found that about half of its poll takers think Hollywood should delay all August and September theatrical releases. Of those, 54% said 2020 premieres should be postponed until next year. This is further evidence that virus fears themselves -- not just state orders curtailing certain activities -- are what's hurting American businesses and the economy. (Read my Bloomberg Opinion colleague Noah Smith's June column, \"Fear of Infection Hurt the Economy More Than Lockdowns.\")\n\nAMC got this wrong once before when it said initially that it wouldn't require theatergoers to wear masks when they returned. Chief Executive Officer Adam Aron said it was because the company didn't \"want to be drawn into a political controversy\" over masks. That thinking backfired because requiring face coverings not only makes customers safer, it makes them feel safer, raising the likelihood that they will venture back out to busy public destinations such as theaters. After the backlash, AMC reversed course and will require everyone to wear masks. The chain and its rivals have detailed other safety measures, such as limiting the number of tickets sold, blocking off seats, enhanced cleaning procedures and upgraded air filters. Regal's website also states that any ticket holder experiencing Covid-19 symptoms may request a refund online. Despite the industry's efforts, most consumers may not be ready just yet to sit back and relax in a cinema recliner.\n\nOther movie fans may consider some films worth it. For example, survey opinions were split over what to do with Walt Disney Co.'s \"Mulan,\" with almost as many people saying they'd prefer to see it in theaters as stream it on the Disney+ app. It's perhaps reflective of both the power of Disney's blockbuster films over the box office and the company's need to keep those ties strong even as it goes all in on streaming. Disney ultimately decided to make \"Mulan\" available Sept. 4 exclusively to Disney+ subscribers, who will have to pay a $30 viewing fee on top of the app's regular $7 monthly subscription price. (Comcast Corp.'s Universal has taken things further by cutting the time any of its movies remain exclusive at AMC to just 17 days.)\n\nApprehension about returning to theaters shows that just because businesses reopen doesn't mean customers will show up. Mitigating the virus is still the key to restoring the economy.",

        "body": "More than 100 generic drugs have the potential to help patients fight the coronavirus, but it will take a government push to do the right research.\n\nMost of the public discussion about regaining our health and our wealth in the Covid-19 era is centered on the need for a vaccine. But vaccine development is expensive and highly uncertain. While we wait, people are dying and costs are piling up. More attention must be given to developing drugs to treat those who become ill.\n\nAnalysis I have done with colleagues Susan Athey (economics of technology professor, Stanford Graduate School of Business), Richard Frank (professor of health economics, Harvard Medical School) and Jonathan Gruber (Ford professor of economics, MIT) suggests the repurposing of generic drugs that have already been proved safe and effective in treating other diseases is an important part of the solution, and there is an urgent need for government support. More than 100 generic drug candidates have been identified as having promise to treat the symptoms of Covid-19. Some are already being tested for their effectiveness. A focus on repurposing generic drugs would give researchers more shots on goal in the game of drug discovery, improving the odds that a winning treatment will emerge.\n\nGenerics offer many advantages: They can be easily produced without fear of violating intellectual property protections, they have established safety profiles and thus are more likely to receive approval from the Food and Drug Administration, and they can more rapidly come to market by skipping early stages of testing and going directly into phase 3 clinical trials. Repurposed generics also offer the possibility of a low price after development, increasing access among budget constrained payers and patients worldwide.\n\nThat is, however, an important barrier to developing repurposed generics for Covid-19: There's no money in it. Lack of patent protection evades innovators ability to charge much above the cost of production and distribution. Thus, many promising generic products remain unexplored because innovators view the revenue potential as small compared with the development costs and the risks.\n\nThen there's the challenge of identifying enough patients to successfully complete the requisite clinical trial to establish the drug's effectiveness. Teams evaluating drugs compete to recruit Covid-19 patients, and shortages of new patients eligible for tests are now emerging. This is in part because so much attention has been placed on hydroxychloroquine, despite very limited evidence supporting its effectiveness in treating Covid-19. Two hundred trials have been initiated investigating this drug's use with little coordination among them, using up the pool of available patients.\n\nThe federal government can take a powerful leadership role in repurposing off-patent drugs for Covid-19 and other pandemics. It can build on successful models that the U.S. government has used to develop drugs to fight past threats, including anthrax.\n\nGovernment involvement ensures domestic access to such treatment in the face of similar efforts by other nations; indeed, the U.K. government has already invested in generic drug repurposing in the Recovery Trial, leading to the use of the steroid dexamethasone to treat Covid-19 infections and setting off a race among government and medical providers to acquire enough of the low-cost steroid to treat patients worldwide.\n\nWe believe creation of a repurposed generic development program is essential. This program would build on an existing public agency infrastructure, but would rely principally on public-private partnerships with established academic laboratories, clinical development networks and drug manufacturers.\n\nIn the first phase, the program would fund studies aimed at identifying promising drug repurposing targets, paying prizes to innovators for successful candidates. In the second, the agency would coordinate clinical trials, playing a critical \"air traffic control\" function to ensure that the set of trial subjects are best allocated to test promising Covid-19 therapeutics. This might entail the use of trials that study many promising drug candidates all at once, leveraging the limited set of patients for maximum learning about drug safety and efficacy.\n\nFinally, the program would contract private companies to manufacture promising drug candidates, paying costs plus a premium to ensure sufficient capacity for the exploration of new uses without undercutting the adequacy of supply for existing uses. Critically, this manufacturing would begin during the trial process, ensuring timely availability and continued supply for those who need the generic to treat other diseases. The government could preference investments in American manufacturing capacity to ensure adequate national supply and allow local communities to capture the economics benefits of such investments.\n\nWe estimate the total cost per therapeutic successfully developed and produced from this effort would amount to $200 million; that's a small investment relative to the amounts the U.S. has already committed to novel vaccine development with much less probability of success and track record of safety.\n\nCovid-19 is an all-out attack on our lives and our economy. We need a proportionate all-in response. Generic drug repurposing should be part.",

        "body": "Re-emergence in dorms reflects difficulties to contain virus\n\nSingapore has found three new virus clusters in migrant worker dormitories previously declared cleared of the disease, reviving concerns over a source of infections that has challenged the city-state's strategy to contain Covid-19.\n\nThe Ministry of Health announced 49 new cases on Wednesday, of which 43 were people residing in the dormitories. Of the dormitory cases, 14 were contacts of earlier cases and already quarantined, with 29 detected through surveillance testing, it said.\n\nChangi Lodge II at 80 Tanah Merah Coast Road was linked to six cases, North Coast Lodge in Admiralty was tied to seven cases and two new patients from Toh Guan Dormitory at 19A Toh Guan Road East were linked to five previous cases, according to the ministry. These new clusters add to other clusters that have been identified in the dormitories, it said in a statement.\n\nDorms housing the low-paid foreign workers that underpin Singapore's construction and services sectors have made up the vast majority of the country's cases. An explosion in infections saw Singapore pivot to a more restrictive approach to the virus, imposing a lockdown in April that shuttered restaurants and offices and triggered a rethink of its testing strategy.\n\nThe re-emergence of clusters in the dorms -- where workers live in close quarters -- reflects the difficulties Singapore and other nations have experienced in stamping out the virus, which is highly contagious and can manifest with little or no symptoms.\n\nSingapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in a speech Wednesday that the country would have acted more aggressively and sooner on the migrant worker dormitories given what it knows now about the asymptomatic and infectious nature of the disease. He said that while authorities stepped up precautions it thought were adequate, bigger clusters broke out in the dorms that \"threatened to overwhelm us.\"\n\nRead More: Singapore's Lee Identifies Covid Missteps, Urges Vigilance\n\nThe persistent infections at the facilities come even after a concerted effort by authorities over months to clear them of the virus through aggressive testing and quarantines. On Aug. 19, the manpower ministry said all workers living in dormitories have either recovered or have been tested to be free from the virus.\n\nThe recurrence of infections in the dorms means that thousands of workers have had to be placed on stay-home notice again, while some work sites have had to pause their projects in order to disinfect areas and review safe management measures. As part of these measures, employers have to ensure that dorm workers as well as those in the construction sectors go for routine testing every 14 days, but implementation of this has been a challenge.\n\n\"Having people in closed, indoor environments that are very crowded and possibly unsanitary will always pose a risk of outbreaks,\" Raina MacIntyre, professor of global biosecurity at the University of New South Wales. \"It is not only the accumulation of respiratory aerosols in closed environments that poses a risk, but also shared toilets.\"\n\nShe said health officials need to enhance surveillance and testing at the sites, and provide more space, better ventilation and fewer people per toilet.\n\nAmong the new clusters discovered, Toh Guan had been declared cleared of Covid-19 on Aug. 8 by the health ministry, CNA reported, noting that it had more than 1,300 cases before that time. CNA said Changi Lodge II had been declared cleared in July after having more than 500 cases, and North Coast Lodge had more than 650 cases before it was declared cleared last month.\n\nMeanwhile, the ministry also said 142 patients were discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing the total recovered to 55,891. The city-state has 75 confirmed cases in hospitals, with none in intensive care units, and 867 at community isolation facilities.",

We must learn from these errors, and do better the next time. But in the fog of war, it is not possible always to make\" the right decisions, he said.\n\nSingapore, which was lauded globally for its efforts to contain the outbreak in its early days, had a major setback when infections spread among its migrant worker community housed in close living quarters. The country ramped up its virus response, made masks mandatory, imposed a two-month partial lockdown, and now has among Southeast Asia's highest reported rates of testing. The number of cases in the city-state's wider community remains relatively small, and have been declining, while fatalities are low.\n\nSingapore has built up contact tracing and testing capabilities and can do about 20,000 laboratory tests a day today, Lee said. With pooled testing, it can test several times that number of persons, he added.\n\nSingapore has also more than doubled its intensive care capacity and set up temporary community care and isolation facilities for patients with mild symptoms, creating more beds than all its acute hospitals put together, he said.\n\nLee also warned against the strategy of allowing the virus to spread in the population to achieve herd immunity, and urged vigilance amid calls for a relaxation of social distancing measures as people grow weary of the prolonged rules.\n\n\"The COVID-19 virus remains as infectious and potent as it was before,\" Lee said. \"If we relax these measures now because the numbers have come down, we will have a resurgence.\"",

        "body": "A large proportion of U.K. health-care workers may have been infected with coronavirus early in the pandemic, according to a survey suggesting that loss of smell and taste may be a guide to determining its prevalence in populations.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the London National Health Service staffers surveyed reported diminished ability to taste or smell -- one of the prominent, early symptoms of Covid-19 -- just weeks after the coronavirus arrived in the U.K., according to research published Thursday in The Lancet Microbe journal.\n\nHealth-care professionals on the front lines are far more likely to contract the virus compared with individuals in the general community, earlier studies have found. Yet it's unclear how many NHS staff have contracted the virus as testing has been limited. The high rate of the loss of smell, called anosmia, suggests that a larger proportion may have been infected than previously thought.\n\n\"Some people get smell loss before other symptoms, or as the only symptom,\" of Covid, said Carl Philpott, professor of rhinology at the University of East Anglia's Norwich Medical School, in an interview. \"It has a sudden onset, so people really notice the difference.\"\n\nRead More: Have Coronavirus and Can't Smell? Harvard Scientists Explain Why\n\nAnosmia should be used more frequently to identify Covid-19 outbreaks and patients, Philpott said. Data from coronavirus tracking apps has shown that smell loss and fatigue are more likely to occur than cough and fever in patients, he said.\n\nPhilpott said he's collected more data showing that anosmia was widespread among health workers in other U.K. regions, including including Norfolk and the North West. Greater recognition of the early symptom might allow more infected people to be isolated early on, rather than spreading the virus unaware of their status, he said.\n\nPeople who experience the symptom also risk longer term sensation deficits, he said.\n\n\"We think about 60% of people with coronavirus are experiencing smell loss and 10-15% of those have permanent smell loss that doesn't resolve in 3-4 weeks,\" he said. \"These are unprecedented numbers.\n\nThe survey was completed by 242 health workers in the week ending April 23, before the U.K. officially added smell loss to Covid's symptoms on May 17.",

Authorities are still finding infections among travelers arriving at the tourist hotspot's borders, but these people are quarantined and only allowed into the community after they're recovered.\n\nLike Taiwan and New Zealand, another country that made it past 100 days before local infections re-emerged, Thailand's success has relied on strictly-policed borders that have been closed to foreigners for months. The strategy has come at great cost to Thailand, with its iconic beaches and cultural sites making it one of the most tourism-reliant economies in the world.\n\nThat makes the milestone a bittersweet one for the country, coming amid growing pressure from business to re-open the borders to save the ailing tourism sector, which accounted for 20% of Thailand's pre-pandemic economy. The government has in principle agreed to open to tourists again ahead of the northern hemisphere winter, but is yet to release many details about how it will do so safely.\n\n\"We contained the virus, and now is really the time to focus on the economy -- the longer we close the borders, the more damage it will have,\" said Somprawin Manprasert, chief economist at Bank of Ayudhya Pcl in Bangkok. \"Without proper policies, the exit of some businesses and workforces could cut the country's long term growth by 0.5% each year, which is significant for a country that's also rapidly aging.\"\n\nThailand's dilemma illustrates the difficult balance governments across the world are trying to strike between public health and economic survival. While many countries quickly shut down to curb the virus's spread earlier this year, the economic fallout soon became too much to bear, and places from the U.S. to India pushed to re-open despite the virus continuing to run rampant, fueling new spikes of infection.\n\nOther tourist-reliant economies like Aruba in the Caribbean have seen a resurgence of cases after allowing travelers back in, and European countries are bracing for new waves seeded during the recent summer vacation period.\n\nThai officials remain wary of a possible resurgence of infection like in New Zealand and Vietnam, two other countries which had appeared to eliminate local transmission only to see unexplained flareups later on.\n\nNew Zealand, which went without a case of transmission within the community for 102 days, had to impose a lockdown in Auckland last month to contain a fresh outbreak in its largest city, while Vietnam saw deaths grow from zero to 30 in a month after a resurgence in the coastal area of Danang.\n\nRead more on the virus' insidious ability to hide.\n\nThailand's 100-day feat is all the more impressive given that it was the first country outside China to detect the coronavirus, on Jan. 13. The country has so far reported 3,425 cases and 58 fatalities, with only 93 patients still being treated in hospitals.\n\nThe government imposed a national lockdown in March but has since relaxed some restrictions to allow businesses to re-open. The country's track record has been maintained by compliance with mask-wearing and an army of health volunteers who act as village gatekeepers. Universal health coverage -- and a strong medical system by developing country standards -- also encourages people with symptoms to come forward for testing and treatment.\n\nAlthough the local population is being encouraged to travel domestically and spend, the activity can't compensate for the loss of income from international tourists. In 2019, Thailand received nearly 40 million foreign visitors, but so far this year less than 7 million have entered the country.\n\nThailand's other economic pillar besides tourism -- manufacturing -- has also been battered by a global slump in demand amid the pandemic, and the country faces one of the worst outlooks among emerging economies in Asia. The Finance Ministry forecasts Thailand's economy will shrink by 8.5% this year, heading for its worst contraction on record.",

Tan on what it will take to end the pandemic.\n\nThis is one of a series of interviews by Bloomberg Opinion columnists on how to solve today's most pressing policy challenges.\n\nMax Nisen: The U.S. is going to have to vaccinate hundreds of millions of people in a short amount of time to bring Covid-19 under control. Various logistical and political challenges complicate that goal. The virus response hasn't been the best advertisement for America's public-health infrastructure. Does the country have to start from scratch, or are there existing systems the U.S. can rely on?\n\nDr. L.J. Tan, Chief Strategy Officer of the Immunization Action Coalition: When H1N1 hit in 2009, we already had a very strong pediatric infrastructure because of Vaccines for Children, the public-private sector partnership to administer vaccines. Our coverage rate in peds is over 95%. The problem is that the adult infrastructure was not in place.\n\nWe hadn't really done as well at vaccinating adults, and that's not to say we're doing well now. But the private sector, which is where adult immunizations reside, is actually much more cognizant of the importance of adult vaccines as a result of the last 10 years of effort.\n\nMany health systems have implemented infrastructure to give access to adult vaccines. Some of those are things we've talked about for Covid-19, like facilitating vaccinations at alternative locations, using pharmacists, drive-through clinics, no appointment necessary walk-in clinics, occupational health. These are things that were really not looked at 15 years ago but are now becoming commonplace because of the innovations of these systems.\n\nSometimes when we're reacting to a crisis we can become a little short-sighted. There is an existing infrastructure that can get vaccines all across the lifespan to the U.S. population. It's stronger in pediatrics, weaker for adults, but it is an infrastructure that we should not have to reinvent.\n\nMN: How do you prioritize what's likely to be a limited early supply of vaccine? And after that, how do you avoid the racial and economic disparities that have plagued the Covid response?\n\nLT: We asked almost exactly the same question for H1N1 and during our flu pandemic planning in the mid-2000s. Flu has similar vulnerable populations as Covid-19. In our entire seasonal flu efforts, we have had racial disparities in getting people vaccinated.\n\nWith Covid-19, we've seen that we have problems with access to health care. But it's not as if we weren't previously aware of those kinds of problems.\n\nFor pandemic planning [during the H1N1 outbreak], we had a large working group of experts from both the National Vaccine Advisory Committee and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meet very regularly to come up with a priority list for vaccination. It had five tiers. The first tier was health-care workers. We then had the elderly as the next camp, over children. When we went to do a couple of quick focus groups, it became very clear that the elderly, the grandparents, were not going to take the vaccine ahead of their grandchildren. And so, as a result of that feedback, the priority populations were flipped. Children went up because we have to recognize that there's an ethical and social component to consider.\n\nSecond, access. It's a great question and one that we've dealt with for many years. We are very aware that we have multiple factors that impact access to not just vaccines, but health care in general. Covid-19, because of the way it came in and the fact that we didn't know how to react, exposed a lot of those existing problems of access and health equity.\n\nWe need to be very cognizant of how social determinants are going to impact access. You've heard of things called food deserts? We need to make sure we don't have vaccine deserts. We need to ensure we are getting a Covid-19 vaccine to locations that are accessible to minority populations and disparate, underprivileged populations. We need to make sure that we're considering that all in our distribution plan.\n\nMN: What do you worry might get in the way of a successful Covid vaccination effort?\n\nLT: I always worry, What if you build a vaccine and they don't come? Even with H1N1, we had some policy missteps, and the reason for that was because of the timing of the pandemic and the arrival of the vaccine after the peak. And so a lot of people said, \"Well, you know, why should I use the vaccine?\" There were some negative repercussions on safety because one of the vaccines that was used in Europe actually induced narcolepsy. That kind of tainted that process a little bit.\n\nWith Covid-19, timing for the vaccine isn't going to be the issue. But we do have a small but very vocal anti-vaccine coalition out there. And I worry that they're going to be able to manipulate the narrative against a Covid-19 vaccine. They've aligned themselves with the political nature of some of the ways we're dealing with Covid-19, which is troubling. The idea of mandatory mask-wearing, and how you have anti-mask people saying its personal autonomy, it's my rights, you can't make me wear masks, etc. -- well, that coincides very nicely with what the anti-vaccine people say: \"It's my body. It's my rights. You can't make me take a vaccine.\"\n\nSo I worry that when there is a vaccine, people are just going to get inundated with some of this negative information and they may not show up.\n\nThe other thing I worry about is reaching high-risk populations. For example, we know that if you've had chronic heart disease and you get influenza you have an eight-fold higher risk of heart attack, yet we don't vaccinate people with cardiovascular disease with the flu vaccine the way we should. We need to figure out how to reach these populations we have not been good at getting to in the past.\n\nMN: How do we overcome people's hesitancy about getting the vaccine?\n\nLT: If we do a really good job with the transparency of our communication of what we do know and don't know, I think it's going to defuse a lot of the hesitancy.\n\nAs I keep telling people, the way out of the pandemic is a vaccine. You've got to get to herd immunity, and if you look at the prevalence rates across the world, we're a long way from there. In order to get out of it, we need to get through it. Getting through means all the things we're already doing, social distancing, washing your hands, sanitizing your hands, wearing a mask, all of that. I think there's a lot of demand for that vaccine to get us out of it, because the getting through part is really, really hard.\n\nWe're not dealing with vaccine technology that's never been done before, despite what anti-vaccine people would like to tell us. Even the mRNA technology, even the adenovirus technology, while they've never been used to produce a licensed vaccine, they have been used to create vaccines. There's a wealth of research and development between those vaccines and those platforms. So we need to make sure that we can tell that to the public in a very good and transparent way.\n\nWe also need to reassure the public that the United States has one of the best, if not the best, vaccine-safety surveillance systems in the world. We have a system that's been in place for 20-plus years. There's VAERS, the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting system and VSD, the Vaccine Safety Datalink, all of these surveillance and testing mechanisms out there to look at vaccine safety. So we have this incredible surveillance system to take over once the vaccine gets approved. I think we need to make sure the public is aware of that.\n\nThe final point is that we need to be very clear about what we don't know. Something we're going to continue to look at is long-term vaccine effectiveness, because obviously we're not going to have 10, 15, 20 years of clinical-trial data. We need to be very clear about all of this and to be upfront so that the public is reassured that this vaccine is safe and effective and will continue to be safe and effective.\n\nMN: The people who will be doing the vaccinating are an underrated part of the process. How do we support them?\n\nLT: The providers first need to feel assured that the vaccine is safe and effective. It can be a flyer, a tip sheet, it can be the data itself, whatever comes out of the clinical trials and ultimately is used by the Food and Drug Administration for approval. As advocates we need to make sure that our providers have that in the back of their heads so that they can be really positive about vaccination, because their recommendations will be critical for getting vaccines into the arms of the public.\n\nWe also need to make sure that the providers are aware of the administrative work that has been done so that they will get paid. Granted, the vaccine itself is free, but there is cost incurred for giving the vaccine. We need to assure the providers that's been taken care of and they will get paid.\n\nThe third thing is we need to be sure target populations know who the providers are. There will be populations that will be targeted for prioritization at different levels. We should not leave it to the provider to have to sort too much of that out. The provider should feel very comfortable not having to convince people. If we educate the public well, the provider should be able to just give the vaccine. There shouldn't be a lot of conversation back and forth between the patient and provider. If we're going to vaccinate about 300 million people, we had better be able to do it rapidly.\n\nMN: How did you end up focusing on public health and vaccines specifically?\n\nLT: My journey is probably different from many. I'm a basic scientist by training, a microbiologist. That's what my Ph.D. is in. I love basic research, and I understand immunology. But I ended up leaving basic research at Northwestern University Medical School to join the American Medical Association because I have a strong interest in policy as well. And at the AMA, I was given the opportunity to actually do translational science, to take basic research and convert it to clinical knowledge that could be used to guide policy.\n\nMN: It's sort of a strange moment to be a public-health professional. This is what your profession was made for, yet the public-health response to Covid in the U.S. has been rocky, to say the least. What can we do next time around to make sure the response is smoother?\n\nLT: I have colleagues who have been in the field of public health and epidemiology and preparedness even longer than I have. And they're grieving because you are right. They say, you know, we trained and practiced and prepared ourselves for 30 to 40 years in our careers for exactly this moment, right? And instead of shining and being allowed to shine, they're not. They've neither shone, nor been allowed to shine. I think this is hopefully going to be the subject of a huge retrospective examination so that we are prepared for future pandemics.\n\nI think national leadership is required for pandemic preparedness. In 2009, with H1N1 we had a national agency in the Centers for Disease Control that was able, for whatever reasons, to lead. I remember [deputy CDC director] Dr. Anne Schuchat -- I think she's just an awesome spokesperson -- in front of the TV and cameras every day giving briefings. I remember when the anthrax attacks happened back in 2001 and Dr. Julie Gerberding was at the CDC at that point and calmly, patiently went up in front of the media to lead the public-health response to anthrax. I think that's what we did not have this time around.\n\nMN: One somewhat unique aspect of Covid is the sheer breadth of possible outcomes. It's really bad for a lot of people and causes no symptoms in others. How might that affect vaccination efforts?\n\nLT: One of the things that I would say very clearly is that there's a lot more to discover about Covid-19. Why gamble, right? I just think it doesn't make sense to say, \"Well, I'm not in one of those currently identified high-risk groups, I'm not going to get vaccinated.\" For example, in H1N1 we found out that obesity was a high risk for mortality and morbidity, and that was actually added into the risk conditions later on.\n\nWe're still an altruistic society, and this is an incredibly contagious virus. This is the other difference, right? The way this thing has continued to spread, it's been remarkable. Vaccination will help us reduce that transmission rate. And that means protecting your friends, protecting your family, protecting your community. That's something that we can do with this vaccine.\n\nI think that's something we need to keep working on, to help people understand that that it's not just about themselves, just like social distancing is not just about yourself. It's about protecting the community around you as well. I think we need to reignite that American altruism that we're famous for. Hopefully that will overcome any political tribalism that we'e seeing.\n\nMN: So what's the bottom line? What are the most important things we need to do to get to the other side of the pandemic and do better next time?\n\nLT: Elevation of evidence and science in decision making.\n\nNational leadership by public-health authorities is required.\n\nWe need to get through it to get out of it. In order to get through it, we need to do all the things we've been doing for the last six months. It's social distancing, masking, immaculate hand hygiene, don't touch your face. Take whatever we've learned and built and sustain it.",

        "body": "A consensus is emerging on how deadly the coronavirus really is. But comparing it with past influenza pandemics turns out to be harder than it looks.\n\nAfter much back and forth in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, a consensus is emerging that the overall risk of dying for those infected with the disease -- at least so far, in a population with an age distribution roughly similar to that of the U.S. or Europe -- is about 6 or 7 in 1,000. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention upwardly revised its \"best estimate\" of the fatality rate in July to 0.65% from 0.26%. An occasionally updated \"meta-analysis\" by Australian researchers Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz and Lea Merone of all relevant studies on the disease has it at 0.68%.\n\nThis isn't much below the approximately 1% estimated in a Feb. 10 study by the Covid-19 disease-modeling group at Imperial College London, which was adopted as a provisional consensus by many in the epidemiology and public health communities. It's also within the range of 0.05% to 1% proposed in a March 17 op-ed article by Stanford Medical School professor John Ioannidis, although at the time the skeptical Ioannidis intimated that the true fatality rate was likely to come out toward the low end.\n\nIoannidis has his own running meta-analysis, based only on studies of the prevalence of coronavirus antibodies, that puts the median fatality rate at 0.24% but acknowledges that in the areas hardest-hit by Covid-19 it's 0.9%. For a variety of reasons, fatality-rate estimates from places with high Covid-19 prevalence are more likely to be accurate than those from places with low prevalence, plus if you're trying to estimate a population-wide fatality rate then areas where the disease is widespread ought to weigh more heavily than those where it isn't, so this doesn't seem incompatible with an overall rate of 0.6% or 0.7%.\n\nThe varying results from different antibody studies do suggest that the disease may be less deadly where it is less prevalent -- because health-care systems aren't overburdened, and possibly because viral loads are lower -- which seems like an important factor in deciding whether interventions to slow the spread of the disease are worth the effort. Improved medical techniques and treatments also appear to be reducing the severity of the disease, which could cut the fatality rate over time while also increasing the rewards to delaying tactics.\n\nSome of these delaying tactics have of course come at huge economic cost, raising questions about whether the dangers posed by Covid-19 really merited such a drastic response. I am not here to offer entirely satisfactory answers to those questions! But I thought it might be useful to take a closer look at how Covid-19's risks stack up against those posed by the most comparable menace, influenza -- both the seasonal variety and the occasional global pandemics. And though I realize that catching an infectious disease brings lots of other risks short of death, fatality rates do seem like the best metric for comparison available at the moment.\n\nAssigning an infection fatality rate to influenza turns out to be harder than one might think. That's partly because there are multiple varieties of influenza, but also because until quite recently the terms \"infection fatality rate\" or \"infection fatality risk\" weren't really a thing (in a search of the National Institutes of Health's PubMed database of medical articles I found no uses of the former from before 2020 and only three of the latter). Instead researchers calculated what they usually called a \"case fatality rate,\" which in scientific articles I've perused has described:\n\nThat's confusing, right? To be sure, definition No. 3 seems to be the most commonly used, and for many diseases it's roughly equivalent to No. 4 because almost all infections result in symptoms. But as you've surely heard, a high percentage of infections with the new coronavirus -- probably around 40% to 45% -- don't ever cause significant symptoms. Influenza infections are if anything even more likely to be asymptomatic. One meta-analysis found that 65% to 85% may be; 50% to 75% is another frequently cited range.\n\nWhen I first went looking in early March for a rough estimate of seasonal influenza's case fatality rate, 0.1% was what I most often encountered. This appears to be according to definition No. 3: If you divide the CDC's estimates of deaths from influenza by its estimates of symptomatic cases over the past nine flu seasons, the resulting fatality rates range from 0.1% in 2018-2019 to 0.18% in 2010-2011, and average out to 0.13%.\n\nTo compare influenza fatality rates with the Covid-19 infection fatality rate, though, one really needs to factor in those asymptomatic infections. A while back, University of Oxford infectious disease epidemiologist Christophe Fraser suggested on Twitter that doing so with seasonal influenza would deliver an infection fatality rate of about 0.04%. When I ran this estimate by influenza expert Lone Simonsen, a professor at Roskilde University in Denmark who used to work at the CDC and NIH, she endorsed it. One can also just take the 0.13% symptomatic-case fatality rate from the CDC and the low-end estimate that 50% of infections are asymptomatic and conservatively calculate an infection fatality rate of 0.065% -- exactly one-tenth what the CDC currently estimates for Covid-19.\n\nThat's a tidy little result. Perhaps too tidy, given that seasonal influenza does appear to pose a greater danger to infants and toddlers than Covid-19 does. Only 25 Americans age 4 and younger have died from Covid-19, according to the CDC, while in most recent flu seasons the estimated fatalities for that age group have been in the low hundreds. Apart from that, though, the risk profile by age is quite similar for seasonal flu and Covid-19, with those 65 and older accounting for about 80% of U.S. deaths from both. Maybe Covid-19 isn't exactly 10 times more dangerous than seasonal influenza, but it's probably in that ballpark.\n\nThis may seem hard to square with the CDC's tally of 61,000 fatalities in the worst recent U.S. flu season, that of 2017-2018 -- more than one-third of the 158,268 deaths attributed so far to Covid-19. Part of the explanation is of course that Covid-19 isn't done with us yet. The CDC estimates that there were 45 million symptomatic influenza cases in the U.S. in 2017-2018, which if 50% of infections were asymptomatic would mean that 90 million Americans, or 28% of the population, were infected. Data scientist Youyang Gu's handy infections tracker, which is based mostly on mortality data, estimates that just 9.2% of Americans had been infected with Covid-19 as of July 15.\n\nA bigger issue may be that the CDC's annual influenza numbers are statistical-model-based estimates that include \"influenza-like\" respiratory illnesses and deaths for which influenza was just one of multiple causes, while the Covid-19 numbers are based on an actual count of deaths attributed to the disease by state authorities (although of course other underlying causes are often involved as well). Harvard and Emory medical school professors Jeremy Samuel Faust and Carlos del Rio suggested in May that a better comparison would be with the number of influenza deaths counted in the CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network reports, which have ranged from 3,448 to 15,620 in recent years. In the CDC's \"underlying cause of death\" data based on death certificates, the highest influenza fatality total in the past two decades was 11,164 in 2018.\n\nAnother approach is simply to look at the overall number of weekly deaths and compare them with expectations based on past years' data. According to the CDC there were 28,200 excess deaths over the course of the 2017-2018 flu season, and since late March of this year there have been an estimated 191,011. That's almost seven times more and, again, the coronavirus isn't done yet. Saying it's roughly 10 times deadlier than the seasonal flu does not seem to be a great exaggeration. It may prove to be an understatement.\n\nInfluenza pandemics are another matter. They occur when a strain of influenza to which most people have never been exposed, and for which vaccines are not immediately available, sweeps the world. Those 65 and older are often less affected by these pandemics than younger cohorts, possibly because they were exposed to similar influenza strains in their youth. During the 2009-2010 H1N1 pandemic, for example, about 80% of the deaths were among those under 65. But only an estimated 12,469 Americans died of the disease. Its overall case fatality rate was a very low 0.02% and the infection fatality rate surely lower than that, so there's really no comparison between it and Covid-19.\n\nThe pandemic influenza strains of 1968, 1957-1958 and 1918 were much more dangerous. 1 It's tough to sort out the infection fatality rates from the case fatality rates in the literature, but there were antibody surveys conducted during and after the 1968 and 1957-1958 pandemics, and World Health Organization fatality-rate estimates of a bit under 0.2% for both seem to take at least some asymptomatic infections into account. There was no antibody testing in 1918 (the influenza virus wasn't identified till 1933), but a 2011 paper co-authored by the aforementioned Christophe Fraser concluded on the basis of transmission patterns that there were few asymptomatic infections, meaning that the case fatality rate, usually estimated between 2% and 3%, may represent something close to the infection fatality rate. Another way of measuring is just to count estimated U.S. deaths from the three pandemics, which were, going back in time from 1968, 100,000, 116,000 and 675,000. As a share of the population, that's equivalent to 164,000, 221,000 and 2.1 million deaths today.\n\nA fuller comparison would adjust for changes in the age distribution of the population. U.S. Army epidemiologist John F. Brundage did that a few years ago and concluded that an influenza strain with a virulence equivalent to 1918's would have killed 1.3 million people in the U.S. in 2006, far less than a straight share-of-population calculation would predict. In his accounting, the aging of the U.S. had lessened the risk from a disease with mortality rates that were highest for infants and those in their 60s and 70s, but also quite high for young adults. Advances in medicine since 1918 surely would reduce the modern toll as well. Then again, a disease with the age profile of Covid-19 might have proved less deadly for the far-younger U.S. populace of 1918 than it is for us now.\n\nNo matter what adjustments one makes, Covid-19 appears to be markedly less dangerous than the 1918 influenza, especially when you factor in that the latter wasn't nearly as deadly in the U.S. as in some other countries. On the other hand, the current pandemic seems certain to pass 1968's in population-adjusted U.S. fatalities -- it probably already has, if you go by the excess mortality data -- and quite likely to pass that of 1957-1958. If the coronavirus were to infect circa 30% of Americans, as those two are estimated to have done, at current fatality rates it would cause almost four times as many deaths (adjusted for population) as the 1968 pandemic and almost three times as many as 1957-1958. And because it is more infectious than influenza, Covid-19 might not stop at 30% in the absence of control measures. In one hard-hit area of Peru a recent antibody survey found that 71% of those tested had been infected; some neighborhoods of New York City may have infection rates nearly that high.\n\nAgain, such comparisons are complicated by medical advances, changing demographics and the differing age profiles of the diseases. A 2016 study of excess mortality from the 1957-1958 pandemic, co-authored by the aforementioned Lone Simonsen, found that 44.1% of the excess deaths across 39 countries were among those 4 and younger, versus 32.5% among those 65 and older. There were, to be sure, a lot of small children in those days (11.3% of the U.S. population was 4 or younger, versus 6% now) and a lot fewer 65-plussers (8.9% then versus 16.5% now). Still, even in the absence of a quality-adjusted-life-years comparison that reflects the greater cost inherent in the loss of younger people's lives, I think it's fair to say that the 1957-1958 pandemic merits being at least mentioned in the same breath as Covid-19.\n\nYet the reaction to it was nothing like that we've seen this year. There were school closures, but they were far from universal. There was also a sharp if short recession, with the percentage drop in U.S. real gross domestic product in the first quarter of 1958 the biggest on record until the second quarter of this year, but only a few contemporary observers appear to have attributed it to the pandemic.\n\nSo why did life temporarily grind to a halt in much of the world for Covid-19 when it did not for a new strain of H2N2 influenza in 1957? One possibility is that public health officials, political leaders, the news media and many others have overreacted this time around. Another is that they underreacted in 1957 and 1958. Also, the U.S. and most of the rest of the world are much healthier and wealthier than they were in the 1950s and 1960s, meaning that a threat such as Covid-19 stands out more than it would have then, and that the resources available to fight it are greater. Again, I don't think comparisons like those I've offered here tell us what the correct pandemic policies are. But they do at least help us better understand how Covid-19 stacks up, which is to say that it's definitely the worst such pandemic to come along in 60 years and probably the worst in a century.",

Me and my mom rushed him to the hospital. It turned out once we got there that at some point that night he had been having a heart attack.\" While large-scale studies have failed to find a benefit from the drug in treating the coronavirus, it has been associated with elevated heart risks. As night turned to day, Grant sat in the parking lot, Googling the survival odds for his father, who was in surgery.\n\nThe Hall family lived from phone call to phone call over the next few weeks as Stuart remained on a ventilator. \"That was the same period in which Trump said he'd been taking hydroxychloroquine for weeks, that it was a wonder drug,\" Grant says. \"We knew how many other people could potentially be in our shoes, and to have our leader promoting bad science was really maddening.\"\n\nStuart has since returned home to his loved ones, and his health is improving each day with physical therapy. But Grant remains frustrated that science has been overpowered by politics. Come November, the 25-year-old is going to make his vote count. \"It's easy not to care until it personally affects you,\" Grant says. \"If it hasn't hit close enough to home yet, look no further than my own.\" -- Riley Griffin\n\nIndia is on course to surpass Brazil in infections and is fast becoming the new virus epicenter.

        "body": "As bars, clubs and music venues emerge as high-risk sites for Covid-19 outbreaks, a team of experts has developed a playbook for nightlife survival.\n\nIn March, just days before the city locked down, three young people in Berlin began experiencing symptoms and tested positive for Covid-19. All three had been partying at the nightclub Kater Blau. Could they, doctors wondered, have infected other people during the same evening?\n\nThe answer was a resounding yes. One clubber, called Sina by the newspaper Welt Am Sonntag that investigated the outbreak, estimated that she had hugged and kissed at least 50 people during her visit to the club. She had talked very loudly, in very close quarters, to many others, trying to be heard over the booming sound system. Within just a few days, the three clubbers diagnosed with Covid-19 had been in close contact with over 1,000 people, likely making them unwitting super-spreaders. It's unknown how many of those clubgoers ended up contracting the disease, but the potential toll is high indeed. A single person infected with coronavirus who visited Berlin's Trompete nightclub earlier in March ended up infecting 17 others in a single evening.\n\nSince then, it's become clear that such outbreaks were no outliers. In Japanese karaoke haunts, Zurich nightclubs and Florida beach bars, the indoor places where people gather to drink, dance and listen to music have emerged as major super-spreader risks. South Korean public health officials traced more than 100 cases to a single infected Seoul pubcrawler who hit five nightspots over two days. In communities that appeared to be successfully controlling the spread of the virus, reopened nightspots appear to be fueling fresh outbreaks.\n\nSo should all bars and clubs simply close until we have a vaccine or cure? A blanket ban on all nightlife activities would be economically devastating, impossible to police and socially harmful, says a new report from the nightlife consultancy VibeLab. Co-created with an international panel of night mayors, academics and music promoters, the report recommends that urban nightlife must very carefully move outdoors, and lays out a set of principles for doing that. The advice reflects what's been learned over a period in which food and drink service in cities around the globe has set up shop outside, often claiming street and sidewalk space from other uses -- an ad-hoc solution that hasn't always succeeded.\n\nThe VibeLab report is just the first installment of the group's overarching Global Nighttime Recovery Plan, due in September. Future installments will focus on a host of pandemic-fueled problems, including finding financial supports for workers and owners of venues that can't reopen and what the future of dance and live music clubs might look like. Its goal is not just to save a threatened part of cities' cultural and economic life, but to make some longer-term improvements in relations between nightlife businesses and citizens, and how public spaces are managed and monitored. It would be wrong, the report suggests, to see the pandemic as a unique and unprecedented emergency: The night economy faced a grave threat even before the coronavirus arrived.\n\nIn many cities, the nightlife sector has long been operating under difficult circumstances. Over the past decade, rising rents and changing urban demographics have forced nightclubs and bars to close, pressured by protests from affluent new residents in the ex-industrial areas where many are located and unsympathetic official attitudes that perceive any nocturnal activity primarily as a nuisance. That resistance has helped spread the night mayor concept -- in which nightlife advocates for specific cities act as intermediaries between authorities and businesses to help shape policy. In places like Amsterdam (a leader in developing the role), London and New York, night mayors have helped to improve communication and provide some solutions aimed at making nightclubs better community members.\n\nThe pandemic has just intensified this plight, but it has also made cities more aware of both the economic and social contributions of their bar and club scenes. Berlin's nightlife tourists, for example, earned the city \u20ac1.5 billion in 2018. With this sector of the economy currently all but shut down, even conservative media voices fret about the future. \"The night-time economy was the consumer society at its most extravagant and seductive, but also at its most vulnerable, and now it's gone,\" wrote Nick Cohen of the U.K.'s right-leaning Spectator. In a May column, he prescribed an uncharacteristically progressive-sounding set of urban reforms aimed at rescuing London's scene, including establishing car-free districts to allow clubs to set up outdoors: \"If you want to save the businesses, you have to ban the cars and free the space.\"\n\nOne thing is clear: Without a vaccine, indoor nightclubs cannot safely return to anything like the conditions they operated under before the pandemic. With limited ventilation, packed crowds, and de rigueur shouting, bars and clubs might represent the best aerosol-dispensing environment an airborne virus could hope to encounter.\n\nThere have been some tentative attempts to make these conditions safer. Clubs that have reopened with social distancing usually report somewhat dismal results; one experiment in Germany, ultimately blocked by local authorities, wanted to stage a distance-free party for attendees who had passed a specially arranged coronavirus test that morning. Many in the industry feel that trying to fully reopen before the virus is contained simply isn't viable -- and could do more harm than good.\n\nBerlin's Club Commission, possibly the world's most influential city nightlife advocacy group, is in fact advocating for clubs to stay closed. \"We just can't create totally safe conditions without diluting the meaning and value of what the city's night scene actually offers,\" says Lutz Leichsenring, a spokesperson for the commission and VibeLab co-founder. This attitude isn't just purism: As Leichsenring notes, if nightclubs reopen without being able to offer an experience clubbers genuinely enjoy, they are likely to go out of business fast.\n\nThe problem is that urban nightlife -- no matter how risky -- isn't something that just allows itself to be canceled. The need to socialize, relax, mingle, hear music and dance is a powerful force, especially among young people in cities. If regulated venues are shuttered, unregulated ones take their place. \"In cities where there are no legal alternatives,\" the VibeLab report concludes, \"dangerous illegal alternatives are found.\"\n\nIndeed, that's what's already happening. In the U.K, for example, the outdoor rave scene has already revived and proved impossible to police, with 4,000 people gathering for a rave outside Manchester in June. Illegal indoor events have also mushroomed, operating by social-media-driven word-of-mouth. On a less spectacular, more organic level, unfenced parks in London are filling on warm evenings into the early mornings with people hungry to socialize. The police may monitor these occasions, but clamping down on them hard risks becoming an oppressive game of whack-a-mole.\n\nVibeLab's report suggest that communication and preparation can allow organizers to stage outdoor events that both satisfy people's need for contact and community and significantly reduce the infection risk. Even before the pandemic, Berlin had already gone some way towards this goal. In 2018, a study from the Club Commission isolated 65 potential sites for open-air events, so chosen because they were at least 1,000 square meters, were in non-residential areas close to public transit and removed from nature preserves, and possessed access to utilities and water supplies. Having found one or two spots in each of Berlin's districts, the commission is now in discussions with each of the city's boroughs to see how some of these sites might be earmarked as places where spontaneous events can take place with minimum risk and disruption.\n\nTo make sure such events run harmoniously, the commission has already been reaching out to organizers on the free nightlife scene, providing them with an organizer's checklist for events and engaging with such issues as noise, which can now be monitored and kept within legal levels using a phone app. Three of the city's borough mayors have already voiced an interest in staging outdoor music events. With a healthy mixture of engagement between authorities and the public, it's possible that Berlin might be able to support a sustainable outdoor nightlife scene -- and as it does so, develop a model for better communication between citizens and authorities that in the past have too often been at loggerheads.\n\nWhen urban nightlife -- in all its noisy, unruly glory -- migrates out of the windowless buildings that once contained it, new problems emerge.\n\nNoise issues are a particular challenge for the outdoor cafes and bars that swiftly emerged in cities worldwide. The report examines how Vilnius, Lithuania's dramatic \"pavement cafe liberalization\" program, which transformed much of the old city into an 24-hour open-air dining and drinking venue, led to pushback from residents who quickly wearied of late-night disruption. The city responded by aggressively fining offending business owners -- \"causing another backlash from venue owners desperate to attract customers by arranging musical events outdoors.\"\n\nSimilar tensions have emerged in other cities. Scenes of heaving, poorly managed sidewalks in Hell's Kitchen and the East Village led New York Governor Andrew Cuomo to clamp down on al fresco alcohol sales in New York City, while residents around popular Paris bar street Rue Jean-Pierre-Timbaud have gone as far as hiring a lawyer to push drinking spots to quiet down earlier. This can have consequences for more than just public harmony. Spain's longstanding tradition of young people gathering to drink outdoors in streets and squares is being blamed by some for a portion of the cases creating a second wave in the country.\n\nWho's maintaining order in these unfenced, uncontrollable spaces? No one wants outdoor clubs to degenerate into antisocial noise orgies or super-spreader events. But the pandemic is also converging with a widespread reckoning over police violence and the role that law enforcement often plays in perpetuating racial inequality. The presence of police officers at public gatherings can escalate rather than diffuse tension. VibeLab's report suggests that cities need ways of licensing and managing activity in public space that doesn't require the heavy hand of the state security apparatus. \"Due to the ban on big events and the closure of nightclubs, we are seeing young people disregarding rules related to Covid-19, organizing unlicensed events in public spaces,\" Thierry Charlois, head of night policy at the city of Paris, said in the report. \"So why not provide licenses for those events and implement the most effective protection possible?\"\n\nSeveral cities have already established alternative law enforcement -- designed specifically to manage nightlife. In Amsterdam, city-approved Square Hosts patrol popular nightlife areas, offering advice and information, warning rule-breakers and generally easing tensions. Clearly identified by their jackets but without the aura of armed and uniformed police, these hosts do an effective job of maintaining order in Amsterdam's lively nightlife districts while avoiding too heavy or threatening a presence -- and can always get the police to assist if things go beyond what they can manage safely.\n\nParis's alternative policing approach is far quirkier. There, an NGO called Pierrots de la Nuit dispatches street performers to roam various nightlife districts. These are, in a sense, Mime Cops: mute, sad-faced clowns who patrol the noisiest areas and gently encourage overly boisterous people to lower their volume, via silent pantomiming. By creating a soothing, engaging spectacle -- backed up with leaflets and a spokesperson who explains the point of the performance once it's done -- the group serves as a very French way to keep rowdy Parisians in line.\n\nWould such an approach work in other cities? The same mimes-as-law-enforcers principle has been successfully deployed in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, as a traffic-calming measure. The Paris program was originally inspired by a similar one in Barcelona, and last year the Pierrots traveled to Turin to demonstrate the technique. So there's clearly room for creative problem-solving in the quest to keep the night economy alive.\n\nCities will need that resourcefulness in the coming months, since the ever-shifting pandemic represents such a moving target. VibeLab contributors Michael Fichmann and Andreina Seijas admit in the report that upcoming chapters of the recovery plan will have to address different conditions.\n\n\"As the weather turns cold in the Northern Hemisphere, open-air options for commerce and socialising will 'hibernate,' and the luxury of space will diminish,\" the report concludes. \"Soon we will have to apply 24-hour thinking to exploit space more completely by making more use of the day. We will also have to continue financial support for many businesses and individuals that had a brief respite from hard times through use of open-air events.\"",

        "body": "Avoidable delays have made defeating the pandemic all but impossible.\n\nFederal officials have had eight months since the new coronavirus arrived in the U.S. to work out how to test for Covid-19 well enough to get to grips with the pandemic. They've failed. As a result, schools, hospitals and other institutions can't adequately trace or anticipate outbreaks, or stop contagious people from infecting others. Efforts to reopen the economy will falter until this problem is solved.\n\nAnd it can in fact be solved. The answer is an additional strategy based on faster though less accurate tests, used far more frequently. The White House and Congress, the Food and Drug Administration and the states should together drive efforts to create, produce and distribute tests that are quick, easy and cheap.\n\nThe testing pipeline is now so clogged that it's impossible in many places to get results within a day or two. In some cases, the delay extends to weeks. This makes the tests useless for isolating coronavirus carriers while they are most infectious, which is often before they feel symptoms.\n\nMost tests being done today are highly sensitive \"PCR\" (polymerase chain reaction) screens of genetic material, gathered via nasal or throat swabs, which are sent to laboratories equipped with the machinery, reagent chemicals and personnel to process them -- at a cost of about $100 apiece. When labs with limited capacity and supplies are unable to manage a flood of test samples, results are delayed.\n\nPCR tests are still very much needed. They're extremely accurate, and thus essential for diagnosing and treating individual patients. But schools and other institutions that want to isolate the sick from the well also need snapshots of many people at once. Saliva tests that bypass swabbing can be faster, even if they still need to be sent to laboratories. And now there are even quicker \"antigen\" tests that, like home pregnancy tests, can give results in 15 minutes wherever the saliva sample is taken. Several such tests are in development; three have received emergency FDA approval.\n\nAntigen tests, which look for viral proteins in saliva, are less accurate than standard PCR tests, but they're so speedy and inexpensive -- a dollar or two per test -- that they can be done frequently enough to monitor a population. Research at the University of Colorado Boulder suggests that if you use them on a group of people every three days, and isolate those who test positive, it's possible to reduce viral transmission by 88%; that's more than twice as effective as using more sensitive tests only once every two weeks.\n\nUsing this kind of screening, it's essential to make sure that anyone who tests positive, and all their recent contacts, immediately be isolated and given PCR tests to learn their Covid-19 status with certainty. And people with symptoms of the virus should be isolated and given PCR tests even if they get a negative antigen result.\n\nThe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign plans to use saliva tests to screen all 60,000 students and faculty members several times a week, in hopes of detecting positive cases before they become most contagious. Test experts envision using antigen tests routinely for people wanting to enter offices, restaurants and other indoor public places.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is pushing to ramp up the development of new fast tests, aiming for capacity to do 6 million a day by the end of the year. (The U.S. now manages to run roughly that many tests in a week.) The FDA can help by approving tests that don't meet the 80% sensitivity standard now in operation. Congress should help, too, with generous funding. A new bipartisan push to provide $25 billion to help states pay for tests is a start, but more than that will be needed. A recent report on testing from the Rockefeller Foundation says three times as much is necessary.\n\nIdeally, the federal government would direct a national strategy to roll out fast point-of-care tests alongside additional PCR tests, using the Defense Production Act to get private companies to expand manufacturing capacity and, most important, making advance purchases to support and encourage test developers. The Trump administration has been unforgivably slow. Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, promises, if elected, to immediately appoint a Covid-19 supply-chain commander to do the job, but America can't wait for a new president.\n\nSome states are moving ahead on their own. Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, North Carolina and Virginia are joining together to buy 3.5 million antigen tests. Again, that's just a start. Other states should follow their example and be more ambitious, substantially ramping up the number of tests.\n\nDecisive action in Washington seems, for the moment, too much to ask. Tragically, states have been fighting Covid-19 largely on their own. Until that changes, their best bet is to make effective testing their top priority.\n\n-- Editors: Mary Duenwald, Clive Crook.\n\nTo contact the senior editor responsible for Bloomberg Opinion's editorials: David Shipley at davidshipley@bloomberg.net .",

        "body": "Debilitating post-Covid effects may persist for weeks to years\n\nBefore Daniela Alves caught Covid-19 in March, the 31-year-old Londoner regularly worked overtime to accelerate her career as a mobile app designer. Now, she struggles with client meetings, and says persistent fatigue has halved her productivity.\n\n\"I was a beast before, but now things are different,\" Alves says over Zoom, pausing frequently to catch her breath or cough. \"I can't physically do it, and I'm approaching life differently.\"\n\nAlves said she needed three months off work even after experiencing a \"mild\" infection that didn't require hospitalization. Covid-19's lingering effects count her among an expanding population of so-called long-haulers -- survivors left with debilitating conditions who represent another insidious dimension of the pandemic.\n\nIt's now known that SARS-CoV-2 will leave a portion of the more than 23 million people it's infected with a litany of physical, cognitive and psychological impairments, like scarred lungs, post-viral fatigue and chronic heart damage. What's still emerging is the extent to which the enduring disability will weigh on health systems and the labor force. That burden may continue the pandemic's economic legacy for generations, adding to its unprecedented global cost -- predicted by Australian National University scholars to reach as much $35.3 trillion through 2025 as countries try to stop the virus's spread.\n\nMore Stories:\n\n\"The bottom line is that the physical, long-term health consequences are very serious for people's welfare, and in economic terms,\" said Hannes Schwandt, an assistant professor of education and social policy who studies well-being and economic outcomes at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. \"But, we don't know enough about it yet.\"\n\nWhile it's unclear how many survivors become long-haulers, a Covid-19 symptom study in the U.K. with more than 4 million participants found 1 in 10 people are sick for a least three weeks. People with mild cases of the disease are more likely to have a variety of \"strange\" symptoms that come and go over a longer period, according to Tim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, who is leading the study.\n\n\"The more we learn about coronavirus, the weirder it gets,\" he said.\n\nThe still-evolving clinical picture, dearth of patient follow-up, and incomplete data on the number of people afflicted by Covid-19 make it difficult to predict the pandemic's long-term health and economic consequences, according to Christopher J. Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington in Seattle.\n\n\"There's enough out there to suggest it's appreciable, and this is something we're becoming interested in trying to measure,\" said Murray, who has studied the global burden of disease for almost 30 years.\n\nThat information will be critical for anticipating and funding future health-care needs, said Thomas File, president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n\"If you look at the intermediate-term consequences right now, we're already seeing it\" on the lungs, heart, neurological and psychological systems, said File, who is also chair of infectious diseases at Summa Health, a hospital system in Akron, Ohio. \"This is going to have a significant burden on our health-care system for years to come.\"\n\nThe economic impact will be much greater if younger survivors endure decades of coronavirus-related disability, said Olga Jonas, a former economic adviser at the World Bank who studies the impact of contagions at Harvard University in Boston. Polio, a paralyzing disease, would have led to an estimated $215 billion in treatment costs in the U.S. from 1955 to 2015 had vaccines not become widely available, a 2006 study found.\n\nThere has been little recognition so far of Covid-19's ill-effects on younger adults, said Hannah Wei, a 30-year-old long-hauler in Canada, who helps other sufferers through survivor support group Body Politic. An analysis of responses from 640 patients collected by the group in April and May found \"recovery is volatile, includes relapses, and can take six or more weeks.\"\n\nAlthough all respondents experienced symptoms consistent with Covid-19, 48% were either denied testing or not tested for another reason. That can makes obtaining financial assistance for rehabilitation and disability services more difficult, Wei said.\n\n\"In the beginning of the pandemic, a lot of my age cohort weren't the ones being tested, so we've been especially neglected from the system and not recorded on official numbers,\" said Wei, who caught Covid-19 in March. \"Now we're seeing a lot of these people become long-haulers.\"\n\nEven if such cases are identified, there's still no guarantee the economic consequences will be adequately quantified, said Janet Currie, an economics professor at Princeton University. For example, employment surveys favored by economists don't routinely ask if people have disabilities, she said.\n\nAlso, the long-term economic effects of Covid-19 will ripple well beyond those who caught the coronavirus, Currie said. Mental health problems emanating from lockdowns will sap work performance and productivity, health-care disruptions may exacerbate other medical conditions, and people needing to provide care for others will have less time for paid work.\n\nThere are also those like Kyle Merryman, who is in limbo over his own classification.\n\nThe 39-year-old U.S. Iraq-war veteran developed Covid-like symptoms in January. By the end of April he'd visited the emergency room eight times with symptoms including shortness of breath and blurry vision. Due to the timing of his illness, Merryman wasn't tested for Covid-19, and an antibody test in June came back negative. Still, he has no other explanation for how he went from being completely healthy to unable to work.\n\nHe was recently diagnosed with postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome -- a problem with the autonomic nervous system. The condition, which may develop after a viral illness, often causes heart palpitations, chest pain and brain fog, according to the Cleveland Clinic.\n\n\"I'm really not sure what my future holds,\" said Merryman, who had to take leave from a technology job in Florida and move in with his mother in Texas. \"My illness has already put a big financial strain on my family and me.\"",

        "body": "Gargling with povidone-iodine helped virus patients: officials\n\nThe Governor of Japan's Osaka prefecture touted the powers of gargling medicine to control the coronavirus and recommended at-risk residents use it -- sending related shares jumping and clearing shelves of the medicine, even as some questioned the findings.\n\nBased on limited trial on a group of 41 patients with mild symptoms, gargling with diluted povidone-iodine four times a day reduced the number of those testing positive to 9.5% after four days, compared with 40% for a group who gargled with just water, Governor Hirofumi Yoshimura said at a press briefing on Tuesday.\n\nPovidone-iodine is an antiseptic more commonly known as betadine. In Japan, it's sold as gargles by Shionogi & Co., using the name Isojin under license from Mundipharma, as well as by Meiji Holdings Co. Meiji saw its shares surging as much as 7.7% in Tokyo following the news. Shionogi rose as much as 3.6%.\n\n\"It's worth giving a try,\" Yoshimura said, recommending its use to residents with symptoms and those working in high-risk industries such as bars, restaurants and health-care. \"It's a drug that everyone can buy at a drug store and it doesn't do any harm.\"\n\nThe finding isn't based on data from a large, randomized, controlled trial -- the gold standard for assessing the safety and efficacy of any potential therapy. When asked by a reporter if it was appropriate to be touting the medicine at such an early stage in its research, Osaka Mayor Ichiro Matsui, who was also speaking at the briefing, questioned back if he was supposed to ignore the findings.\n\n\"We've always been asking people to gargle, in addition to washing their hands, wearing a mask and social distancing,\" said Matsui. \"Now we're just saying there were better results when they gargled with this instead of gargling with nothing.\"\n\nAt a Matsumotokiyoshi Holdings Co. drug store in central Tokyo's Chiyoda ward, the shelves were stripped clean of gargle medicines containing povidone-iodine, including Meiji's brand, as of 3:30 p.m. local time. Three nearby stores were also empty. Amazon's Japanese website listed most related products as being sold out.\n\n\"We hadn't heard anything prior to the governor's press conference,\" said Meiji Holdings spokesman Hirosaki Oode. \"Our product is effective at disinfecting the mouth and throat, as well as combatting bad breath. We have no plans to study its effectiveness against coronavirus at this time.\"\n\nPeople in Japan commonly gargle as a preventative measure against colds and flus in winter, similar to hand-washing, though its effectiveness is still a matter of some dispute. A 2005 study by Japanese scientists concluded gargling with water helped prevent upper respiratory tract infections, but didn't find using povidone-iodine any more effective than water, though a much smaller study on just 23 patients in 2003 did.\n\nAlong with handwashing and mask-wearing, the habit was one of the early reasons posited as possible reasons Japan escaped the initial brunt of the virus relatively unscathed. In recent weeks however, cases have flared up across Japan, with infections in Osaka on some days coming close to surpassing Tokyo despite a much smaller population.\n\nThe rush to find something to stem the spread of the pandemic has led to multiple treatments being hailed worldwide as a potential silver bullet for the disease before sufficient data can back those claims up, from hydroxychloroquine touted by President Donald Trump, to Fujifilm Holdings Corp.'s antiviral drug Avigan.\n\nWhere Are We in Quest for Coronavirus Drugs, Vaccine?: QuickTake\n\n\"I even think that gargling with povidone-iodine could defeat the coronavirus,\" Yoshimura said. \"But it's still in the research phase and we can't say anything definitive.\"",

        "body": "Race started with a peloton crash as riders sought early gains\n\nIt was always going to be a weird Tour de France, even more so if you're trying to crunch data on who'll win the race -- and when.\n\nThe race's coronavirus-related rules mean that the prospect of a team, or indeed the whole peloton, cycling into Paris on Sept. 20 is anything but guaranteed. Adding to the potential for confusion this weekend, riders are headed to the Pyrenees, traditionally a venue where campaigns can be won or lost.\n\nFor Peter Gray, senior vice president of sport at NTT Ltd., it's a recipe for chaos. While he'd normally be on site in France for the Super Bowl of cycling, this year he's at home in Melbourne, sifting through reams of incoming info. He's one of several NTT data mavens across the globe producing key insights for the teams, television broadcasts and an augmented reality experience for the millions of fans who'd usually be lining the course's 3,470 kilometers (2,156 miles.)\n\nAfter a two-month delay, the race took off from Nice last weekend in a \"Grand Depart\" marked by crashes forcing about 20% of the peloton to change bikes at some point. Rainstorms played their part, but some of it reflected an unexpected change in team strategy.\n\nIf two riders or staff on a team show symptoms or test positive for Covid-19, the whole team has to pull out. That means many riders anticipate each day's racing could be their last. Tony Martin, road captain of the Jumbo-Visma team, went so far as to liken it to a sword of Damocles.\n\nRead: France Tightens Mask Protocols as Virus Infections Climb\n\nOrganizers could in theory scrap the race and announce the winner at any time in the next 17 days. Gone is the strategy of sacrificing stage wins for consistently strong finishes in order to keep legs fresh.\n\nThe race is \"more unpredictable and in many ways chaotic compared to previous years,\" Gray said.\n\nSlovenia's Primoz Roglic, a former ski jumper who rides for Jumbo-Visma, is widely seen as the most formidable general classification, or GC, contender. He faces competition from last year's winner, Colombia's Egan Bernal, who rides for Ineos Grenadiers, one of the best funded teams in cycling.\n\nThere are a couple of others with a shot -- such as France's Thibaut Pinot or Italy's Giacomo Nizzolo from the NTT Pro Cycling Team 1-- but the 2020 field is thin. Two of the best riders of recent years, the U.K.'s Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas, aren't competing.\n\nWith so few teams having a fighting chance, and the prospect of the race ending at any moment, strategy has turned to focusing on the here and now.\n\nAlso contributing to the chaos is an explosion of data available to teams. NTT's insights, pulled from transponders underneath each bike's saddle, is now being fed back to the teams. That's a first, according to Gray, who said that teams previously had limited real-time information.\n\nAdd it all up and you're left with one great twist: riders and their managers know more than ever about what's going on in the moment, and less than they ever have about the race as a whole.",

Another man found to have contracted the disease in April after returning from abroad tested positive in Shanghai on Monday but hasn't shown any symptoms.\n\nNone of the patients' close contacts has tested positive for the virus, but they have been placed under quarantine, local authorities said.\n\nThe two cases are the latest addition to a growing number of \"virus reactivation\" anecdotes found among patients believed to have recovered from the viral infection, which has sickened more than 20 million worldwide and killed 748,000. While it is rare for recovered patients to test positive again, the phenomenon raises questions over why some patients suffer from long-term symptoms, and whether any immunity to the disease might be too ephemeral to protect against re-infection.\n\nSome studies have shown the level of protective antibodies an infected person may build up to fight the virus quickly drop after only a few months, possibly making them susceptible to the same pathogen a second time. However, there is little evidence so far that re-infection has been occurring in this pandemic.\n\nSome experts have raised the possibility that other cells continue to provide immunity even after antibodies fade. Researchers in South Korea have suggested that the virus detected in patients months after recovery could be the vestiges of dead virus particles that are no longer infectious.",

That will ultimately allow the system to notify people that they've been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus even when they don't know them -- such as on public transport.\n\n\"There is no silver bullet when it comes to tackling coronavirus,\" Dido Harding, executive chair of the National Health Service's test and trace program, said in a statement. \"The app is a great step forward and will complement all of the work we are doing with local areas across the country to reach more people in their communities.\"\n\nIdentifying people who may have been infected and isolating them without locking down the whole country is crucial to the government's efforts to restart the economy. Survey data released Thursday revealed the difficulties the U.K. had tracking the pandemic in its early stages, when limited testing capacity was used only for key workers and hospital patients.\n\nMass Antibody Study Finds 3.4 Million in England Had Covid-19\n\nThe survey showed that 3.4 million people in England, or 6% of the population, have had coronavirus -- more than 12 times as many people as have officially tested positive. The government's problem is further complicated by those who don't realize they're infected, given that a third of the people identified by the survey reported having had no symptoms.\n\nBut there's no public timetable for a national rollout of the app, despite ministers previously calling it an essential component of a functioning infection-tracing regime. People in Newham, east London, one of the most ethnically diverse areas in the country, will join users in the Isle of Wight in testing the app.\n\nThe app was originally scheduled for release mid-May, but technical problems meant the developers were forced to abandon their centralized data-collection model in favor of a decentralized approach proposed by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. That means no data is sent to government computers without the user's permission.\n\nThe app will allow users to scan barcodes when they visit bars, cafes and other public locations. It will also enable people to book tests for the virus, and help them to keep track of how much longer they need to self-isolate for if they test positive.",

The damage to the education of a generation of children, especially from poorer families, could be huge.\n\n\"Keeping our schools closed a moment longer than absolutely necessary is socially intolerable, economically unsustainable and morally indefensible,\" Johnson wrote in the Mail on Sunday newspaper.\n\nYet Johnson finds himself in a fight with teachers' unions and other authorities over whether it is safe to restart classes. The public is also divided. A YouGov survey on Aug. 4 found that while 57% of Britons thought schools should reopen in full in September, 25% disagreed and 18% were not sure.\n\nChildren's Commissioner for England Anne Longfield, whose job it is to champion children's rights, suggested all pupils and staff should be tested for coronavirus as often as once a week, even if they don't have symptoms. The government rejects such a step as unnecessary.\n\nUnion leaders and opposition politicians have also called for improvements to the country's Covid-19 test and trace program before schools reopen. Teachers' leaders want the government to reassure staff they will be supported properly with a backup plan if there's another surge in infections.\n\nJohnson Says U.K. Virus-Tracing 'World Beating' Despite Misses\n\nEducation is controlled by the U.K.'s devolved national governments, and schools in Scotland will start to reopen this week. Johnson has set a target for all children to return to schools in England from September. Elsewhere in Europe, governments have begun returning pupils to classrooms without triggering sharp rises in infections. In Sweden, schools never closed.\n\nWithout the backing of unions and a still cautious public, Johnson will struggle to deliver on his pledge. To bolster his case, the prime minister is expected to cite new state-backed research this week showing there is little evidence that coronavirus is transmitted in schools.\n\n\"This pandemic isn't over, and the last thing any of us can afford to do is become complacent,\" Johnson wrote in the Mail. \"But now we know enough to reopen schools to all pupils safely, we have a moral duty to do so.\"\n\nJohnson has faced growing criticism for his handling of the pandemic, with the U.K. suffering the highest death toll in Europe amid claims he was too slow to lock down the country. The premier insisted he followed the best scientific advice, but public faith in the government's response has been damaged.\n\nIn late March, 72% of Britons thought ministers were handling the crisis well, but by late July this had fallen to 45%, according to YouGov research.\n\nFor the U.K.'s recovery, the risk is Johnson's record makes it harder for teachers and parents to trust him when he tells them schools are safe.",

Deaths rose by 0.4% to 184,114.\n\nAnthony Fauci warned that as Covid-19's spread in Sun Belt states is started to ebb, \"there are several states that are at risk for surging, namely North Dakota, South Dakota, Iowa, Arkansas, Missouri, Indiana, Illinois.\"\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases urged residents to wear masks, socially distance, wash hands and avoid crowds.\n\n\"Those states are starting to see an increase in the percent positive of their testing; that is generally predictive that there's going to be a problem,\" Fauci said.\n\nA panel of experts convened by the National Institutes of Health undercut an emergency authorization issued just days ago by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, saying there's not enough evidence to recommend use of convalescent plasma for hospitalized coronavirus patients.\n\nThe Trump administration won't join a global effort to develop, manufacture and equitably distribute a coronavirus vaccine, in part because the World Health Organization is involved, The Washington Post reported Tuesday.\n\nThe plan, co-led by the WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and Gavi, the vaccine alliance, was of interest to some members of the Trump administration and is backed by traditional U.S. allies, including Japan, Germany and the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, according to the newspaper.\n\nBut the U.S. won't participate, in part because the White House doesn't want to work with the WHO, which President Trump has criticized over what he characterized as its \"China-centric\" response to the pandemic, the Post said.\n\nAfter purchasing 150 million new rapid Covid tests from Abbott Laboratories, the U.S. government plans to distribute \"the overwhelming majority\" to states, a top Trump administration official overseeing testing said.\n\nGovernors will be able to use the tests to help reopen schools and protect first responders, Brett Giroir told reporters. Distribution is to begin in mid-September, with states coping with natural disasters, such as Louisiana in the midst of hurricane season, first in line, he said.\n\nMost will be shipped to governors, who can allot them \"according to their distribution plans,\" Giroir said. \"We fully, fully want to support them in that.\"\n\nCalifornia reported 3,712 new virus cases, the lowest daily tally since mid-June. The increase was less than the 14-day average of 5,366 and reflects ongoing improvement in the state, where average daily infections exceeded 9,000 a month ago.\n\nThe average rate of positive tests over the past 14 days was stable at 5.3%, according to state health data. Hospitalizations from the virus decreased 0.7% to 3,849 patients, also the lowest since June.\n\nStill, California reached a grim milestone, crossing 13,000 fatalities from the virus.

In early July, the Republican governor issued a mask mandate but rebuffed requests for stricter measures.\n\n\"Since my last orders in July, Covid numbers have declined, most importantly hospitalizations,\" Abbott said in a tweet late Monday. \"I hope to provide updates next week about next steps.\"\n\nThe first doses of a Covid-19 vaccine should go to front-line health-care workers and first responders, followed by people at higher medical risk from the virus, said a group of scientists and academics advising the U.S. government.\n\nThe draft guidelines released Tuesday were developed by the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Their recommendations will help U.S. health officials come up with a final plan to distribute a vaccine, once one is available.\n\nThe recommendations break the population into four groups, with the goal of targeting people both at high risk from the virus, and at risk of spreading it to others.\n\nGroup one includes front-line health workers and first responders, followed by people with health conditions that put them at risk as well as older adults in dense living settings. The group includes about 15% of the U.S. population, according to the report.\n\nJust days after President Donald Trump praised his administration's ability to provide personal protective equipment for health-care workers, a national nurses group says their members continue to suffer from shortages.\n\nIn a survey of more than 21,000 nurses conducted by the American Nurses Association, a third reported that they were out of or short of N95 masks designed to offer maximum protection in a hospital setting. Almost 60% said they're re-using single-use protective equipment for five or more days, and 68% said their facilities mandate re-using the supplies.\n\nArizona on Tuesday reported 507 new cases, a 0.3% increase to 202,342 that was just above the 0.2% rise of the prior seven-day period. The state Department of Health Services recorded 15 deaths from Covid-19, bringing the toll to 5,044. The testing positivity rate jumped to 11.1% from 3.5% a day earlier.\n\nFlorida's health department and emergency management division are cutting ties with Quest Diagnostics Inc. Governor Ron DeSantis directed the divisions to sever ties with Quest over its \"failure to follow Florida law and report all Covid-19 results in a timely manner,\" according to a statement Tuesday from Florida's joint information center on Covid-19. Quest shares were down as much as 4%.\n\nAfter more than five months of strict lockdowns, Argentina's coronavirus crisis is only getting worse: Almost 47% of people tested get a positive result back. The World Health Organization suggests nations push the rate below 5% for several weeks before reopening their economies.\n\nArgentina passed Chile to claim the 10th spot in most cases globally, with 417,735 infections and 8,730 confirmed deaths. Over the past week alone, cases have risen 9.9%, the most among the top 20 countries. India's cases grew 9% in the period, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said he reached agreement with the teachers' union to delay the start of the school year.\n\nThe opening will be Sept. 21 instead of Sept. 10, de Blasio said Tuesday at a press conference. The teachers union had said they would consider striking if health and safety measures weren't in place.\n\nNew York state Alaska and Montana to its coronavirus travel advisory list, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday. Travelers coming to New York from a total of 30 hot spot states, as well as Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, are required to quarantine for 14 days, according to the advisory.\n\nThe list includes areas that have a positive test rate higher than 10 per 100,000 residents over a seven-day rolling average, or an area with 10% or higher positivity rate over a seven-day rolling average.\n\nThe number of Covid-19 cases in New York remains low, with 0.98% of the nearly 77,000 tests conducted on Aug. 31 found to be positive. There were 432 hospitalizations and three virus-related deaths, according to state data.\n\nGreece's schools will reopen on Sept. 14, Education Minister Niki Kerameus said Tuesday. She called on parents who haven't returned to urban centers from vacation to do so now and to restrict the movement of children ahead of the new school year in case any have the coronavirus but show no symptoms. \"Our children are safer in school than in the streets or squares where they move around without rules, '' she said.\n\nThe wearing of masks is mandatory in all enclosed spaces and outdoors when larger numbers of pupils gather. Masks will be distributed for free as well as individual water bottles for each student.\n\nBrazil's economy registered its biggest drop on record in the second quarter as measures aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus paralyzed activity from investments to family consumption.\n\nGross domestic product plunged 9.7% from the previous three-month period, more than the 9.2% median estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The economy contracted by 11.4% compared to a year ago, the national statistics agency reported on Tuesday. Both drops were the biggest of a series going back to 1996.\n\nThe White House will resume public tours on Sept. 12, according to a statement from the Office of the First Lady.

About 13,000 positions could be shifted or eliminated at its domestic German operations, the car-parts and tire maker said. Automotive suppliers have slashed expenses after the pandemic decimated economies worldwide.\n\nSeparate industry figures showed car sales fell in France and Spain in August, erasing gains made during the previous months and damping hopes for a rapid recovery from the pandemic in Europe.\n\nThe British prime minister chose Simon Case, a former aide to Prince William, to head the U.K.'s civil service. The appointment is a radical move by Johnson, whose government is slipping in the polls amid criticism of its handling of the pandemic. Johnson led the U.K. out of the European Union earlier this year and is seeking to revive and reshape an economy in mired in a deep recession.\n\nThe global aviation industry has racked up more than 350,000 job losses in the past six months, with more pain on the way, according to new research delving into the pandemic's impact on the once-thriving sector.\n\nWizz Air Holdings Plc announced Tuesday that it dropped plans to increase passenger capacity to 80% in the next quarter, and it will maintain its current 60% level for the period if stricter travel measures continue.

The damage to the education of a generation of children, especially from poorer families, could be huge.\n\nThe number of deaths in Russia rose 19% in June from a year earlier, with nearly half of the additional victims diagnosed with Covid-19.

Texas passed 12,000 deaths.\n\nCalifornia reported virus-related hospitalizations declined to a two-month low and Governor Gavin Newsom said he's about to present updated guidelines for reopening the economy.

The state had 4,489 Covid-19 hospitalizations, the lowest in more than two months, according to Texas Department of State Health Services data.\n\nFatalities rose by 265 to 12,070, and Texas counted 5,059 new infections, bringing the cumulative case tally to 597,737. A drop in fatalities generally lags behind an outbreak's overall improvement.\n\nIn Houston, the effective transmission rate was below 1 for a 17th consecutive day, according to the Texas Medical Center. A rate below 1 for at least 14 days indicates community spread is under control, the medical center said on its website.\n\nColleges and universities around the U.S. are being increasingly hit with virus outbreaks. The New York Times tallied at least 6,600 cases across the country as of Wednesday. Here are some of the latest:\n\nBrazil reported 44,235 cases, down from 47,161 the previous day, for a total of 3,761,391.

Deaths rose by 0.6% to 180,249.\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds ordered bars, breweries, wineries and night clubs in six counties to close for more than three weeks starting Thursday as Covid-19 infections rise among young people.\n\n\"It is imperative that we implement some immediate steps to slow the spread among young adults,\" Reynolds, one of few U.S. governors who hasn't imposed a statewide stay-at-home order, told reporters Thursday.

The closings are in effect until Sept. 20.\n\nThe U.S. government will acquire almost all of the 15-minute Covid tests Abbott Laboratories plans to produce this year after the company was granted emergency approval for use of the test, according to people familiar with the deal.\n\nThe government will pay $750 million for 150 million tests, the people said, asking not to be identified because the deal hasn't been formally announced. Approval for the test came on Wednesday, and analysts quickly agreed the new assay -- which works without relying on laboratory equipment -- could help ease delays that have crimped much of the nation's testing capacity.\n\nCalifornia reported 4,430 new cases, a 0.7% increase and less than the two-week daily average of 6,456.

The country is now seeing about 33 cases per 100,000 people compared to three in June, ministry adviser Philip Nolan told reporters in Dublin, while the number of people being admitted to the hospital is starting to rise.\n\nThe warnings come a day after health minister Stephen Donnelly said the country is at a tipping point that could result in another nationwide lockdown. Ireland reported 93 new cases with no deaths Thursday. There have been 1,535 cases over the past two weeks.\n\nArizona on Thursday reported 680 new virus cases, a 0.3% increase to 200,139 that matched the prior seven-day average as the state appeared to continue its progress in controlling Covid-19.

The number of cases includes students and faculty, and students will not be sent home during that period, he said. After two weeks, the state will reassess, Cuomo said.\n\nThe edict comes as the number of coronavirus cases in the state remains low. Of the more than 83,000 people tested on Aug. 26, 0.95% were positive for the virus, according to the most recent state data. There were 490 hospitalizations and four virus-related fatalities.\n\nThere have been several virus clusters in Western New York, Cuomo said. A total of 53 cases were tied to a food processing plant in Chautauqua County, and other cases were the result of community spread, state officials said.\n\nItaly reported 1,411 new cases Thursday, in line with the previous day but still the most since May 6. A record 94,024 tests were performed as summer vacationers returned rom countries including Spain and Greece.\n\nThe Lazio region around Rome is offering free tests at ports and airports to anyone coming back from the popular destination of Sardinia, where some clusters at nightclubs were reported.\n\nPatients in intensive-care units fell by two to 67, while most new hospitalized patients, at least in Lombardy, have been admitted for other issues than Covid-19 symptoms like respiratory problems or pneumonia.\n\nChancellor Angela Merkel called on Germans to refrain from traveling to areas with severe outbreaks of the coronavirus, which include the U.S.\n\nPeople from Germany who visit high-risk places without a valid reason risk losing income if they're forced to miss work due to quarantine, which can run as long as 14 days, Merkel said in Berlin on Thursday. \"We call on people to avoid traveling to risk areas wherever possible,\" she said.\n\nFlorida reported 611,991 Covid-19 cases on Thursday, up 0.5% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 0.6% in the previous seven days.\n\nThe seven-day rolling case total was 23,389, the lowest since June 22, according to the health department report, which includes data through Wednesday. The new daily rate of people testing positive for the first time rose to 6.4% for Wednesday, from 5.7% on Tuesday.\n\nDeaths among Florida residents reached 10,868, an increase of 135, or 1.3%, and the seven-day rolling total was 819. By that measure, it has now been under 1,000 for the past six reports, after peaking this month at nearly 1,300. Deaths often trail infections by weeks, and generally take even longer to be reflected in the data.\n\nAbbott Laboratories surged after its 15-minute Covid test priced at just $5 was granted emergency authorization for use in the U.S. The company's shares climbed 8.7% to $112.91 at 9:57 a.m. in New York trading.\n\nThe product, dubbed BinaxNOW, works without relying on laboratory equipment at a time when labs can take as long as two weeks to produce results. It uses a nasal swab and a small reactive card, and it can be administered by a range of health-care workers, including pharmacists, at almost any location.\n\nManchester United star Paul Pogba tested positive for coronavirus. He was withdrawn from the French national soccer team, London-based LBC radio reported.\n\nInitial jobless claims in regular state programs fell by 98,000 to 1.01 million last week, suggesting the labor market's gradual recovery is back on track. At the same time, claims remain far above pre-pandemic levels, and risks to further improvement include lawmakers' failure to extend support for cash-strapped companies and jobless Americans.\n\nThe U.K. is still in the eye of the coronavirus storm and more challenging times may yet follow, according to an influential business chief who urged the government to take further steps to support corporate Britain.\n\nThe country faces a moment of renewed danger as the winding down of support measures threatens to coincide with a potential winter resurgence of the virus, said Adam Marshall, director general of the British Chamber of Commerce.\n\nIn a separate warning, the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply said many U.K. companies are not preparing for Brexit because the pandemic has depleted their cash reserves.\n\nSanofi will begin human trials of an experimental vaccine against the coronavirus next week, Chief Executive Officer Paul Hudson said Thursday. The drug giant is planning to move to final-stage trials toward the end of the year, he said.\n\nNovavax may file for U.S. approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in December, Czech newspaper Hospodarske Noviny reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Stanley Erck. Novavax plans to partly produce the vaccine at its Czech plant.\n\n\"I'm not saying it will be approved in December, but I'm sure we will have the results in December,\" Hospodarske cites Erck as saying.\n\nFrance is ready to institute a new national lockdown as a last resort as Europe grapples with how to contain the resurgent coronavirus. Plans to restrict movement are ready, but the country will do everything possible to avoid measures that clobbered the economy in the second quarter, France's Prime Minister Jean Castex said on Thursday.\n\n\"The epidemic is gaining ground, and we need to intervene now,\" Castex said, rejecting the need for broad restrictions. \"This doesn't mean the situation is as serious as it was\" earlier this year.\n\nThe number of passengers arriving in the U.K. collapsed in the second quarter as coronavirus restrictions brought international travel to a standstill. Home Office figures show there were just 1.3 million arrivals between April and June, a 97% decrease from the same period of 2019.\n\nU.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government will pay workers on low incomes 13 pounds ($17) a day if they are self-isolating during the pandemic.\n\nThe payments will begin on a trial basis from Sept. 1 in Blackburn and areas of northwest England that currently have additional social distancing-rules in place to contain local outbreaks, the Department for Health said in a statement.\n\nA 15-minute Covid test from Abbott Laboratories that will be priced at just $5 won emergency authorization for use in the U.S., a breakthrough that could ease the bottleneck that has crimped much of the nation's testing capacity.\n\nThe product, dubbed BinaxNOW, works without relying on laboratory equipment at a time when labs can take as long as two weeks to produce results. It uses a nasal swab and a small reactive card, and it can be administered by a range of health-care workers, including pharmacists, at almost any location.\n\nAbbott will start shipping the test within two weeks and intends to manufacture 50 million tests a month by the end of October.",

Click CVID on the terminal for global data on coronavirus cases and deaths.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump alleged that health regulators may be delaying the emergency authorization of blood plasma to treat coronavirus patients until after the election to hurt him politically, offering no substantiation for the charge.\n\n\"I hear great things about it, that's all I can tell you,\" Trump said at a White House news conference Wednesday. \"It could be a political decision because you have a lot of people over there that don't want to rush things because they want to do it after November 3rd,\" the date of the election.\n\nThe use of plasma drawn from people who have survived Covid-19 as a virus treatment has been embraced by some doctors. While seen as safe, clinical trials haven't yet proved whether the therapy can help people sickened by the coronavirus.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said he's authorized the city to disconnect utility service at a house in the Hollywood Hills that hosted large parties.\n\n\"Despite several warnings, this house has turned into a nightclub in the hills, hosting large gatherings in flagrant violation of our public health orders,\" Garcetti said in a statement. Water and power were disconnected.\n\nA University of Illinois test that uses saliva to detect the coronavirus is showing promise and could help the state curb the pandemic as cases spike to the highest since May, Governor J.B. Pritzker said.\n\nThe optimism comes after Yale University received an emergency use authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week for its coronavirus saliva test, which is used by the National Basketball Association. Piggybacking on that, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign conducted a bridge study, comparing its test with Yale's, said Martin Burke, a professor who oversaw the study.\n\nThe results showed that Illinois's test was even more sensitive, allowing it to operate under the umbrella of the FDA's approval, and the university plans to seek independent approval, Burke said.\n\n\"If ongoing research continues to yield positive results, this has potentially game changing implications,\" Pritzker told reporters during a press conference Wednesday.\n\nFacing a spike in cases, Puerto Rico is clamping down again, closing beaches, bars, gyms, theaters and casinos through Sept. 11 and putting strict new controls in place for other establishments.\n\nGovernor Wanda Vazquez announced the new rules, which will take effect Saturday, in a national address Wednesday night.\n\nUnder the regulations, all businesses except grocery stores, pharmacies and hospitals will be closed on Sundays, and all residents are being asked to stay home on Sundays unless it's an emergency.\n\nShops and restaurants must enforce the use of masks and hand-washing, in addition to operating at capacities of 25% or less. Team sports are prohibited and all beaches will remain closed except to people engaged in individual exercise.\n\nThe U.S. commonwealth of 3.2 million people took some of the strictest controls of any U.S. jurisdiction early on in the pandemic, but has seen infections and deaths steadily rise at is has opened up its economy. The island has 27,934 confirmed and suspected cases of the coronavirus and 356 deaths, according to Health Department figures.\n\nTexas reported the lowest number of Covid-19 hospitalizations since late June, according to state health department figures.\n\nHospitals in the second-biggest U.S. state had 5,974 virus patients as of late Tuesday, the fewest since June 29. The strain on medical infrastructure continued to ease even as new cases increased by 7,024 to bring the cumulative total to 557,256.\n\nThe uproar over data and coding glitches that have undermined confidence in the state's case, fatality and positivity tallies intensified. The top-ranking county official in a suburban Dallas region that includes towns like Plano and McKinney warned residents the numbers \"continue to be plagued by mistakes and errors.\"\n\n\"The Commissioners Court is 100% certain that the COVID-19 data being reported for Collin County is inaccurate,\" Collin County Judge Chris Hill wrote on Facebook. \"Warning: Collin County is providing COVID-19 numbers and data as a convenience to our residents. However, because we have been made aware of inaccuracies in the Department of State Health Services' reporting, we must advise residents that Collin County has no confidence in the data currently being provided to us.\"\n\nCoronavirus cases in the U.S. increased 0.8% as compared with the same time Tuesday to 5.51 million, according to data collected by Johns Hopkins University and Bloomberg News. It was the third straight day that cases rose by 0.8%, which was lower than the average daily gain of 0.9% over the past week. Deaths also rose by 0.8%, to 172,511.\n\nFrance reported its biggest increase in new coronavirus cases since early May, before the country emerged from an almost two-month lockdown.\n\nNew infections totaled 3,776 over the past 24 hours, the government's health office reported Wednesday, the largest daily jump since May 6. Deaths increased by 17 to 30,468.\n\nFrance, along with neighbors including Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, has been grappling with a resurgence in cases over the past few weeks, even as the number of fatalities remains well below the levels seen during the peak of the pandemic in March and April.\n\nAll New York City public school students and staff should be tested in the 10 days before the system reopens in September, the city's teacher's union demanded Wednesday.United Federation of Teachers President Michael Mulgrew said his members still lack confidence that the reopening of the largest U.S. school system can go forward without preventing a new wave of Covid-19, which forced the city's 1,800 schools to shut in March. The schools are scheduled to reopen with a \"blended schedule\" that combines remote online instruction with in-school learning in classes of no more than 10 students, one to three days a week.\n\nAt a news briefing Wednesday, Mulgrew called for all 1.1 million students and school staffs to get tests for Covid-19 or an antibody test within 10 days of the schools' Sept. 10 opening date.\n\nDaily new cases of coronavirus in Spain jumped to highest since late April, with 3,715, according to data for Health Ministry published Wednesday.\n\nThe Madrid region recorded the biggest surge, with 1,535 new cases in the past day, according to the data. The ministry said 131 deaths were recorded in past seven days.\n\nFlorida reported 584,047 Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, up 0.7% from a day earlier, compared with an average increase of 1% in the previous seven days. The new daily rate of people testing positive for the first time fell to 7.1% for Tuesday, the lowest since June 14. The state has reported 33,146 new cases in the past seven days, the fewest in a comparable period since late June.\n\nDeaths among Florida residents reached 9,932, an increase of 174, or 1.8%, according to the health department report, which includes data through Tuesday. Although cases and hospitalizations have been slowing in Florida, the state continues to report more than 1,000 new Covid-19 deaths a week. Deaths often trail infections by weeks, and generally take even longer to be reflected in the data.\n\nNew York City's positive test rate for the Covid-19 has fallen to its lowest since the pandemic crisis first hit, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.\n\nAfter more than two months of experiencing positive test rates of less than 3%, the city recorded a 0.24% test rate this week, the mayor reported during a news briefing Wednesday. Of 64 patients who were hospitalized with respiratory symptoms, only 8.7% were found to be infected with the Covid-19 virus, the mayor said.\n\n\"We are one of the safest places in the country when it comes to the coronavirus,\" de Blasio said. \"The economy is starting to come back, but we have a long way to go.\"\n\nPeople will have to wear masks both indoors and outdoors on the island of Mykonos and in the northern region of Chalkidiki, the Greek government said. The authorities also decided to suspend any kind of events and prohibit gatherings of more than nine people in the two tourist areas.\n\nThe measures come after Greece reported 269 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, a record since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is seeing a jump in new cases and the government blamed the increase on social gatherings and the failure to adhere to precautionary measures. The country reported 435 new infections on Wednesday, the highest daily increase in over a month.\n\nThe Gulf nation has increased testing, eased restrictions and airlines such as Emirates and Etihad have started to connect with more destinations.

        "body": "Justice Department targets nursing-home deaths in blue states\n\nCovid-19 testing moves by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Justice Department are deepening the partisan divide over the handling of the pandemic in the U.S., with critics charging the measures are to benefit the White House as the election nears while the administration says they're addressing policy failures.\n\nNew CDC guidance that asymptomatic individuals shouldn't necessarily be screened was quickly questioned by public-health experts who said the shift could reduce the amount of testing done and lead to further spread.\n\nBrett Giroir, a top Trump administration official overseeing coronavirus testing, defended the move on a call with reporters Wednesday. The change wasn't influenced by the White House, he said, and is intended to clarify to the public the limitations of such screenings, not to reduce how many tests are conducted. He said health and science experts were involved, and the White House coronavirus task force signed off on it.\n\nTrump Test Chief Defends New CDC Guidelines After Blowback\n\nGiroir said that Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and one of the administration's most prominent voices on the virus, was involved as well. However, Fauci was in surgery when the recommendations were presented to the task force on Aug. 20, his press office said.\n\nFauci \"was not present for the meeting where the changes to the guidelines were discussed in detail and ultimately adopted by the Task Force,\" NIAID said in a statement. While he'd seen an earlier version, \"without having the benefit of the discussion that took place on August 20 at the Task Force meeting where the guidelines were finalized,\" Fauci now \"has some concern\" about how they'll be interpreted.\n\nDemocrats quickly piled on. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo called the move \"indefensible.\" California Governor Gavin Newsom said, \"I don't agree with the new CDC guidance, period, full stop.\"\n\nA senior administration official said the White House didn't exert any pressure and that all task-force members were involved in the testing guidance changes.\n\nShortly after Giroir's press call, the Department of Justice announced that it's seeking data from four Democrat-led states -- New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- for a potential investigation into virus deaths at nursing homes. It said the states had required facilities to accept residents \"often without adequate testing.\"\n\nN.Y., N.J. Among States Targeted in Nursing-Home Review\n\nIn a press release, the agency compared Covid mortality rates in New Jersey and New York -- the early epicenters of the pandemic in the U.S. -- unfavorably to those in Republican-led Texas and Florida, which became hot spots later on and benefited from advancements in treating patients and stopping the virus's spread.\n\nWhile New Jersey and New York still lead U.S. states with the most deaths, Texas and Florida are now among the top five by fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nThe moves raised eyebrows further as the Republican National Convention is well underway, with President Donald Trump's acceptance speech Thursday. Critics suggested that his administration is trying to take control of the narrative about the pandemic in an effort to fend off criticism about Trump's leadership.\n\nPublic-health experts said they worry these actions, along with further partisan divisions and questions about whether treatment and vaccine research could be influenced by politics, could impede the country's ability to stem the new coronavirus.\n\n\"We politicize public health at the public's peril,\" said Howard Forman, director of the Yale School of Public Health's health-care management program. No matter who is elected, \"what's happening now undermines our trust in our public-health infrastructure and will doom our efforts to get maximum vaccine uptake.\"\n\nTrump has repeatedly insisted that he has done a great job battling the coronavirus, though he downplayed it for weeks and repeatedly predicted it would fade away while criticizing his health officials. He has also regularly drawn a line between blue states -- which were among the first hit -- and red states that saw cases rise later on.\n\nThe virus has weighed on Trump's poll numbers. Democratic nominee Joe Biden has held a steady lead in the presidential race, though one that polls indicate has shrunk.\n\nBiden has routinely hammered Trump over his handling of the pandemic, as the U.S. outpaces similar countries in cases and deaths. Trump could see a political bounce if he can distract from questions of his handling of the virus, or defer the blame for the glut of American cases and deaths.\n\nTrump has said previously that he'd like testing slowed down, though the White House said it was a joke and health officials said they hadn't been ordered to do so. The president regularly complains that U.S. testing totals are exaggerating the footprint of the virus and that young adults with only mild symptoms shouldn't count as a case.\n\n\"We are focused on aggressively shielding the highest-risk individuals. Those living in nursing homes and long-term care facilities are less than 1% of the U.S. population but account for nearly half of all fatalities,\" Trump said in mid-August, speaking at his New Jersey golf club. \"That's why we have rushed nursing home funding, protective gear, and rapid testing equipment. And we will announce additional measures to protect nursing home residents.\"\n\nThis week's Republican convention, meanwhile, has made little mention of the virus, though one video montage praised Trump for his handling, including selectively edited clips from New York's governor, among others. Trump is, in other words, campaigning on the moments of praise by Cuomo while the Department of Justice takes aim at Cuomo's handling of the pandemic.\n\nThe focus of the Justice Department inquiry is state policies that mandated nursing homes accept patients regardless of whether they had Covid-19.\n\nMany public health experts believe that was an error early on in the crisis that contributed to high death tolls, though similar policies were enacted by other states. Cuomo, who has previously defended the policy and said the state was following CDC guidance, reversed it in May.\n\n\"At least 14 states -- including Kentucky, Utah and Arizona -- have issued similar nursing guidance all based on federal guidelines - and yet the four states listed in the DOJ's request have a Democratic governor,\" Cuomo and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in a statement.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, where Governor Tom Wolf's handling of the coronavirus has been a target for Republicans for months, more than two-thirds of the 7,624 Covid deaths in the state were from residents of nursing homes or personal-care facilities, according to the state health department.\n\nIn Michigan, which advanced a bipartisan bill this summer to put elderly Covid-19 patients in separate facilities, deaths of nursing-home residents made up 31% of the 6,690 virus fatalities as of Aug. 25.\n\nAlyana Alfaro, a spokesperson for New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy, defended the state's actions. It \"followed CDC guidance and took numerous actions to protect residents of our nursing homes,\" she said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"That this request from the Department of Justice, sent only to four states with Democratic governors, was announced by press release during the Republican National Convention speaks volumes about the nature of the review,\" Alfaro said.",

        "body": "Health trackers like Fitbits and smartwatches can help detect the coronavirus before symptoms appear. But data gaps and privacy fears remain.\n\nThe prospect of suddenly falling gravely ill with no early symptoms is one of the coronavirus's many frightening aspects, one that Monica Valencia understands all too well. In July, a family member died of Covid-19 after an extremely short illness that seemed to come out of nowhere. Only one symptom, shortness of breath, ever manifested. Within days, the relative was dead.\n\n\"I don't want anyone else to go through what my family went through,\" Valencia said.\n\nNow she's hoping to contribute her health data so that no one else has to. In July, Valencia was among 400 employees of the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System outfitted with wearable Fitbit fitness devices as part of a study tracking early signs of Covid-19 launched in March by the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego. The devices monitor heart rate, sleep patterns, and physical activity levels; if they can pick up the subtle physiological changes that herald infection, they could nudge users to get tested even before symptoms appear. Bringing such tech-based Covid-19 detection to an entire community could spot outbreaks earlier, alert individuals who may remain asymptomatic but contagious, and help local officials increase the effectiveness of their testing and tracing protocols. In a pandemic that has so far stubbornly resisted high-tech countermeasures, mass deployment of health trackers could be a powerful new public health weapon.\n\nSeveral studies are looking at the effectiveness of wearables as Covid detectors, and they are showing promising results. But they have major drawbacks. Most studies require participants to own their own wearable devices, which sell for anywhere from $50 to $400 -- a big data gap in a pandemic where low-income frontline workers are among the most vulnerable. (Pew Research Center has found that some 31% of Americans whose households earn $75,000 or more per year report using wearable devices, compared to only 12% of those in households earning less than $30,000.) Other issues could limit the effectiveness of this technology. As with tech-powered contact tracing efforts, some people are concerned with privacy issues and government access to health information -- the same surveillance fears that also haunt \"smart city\" programs that harvest data from residents. Researchers must both overcome those challenges and confront one additional barrier: a long legacy of mistrust between medical institutions and low-income communities of color.\n\nThe Scripps study, called DETECT, monitors the biometrics of 35,000 participants through an app that pulls data from Fitbits, Apple Watches, and other wearable devices. Lead researcher Jennifer Radin, an epidemiologist at Scripps, has compared day-to-day changes over baseline health levels and found signs that the sensor data can help detect Covid-19 before symptoms appear better than self-reported symptoms alone. Eventually Radin hopes to build an alert system that tells participants when their health patterns indicate infection; it could then send them testing information or an at-home testing kit and connect them with a contract tracer if they test positive.\n\nAnyone who uses a wearable can download Radin's app to participate in this work. The MTS workers are among a few groups in and beyond the San Diego area who have received free Fitbits, donated by the device maker, that Radin's team contacted to participate in the study. Healthcare workers at Scripps' clinical facilities have also received a batch, as have a number of osteopathic doctors in rural communities of the U.S., a partnership that Scripps set up through the Osteopathic Foundation. \"It's exciting to potentially roll out the study in populations that might not have access all the time to these devices and hopefully create something that is really useful,\" Radin said.\n\nRadin and other scientists are going further, setting up a study in Jackson, Mississippi, to distribute wearables to low-income African-American residents, one of the pandemic's hardest-hit populations nationwide. More than 80% of Jackson's population is Black and nearly 30% live under the poverty line; the city has seen more than 500 cases of Covid-19. Initiated by the World Economic Forum, the Jackson program is still in the early planning stages about how it would work, how it would be funded, and whom exactly it would target.\n\nHowever, a program that straps digital trackers to the wrists of African Americans in a bid to study their health faces challenges beyond the question of device access. In the U.S., medical experimentation on Black people has a long history of deception and non-consensual practices, from syphilis injections by federal researchers at Tuskegee, to Cold War-era radiation studies by the Department of Defense, to the uncompensated taking of cancer cells by doctors at Johns Hopkins University. That has scarred the Black community with deep trust issues towards health care institutions, said Primus Wheeler, the executive director of the Jackson Medical Mall Foundation, a health care complex serving the city's disadvantaged residents. (It's located in the husk of a former shopping center.)\n\n\"When you even mention research, folks think about themselves as a guinea pig,\" Wheeler said. \"Even going to the hospital -- people may not want to go to a teaching hospital because they fear being practiced on.\"\n\nThat's also why Wheeler sees so much value in the wearable devices: They can help prompt wearers to seek medical attention early, instead of waiting until it's too late. He and other community health leaders in Jackson are collaborating with city leaders, WEF executives, and researchers to design the study in a way that is mindful of trust divides. Wheeler thinks that they could tap into Jackson's network of community health workers -- community members trained on the basics of at-home medicine and who act as a liaison to institutional providers -- to distribute the devices and ensure participation.\n\nThe DETECT study is just one of several projects employing wearables as Covid-19 detectors. Fitbit's own research program, which encompasses 100,000 people in the U.S. and Canada, is catching signs of the disease before symptoms show. So is a 5,000-person study led by Michael Snyder, a professor of genetics at Stanford University. Snyder's team is now building an algorithm that can scan device data at scale and alert wearers to get tested and self-isolate when signs of infection show. In a sub-analysis of 31 participants who tested positive for Covid-19, Snyder found that 82% had data on their devices that indicated infection -- such as an elevated heart rate -- at or before the time symptoms appeared.\n\nBut the participants whose health data did not hint at their serious illness were likely people with pre-existing conditions, Snyder said, highlighting another gap between wearables research and the populations most at risk for Covid-19. Snyder said that his project has distributed free devices to high-risk groups -- specifically people with family members who've had Covid-19. But medical confidentiality requirements have made that process a challenge.\n\nStill, he believes that digital divides shouldn't be a reason not to pursue tech-based medical research. Over time, he believes the devices will come down in price and could serve as health equalizers. \"It shouldn't matter if you're rich or poor -- it's important information that this provides access to,\" he said.\n\nOther researchers are taking a different approach from the get-go. Jessilyn Dunn, a professor of biomedical engineering at Duke University, is also leading a research program using smartphones and smartwatches. So far, the vast majority of participants in her Covidentify study have been people who already own those devices, and as a result their demographics have been skewed towards more affluent, less vulnerable people. Now, she's \"working like crazy\" to distribute 450 devices to underserved communities around Durham, North Carolina, with a focus on Black and Latinx residents. Firefighters, meatpacking plant workers, and elderly churchgoers are among those who've already been equipped with smartwatches that can detect changes in their heart rate and step counts.\n\nKey to Dunn's work is making sure people know how to use the technology: Her research coordinators talk to participants regularly to make sure they know what they need to do. Unlike others, her study's app does not collect location data by default, and she does not plan to link her results to any contact tracing program because of potential privacy issues. But she still foresees challenges: Immigrants with a fear of deportation, for example, might still be skeptical of participating.\n\n\"We want to include all sorts of demographics in our community, but it might not work for everyone,\" she said.\n\nSo far it seems to be working for Valencia. She doesn't feel spooked by the privacy issues, noting that the Scripps study allows participants to opt out of sharing location data and other personal details. She's also learning about her body in ways she wouldn't otherwise, observing how her heart rate fluctuates based on the daily stress she experiences. But mostly she likes contributing to something bigger. \"If you do it, it helps with the research,\" she said. \"For me, the positives there outweigh any of the personal information that is shared.\"",

        "body": "In the nine months since the coronavirus emerged, the global medical community has learned about how to detect the virus, restrict its spread and better treat patients. Lately, scientists are also confronting a glaring blind spot in their knowledge: thousands of Covid-19 patients who report that months later they haven't recovered in full.\n\nMysterious lingering symptoms after viral infections aren't new. Patients recovering from other viruses, including Ebola and the coronaviruses SARS and MERS, have also reported a wide range of continuing health problems, including neurologic issues. And then there's chronic fatigue syndrome, also called myalgic encephalomyelitis, a mysterious and debilitating condition linked to numerous viral infections.\n\n\"It's the minority of people -- depending on the illness, from 5% to 20% -- who have some kind of persistent problem. They never quite get over it,\" says Mitchell Elkind, a professor of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University.\n\nNow Covid-19 patients are reporting similar problems. Some of the most common issues involve the nervous system, including everything from memory and sleep disturbances to dizziness, nerve pain and \"brain fog.\" Scientists are just starting to study those \"long-haul\" patients, so it's not clear what is causing their symptoms or how long they will last. But even if a small minority of Covid patients face lingering cognitive problems, \"that can be a massive societal and economic burden a year from now,\" says Adrian Owen, a neuroscientist at Western University in Canada.\n\nIn the past, post-viral syndromes have often gotten limited research attention, or, in the case of chronic fatigue syndrome, proved hard to study given the long interval between viral infections and reported symptoms. The enormous number of coronavirus patients with lasting neurological symptoms may finally change that. It's prompting numerous studies just getting underway that may give doctors and patients badly needed answers to why some people can't seem to recover from Covid-19. -- Emma Court and Robert Langreth\n\nThe coronavirus has swept through South Africa. But the country was already carrying a heavy burden of chronic and infectious diseases. Its healthcare system is fragile.

        "body": "For those in their gregarious 20s, social distancing has painful side effects.\n\nImagine a condition so bad for your health, it reduces your life expectancy as much as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. It weakens your immune system and carries an increased risk of dementia and heart disease. It even causes your wounds to heal more slowly and hurts your ability to recover from cancer.\n\nThere is one: loneliness.\n\nFormer U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy has been warning about the health effects of what he calls a \"loneliness epidemic\" since at least 2017, but his clarion call is carrying further these days, thanks in part to a perfectly timed new book and months of Covid-19-induced isolation.\n\nI mention the physical health effects of loneliness because, in the face of a pandemic whose deadliness is as obvious as the refrigerated trucks parked outside hospitals, the world seems to have decided that people -- especially younger people -- who feel lonely right now are selfish, weak, entitled or simply bored. The Greatest Generation survived the Great Depression and fought World War II, after all, and today's youth are merely being asked to binge on Netflix.\n\nThis glib comparison, a favorite jest of late-night comics, ignores the fact that connection is one of humanity's most fundamental and basic needs. And while phone calls and video chats can keep people in touch, they're not the same as getting together. Nor can people support one other quite as fully via technology. Videoconferencing doesn't let you babysit children or help a friend move.\n\nThere's been lots of sympathy for lonely elders during the pandemic. Without diminishing their suffering, it's worth asking: Can't this same empathy be extended to lonely young people? Smooth skin and a full head of hair don't lessen the pangs of isolation.\n\nOn the contrary, young people may feel even worse than their elders; surveys conducted before the pandemic found the highest rates of loneliness among the young and the lowest among people over the age of 72.\n\nYounger people report higher rates of anxiety and depression as well, and the pandemic hasn't changed that. In July, 47% of people under 30 reported feeling anxious, according to data published by the CDC, and that percentage drops steadily with age. Only 13% of people 80 and above reported symptoms of anxiety. Undergrad and graduate students are often able to access affordable mental health care through their colleges, but closing schools has made those resources harder to access.\n\nWorking people in their 20s have been more likely than older people to be laid off than older workers this spring. One in four workers under 25 have lost their jobs, and 13% of those aged 25 to 34. That has left them without not just health benefits, but also the sense of purpose and structure a job provides.\n\nWork provides an important social scene for younger people. In general, people in their 20s are more likely than older people to value socializing and to make new friends, but this is especially true at work, where they form more personal bonds and say that such friendships improve their performance.\n\nPeople under 35 are also less settled at home, generally living with family, roommates or an unmarried partner. Thinking back to my own 20s, a single year could involve all of these options. Friends provided the only ballast in a life of ever-changing roommates, boyfriends and jobs. A pandemic would have rendered my 20s life unrecognizable.\n\nThat's not the case now that I'm closer to the middle of life than its beginning. In fact, the age group perhaps least likely to be lonely right now is the 35-64 cohort -- the most likely to be employed and the most likely to be living with a spouse, according to Census Bureau data.\n\nOlder folks may be better equipped to cope with isolation and more resilient in the face of adversity. The human brain changes throughout life, and people with older brains report higher levels of contentment and satisfaction, and are better at seeing things in perspective and concentrating. They're better able to focus on the positive, less reactive to criticism and more accurate when it comes to reading other people's feelings. The intense highs and lows of youth -- the angst and agita -- give way to the equanimity of maturity.\n\nThose over 65 are more likely to live alone, which is a risk for loneliness. On the other hand, they've got practice at being on their own. Some retirees I've talked to say that the pandemic has barely changed their lives at all.\n\nSo, I'd like to see a little more understanding directed at the young. Shame discourages people from seeking treatment and it encourages them to lie about whether they've been exposed to Covid-19, making it harder to test and trace. If we don't want people in their 20s going to bars, we should shut down bars -- not reopen them and then yell at whose who show up.\n\nPublic policy to control Covid-19 cannot rely on shaming or harassing people into compliance. Yes, some young people could be doing a better job of social distancing. But understand that, for them, it's probably harder.",

        "body": "A few weeks ago, I made a prediction that I in no way wanted to be correct: By early August, the Covid-19 death toll in Florida would average 600 a day, rivaling the worst days of the pandemic in New York.\n\nI was wrong. As of August 4, Florida's seven-day average was just 184, according to the latest official data. Unfortunately, I don't see this as reason for relief.\n\nHere's where I might have erred: I made some ambitious assumptions about how New York's experience could be applied to Florida. Specifically, I assumed a straightforward relationship between the percentage of Covid-19 tests coming out positive and the actual number of cases: The higher the percentage, the more cases are going unrecorded because people with mild or no symptoms aren't getting tested. The relevant positive rate for New York was more than double Florida's (44% versus 18%), so I estimated that New York's mid-April peak of 11,434 cases would be about 24,000 in Florida terms. It followed that if New York ended up with 1000 deaths a day, Florida -- with about 15,000 cases -- should see more than 600. Perhaps the relationship isn't that simple. Maybe New York actually had a lot more cases, or maybe Florida's death rate really is different.\n\nThat said, I also should have considered whether Florida's methodology for recording deaths was even comparable to New York's. States are supposed to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, but in reality they all do things differently, and some use pretty narrow definitions. According to the watchdog organization Florida COVID Action, for example, last month Florida started attributing deaths to Covid-19 only if the disease is confirmed as the \"primary cause.\" This means that a lot of Covid deaths are probably being recorded as pneumonia or as acute respiratory distress syndrome.\n\nSo how much might Florida or New York be undercounting Covid-19 deaths? One way to get a sense: Look at how deaths overall compare to the same period last year. Granted, this is probably an underestimate of coronavirus fatalities, because deaths by other causes declined after the pandemic started compelling people to stay safe and away from each other. But it's better than nothing.\n\nData compiled by The New York Times suggest that New York State had about 9,600 excess deaths during its worst week in April, compared with about 6,600 official Covid-19 deaths -- suggesting an undercount of about 30%. Florida had about 1200 excess deaths in the week ending July 11, compared with an official report of about 500, suggesting an undercount of almost 60%. Moreover, there's a lag in death reporting -- and that lag appears to have gotten worse -- so excess deaths are likely to end up higher still.\n\nIn other words, while my prediction about Florida's official Covid-19 death count was definitely wrong, the pandemic is probably taking a lot more lives in the state (and in other states) than meets the eye. Just applying the undercount estimate derived from excess deaths, Florida's 7-day average of 184 becomes about 440. The reality could be even worse. I certainly hope it's not, and that Floridians and all Americans will do what's needed to get the numbers down as quickly as possible.",

        "body": "Wider testing explains the spike in reported cases among millennials and Generation Z, but so does social-distancing fatigue.\n\nIn parts of Europe, new coronavirus cases have been creeping up again. While this is by no means a second wave, and case numbers are still lower than they were before, an interesting demographic pattern has started to emerge.\n\nWhereas elderly populations had the greatest share of new cases early in the crisis, younger age groups are now taking the lead. People aged between 20 and 39 account for about 35% to 40% of new cases in England, Belgium and the Netherlands. In Spain, 15- to 29-year-olds account for more than a fifth of new cases. The charts below illustrate the shift, using the date that bars and pubs reopened in each country as the dividing line for gauging how things evolved as restrictions were lifted.\n\nWhile Germany's age breakdown early in the pandemic looked slightly different, the country is seeing a similar trend now. Globally, data from the World Health Organization show the proportion of 15- to 24-year-olds infected with the disease has increased three-fold in the past five months.\n\nSo, what's going on? The first possible explanation is increased testing. At the height of the outbreak, only the very sick -- who are, more often than not, elderly -- were able to get tested, while those with mild symptoms were told to ride out the illness at home without a diagnosis. With more capacity to test and contact-tracing programs in place, countries are catching milder or asymptomatic cases in younger people that previously went uncounted.\n\nBut social-distancing fatigue is also a big factor, especially in age groups that don't feel at risk. Anyone who's been near an urban green space or pub recently has seen the signs: Huge groups drinking not quite a meter (3.3 feet) apart; friends sharing a cigarette; hugs and kisses as people meet up for the first time in months. The WHO has even pleaded with the world's youth \"to resist their urge to party.\"\n\nIt isn't surprising that young adults are trying to return to normal life. Many twentysomethings found themselves living and working in the bedrooms of cramped, rented accommodation. In Britain, people aged 16 to 24 have on average only about 26 square meters of liveable room in their homes. Even for those who escaped to the relative comfort of their parents' houses, it can still be lonely being separated from peers.\n\nThe question is how to get young people back onto the program of protecting themselves to protect older family members, colleagues and fellow commuters from infection. It's not as simple as asking them to resist the urge to party. In London, young urbanites are far more likely to live in shared accommodation. That increases the number of potential transmissions, especially when each housemate has a separate social life.\n\nThere needs to be clearer and more consistent information. It's not always easy to know what's permissible and what isn't at any given time. Health officials could also sound the alarm more about young Covid-19 patients who are reporting prolonged, lingering symptoms such as chest pain and extreme fatigue. The messaging would be more effective by going straight to where young people spend much of their time: social media.\n\nIn Preston, a city in the north of England that's just reentered lockdown, the council leader has urged young people, \"Don't kill granny.\" Done right, such slogans can be a simple but effective way of reminding everyone that we're in this together.",

        "body": "As Covid cases rise again in Europe, governments need to reinforce social distancing and avoid reopening the riskiest parts of the economy.\n\nEurope has been praised for keeping the pandemic in check while reopening its economy. Unlike in the U.S., a combination of responsible individual behavior and smart public policy has delayed a resurgence of the new coronavirus.\n\nHowever, economies and citizens can only take so much of closures and extreme social distancing. From Germany to Greece, an increase in new cases is threatening to turn into a more serious second wave of Covid-19. Some of this is inevitable as shops and businesses reopen, and the younger profile of the newly infected means the latest cases have been less serious. But Europe can't afford to let the pandemic overwhelm its hospitals, especially in the autumn and winter when more of life is forced indoors.\n\nMore serious thought must be given to what activities are acceptable. In some countries, teenagers and twentysomethings are taking to the dancefloors of reopened nightclubs, perhaps hopping from one holiday venue to the next. For a continent that closed its schools, this is a bizarre priority.\n\nEurope doesn't have to face a second round of full draconian lockdowns, which would be disastrous for the economy. However, countries do need to step up their efforts to contain infections again, insisting on the enforcement of social-distancing rules and limiting large gatherings.\n\nAfter a benign start to the Summer, several European states have suffered multiple outbreaks. In Germany, the authorities have counted more than 1,000 new cases for each of the past three days. France, Spain and the Netherlands are seeing sharp increases in new infections. Even countries that dealt relatively well with the spring outbreak -- such as Greece -- warn of a second wave.\n\nFor now, the situation is very different from March, April and May. The number of daily deaths has fallen sharply and hospitals are no longer under pressure. Many of those who test positive have no or few symptoms, a sign that authorities are closer to establishing the \"real\" number of cases. National health services are actively tracing outbreaks and doctors have become better at treating the sick.\n\nStill, Europe knows the danger of this deadly virus. If case numbers keep rising, it will become harder to contain. Covid-19 could start to circulate widely again among the more vulnerable parts of the population, such as older people. Most people haven't developed the antibodies to deal with SARS-CoV-2. Serological studies in the U.K. and Spain put the proportion at 5%-6% (although some studies show people may have developed other forms of immunity).\n\nThen there are the costs of having to enforce a new lockdown. In the first half of 2020, European economies shrunk dramatically. Gross domestic product in Spain and Britain fell more than 20% compared with the end of 2019. Governments have adopted extraordinary measures -- including furlough schemes -- to keep their economies afloat, but they're hugely expensive. A new round of closures would hit the morale of the population and might cause long-term psychological damage.\n\nEuropean governments should continue with their efforts to circumscribe outbreaks as soon as they emerge. This requires localized \"smart\" lockdowns, as has happened in Germany and the U.K.\n\nFor now, the greatest emphasis is on limiting imported cases. Britain has a quarantine on travelers from countries including Spain and France. Italy is obliging those returning from four countries to undertake mandatory tests. But this isn't enough: There are clear signs that the virus is circulating locally.\n\nSome countries, including Italy, have allowed open-air nightclubs to operate again, under pressure from industry groups. The authorities are now experiencing just how difficult it is to trace the contacts of young revelers, and to contain the possible spread. A teenage girl tested positive after attending a nightclub in Marina di Pietrasanta on the Tuscan coast. For now, reportedly 550 people have made themselves known, which will stretch the capacity of the local health-care system.\n\nNo doubt some will prefer not to be identified, as they fear a long stretch of self-isolation. Similar instances have occurred at nightclubs in Sardinia and in the southern Italian town of Soverato. It seems wiser to keep such activities shut. These crowds aren't very different from those at football stadiums, which are still banned.\n\nFinally, governments will need continued vigilance from citizens. In Italy, people have been impressively compliant on wearing masks and limiting unnecessary contact. As social-distancing fatigue kicks in, these precautions have started to slip; it's the same across Europe as people forget the grim scenes of overwhelmed medics and ambulance sirens on city streets. A little more individual prudence would go a long way in keeping the pandemic in check.\n\nEurope has shown it has the institutional capability to deal with this crisis. As autumn returns and more people move into closed spaces where contagion is easier, risks will increase. It's better to act now than regret it later.",

        "body": "Government collapse at peak of pandemic undermined response\n\nThe deadliest place in the world right now for coronavirus is Kosovo.\n\nThe Balkan state, where more than half of the 1.8 million population is under the age of 25, has recorded 54.2 fatalities per million people resulting from Covid-19 in the past week -- just ahead of second-placed Colombia. While new infections during the same period are better, Kosovo also tops that chart if the range is expanded to a month.\n\nThere are several reasons behind the trends. Since breaking away from Serbia following a bloody war, Kosovo remains one of Europe's poorest states, reliant on remittances from citizens who've left for more affluent parts of the continent. Corruption, meanwhile, has held back the development of the health system.\n\nPolitics, however, appears to have been the major contributing factor -- as it has in many parts of the globe where responses to the virus have proved lacking.\n\n\"At the height of the pandemic, Kosovo ousted its government and fired the health minister and key people for the management of that sector,\" said Afrim Krasniqi, executive director at the Albanian Institute for Political Studies in Tirana. \"Kosovo was the only country in the region that failed to apply swift, extraordinary measures to limit the spread of the pandemic.\"\n\nAfter what now looks like a premature relaxation of virus restrictions in May, new Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti, a U.K.-educated former finance minister, tightened social-distancing measures in July in an effort to control the rising number of Covid-19 cases. Hoti himself tested positive this month, though has now returned to work.\n\nThe current 140-160 new cases a day could be a \"plateau,\" according to Sergei Koryak, the World Health Organization's liaison officer in Pristina, Kosovo's capital. But the WHO is working to increase testing capacity from about 500 a day, fearing official data may even be under-counting infections.\n\n\"Laboratories are testing only patients with symptoms, with high temperatures,\" Koryak said by phone. \"So potentially some mild cases may have been missed.\"",
