    "\"COVID toes\" and other skin symptoms may be a sign of coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "There is still much to learn about the novel coronavirus, including a wide range of symptoms that appears to be expanding. Common symptoms of the respiratory illness include fever, cough, shortness of breath and chills, but some doctors have reported less obvious symptoms in some patients -- including what some are calling \"COVID toes\" and other skin ailments.\n\nEsther Freeman, director of Global Health & Dermatology at Massachusetts General Hospital and an assistant professor a Harvard Medical School, said \"COVID toe\" cases look similar to pernio or chilblains, a condition of inflamed blood vessels caused by cold temperatures.\n\n\"We're seeing this inflammatory response that we would normally see when someone was exposed to the cold temperature... like someone who has been playing outside with wet socks,\" Freeman told CBS News. \"However, in this setting, we're seeing it in warm climates and we're seeing it in patients who have been indoors and sheltering in place.\"\n\nFreeman said it's not unusual for a virus to cause a rash, so most dermatologists aren't surprised that COVID-19 could cause skin symptoms. \"What is surprising to me are these 'COVID toes,' these pernio-like lesions...because we haven't seen as many reports of these in other viruses.\"\n\nFreeman is a practicing dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital who has been seeing patients via tele-health video appointments. \"I have seen more toes in the past two weeks in my clinic than I have in my entire previous career combined,\" said Freeman, who is a member of American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) COVID-19 task force.\n\nAside from seeing skin symptoms in her own patients, Freeman has also received examples of these symptoms from health care providers all over the world. The AAD COVID-19 task force set up an international registry for physicians to send in examples of dermatological manifestations of COVID-19, to help further the study of these symptoms. Physicians from 21 different countries have sent in information to the registry so far.\n\nFreeman said \"COVID toes\" have been seen in both children and adults. They are sometimes present along with more typical coronavirus symptoms, and sometimes they are the only symptom the patient is experiencing. \"Actually, about half of the registry is experiencing something other than toes,\" Freeman said.\n\nSome physicians have also reported seeing skin conditions that look like morbilliform (measles-like) rashes, hives or chickenpox.\n\nIn fact, one of the first case series of dermatologic manifestations included 18 Italian patients with several skin abnormalities including redness, hives and rashes, often on their torsos, Freeman and her colleagues write in the Journal of American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nFreeman says her own patients tend to come to her with two main concerns. \"The first thing they want to know is 'My toes are purple, am I going to get really sick?' I can be reassuring that most of the patients in our registry, most of the data that we're looking at, are doing really very well,\" Freeman said. \"The second thing my patients want to know is, 'Am I potentially infectious? Could I be infecting my family members?'\"\n\nFreeman said it is important to be cautious because some \"COVID toe\" patients might still be infectious and should talk to their doctor about getting a coronavirus test.\n\n\"The overall message I want to tell the public is not to panic,\" Freeman said. \"Most of our patients who have these 'COVID toes' are doing extremely well.\"\n\n\"If you need to go to the ER because you're otherwise sick or you have other symptoms you need to be evaluated for, that's fine. But if the only symptom you have is purple toes, you don't need to go rushing into the ER,\" Freeman said, adding that if a patient does experience toe or skin abnormalities, they should talk to their physician.\n\nA team of dermatologists from Brussels, Belgium and and Portland, Oregon have also studied toe and skin infections in relation to COVID-19. In a case report published in JAAD, they say it's important for dermatologists to recognize the signs.\n\nThe researchers write about a 23-year-old man who had \"acute-onset\" purplish and painful plaques on his toes and the outer side of his feet for three days. For several days before that, he'd also had a low-grade fever and dry cough.\n\nAfter a complete skin examination, the patient tested positive for COVID-19. The researchers say he was diagnosed with \"COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains,\" the medical term for the skin sores. Similar cases have been observed by French and Belgian dermatologists, but had not been previously reported due to lack of testing, the researchers said.\n\n\"Young patients presenting with chilblains have lacked criteria sufficient to allow for a COVID-19 PCR test,\" according to the study. \"Because of the recent outbreak of chilblains, concurrent with the increase of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 has been widely suspected as the etiology,\" or cause, they write.\n\nThis study looked COVID-19 chilblains cases in children and young adults, whose feet have been more affected than their hands.\n\n\"Chilblains may be the inaugural symptom of COVID-19, and a fever and dry cough may be minimal or even absent,\" according to the study.",

That's what our calling is.\"\n\nSo they keep answering that call.\n\n\"We have to help people that can't help themselves right now,\" Brock said. \"And we have to be able to be strong for them, because this is the time that they need us the most.\"\n\nThe call volume in recent days has returned to near pre-coronavirus levels, roughly 4,000 a day, mostly COVID-19 calls.

        "body": "At 113 years old, Maria Branyas has lived through the 1918 flu pandemic, two world wars, the Spanish Civil war, and now coronavirus. Branyas is believed to be the oldest woman in Spain, and despite her age, she was able to beat coronavirus after being diagnosed with COVID-19 in March, BBC News reports.\n\nBranyas spent weeks in isolation and only experienced mild symptoms. \"Now that she is well, she is wonderful, she wants to speak, to explain, to make her reflections, it is her again,\" her daughter tweeted, according to BBC News.\n\nThe supercentenarian was born in Mexico in 1907 and moved to San Francisco before settling in the Catalan province of Girona during World War II, BBC News reports. Branyas has three children, 11 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. One of her kids turned 86 recently and her eldest grandchild is 60.\n\nSpanish publication La Vanguardia, which first reported on Branyas' coronavirus recovery, interviewed her last year, calling her the \"Abuela [grandmother] de Catalan.\"\n\nWhen asked for her secret to a long life, Branyas told La Vanguardia, \"I have done nothing but live.\"\n\nIt appears that at 113 years old, Branyas is active on Twitter. La Vanguardia included one of her many tweets in which she updated her followers on her coronavirus recovery. She said she had been asked to do a TV interview - and guessed it was because she overcame COVID-19.\n\nWhile the elderly are more vulnerable to coronavirus and may have a more difficult time overcoming it, recoveries like Braynas' are not unheard of. In the United States, a \"resilient\" 104-year-old man who lived through the Spanish Flu, the Great Depression and World War II also recovered from the coronavirus.\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Lapschies contracted the virus at the Edward C. Allworth Veterans' Home in Oregon, CBS affiliate KOIN reported. He first started showing symptoms on March 5 and been isolated in his room, but by early April, he was considered recovered from COVID-19.\n\nBecause elderly people are at high risk of serious illness from the virus, people over the age of 65 are encouraged to social distance and avoid going out in public. However, since no one is immune, Americans of all ages are being asked to practice social distancing and wear masks to help save the lives of those who are most vulnerable.",

        "body": "The union that represents 250,000 meatpacking and poultry plant workers is calling for improved protections for those on the front lines of sustaining the nation's food supply as the coronavirus spreads.\n\nTen meatpacking workers and three food processing workers have died of COVID-19, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW). In addition, at least 5,000 meatpacking workers and 1,500 food processing workers have been directly impacted by the virus, from testing positive for the disease it causes to missing work due to self-quarantine while they await test results, the labor group said.\n\nThe union's tally of fatalities is lower than one compiled by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting, The center found that as of April 23 there have been at least 3,400 reported positive cases tied to meatpacking facilities at 62 plants in 23 states and at least 17 reported worker deaths at eight plants in eight states.\n\n\"Since the beginning, food and meatpacking workers have been working at the front lines of this public health crisis,\" UFCW President Marc Perrone said in a virtual press conference on Thursday. \"While companies are taking steps to protect workers, we're not seeing the scope we need to protect these workers going forward.\"\n\nThe UFCW is calling on the White House Coronavirus Task Force to prioritize five safety measures for the meatpacking industry: increased worker testing; priority access to personal protection equipment; no longer giving processors waivers to bypass workplace rules on how quickly production lines are set; mandating social distancing; and isolating workers with COVID-19 symptoms or those who have tested positive.\n\n\"It was shoulder to shoulder at my workplace,\" said Achut Deng, a worker the past six years at a Smithfield Foods pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, who tested positive for COVID-19 in early April. Deng was diagnosed with the coronavirus disease several days after being sent home from work.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called on Smithfield to make substantial changes at its Sioux Falls plant, which is linked to hundreds of local COVID-19 cases and at least two deaths.\n\nOther meat companies around the U.S. are also contending with infected workers.\n\n\"Last week Cargill began giving us masks at work,\" said Itzel Goytia, employed at the agribusiness giant's meatpacking plant in Dodge City, Kansas. \"Social distancing is hard, if not impossible, in some areas of the plant, with hundreds of workers in and out every day.\"\n\nAll told, 13 plants have closed at some point in the last two months, affecting roughly 25,000 workers. That has reduced the nation's pork slaughter capacity by 25% and beef slaughter capacity 10%, the UFCW estimated.",

        "body": "15 children hospitalized in New York City with rare condition that could be linked to COVID-19\n\nFifteen children between the ages of 2 and 15 have been hospitalized in New York City with symptoms consistent with a rare disease possibly linked to the coronavirus. Health officials said the illness has features of Kawasaki disease, a serious illness first noted in children with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"A pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome, recently reported by authorities in the United Kingdom, is also being observed among children and young adults in New York City and elsewhere in the United States,\" said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner of the New York City Health Department's Division of Disease Control, in a public letter to colleagues Monday.\n\nAccording to Daskalakis, symptoms vary among the children depending on which organ system is affected, but \"include features of Kawasaki disease or features of shock.\" All of the children experienced a persistent fever, more than half reported rash, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea, and less than half experienced respiratory symptoms. He added, however, that \"the full spectrum of disease is not yet known.\"\n\nKawasaki disease is associated with fever, skin rashes, swelling of glands, and in severe cases it can inflame blood vessels within the heart.\n\nDr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician in New York City, told CBS News last week that she was \"not surprised\" by the U.K. report showing a possible link between COVID-19 and Kawasaki. According to Hes, children can sometimes develop the disease after a bout with a common cold, which is caused by a different variety of bug in the coronavirus family.\n\nShe added that Kawasaki could pop up \"weeks to months later\" after experiencing some kind of viral infection or \"multiple viral infections.\"\n\nThe cases reported in New York involved children who were hospitalized between April 17 and May 1 with \"illnesses compatible with\" a form of Kawasaki or shock, according to the New York City Health Department. More than half of the children required blood pressure support, and five required mechanical ventilation.\n\nThose who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units required cardiac and/or respiratory support, according to the health department. None of the children have died.\n\nFour of the 15 children tested positive for the coronavirus. Ten came back negative, and one was initially indeterminate and then negative. Serology testing showed that six patients with negative results had coronavirus antibodies in their blood, suggesting they had been infected earlier.\n\nRegardless of a coronavirus test result, the health department has urged doctors with patients under 21 years old and symptoms consistent with Kawasaki to immediately report those suspected cases to the health department. Doctors are also instructed to immediately refer such patients to a \"specialist in pediatric infectious disease, rheumatology, and/or critical care.\"\n\nOnly severe cases may have been recognized so far, according to the health department. Daskalakis wrote that \"early diagnosis and treatment of patients meeting full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease is critical to preventing end-organ damage and other long-term complications.\"",

        "body": "15 states now investigating child illness possibly linked to coronavirus, Cuomo says\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that 14 other states are now investigating cases of a mysterious illness appearing in children that is potentially related to the coronavirus. The governor urged parents to \"be aware\" of the inflammatory syndrome believed to be connected to COVID-19.\n\n\"If your child has been exposed to someone who had COVID, even if it was several weeks ago, that is a special alert in this situation,\" Cuomo said at his daily press conference Wednesday. \"Parents say 'should I be concerned?' You should be aware.\"\n\nNew York has now identified over 100 cases of the \"pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome.\" Doctors in the United Kingdom first noted cases of the syndrome, which appears to be similar to Kawasaki disease, a rare but serious illness seen in some children who have contracted a viral infection.\n\n\"New York is in many ways the tip of the arrow here,\" Cuomo said. \"(We are) looking at 102 cases where children who may have been infected with the COVID virus show symptoms of an inflammatory disease like Kawasaki Disease, or toxic shock-like syndrome.\"\n\nAccording to the governor, 14 other states, as well as Washington D.C. and five European countries, have reported cases. The states are: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Utah and Washington.\n\nThree children in New York, ages five, seven and 18, have died after showing symptoms of the illness. Of the state's 102 identified cases, 60% have tested positive for COVID-19 and 40% tested positive for its antibodies.\n\n\"That means children either currently have the virus, or could have had it several weeks ago,\" Cuomo said.\n\nA majority of the cases in New York, 70%, had to be treated in an intensive care unit, while 19% required intubation and 43% are still hospitalized. Cuomo said the cases have cropped up across the state and in a wide range of ages, with a majority in children between five and 14 years old.\n\nCases reported in New Jersey have a similar wide range in age: 3 to 18 years old, New Jersey Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli said at a separate press conference Wednesday. She said the state has received 18 reports of the syndrome from nine counties, and that four of the identified cases have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nNew York's Department of Health sent an alert to 49 other states on Monday, notifying them of syndrome's correlation with COVID-19. At the time, only 85 cases had been reported in New York.\n\nThe governor noted on Wednesday that it was only recently that public health officials believed children to be safe from contracting the coronavirus.\n\n\"We thought that children were not especially affected by the virus, to now find out that they might be, and it might be several weeks later, this is truly disturbing,\" he said.\n\nCuomo said that because the syndrome may not show up until weeks after coronavirus infection, and does not present as a normal COVID-19 case, it may not have been initially diagnosed as related to the virus.\n\nCOVID-19 symptoms are predominantly respiratory; but the Kawasaki-like syndrome seen in children appears to be caused by an inflammation of blood vessels, presenting cardiac symptoms. Predominant symptoms include prolonged fever, abdominal pain and a skin rash. Afflicted children, however, have also shown had changes in skin color (becoming, pale, patchy, or blue), difficulty feeding (for infants), difficulty breathing, a racing heart, as well as lethargy, irritability or confusion.\n\nAccording to the governor, the state's department of health has told hospitals to prioritize COVID-19 testing for children who come in with any of the symptoms related to the inflammatory syndrome.",

    "2 pet cats test positive for COVID-19 in New York - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Two pet cats in New York state have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that has claimed more than 180,000 lives globally, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). This comes after several lions and tigers contracted the disease at the Bronx Zoo earlier this month.\n\nThe USDA said these are the first pets in the U.S. to test positive for COVID-19. They had mild respiratory illnesses and are expected to recover. Officials say the cats may have contracted the disease from people in their households or neighborhoods. The pets lived in separate areas in New York, the USDA pointed out.\n\n\"... A veterinarian tested the first cat after it showed mild respiratory signs. No individuals in the household were confirmed to be ill with COVID-19,\" USDA said in its press release. \"The virus may have been transmitted to this cat by mildly ill or asymptomatic household members or through contact with an infected person outside its home.\"\n\nIn the case of the second feline, the owner of the cat tested positive for COVID-19 prior to the cat showing signs. Another cat in the household has shown no signs of illness, according to the USDA.\n\nThe testing used to confirm the cats were positive for coronavirus is different than the procedure used on humans. Health officials say that while some animals can become infected by people, there's so far little evidence that animals are transmitting the disease to humans.\n\nA Malayan tiger at the Bronx Zoo contracted COVID-19 in early April. Handout / Wildlife Conservation Society's Bronx Zoo\n\nWhen the infections at the Bronx Zoo were revealed, health officials said the big cats got sick from being exposed to a zoo employee who had COVID-19, but was asymptomatic. No other animals at the zoo had any coronavirus symptoms.\n\nAt the time, the USDA said the Bronx Zoo's tiger was the \"first case of its kind\" and \"further studies are needed to understand if and how different animals could be affected by COVID-19.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said a small number of pets outside the U.S. have been reported to be infected with the virus after close contact with people with COVID-19 -- but not the other way around. \"We do not have evidence that companion animals, including pets, can spread COVID-19 to people or that they might be a source of infection in the United States,\" the CDC says.\n\nIn a study published in Science, scientists from Harbin Veterinary Research Institute intentionally exposed groups of cats, dogs, ferrets, pigs, chickens and ducks to the new coronavirus, and found some animals are more susceptible than others.\n\nFortunately for dogs, the researchers found that man's best friend has a low susceptibility to the virus. Livestock including pigs, chickens and ducks also did not appear to be significantly affected by it.\n\nHowever, both ferrets and indeed cats do appear to be susceptible to infection, the study finds. To determine this, researchers inserted the virus, SARS-CoV-2, into the noses of five domestic cats. Three of the infected cats were put in cages next to uninfected ones. The researchers later found the virus in one of the exposed cats, suggesting it contracted the virus from droplets in the breath of the infected cats nearby.\n\nThe four cats that had coronavirus also developed antibodies against the virus. The researchers say knowledge of how the virus replicates in animals could be helpful in efforts to develop treatments for COVID-19 in humans. However, the study also raises many other questions.\n\nFor one thing, this experimental study might not mimic the way germs are spread in real life, Dr. Ann Hohenhaus, an internal medicine and small animal veterinarian at New York City's Animal Medical Center, told CBS News. \"They took a known amount of virus and squirted it up the nose of the animals they were testing,\" she explained.\n\n\"When you do research, you got to start somewhere, so that was a big dose of the virus right up the nose. And I don't think there's anybody who thinks that mimics the situation out there of you and your pet in an apartment in New York City,\" Hohenhaus said, adding the study was an important step in the research of coronavirus and animals.\n\nThe CDC and USDA have told pet owners to \"wash your hands before you touch your pet, wash your hands after you touch your pet. If you're sick, wear a mask ... you should not take care of your pet and find a surrogate to take care of your pet so that you can quarantine yourself away from everyone in the family, which includes all pets,\" Hohenhaus said.",

    "2020 Daily Trail Markers: COVID-19 may have slowed Biden's campaign expansion": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In the past when presidential candidates became the presumptive nominees of their party, they quickly hired staff to expand their operations for the general election. But this year, the COVID-19 pandemic may have slowed that process for Joe Biden. Several Democratic campaign operatives looking to join the nominee's campaign disclosed to CBS News that they had been told a \"hiring freeze\" was occurring inside the Biden HQ.\n\nIt's not unusual for the winning campaign to reach out to senior staff of former rivals to mine for hires ahead of the general election. But several senior staffers on former Democratic campaigns said they were not yet aware of wide-scale plans to bring on their former staff. Former Clinton, Romney and McCain campaign managers spoke to CBS News about the expansion process and added it may not be a bad idea to pause hiring to assess where resources should best be spent later this year.\n\nCalling it \"one of the worst policy mistakes any president has made in our history,\" former vice president Joe Biden's campaign is intensifying its criticism of President Trump's leadership of the government's response to the coronavirus by focusing on four key areas of concern. A memo obtained by CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe and sent to campaign allies and leading party activists outlines how the Biden team plans to continue sowing doubts about the president's leadership. The sharper focus comes as Biden in recent days has said that Mr. Trump \"has no interest in solving this problem and saving lives\" and has outlined a series of specific steps he would have taken to better organize a federal response to the pandemic. News of the memo was first reported by Axios.\n\nLate last night Biden joined \"The Late Show with James Corden\" and continued to hint that his choice for a running mate could come before the end of the summer. Biden predicted the background searches into his short list of potential candidates could be completed by July, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. He said his campaign is hoping to announce his vetting committee by May 1.\n\nBut on Wednesday, the campaign pushed two endorsements to coordinate with the 50th anniversary of Earth Day. First, Washington Governor Jay Inslee endorsed Biden, and then Biden was joined by Al Gore for a discussion on what could be done to combat climate change if Biden were to be elected. Gore said it was a \"no-brainer\" for voters if they are concerned about climate to vote for Biden because President Trump is the \"face of climate denial.\" Both Biden and Gore proposed that ramping up investment of green jobs, like solar panel installers and wind turbine engineers, could be an opportunity to help the economy bounce back after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\n\nAs the Trump administration issues guidelines for states seeking to reopen, the president and his re-election campaign are keeping close watch of senior citizens. CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga says President Trump tweeted this morning, with a special message to \"beloved seniors,\" a vulnerable population amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"States are safely coming back. Our Country is starting to OPEN FOR BUSINESS again,\" the President wrote, adding, \"Special care is, and always will be, given to our beloved seniors (except me!). Their lives will be better than ever...WE LOVE YOU ALL!\"\n\nRecent polls are showing presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden is gaining ground among the 65 and older crowd. In an NBC/WSJ poll released this week, Biden led Trump by 9 points among the group, (52 to 43 percent.) The new poll stands in stark contrast to the 2016 general election, when Hillary Clinton lost seniors by 7 points to Trump (52 to 45 percent).\n\n\"Seniors and especially those in a more vulnerable population want to see their government protecting them,\" Trump campaign spokeswoman Erin Perrine told The Hill Wednesday. \"There's no one out their protecting the American people more than President Trump. He says day in and day out - through action and work - that the health and safety of the American people is a top priority.\" According to CDC data, senior citizens over the age of 65 years accounted for over 45% of nationwide coronavirus-associated hospitalizations during the month of March.\n\nStacey Abrams continues to be explicit about her desire to be Joe Biden's running mate, and today she showed that she's read-in on Biden's talking points. \"I think I would be very effective in restoring the soul of America,\" she said on ABC's \"The View,\" mirroring Biden's signature line.\n\nCBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte says Abrams was asked if it would be a \"slap in the face\" to black female voters if Biden did not choose a black vice president. She dodged the question, saying she shared that concern, but believes Biden would make \"a smart choice,\" adding that the pick should reflect America.\n\nMost of the interview focused on Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and President Trump, whom the hosts and Abrams criticized. Abrams said that Kemp's desire to reopen the state shows that he and others are \"focused on wining the next election than focusing on the needs of the people now.\" She added that Kemp is prioritizing the economy over Georgian lives.\n\nELIZABETH WARREN\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday led nine Democratic senators in calling for \"broad investigations\" into whether the Trump administration has driven decisions about the distribution of emergency supplies with \"electoral concerns.\"\n\nCBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak says the senators questioned the motives behind the administration's fulfillment of a request for aid from Florida, a battleground state.\n\n\"This confusion has been exacerbated by President Trump's public statements suggesting that governors' political support for his administration could influence how much support they receive from the federal government,\" they wrote in a letter to Inspectors General of HHS and FEMA. In a second letter to the Pandemic Response Accountability Committee, Warren and Senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey asked for an investigation into reports the Trump Administration delayed stimulus payments to put President Trump's name on the checks. They also wrote that President Trump, \"has inserted crass political propaganda into his public briefings. [...] Together, these incidents appear to indicate that the Trump Administration has infused political and partisan interests into its response to both the public health and economic crises.\"\n\nGRETCHEN WHITMER\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer said at her briefing this afternoon that the state will likely need another \"short term extension\" of the stay-home order. The current order expires at the end of the month. \"We will have a plan and we will start to share that in more depth as we get closer to next week,\" Whitmer said. \"Michiganders will still need to stay home unless they're doing things that are explicitly permitted by the order. We got to get this right.\"\n\nAmid speculation that she is on a shortlist to become former Vice President Joe Biden's running mate, CBS News campaign reporters Adam Brewster and Jack Turman report that Whitmer's latest challenge is working with a Republican-controlled legislature that is anxious to start re-engaging sectors of Michigan's economy. Republicans in the state House and Senate have already released their own plans to ease stay at home restrictions.\n\nWhitmer also addressed the contract her administration had awarded to two firms with Democratic ties, but was later canceled. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services announced on Monday that they would contract with Great Lakes Community Engagement and EveryAction Van, which is the nonprofit arm of NGP Van. NGP Van's website says it is the \"leading technology provider to Democratic and progressive campaigns.\"\n\nWhitmer said when she discovered this, it was her decision to cancel it. \"This was an unnecessary distraction. And I think that leadership is about solving problems,\" she said. Asked how much data the firms had access to, Whitmer replied, \"I don't believe that much had even gotten started at all, frankly.\"\n\nToday, Bloomberg Philanthropies, of former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced a new COVID-19 contact tracing program. The program will focus on testing individuals for COVID-19 and interviewing the person to identify people they may have been in contact with as an effort to slow down the spread of the virus.\n\nAccording to CBS News campaign reporter Tim Perry, Bloomberg's organization will commit $10.5 million as well as organizational and technical support to help build and execute the program. Part of this support will go to the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, which is building an online curriculum and training program for contact tracers.\n\n\"We're all eager to begin loosening restrictions on our daily lives and our economy. But in order to do that as safely as possible, we first have to put in place systems to identify people who may have been exposed to the virus and support them as they isolate.\" Bloomberg said in a statement.\n\nThe contact tracing program will also be coordinated with New Jersey and Connecticut. Governor Andrew Cuomo today called the program \"unprecedented\" and \"nation-leading\" and said it will serve as a model for the rest of the nation. \"The numbers indicate we are past the apex of this pandemic, and while we start our work to re-open our economy we must ensure we are doing it in a way that does no harm and does not undo all of the work and sacrifice it has taken to get here.\" Cuomo said.\n\nNew polling shows Joe Biden leading in Florida - thanks in part to higher marks on how he would handle health care and a crisis. According to the Quinnipiac University Poll, Biden leads Trump 46% to 42%. According to voters in the Sunshine State, Biden is viewed as the candidate who would do a better job on healthcare, 54% to 39%.\n\nCBS News political unit associate producer Sarah Ewall-Wice says the polling also finds that amid the coronavirus, Florida voters believe Biden would do a better job handling a crisis 50% to 43%. However, Trump still leads on the economy. Florida voters believed he would do a better job of handling the economy than Biden, 50% to 44%.\n\nNEVADA\n\nNevada's Republican secretary of state now faces another court challenge over its upcoming all-mail primary, with a Texas-based \"voters' rights organization\" asking a federal court late Tuesday to declare the plan unconstitutional. The suit, first reported by The Nevada Independent, is funded by the same group behind a similar lawsuit in New Mexico over that state's attempt to shift to an all-mail primary.\n\nNew Mexico's plans were eventually rejected by that state's supreme court. Meanwhile in Democrats' lawsuit against the secretary of state, filed last week, Republicans asked Nevada judge Wednesday to allow them to intervene as defendants. Only GOP candidates are facing competitive intra-party primaries on June 9, though Democrats insist expanding mail-ballot access is crucial ahead of the November election. \"It's no surprise they are now targeting Nevada in their nationwide movement to disenfranchise voters when they've struggled to remain relevant in our state through fair elections,\" William McCurdy II, chair of the Nevada State Democratic Party, told CBS News campaign reporter Alex Tin in a statement.\n\nSOUTH CAROLINA\n\nThe South Carolina Democratic Party joined the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in filing a lawsuit with the state's Supreme Court Wednesday, calling for provisions that the groups say would ensure the safety of millions of voters ahead of the state's primary in June. CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell says the lawsuit asks in part that the Court determines that voters who practice social distancing during this pandemic can qualify as \"physically disabled person[s]\" who are eligible to vote absentee. The lawsuit also urges the state Supreme Court to recognize that COVID-19 \"severely threatens the administration of elections\" and voters' rights to free and open elections.\n\n\"It is the height of recklessness to ask volunteers to risk their lives staffing polls and precincts when the Republicans controlling our government have the ability to take action and protect lives by eliminating the qualifications for absentee voting and transition to a mail-in voting program,\" said SCDP Chair Trav Robertson in an emailed statement.\n\nSeparately, the American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU of South Carolina, and NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday challenging a state requirement that forces voters to have a third-party witness signature on their ballot envelope in order to vote absentee. The lawsuit is also challenging South Carolina's \"excuse\" requirement, which doesn't provide an option for eligible voters to vote absentee during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\n\"The state's requirement that a witness sign an absentee ballot will endanger vulnerable voters by forcing them to leave their homes and interact with others,\" said NAACP LDF senior counsel Deuel Ross in a statement. \"Election officials must act to prevent the spread of COVID-19 by both broadly expanding absentee voting options and making in-person voting as safe and accessible as possible.\" The ACLU of South Carolina Legal director Susan Dunn added in a statement, \"Without action from the courts, South Carolina's June primaries will force people to choose between their health and their right to vote, a decision no one should have to make.\"\n\nWISCONSIN\n\nWisconsin health officials have now identified 19 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 who either voted in the April 7 election or served as a poll worker. But CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster says it's not clear yet if those cases were contracted at polling sites.\n\n\"So far, 19 people who tested COVID-19 positive after April 9 have reported that they voted in person or worked the polls on election day; several of those people reported other possible exposures as well,\" Jennifer Miller, a Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) spokesperson, told CBS News in a statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"Since we only have data on positive cases (without a comparison group of people who were not tested or tested negative), there is no way to know with certainty if any exposures at the polls that are reported are in fact attributable to COVID-19 illness.\"\n\nWisconsin DHS Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk told reporters during the briefing on Wednesday afternoon that the state continues to monitor people who test positive for COVID-19 to see if they participated in the election two weeks ago. She said health officials should have a better idea of how many people may have been exposed on election day over the next week.\n\n\"We would generally expect anyone who would have had an exposure on April 7 to have exhibited symptoms by April 21, which was yesterday,\" Willems Van Dijk said. \"I would anticipate that over the next week we would be clearing out any reports of positive cases that also reported voting or working as a poll worker.\" Major General Paul Knapp, Wisconsin's Adjutant General and Commander of the Wisconsin National Guard, said Wednesday that five national guard members showed symptoms of COVID-19 after working the polls. Only one of those members was tested and the results came back negative. More than 2,400 Wisconsin National Guard members served as poll workers during the April 7 election after communities around the state reported a severe shortage of election workers.",

    "2020 Daily Trail Markers: Catherine Cortez Masto has stayed out of the veepstakes limelight. Does even she want the job?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "While what's going on behind the scenes mostly remains unknown, in public, voters have seen an outpouring of affection for a job John Nance Garner declared was worth less than \"a bucket of warm piss.\" Garner was Franklin Roosevelt's vice president. Some of the women vying to be Joe Biden's running mate have appeared on late-night talk show appearances, been profiled in glossy magazines, and announced outright that they'd accept the job. That's not the case for Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, who has stayed out of the limelight and yet remains on most lists as a possible running mate for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden. Why? On paper, Cortez Masto seems like the key to a golden ticket. However, multiple sources tell CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte that Cortez Masto might not be interested.\n\nWhile prominent Democrats have advocated for Biden to pick a black running mate, Cortez Masto's background would offer diversity, too. Picking a Latina could be helpful to Biden, who has struggled to win over Latino voters during the primaries. Latino Decisions conducted a recent poll that showed Biden losing ground with Latino voters: 59% said they support or lean towards him, down from 67% in February. Cortez Masto, 56, has the kind of resume that puts her on par with other potential running mates. From 1999 to 2001, she served as a criminal prosecutor for the U.S. attorney in Washington, D.C. Later, in 2007, like Senator Kamala Harris in California, Cortez Masto became state attorney general. It was during her tenure AG that she forged a relationship with Beau Biden, Joe Biden's late son and the former Attorney General of Delaware. That relationship brought Joe Biden and Cortez Masto together in October 2016. He campaigned for her in Las Vegas, eighteen months after his son's untimely death. Biden spoke about his son's relationship with Cortez Masto at length on the trail, telling voters, \"My son had, really, very good judgment. And my son truly, truly, truly admired Catherine.\"\n\nEven with her credible resume, it's possible she's not interested. She has in the past said she's not interested in the job. In November, while taking questions from the press at Nevada Democrats' \"First In the West'' dinner, she told CBS News that she would say no if offered the job of running mate. CBS News reached out Cortez Masto's office to see if her opinion has changed. They did not respond. A source with close knowledge of Cortez Masto's political team confirmed to CBS News that she's \"not actively campaigning\" to be Biden's running mate -- a trait that, this year, seems to set her apart.\n\nJOE BIDEN\n\nJoe Biden was once again off the virtual trail on Monday, but he is scheduled to appear at a virtual fundraiser later in the evening. CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson first reported this weekend that the campaign held its highest-grossing fundraiser yet on Friday evening with California Governor Gavin Newsom, bringing in $2.7 million dollars in just one evening. The campaign also announced on Monday the joint fundraising amount between the campaign and the Democratic National Committee brought in $60.5 million in April. This amount was all brought in via online donations or virtual high-dollar fundraisers. On Monday in a Washington Post op-ed, Biden argued Mr. Trump is putting forth a \"childish\" tactic of trying to \"divide\" Americans to choose between opening up the economy or focusing on public health. With this binary choice, Biden continues to paint Mr. Trump as not caring about others: \"They knew exactly how to make the Oval Office safe and operational, and they put in the work to do it... They just haven't put in that same work for the rest of us.\" Biden also welcomed the wonkiness of the #YangGang to his campaign podcast, \"Here's the Deal.\" Biden and Andrew Yang talked like econ bros (with frequent \"Yeah, man\"s) about how to get people safely back to work. Yang did not hold back on his advice to Biden: He said the economy should enter a \"temporary Rip Van Winkle period\" and in the meantime, the U.S. should put together a \"Marshall Plan\" to get the country back up and running. Biden enthusiastically agreed. Once Biden can get back to campaigning, Yang said Biden should go and join Mike Rowe on Dirty Jobs to embrace and advertise in-demand labor jobs that pay well. \"These are awesome jobs!\" Yang said\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\n\n\"I don't think the system broke down at all,\" Mr. Trump told reporters Monday in the Rose Garden, after least three senior officials leading the nation's coronavirus response have begun self-quarantine and two White House personnel -- one of President Trump's personal valets and Katie Miller, a spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence -- tested positive for coronavirus. \"I think we've controlled it very well. We have hundreds and hundreds of people a day pouring in to the White House,\" the President said, noting that he felt \"no vulnerability at all\" after the positive cases were detected. The president added he will consider separating himself from Pence in the days to come. \"We can talk on the phone,\" Mr. Trump told reporters.\n\nThe Trump administration issued a new memo Monday requiring all White House personnel to wear masks at all times, except when seated at their desks. All White House employees received an email on Friday that includes the language \"practice maximum telework\" and \"work remotely if at all possible,\" CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang reports. \"I did, I required it,\" the President told reporters Friday during a coronavirus briefing. A senior White House official confirmed that testing within the West Wing will expand starting today and the number of White House personnel needing to be near the president and vice president will be limited going forward, reports CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett. The White House medical unit is also requiring all visitors, press, and White House staff to do temperature checks at the security gates before they are allowed on-campus, report CBS News White House producers Arden Farhi and Sara Cook. The White House started temperature checks for those in close proximity to the president and vice president on March 14, and these checks were expanded campus-wide on March 16. The White House began to do \"regular testing\" for COVID-19 on April 3 for guests in close proximity to the president. Following the positive test by the Mr. Trump's valet, the White House instituted daily testing for White House staffers in close proximity to the President and Vice President.\n\nMr. Trump on Monday rebuked Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Twitter, accusing the Democratic state executive of delaying his states' reopening to hurt the president's re-election campaign, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports. \"Don't play politics,\" Mr. Trump tweeted Monday. \"The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails.\" Asked to clarify his statement, Mr. Trump said on Monday, \"There just seems to be no effort on certain blue states to get back into gear. The people aren't going to stand for it. They want to get back. They're not going to stand for it.\" The president announced the federal government will distribute $11 billion authorized by the CARES Act to the states for increased testing. \"If someone wants to be tested right now, they'll be able to get tested,\" the President said.\n\nThe Trump campaign's latest eight-figure ad blitz targeting Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has officially begun, according to Sganga. The Trump campaign tested over 30 Facebook advertisements attacking the former Vice President on his diplomatic stance toward China and mental acuity, today alone. According to Kantar/CMAG, the president's re-election campaign spent over $5 million on local television airwaves through May 19, with nearly half invested in the key battleground state of Florida.\n\nPence and Dr. Deborah Birx, appearing from separate rooms within the White House complex, held a teleconference call with state governors today, according to one participant on the call. CBS News political correspondent Ed O'Keefe and campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar report the Trump administration is pushing to increase testing for COVID-19 and recommending that more than 1 million nursing residents and staff be tested in the coming weeks. Pence also announced that positive cases are dropping nationally including in the New York metro area, which has gone from 12,000 positive cases per day to about 2,800 per day. Administration officials are worried about a rising number of cases in the Twin Cities, where positive tests have gone from less than 100 per day to 400 per day in the past week. Three states - Minnesota, South Dakota and Maryland as well as Washington, D.C. - have 20% or more testing positive. With the exception of Nebraska, which has outbreaks in prisons, every other state is trending downwards. One participant on the call noted that signs of social distancing were obvious. Pence was in the situation room, Birx was in a separate area, and other administration officials joined by telephone. \"They are really social distancing today. Most of them on a phone. Birx and Pence alone in different rooms,\" said the person familiar who was granted anonymity to speak frankly about the call. \"When they were setting up prior to the start they were wearing masks,\" the person added. This comes after Pence's press secretary tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday. But, a spokesperson for Pence said on Sunday that the vice president \"is not in quarantine,\" and has \"tested negative every single day.\"\n\nIowa Governor Kim Reynolds announced today that she will go into a \"modified quarantine\" after being near a White House staffer testing positive for coronavirus, last week, CBS News correspondent Nikole Killion reports. Reynolds visited the president at the White House and hosted Pence in Iowa on Friday, along with Senators Chuck Grassley and Joni Ernst. Reynolds said she is healthy and \"feeling fine\" without any symptoms. \"However, out of an abundance of caution,\" said the governor, \"I will follow a modified quarantine plan similar to what Dr. Fauci and other White House administration members have announced that they're doing.\" The Iowa governor confirmed she will follow a modified quarantine plan, similar to Dr. Anthony Fauci's course of action after also coming into \"low risk\" contact with a White House staffer testing positive. She added that she will be tested daily and was negative as of this morning.\n\nTAMMY BALDWIN\n\nSenator Tammy Baldwin is \"in regular contact with the Biden campaign,\" she said on CBSN Monday. \"I want to make sure that that Vice President Biden becomes the next president of the United States,\" she told CBSN's Tanya Rivero, who asked whether she'd join Joe Biden's team. According to CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak, Baldwin said she has advised Biden's campaign on the battle brewing in her home state of Wisconsin, which Mr. Trump won narrowly in 2016, \"but I keep my counsel with the vice president's campaign private.\" Baldwin also said every woman deserves to be heard, but she agrees with Biden's handling thus far of allegations of sexual assault made against him by a former Senate staffer. \"I also have heard Vice President Biden very directly asked about these allegations, deny them firmly, and go the next step of saying if you can find any complaint that was ever filed in the senate against him that he clears that for public disclosure.\" she said. \"And I agree with him, and I think that is the next step.\"\n\nBERNIE SANDERS\n\nBernie Sanders joined The Washington Post's Robert Costa this morning discuss Biden and COVID-19 relief. CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte says Sanders was asked about Elizabeth Warren being a potential running mate who could make the ticket more progressive. \"Elizabeth is an outstanding U.S. Senator and I think she would be a great choice if she was someone Biden feels comfortable with,\" said Sanders. He went onto joke that picking a VP was \"not quite like getting married\" but had a lot to do with \"personal chemistry.\" Sanders continued to knock Mr. Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republican leadership for their COVID relief efforts, calling the response so far \"atrocious\". Sanders said Mr. Trump has members of the task force (excluding Dr. Fauci) \"under his thumb\" and the president is therefore negatively influencing the response. Finally, on policy Sanders said that he will continue to try to push Biden further to the left. He also noted that he hopes Biden will choose progressives for his theoretical Cabinet, and embrace Medicare for All. Asked about some of his supporters being weary of Biden, Sanders said, \"On his worst day, Joe's 1000 times better than Trump on his best day, so I'm strongly supporting Joe.\"\n\nNORTH CAROLINA\n\nThe North Carolina Democratic Party announced Monday that in partnership with the Democratic Coordinated Campaign, the group made more than 22,000 phone calls to voters during its first-ever Digital Day of Action. More than 100 volunteers helped make the calls over a two-day span this past weekend, according to CBS News campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell. \"Even as the coronavirus pandemic has limited some forms of traditional campaigning, we continue to see overwhelming excitement and support at the grass roots level across North Carolina,\" said NCDP Executive Director Meredith Cuomo. \"These impressive figures are just the latest demonstration of the enthusiasm our Party is seeing, and Republicans up and down the ballot should be nervous,\" she said. Cuomo added that the NCDP will continue to digitally organize and look for ways to virtually engage voters across the state. Already the state Democratic party has had to develop virtual organizing and fundraising events in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The NCDP announced in April that there was record turnout during its county conventions that were held virtually. The latest effort over the weekend was done in conjunction with the Democratic Coordinated Campaign, which is a joint effort between the Democratic National Committee, the NCDP, and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden's campaign. According to the NCDP press release, the Coordinated Campaign has hired more than 50 full-time organizers in North Carolina to date. And in April, the group reportedly made more than 200,000 calls and recruited nearly 400 volunteers.\n\nWISCONSIN\n\nWisconsin will hold its second election during the COVID-19 pandemic on Tuesday, according CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster. The special election in Wisconsin's 7th Congressional District, a large, mostly rural district in the northwestern part of the state, features Republicans trying to defend a seat vacated by former Congressman Sean Duffy, who resigned for family reasons. Democrats held the district for 40 years until Duffy won the seat in 2010. Mr. Trump won the district by 20 points in 2016, but in the April election, the conservative state Supreme Court candidate beat the liberal candidate by 6 points, according the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. Election officials have encouraged people to vote by mail during the special election. As of Monday morning, more than 76,000 absentee ballots have been returned in the election, or about two-thirds of the ballots requested. Nearly 190,000 votes were cast in the district during the April 7 presidential primary in the district. Governor Tony Evers has cited the rural makeup of the 7th District, and likely shorter lines at polls, as a reason he felt comfortable keeping the special election in place. Still, he told reporters on Monday that he'll define success based on the safety precautions taking place. \"Success for me, it would be to have everybody, not only poll workers be protected and doing the things they need to do to be protected, but also the people that are voting\" Evers said. The stretch has been exhausting for local officials, who have been tasked with administering back-to-back elections with large increases in mail voting. \"We're not even done with this other one, we had to wait a whole week before we could finish up elections and get results,\" Rhineland City Clerk Valerie Foley told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. \"So it's hard on the officials, the clerks, it's hard on everybody.\"\n\nAND THE NOMINEES ARE...\n\nThe Libertarian National Committee decided they will nominate their official presidential ticket on May 22 through an online session, reports CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. The party has also scheduled an in-person convention in Orlando from July 8 through July 12, which will be at a venue \"with enough contiguous space to provide for personal distancing.\" Congressman Justin Amash, a Republican turned Independent and now Libertarian, is the most well-known candidate for the party. Amash announced his exploratory committee in late April, and went head-to-head with four other Libertarian candidates in a debate Saturday night. Among the topics discussed include efforts to help down ballot Libertarian candidates, the government response to COVID-19 and abortion. Amash was also asked about his Congressional campaign website still being up, and he responded that he's not planning to going back to that campaign. During the debate Amash, who currently represents Michigan's 3rd district, also called out Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's executive orders, saying \"it doesn't make sense to have a one-size-fits-all approach.\" \"We need to make sure that we're restoring power to the people, that the people make the decisions. That we don't have a government telling us exactly how to manage every situation,\" he said.\n\nIN THE HOUSE\n\nIn California's 25th district special election, Republicans were outraged throughout the weekend after the L.A. County Registrar-Recorder announced a new voting center in Lancaster, California, after a request by the Republican Mayor R. Rex Parris and the Los Angeles Democratic Party. A memo was sent out to all House Republicans Saturday morning by National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer, asking members to help with \"raising hell\" about the new center. In the memo, Republicans argued the center is not necessary due to registered voters already being mailed a ballot that it was an attempt to \"steal\" the election because of the Democratic support in the area. Democrats have defended the move, pointing to the support from Parris and that the resource the center provides is for voters in a diverse district to drop off their mail ballots, request a new one or register to vote. In the end, the new voting center may not make a notable impact, Political Data Inc. Vice President Paul Mitchell told CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro. \"This is a tempest in a teapot in the middle of a desert during a pandemic,\" he said. Republican candidate Mark Garcia currently leads Democrat Christy Smith in early ballot returns by over 10,500 votes. Mr. Trump and National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer were still vexed about the issue Monday morning. Emmer appeared on Fox News to criticize the new center, and Trump Tweeted in support of Garcia. \"Dems are trying to steal the Mike Garcia Congressional Race in California. Republicans, get out and VOTE for your terrific candidate, ASAP!\" Smith, who has received some last minute social media pushes from Senator Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, responded by criticizing Mr. Trump's pandemic response. \"Mr. Pres, Put on a face covering and do your job. Where are the tests? Why did you hide the CDC recos? What's your PLAN to help families and businesses recover? America is coming for you at the ballot box in November, starting with #CA25,\" she tweeted. California's 25th and Wisconsin's 7th districts have their elections Tuesday, though fuller results could come throughout the week due to the sheer amount of absentee ballots.\n\nRepublican Senator Ben Sasse's reelection campaign aired an ad Monday morning highlighting a tweet from President Trump criticizing him, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson. In the ad, the narrator says that Sasse's independent thinking has ticked off everyone from \"the radical left to every now and then, even the president of his own party.\" The ad showcases a tweet from Mr. Trump in 2016 that says, @BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U.S. Senator. How the hell did he ever get elected?\" Sasse was critical of then candidate Trump in 2016 but has since earned the endorsement of Mr. Trump in a tweet in 2019. The ad finishes by touting Sasse as \"Conservative. Independent. Straight-Shooter.\" The Cook Political Report rates Sasse's seat as \"Solid Republican.\"",

    "2020 Daily Trail Markers: Tara Reade speaks after Biden denies assault allegations": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In her first on-camera interview since Joe Biden denied her allegations against him last Friday, Tara Reade addressed Biden directly in her interview with Megyn Kelly, CBS News campaign reporter Bo Erickson reports. \"You and I were there Joe Biden, please step forward and be held accountable. You should not be running on character for the president of the United States,\" Reade said. Asked if she wanted an apology, Reade offered, \"I think it's a little late.\"\n\nReade, who worked as a staffer in Biden's Senate office in the early 1990s, went into greater detail about the alleged assault in her interview with Kelly, though she was still uncertain about the precise location where it occurred.\n\n\"I remember going down the Russell building floors, and so I don't know if I was in the first floor or the basement but there's corridors that lead to the Capitol and that kind of thing,\" Reade said. It was a weekday, she affirmed to Kelly. She said that when she caught up with Biden, he greeted her by name, and she handed him the forgotten gym bag. In fact, as she was \"being pushed up against the wall,\" Reade said she remembered thinking, \"where's the bag?\"\n\nShe also said she \"wishes\" Biden would drop out of the presidential race but admitted she does not think he would do so. \"His campaign is taking this position that they want all women to be able to speak safely, I have not experienced that,\" Reade told Kelly, highlighting that her social media was \"hacked,\" her personal information has been \"dragged,\" and that she feared for her safety due to previous public posts she made about Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"Even the whole thing with being called a Russian agent...that incites people, people actually -- I got a death threat from that because people thought I was being a trader to America.\"\n\nNearly an hour after his virtual town hall in Tampa was scheduled to begin, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden began remarks that were hard to hear because of persistent technical difficulties. Campaign reporter LaCrai Mitchell reports that the virtual rally was riddled with technical issues that left the live stream picture completely black at one point during Florida Congressman Charlie Crist's introductory remarks.\n\nDuring brief remarks -- which lasted about 6 minutes -- Biden discussed the impact of COVID-19 on small minority-owned businesses and took hits at president Trump's handling of the public health crisis, calling him and his \"handlers\" incompetent. The former vice president also highlighted the issues surrounding Florida's processing of unemployment claims, saying that former Florida governor Rick Scott \"hollowed out\" the system.\n\nThe virtual rally in Tampa marked the end of Biden's first virtual \"travel\" day to the battleground state of Florida since the COVID-19 outbreak put an abrupt end to in-person political events. In March, the campaign canceled visits to Miami and Tampa due to concerns surrounding the coronavirus. A Florida Democratic Party spokesperson told Mitchell that the virtual events show Biden's commitment to the state and is a way for him to make sure he has a strong and active presence with Florida voters.\n\n\"Something that's important that Joe Biden and his team understands and is really working towards, is realizing how diverse Florida is and making sure he's listening to and speaking with every single community in Florida,\" said an FLDP spokesperson.\"\n\nAccording to a pool report item sent out by the campaign Thursday afternoon, Biden repeated comments that he's made about the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, at the start of the virtual roundtable he held with black leaders in Jacksonville earlier. Arbery was a young unarmed black man who was shot and killed after encountering two armed white men during a jog in his neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia, in Feburary.\n\nThe pool report item sent by the campaign said that during the roundtable, Biden compared the video of Arbery's shooting to seeing him \"lynched before our very eyes\" before adding that Arbery's family deserves \"a swift, full and transparent investigation\" into the shooting.\n\nIn spite of unforeseen technical glitches, Mitchell reports that the live stream in Tampa began with as many as 2.5k participants tuned in on one platform -- 2.4k viewed from YouTube -- and ended with 700+ viewers still watching. Tampa is a popular stop for candidates because of its location along the famed \"I-4 corridor,\" which some say is the region of the state that picks presidents.\n\nIn 2016, Donald Trump narrowly won Florida by 1.2% of the votes cast. Both Biden and Mr. Trump won every Florida county in the state's Democratic and Republican primary contests, respectively, in March. A recent Fox News poll showed Biden ahead of the president by 3 points among registered voters in Florida.\n\n\"Joe Biden is giving Trump a run for his money in Florida,\" said an FLDP spokesperson. \"Going into 2020, a lot of people thought that Trump just had Florida on lock but I think Joe Biden is proving that that's not the case.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden is giving Trump a run for his money in Florida,\" said an FLDP spokesperson. \"Going into 2020, a lot of people thought that Trump just had Florida on lock but I think Joe Biden is proving that that's not the case.\"\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP\n\nThe Trump campaign is poised to launch a $10 million national advertisement campaign targeting presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden, CBS News campaign reporter Nicole Sganga reports. According to a campaign spokesperson, the effort will span cable, broadcast and online platforms.\n\nTrump campaign manager Brad Parscale previewed the onslaught on Twitter Thursday, declaring the ad blitz a \"death star.\" Parscale wrote, \"In a few days we start pressing FIRE for the first time.\"\n\nThe move to target Biden on television airwaves marks a shift in the president's re-election campaign strategy. With the coronavirus pandemic dominating national news, the campaign is cautiously drawing attention toward the Democratic rival, six months ahead of Election Day.\n\nA member of the U.S. military assigned to the White House as a valet has tested positive for the coronavirus, the White House confirmed to the CBS News White House unit Thursday.\n\nPresident Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have been tested again since learning of this person's diagnosis and the tests came back negative, according to the president.\n\n\"Testing not a perfect art,\" Mr. Trump said in the Oval Office Thursday afternoon. Trump said the White House would begin testing personnel once a day, but added he had very little \"personal contact\" with the valet. \"I know who he is, he is a good person. But I had very little contact. Mike has had very little contact with him,\" the president added, in reference to Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nSeparately, White House counselor Kellyanne Conway rebuked anti-Trump political action committee \"The Lincoln Project,\" after the group launched a viral attack on the president's coronavirus response. The collection of dissenting and former Republicans with aims to upend the President's re-election includes Kellyanne Conway's husband, attorney George Conway.\n\n\"They've all failed. They've never succeeded the way I have as campaign manager,\" Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News. She added that the Lincoln Project should \"worry the most about\" $65 million in booked advertising by pro-Trump super PAC, American Priority, scheduled ahead of November.\n\nAnd Vice President Mike Pence delivered personal protective equipment to a Virginia nursing home and thanked workers inside the center over the phone while standing outside the building. The vice president hauled boxes of medical equipment from a van and set them out in front of the Woodbine Rehabilitation Center in Alexandria. He said it was one of two deliveries the Federal Emergency Management Agency will send out to over 15,000 nursing homes across the country. The delivery is part of a shipment of 63 million gloves, 14 million masks, 13 million gowns, and more than 1 million pieces of eye protection equipment.\n\nCBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar says Pence told the health care workers the American people understand the \"emotional weight\" that is placed on them, adding, \"but to see the way you have stepped up is inspiring.\" Pence promised the health care workers at Woodbine that the prayers of a \"grateful nation\" will be with them \"every step of the way.\" He told them \"all along the way, you'll have been the heroes, and when this is all over, you will have the gratitude of the American people.\"\n\nThe Justice Department moved to dismiss its criminal case against Michael Flynn, President Trump's first national security adviser who pleaded guilty to lying to federal investigators. In a motion filed in U.S. district court in Washington D.C. Thursday, federal prosecutors asked a federal judge to toss out with prejudice the single count of making false statements to the FBI, remarking that \"continued prosecution of this case would not serve the interests of justice.\"\n\nDuring a meeting with Texas Governor Greg Abbott in the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr. Trump called Flynn an \"innocent man.\" The President added, \"Now in my book he's an even greater warrior.\" Trump repeatedly condemned Justice Department officials under former President Barack Obama. \"They're scum. Human scum. This should have never happened in this country.\"\n\nCBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge sat down with Attorney General William Barr Thursday. Barr defended the Justice Department's decision to seek a dismissal of its criminal case against Michael Flynn, President Trump's first national security adviser who admitted to lying to federal investigators. Barr dismissed the notion from critics that he is doing the bidding of Mr. Trump.\n\nStacey Abrams joined a Mother Jones Q&A livestream this afternoon where she was asked about many news of day topics including Tara Reade, Ahmaud Abery, and COVID19. CBS News campaign reporter Cara Korte says she was also asked to react to the Justice Department's motion to drop Michael Flynn's case. Abrams took the opportunity to slam President Trump.\n\n\"I think it's indicative of a problem with the person in charge of our country who has not only demonstrated incompetence, but has demonstrated autocratic behaviors that should terrify all of us,\" Abrams said. She went on to say that the president \"does not care about our country\" and has \"taken away the legitimacy of our system and replaced it with favoritism.\"\n\nELIZABETH WARREN\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren led a group of Democratic senators Thursday in asking Amazon whether the massive online retailer fired whistleblowers for raising concerns about worker conditions amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In a letter to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, CBS News campaign reporter Zak Hudak says the senators cited four Amazon employees who were fired over the past few months after speaking up about worker safety.\n\n\"In order to understand how the termination of employees that raised concerns about health and safety conditions did not constitute retaliation for whistleblowing, we are requesting information about Amazon's policies regarding grounds for employee discipline and termination,\" they wrote. In a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said the employees were fired for different reasons.\n\n\"These individuals were not terminated for talking publicly about working conditions or safety, but rather, for violating -- often repeatedly -- policies, such as intimidation, physical distancing and more. We support every employees' right to criticize or protest their employer's working conditions, but that does not come with blanket immunity against any and all internal policies,\" a spokesperson said, adding that the company planned to offer more details in a response to the senators.\n\nWarren was a frequent critic of Amazon on the campaign trail, frequently using it as an example of a big tech company that needed to be broken up. She was joined in signing this letter by former presidential primary competitors Sens. Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand and Kamala Harris, as well as Sens. Sherrod Brown, Ed Markey, Richard Blumenthal and Tammy Baldwin.\n\nGRETCHEN WHITMER\n\nMichigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced she is extending Michigan's stay at home order through May 28th at her press briefing Thursday afternoon, according to CBS News campaign reporter Jack Turman. She also highlighted the six phases to her MI Safe Start plan, which is her administration's plan to start re-engaging sectors of Michigan's economy.\n\nThe six phases include: uncontrolled growth, persistent spread, flattening, improving, containing and post-pandemic. Whitmer said Michigan is currently in the flattening phase, which is the third phase.\n\n\"In order to stay safe as we re-engage these sectors, we need to continue practicing strict social distancing, wearing face coverings, using safe workplace practices, working on - the state will continue to work on our testing capabilities and tracing capabilities,\" Whitmer said.\n\nThe Democratic governor also said the manufacturing industry can start to phase in to the workplace on May 11th. In a press release, Whitmer noted that the manufacturing facilities must implement safety protocols, including daily screening protocol upon entry for workers and a questionnaire that details symptoms and potential exposure to people who possibly have contracted coronavirus. Whitmer said at her briefing that the Big Three auto suppliers came to an agreement with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union to start phasing in to work on May 18. Whitmer added that they will start at 25% capacity and will begin to phase up from that point.\n\n\"This is truly good news for our state,\" Whitmer said. \"It's a major step forward on our MI Safe Start plan to re-engage our economy safely and responsibly.\"\n\nNearly 3.2 million American workers filed for unemployment insurance last week, the Labor Department reported on Thursday. CBS News campaign reporter Adam Brewster says it's the seventh straight week where more than 3 million people filed jobless claims, but down from the peaks of more than 6 million weekly claims in late March and early April. During that seven week stretch, more than 33 million Americans have filed for unemployment, about a fifth of the American workforce. The Labor Department also reported on Thursday that more than 22.6 million Americans filed continuing claims for the week ending April 25. That represents the number of people who are currently receiving unemployment benefits. The Labor Department's monthly jobs report is set to be released on Friday. The Associated Press, citing data from FactSet, said the unemployment rate \"likely jumped to at least 16%\" and could be the highest level since the Great Depression.\n\nMore than 11 million Asian-Americans will be able to vote this year, making them the fastest-growing group of eligible voters in the United States, according to a Pew Research Center analysis of Census Bureau data. CBS News campaign reporter Musadiq Bidar reports the number of Asian eligible voters is expected to reach new highs in 2020, with nearly 70% of the voting population made up of immigrants.\n\nAsian-Americans are also the only major racial or ethnic group in which naturalized citizens, rather than U.S.-born, make up a majority of eligible voters. The analysis found that from 2000 to 2020, the number of Asian-American eligible voters grew by 139%, which was similar to the Hispanic rate of 121% growth. The black and white electorates grew at a much slower pace (33% and 7%).\n\nIn 2018, AAPI data found that Asian registered voters tend to lean more Democratic than Republican but that varied by origin group. For example, 50% of Indian-Americans were most likely to identify as Democrat compared to 42% of Vietnamese-Americans who were more likely to identify as Republican.\n\nAmong all eligible voters, Asians have the highest levels of education attainment of any major racial and ethnic group and have the highest annual median household income as well. Half of Asian-American eligible voters have a bachelor's degree, which is higher than white (34%), black (20%), and Hispanic (18%). While Asian eligible voters are spread out across the country, more than half only live in California (3.6 million), New York (920,000), and Texas (698,000).\n\nThe Republican National Convention Committee announced Thursday the addition of a physician as a senior adviser for convention planning to ensure that the in-person convention in August is safe for all who are attending, reports CBS News political unit associate producer Eleanor Watson.\n\nDr. Jeffrey Runge is joining the team as a senior adviser for health and safety planning. He has 35 years of medical experience and was also the chief medical officer and assistant secretary for health affairs for the Homeland Security Department during George W. Bush's administration.\n\nRunge will be tasked with communicating with local and state officials about best practices and will advise the convention committee on safety protocols, including determining the appropriate maximum number of people in venues, according to two convention officials. Runge could bring on other team members later in the lead-up to the convention.\n\nTexas 22nd District Republican runoff candidate Kathaleen Wall has released a second ad targeting China and its government, saying \"the Communist Chinese government stifles dissent\" and that \"for Congress, it's Kathaleen Wall against communist China.\"\n\nThe ad began running in the district Thursday on Fox News, and will appear on broadcast television before the July 14 runoff. Wall is locked in a runoff with Sheriff Troy Nehls; the winner will face Democrat candidate Sri Preston Kulkarni, who was the district's 2018 nominee. CBS News political unit broadcast associate Aaron Navarro says while Kulkarni is not mentioned in the ad, Wall's press release goes after him, calling him a \"silent Democrat who refuses to stand up to the thuggish Chinese government.\"\n\nIn response, Kulkarni said Wall is \"following the GOP leaders' playbook\" and is \"trying to distract the constituents of TX-22 from Washington Republicans' unprepared response to the coronavirus crisis.\"",

    "48,000 Yemeni women could die giving birth as UN starts shutting down maternity services due to funding gap": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "London -- The United Nations agency that runs maternity wards and maternal health services across war-torn Yemen says the program is nearly out of money. The agency notified authorities this week that it will no longer be able to support 140 of its 180 facilities in the country.\n\nIt's a new, imminent threat to medical care for women in a country ravaged by years of war and disease. The U.N. says tens of thousands of expectant mothers will be at risk of dying during childbirth if funding isn't secured.\n\nUNFPA, the U.N.'s sexual and reproductive health agency, provides basic reproductive healthcare to hundreds of thousands of Yemeni women. The agency says that without its services, 320,000 pregnant women will be cut off from care and 48,000 could die from complications during delivery. The situation is only expected to worsen with the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"By cutting support to UNFPA, you've basically cut the umbilical cord of the reproductive health system in the country,\" Nestor Owomuhangi, representative for UNFPA in Yemen, told CBS News.\n\n\"It's grave,\" he said. \"It was bad before corona. We have weekly meetings, and... you can see an aura of hopelessness, given the corona that's knocking on our doors.\"\n\nBefore the coronavirus pandemic, aid groups were already calling the situation in Yemen the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Years of brutal conflict between the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi Arabia-backed government have decimated the country's infrastructure and led to widespread famine and disease.\n\n\"And then you have a situation where you have the coronavirus that has devastated the world, and for Yemen, we are looking at a population that has been resilient in a sense, but has gone through all kinds of catastrophes - of cholera and malnutrition - and therefore their immunity levels are low,\" Owomuhangi said.\n\nPeople in Yemen already have very limited access to healthcare, with only about half of the health facilities functioning across the country. Of those, only 20% offer maternal and child health services - many of which are supported by UNFPA. If it is unable to raise more funds by July, it will be forced to close up to 90% of its services in Yemen.\n\n\"They have no health system, and there is no political organization to support them. So how hopeful are we? We only know that the hopes of the population are on us,\" Owomuhangi said.\n\nUNFPA operates a wide range of sexual and reproductive services in many countries, but in Yemen it focuses primarily on life-saving interventions during childbirth.\n\n\"It's already the minimum service,\" Arthur Erken, UNFPA's director of strategic partnerships and communications, told CBS News. \"These health facilities that lack staff, that lack supplies, that have been bombed or been severely damaged by the war, are already in a difficult state - these 140 need to stay open. Otherwise the consequences will be directly - the health and death will be directly a result of closing (them). Of course, if you have no money, that's pretty much end-of-story,\" he said.\n\nEven before the coronavirus started spreading across the world, the agency didn't have enough funding to make it to the end of this year. When a donor conference was cancelled in April because of the pandemic, it left them in dire straits. UNFPA says it now needs $59 million to continue operations in Yemen until the end of 2020, plus another $24 million to deal with the extra burden of COVID-19 in the country.\n\n\"Women are pregnant. They were pregnant before the crisis. They're pregnant now. How do you deal with that?\" said Erken. He said the crisis can only be addressed by the international community collectively, and he urged nations to step up through the U.N., \"to make sure that being pregnant is not a death sentence in the coronavirus crisis.\"\n\nOnly a few dozen cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Yemen, though on Thursday the international aid organization Save the Children reported a dramatic rise in deaths of people with coronavirus symptoms in the southern city of Aden - 380 over the past week. The World Health Organization (WHO) believes that, even if the pandemic is well-managed in Yemen, 42,000 people could die from the disease there, according to Britain's Guardian newspaper.\n\n\"Our hope is in the hope of the people who believe that we can make a difference,\" Owomuhangi said. \"And for that reason we have no choice but to believe that we can be able to provide support, whatever we can, not to let the population down.\"",

        "body": "The 5-year-old daughter of two Detroit first responders has become the youngest person in Michigan to die from coronavirus, The Detroit News reports. LaVondria Herbert, the mother of Skylar Herbert, told the local publication about her daughter's death on Sunday.\n\nSkylar tested positive for COVID-19 in March and later developed a rare form of meningitis and brain swelling, the newspaper reported. Skylar received care at Beaumont Health in Royal Oak, Michigan and was at first showing signs of improvement, but then her condition started going downhill.\n\n\"We decided to take her off the ventilator ... because her improvement had stopped, the doctors told us that it was possible she was brain dead, and we basically just knew she wasn't coming back to us,\" Herbert told The Detroit News.\n\n\"The loss of a child, at any time, under any circumstances, is a tragedy. We are heartbroken that COVID-19 has taken the life of a child. We extend our deepest sympathy to Skylar's family and all others who have lost a loved one to this virus,\" Beaumont Health said in a statement emailed to CBS News.\n\nMetropolitan Church of God in Detroit posted about Skylar's death. \"There are no words to express how deeply saddened we are by the passing our beloved member Skylar Herbert,\" the church wrote on Facebook. \"Skylar touched our hearts with her cheerful spirit and brightened our Sunday's with her smile. We thank God for gracing our congregation with her life and find solace in knowing that she now rests in the Lord's presence. Please keep Sis. Faustina Green (grandmother) and Skylar's parents lifted in prayer.\"\n\nBefore Skylar's death on Sunday, the youngest person to die from COVID-19 in Michigan was 20 years old, according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nA spokesperson for the department told CBS News via email that a child in Michigan who tested positive for COVID-19 has died, although they could not confirm the child's identity.\n\n\"Michigan has lost residents ranging from ages 5-107 due to COVID-19,\" the spokesperson said, adding that the department \"sends its condolences to the child's family and the families of all who have been lost to COVID-19.\" CBS News has also reached out to the Herbert family.\n\nWhile children are not as likely to develop severe symptoms of coronavirus or die from it, young people are not immune to the disease and even young children can get sick.",

    "A new coronavirus cluster linked to Seoul nightclubs is fueling homophobia": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Seoul -- A new cluster of coronavirus cases centered in a popular nightlife district of South Korea's capital has grown to 102 confirmed infections, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said Tuesday. All of the cases have been traced to Itaewon, a thriving neighborhood packed with bars, restaurants and nightclubs.\n\nAlong with the virus, discrimination against South Korea's gay community appears to be spreading again, and raising concerns about efforts to contain the new outbreak.\n\nDining and entertainment businesses were allowed to reopen in South Korea prior to a national week-long holiday at the end of April. The bars and nightclubs of Itaewon were packed when a man in his early 20s visited several clubs on the evening of May 1. He later tested positive for the coronavirus, though he was showing no symptoms at the time.\n\nAmong the businesses he visited were several nightclubs popular with gay men. The outbreak in the district -- home to a number of gay bars and clubs -- has stoked long-standing fears and animosity in South Korea toward the LGBTQ community.\n\nThe government has been working fast to trace and track all of the approximately 6,000 people who visited the affected clubs in Itaewon, using credit card records, security camera video and other means. Officials have encouraged anyone who was there to get tested, but given the still-pervasive stigmatization of the LGBTQ community in South Korea, there are fears some people may be reluctant to come forward, which could risk further spread of the virus.\n\n\"I heard some people are reluctant to get tested for fear of being criticized. We will try hard to make sure everyone receives a test without feeling uncomfortable or prejudiced against,\" Jeong Eun-kyeong, head of the Korean Centers for Disease Control, said in a recent press briefing.\n\nBut Jong Geol Lee, general director of Chingusai (\"Between Friends\"), a Korean human rights group that advocates for gay men, told CBS News that since the cluster in Itaewon emerged, there have been \"many malicious reports towards gay men.\"\n\nHe said fear and hate have come out into the open. According to Lee, the situation has driven a 70-fold increase in calls and messages to Chingusai, mostly from gay men seeking guidance and fearing they could lose their jobs if they're tested and forced to self-isolate.\n\nLee pointed to local media reports using language that fuels bias -- articles referring to the \"dark side\" of gay bathhouses, for instance, and suggesting such businesses could be COVID incubators. He said such reports unfairly blame the gay community for the outbreak and make it even more challenging to encourage people to get tested for the virus.\n\n\"Those people just found a good opportunity to express their inner homophobia and anger toward gay people,\" Hwang, a researcher in his 30s who didn't want to give his full name, told CBS News. He said the current wave of homophobia was playing on \"the old stereotype that gays are promiscuous.\"\n\nHwang said that as South Korea doesn't have specific laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation, it's hard for members of the LGBTQ community to get legal protection if they believe they've been fired or pressured out of a job for that reason.\n\nThere's also fear in Korea's gay community that the COVID outbreak, and the ensuing push for people who visited Itaewon's clubs to get tested, could force people to reveal their sexual orientations against their wishes.\n\n\"Korea is a conservative society, and many parents would not know about their children's sexual orientation. But with this incident, you might spread (the virus) to your family and need to come out,\" Hwang told CBS News.\n\nKim, a gay resident of Itaewon in his late 20s who also asked not to be identified, urged his fellow Koreans not to assume that, just because some gay clubs appear to be at the center of the outbreak, all members of the community are ignoring advice to keep socially distant.\n\n\"It may be difficult for everyone as the coronavirus has spread again,\" he acknowledged, adding that he and many other gay men chose not to go out and party even when the clubs reopened. Kim said he largely decided to stay home, and was annoyed that others weren't taking precautions.\n\nAuthorities in Seoul have ordered all bars and nightclubs closed again in light of the Itaewon outbreak, so, at least for the immediate future, the choice has been taken away.\n\n\"I hope we as Koreans can solve this issue quickly again,\" Kim said.",

    "A woman says she's had 8 positive coronavirus tests in 50 days. How long can it really take to recover?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A woman says she's had 8 positive coronavirus tests in 50 days. How long can it really take to recover?\n\nThere's growing evidence that the coronavirus can affect different people in different ways. The length of the infection, severity of the symptoms and the recovery process all vary from patient to patient, and there is still much to learn about the disease. One woman in Canada says she's had the coronavirus for 50 days, and even though she's started feeling better, she still keeps testing positive.\n\nTracy Schofield, who is a nurse, told Canada's CTV News she started having coronavirus symptoms on March 30. The next day she got her first COVID-19 test, which came back positive. It would be Schofield's first test of many -- she's had eight more since.\n\nShe experienced chills, a headache, difficulty breathing and a fever, she told CTV. After 50 days, she still has some lingering symptoms and is now worried COVID-19 could cause long-term problems. \"I still to this day have shortness of breath,\" Schofield told CTV. \"COVID-19 has taken a lot out of me, and it continues every day.\"\n\nSchofield was hoping she'd be fully recovered by now, nearly two months after her first symptoms, but she has taken a total of nine coronavirus tests and only one came back negative, according to CTV.\n\nSome health care facilities require patients to get two consecutive negative test results at least 24 hours apart to confirm they have cleared the virus.\n\nSchofield says Region of Waterloo Public Health officials released her from self-isolation after 14 days, and she's been cleared to go back to work, too. However, she is still worried she might be contagious.\n\nFor those who have had the coronavirus and are waiting to be in the clear, like Schofield, there are still many unknowns about the recovery process.\n\nThe CDC says it is possible the virus could be detectable in the upper or lower respiratory tract for weeks after illness onset. However, it says, the \"duration of viral shedding and the period of infectiousness for COVID-19 are not yet known.\"\n\nSchofield says she works in a long-term care setting and doesn't want to put anyone else at risk. The hardest part, she said, is that nobody has answers for her questions.\n\nDr. Amesh A. Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told CBS News that persistent positive coronavirus tests do not necessarily mean the virus is actively persisting inside of a person. \"The test isn't detecting viable virus, the test is detecting genetic material from the virus,\" Adalja said.\n\n\"We do know that when people are infected, after they recover they may continue to cough up and excrete viral debris for some period of time,\" Adalja said. \"And it's not necessarily something that reflects infectiousness or contagiousness, although many hospitals and nursing homes require a few negative tests after somebody has recovered in order to clear them.\"\n\nAdalja said for this reason, there are two different ways recommended by the CDC to determine if a previously infected person can safely leave isolation.\n\nOne way is to conduct tests until there are two consecutive negative results, taken no less than 24 hours apart. \"Not everybody needs to get this two-test type of protocol; it's usually used for someone being discharged to a nursing home,\" Adalja said.\n\nThe other way to determine recovery is symptom-based. If a patient is without symptoms for seven days and has not had a fever for three days (without relying on fever-reducing medications), then they can be considered recovered, the CDC says.\n\nAdalja did not treat Schofield but said it's likely she doesn't have coronavirus at this point -- she had coronavirus. \"The test is going to remain positive because there's still viral remnants,\" Adalja said, adding the test could detect these remnants for weeks at a time for some patients.\n\nAs for the possibility of Schofield getting inaccurate test results, Adalja said these tests don't normally produce false positives, but could produce false negatives.\n\nIn Schofield's case, Adalja suspects her positive tests are not false. \"I suspect she is having viral debris that's still in her nasal passages that's being picked up by the test,\" he said.\n\nSchofield told CTV she is also concerned about her lingering shortness of breath, and wondering if she'll have to use an inhaler for the rest of her life.\n\nAs for her concern about permanent health damage, Adalja says she could be experiencing residual symptoms. \"If someone has damage from the virus... their lung function is going to take time to recover, so they may have shortness of breath, but that's not a result of ongoing infection, that might just be the result of the damage the virus did to them earlier in their course of illness,\" Adalja said.",

    "After battling COVID-19, survivors may have to fight big medical bills": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "After battling COVID-19, survivors may have to fight big medical bills\n\nWhen Gloria Thomas ran a high fever and had trouble breathing in March, she headed to the emergency room. With a history of asthma, the 29-year-old Denver resident was familiar with respiratory distress, but this was different.\n\nBoth the ER doctors and Thomas suspected COVID-19. Yet while Thomas was experiencing symptoms of the disease, including severe pain in her lungs, she didn't receive a test for the virus. The reason: Thomas was never officially admitted to the hospital, so she didn't qualify for one of the sought-after tests, which the hospital at the time was limiting to patients who had been admitted. Instead, Thomas was stabilized by ER staff and sent home to recover with a fistful of prescriptions.\n\nWeeks later, Thomas is feeling much better, but is now dealing with a new problem -- sorting through the bills from her ER visit to determine what she owes. The financial hit from her COVID-19 treatment is part of the impact of the coronavirus, which has not only infected about 1.4 million Americans but also left many with heavy medical bills.\n\nAnd plenty of stress -- it's often unclear who is on the hook for paying for coronavirus treatments. That's especially true for patients like Thomas, who weren't able to get tested for the disease when they initially sought medical care.\n\n\"I'm still sorting through everything and trying to figure out what might be covered under new COVID rules and how it's all going to work out,\" she said. \"This ER bill is pretty huge.\"\n\nThomas said she got a \"not very well itemized\" statement from her in-network hospital, which shows about $1,200 in coinsurance charges for her ER treatment. Co-pays from prescriptions add another $200 to her costs. She expects she'll also owe a $500 co-payment for any ER visits, although she hasn't yet found the bill for that. And she wonders if she'll be on the hook for two telehealth follow-up doctor visits.\n\nExactly what's covered by insurance for COVID-19 patients with out-of-pocket health care costs is a mystery to plenty of patients like Thomas. The patchwork of initiatives from the government and health insurance industry may create as much confusion as relief for consumers.\n\n\"I wish there were a federal law that said it was illegal to give a bill to a patient during all this,\" said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at Kaiser Family Foundation. \"But it all depends on who is taking care of you.\"\n\nCosts for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may reach $20,000 per person, while individuals can expect to pay an average of at least $1,300 in out-of-pocket costs, according to a Kaiser analysis. Even patients who aren't hospitalized may still face pricey medical bills for outpatient treatments, testing and ER visits that don't end in hospital admission, health advocates said.\n\nFear of racking up heavy medical bills may be keeping at least some people from seeking COVID-19 treatment. About one in seven adults said they would avoid seeking medical care for a fever and dry cough due to concerns about costs, according to a recent study from Gallup and West Health.\n\nDozens of insurers, including Aetna, Cigna and Humana have waived some combination of co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles for COVID-19 treatments including hospital stays, according to America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. But these waivers vary in what they cover, and not all people with insurance may be eligible.\n\nIn many cases, these waivers apply to treatment from out-of-network providers -- an important consideration for patients in hard-hit areas where it may be impossible to limit your options to in-network care. Bills for out-of-network services are often the cause of surprise medical expenses.\n\nBefore the outbreak, several members of Congress were working on ways to eliminate surprise billing. Now, several patient advocate groups are encouraging lawmakers to deal with the issue for all patients in the next stimulus bill.\n\nThe pandemic \"shines a bright light on just how broken our health system is,\" said Emily Holubowich, vice president of federal advocacy for the American Heart Association. Patients with heart disease are at much higher risk for serious complications from COVID-19 and, in turn, expensive medical bills.\n\nSome waivers took effect in late March while others start April 1. Some have waived cost-sharing for virtual doctor appointments by video or phone, yet other plans still require patients to meet their deductible before covering those consultations. Insurers also have varying definitions of what COVID-19 treatment actually means. (To find out your insurer's rules check this list or call directly.)\n\nPollitz of the Kaiser Family Foundation notes another important caveat: Even if you think you have insurance from one of the companies offering cost-sharing waivers, you may not be eligible. That's because most employer-sponsored plans are self-funded and set their own rules about coverage. Insurers simply administer the plans.\n\n\"You may be carrying a Blue Cross Blue Shield card in your pocket, but if your employer decides not to pay, you'll get hit,\" Pollitz said.\n\nThomas said she worries she'll be on the hook for the full amount of her cost-sharing for the treatment she received. That's because she visited the ER on March 24 and her insurer is waiving out-of-pocket costs only for COVID-19 treatments that began on April 1. She also expressed concern that, because she was never tested, she can't prove she was treated for COVID-19 even if it is possible to negotiate an exception on the date with her insurer.\n\nPatient advocates say stories like Thomas's are just the beginning of what promises to be a flood of questions, complaints and appeals concerning COVID-19 coverage.\n\n\"It takes weeks for medical bills to show up, especially from out-of-network providers,\" explained Adam Fox, director of strategic engagement at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative.\n\nWith COVID-19, meanwhile, it may take even longer as hospitals wait to see how much they will receive from existing and future government stimulus packages and how much of that will be used for compensating out-of-network providers, Fox predicted.\n\nUnder the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, passed in late March, hospitals that receive emergency funding are prohibited from billing patients for fees beyond their network reimbursement rate.\n\n\"But that will be difficult for patients to track,\" Pollitz predicted.\n\nThe Trump administration has mandated that all comprehensive health insurance plans must pay for 100% of the cost of coronavirus testing as well as the visit to the ER, doctor's office or urgent care center that may have led to that testing. Definitive as that sounds, however, there are gray areas.\n\nTake 25-year-old Anna Davis Abel of Morgantown, West Virginia, who has lupus, an immune disease that may make her more susceptible to coronavirus complications. Tests for COVID-19 were scarce when she came down with similar symptoms in early March. Her doctor decided to first rule out other respiratory illnesses, testing her for the flu and other common viruses.\n\nThe tests found that Davis Abel in fact had the flu. During her recovery, she received a co-insurance bill for more than $500 for the test and the doctor visit. Davis Abel and her doctor both believe the test should be covered completely as a cost related to COVID-19 testing, an argument the doctor made in writing.\n\n\"I thought to myself, 'How on earth can this not be covered?'\" Davis Abel told CBS Moneywatch.\n\nAfter some unsatisfactory calls to her insurer, She took her case to social media, where it was picked up by media outlets. Ultimately her insurer agreed to pay the full amount.\n\nSaid Davis Abel, \"I hope other people with COVID-19 bills don't have to fight this hard.\"",

    "After outcry, Frontier Airlines drops planned fee for empty middle seats": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Frontier Airlines is dropping plans to charge passengers extra to sit next to an empty middle seat after congressional Democrats accused the airline of trying to profit from fear over the new coronavirus.\n\n\"We recognize the concerns raised that we are profiting from safety and this was never our intent,\" Frontier CEO Barry Biffle said late Wednesday in a letter to three lawmakers. \"We simply wanted to provide our customers with an option for more space.\"\n\nBiffle said the airline will rescind the extra fee, which Frontier called More Room, and block the seats from being sold.\n\nEarlier in the day, Democrats had railed against Frontier's plan to charge passengers at least $39 per flight to guarantee they would sit next to an empty middle seat. The offer was to begin with flights Friday and run through Aug. 31.\n\nThe chairman of the House Transportation Committee called it \"outrageous.\" Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said the Denver-based airline was using the need for social distancing during a pandemic \"as an opportunity to make a buck ... capitalizing on fear and passengers' well-founded concerns for their health and safety.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., highlighted the fee during a congressional hearing on how COVID-19 is affecting the airline industry.\n\n\"I don't think it's appropriate for some passengers who can't afford to pay an additional charge for a seat to be less safe than other travelers,\" Klobuchar said.\n\nU.S. air travel has dropped more than 90% from a year ago because of the pandemic, and many flights are nearly empty. However, some flights - highlighted on social media - have been much more full, with many passengers not wearing face coverings. That's led airlines to say they'll block middle seats when possible to create space between passengers.\n\nFrom the outset, Biffle rejected the notion that his airline would be charging for social distancing.\n\n\"We are offering the option, and it is guaranteed. We don't believe you need it - if everybody is wearing a facial covering - to be safe,\" he told The Associated Press earlier this week. \"It gives people more peace of mind if they want it.\"\n\nBiffle said ticket sales rose after previous announcements around safety, including a decision to require passengers to wear masks, and he expected the same reaction to the empty-seat offer.\n\nAirlines steal ideas from each other all the time, but so far, none have copied Frontier's More Room offer.\n\nDuring Wednesday's Senate Commerce Committee hearing, the president of Airlines for America, a trade group for the biggest U.S. carriers, said none of his airlines have a similar charge. Frontier isn't a member.\n\nThe trade group official, Nicholas Calio, said other airlines block some middle seats and board passengers from back-to-front to keep spacing on planes.\n\nKlobuchar asked if the federal government should issue guidelines to \"fix\" Frontier's policy. Calio said rules aren't necessary.\n\n\"Hopefully, the market will take care of that,\" Calio said.\n\n\"Well, it didn't with Frontier,\" Klobuchar responded.\n\nHilary Godwin, dean of the school of public health at the University of Washington, said the Frontier policy \"is exactly the reason that some national-level guidance\" is needed for social distancing on airlines and in airports.\n\nGodwin said crowded planes and long flights create the greatest risk for spreading the virus. She said the expectation that air travel will recover slowly is a good thing - it will give airlines and health officials time to decide the best steps to take to protect travelers and airline and airport workers.\n\nBiffle announced Frontier would drop the fee idea in a letter to Reps. Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., and Jesus Garcia, D-Ill., and Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass.\n\nU.S. health officials stress the importance of social distancing, and they also recommend that people wear cloth face coverings in public because some who are infected don't feel symptoms and could unknowingly spread the virus.",

    "Amazon ending unlimited time off policy for warehouse workers": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Amazon ending unlimited time off policy for warehouse workers\n\nStarting Friday, Amazon's \"unlimited time off\" policy\" for workers is coming to an end, and warehouse employees who want to stay home out of concerns they will catch COVID-19 will have to apply for a leave of absence.\n\nSince the coronavirus started spreading widely in the U.S., some Amazon workers have called on the company to offer paid leave to everyone and to be proactive about shutting down fulfillment centers where workers fall ill. Many feel exposed because of the nature of their jobs, which can require coming into contact with hundreds of people every day.\n\nThe company has expanded paid leave to those who are told to self-quarantine and has raised pay by $2 an hour, for a starting wage of $17 an hour. But it has resisted making paid time off universal, saying that workers afraid of getting sick or needing to care for ill family members can take unlimited unpaid time off.\n\nNow, that time-off policy is coming to an end, and many warehouse workers are concerned they'll be forced to come back to work before they're ready.\n\nAmazon will only approve personal leaves of absence for emergencies and circumstances related to COVID-19, a company spokesperson said, while workers who are ill should go on a medical leave of absence.\n\n\"Workers aren't even clear on the rules,\" said Hafsa Hassan, who works in an Amazon fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota. Hassan was one of about 50 workers who walked out of the Shakopee center on Sunday, concerned, she said, over the end of the time-off policy and three of their colleagues who had been diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nIn a statement, an Amazon spokesperson said: \"[W]e are providing flexibility with leave of absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures. We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.\"\n\nThe spokesperson also noted that Amazon would extend its $2-an-hour pay increase and double overtime until May 16. Amazon is also hiring 175,000 additional workers to handle its huge increases in business during the pandemic.\n\nHowever, some workers are taking the end of the unlimited-leave policy as a sign to go back to work or risk losing their jobs. One worker said she was unable to apply for leave after trying multiple times, while others said they weren't sure if they would be eligible.\n\nRachel Belz, who works in a fulfillment center in West Deptford, New Jersey, said she's been home on unpaid leave since late March because she worries about infecting several high-risk people she lives with, including her young son. Where she lives, school is canceled until May 15, she said.\n\nBelz hasn't been able to apply for a leave of absence, despite trying multiple times, she said on a call organized by United for Respect, a workers' rights group of which she is a member.\n\n\"I was not able even to complete the form and answer the questions that it requires to formally file for a leave of absence,\" she said. \"If you're expecting people at a high volume to apply for this, you need to work out these kinks.\"\n\nCompounding the issue of time off is the contention of many workers that warehouses are hotbeds of sickness. Workers said that cleaning wipes, hand sanitizers, gloves and masks remained scarce, and that they did not have enough time between tasks to clean their workstations.\n\nJordan Flowers, who works in a warehouse in Staten Island, New York, said his facility only made hand sanitizer available in the main break room, meaning it takes time to walk over to get it. He also said that worker crowding continues in some departments, and that he's seen \"eight people on top of each other\" on some days.\n\n\"I know people who are taking their own cleaning supplies in, encouraging their coworkers to bring in their own cleaning supplies,\" said Belz of the West Deptford warehouse. The conditions are exacerbated as Amazon hires more and more people to keep up with the demands on its delivery system, making the facilities even more crowded, she said.\n\nEmployees who complain too loudly about working conditions risk losing their job. In recent weeks, Amazon has fired five workers who have criticized working conditions in its warehouses, including two at its Seattle headquarters.\n\nNew York state's attorney general, Letitia James, cautioned Amazon in a message last week that its safety measures could be lacking, and that it may have broken labor laws in firing a Staten Island, New York, worker who spoke out about conditions. (James' office confirmed the existence of the letter, which NPR first reported.) Amazon previously said it fired warehouse workers for breaking the company's social distancing guidelines.\n\nBillie Jo Ramey, a worker at an Amazon fulfillment center in Romulus, Michigan, said she worried about returning to work after having been sick for almost a month with symptoms resembling COVID-19.\n\n\"I'm in no shape to go back. I live with friends of mine who are at high risk of catching the virus. I don't want to go back to work,\" she said. \"I have to make a choice to go back in or stay home and not get paid.\"\n\nRamey, who is also a United for Respect member, added that several people she lives with have severe health conditions. \"Do I qualify for special leave? I have no idea,\" she said.\n\nWorkers who go on leave remain employees, but they aren't guaranteed their position back when they return unless specifically required by law, CNBC reported.",

    "At least 7 COVID-19 cases tied to in-person voting in Wisconsin": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "By Monday, there were at least seven cases of COVID-19 tied to voting during Wisconsin's in-person primary election earlier this month. After legal battles in the state over absentee voting and over whether the election could be delayed, voters went to the polls on April 7 to cast their ballots in the presidential primary election and in Wisconsin races, despite a stay-at-home order.\n\nThe number of people infected could increase as more cities report data, and as Milwaukee gathers more information. In a statement to CBS News on Tuesday, Milwaukee Health Commissioner Jeanette Kowalik said that Wisconsin only had \"30% of the data back from new cases as of 4/7 and on.\" She added that officials hope to have a more complete report on Friday.\n\nKowalik said the city is also looking at any new cases that began after April 7, since symptoms tend to appear within 14 days of exposure.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Wisconsin has reported 4,620 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 242 deaths. Milwaukee has 1,697 positive cases and 92 deaths.\n\nMore than 18,000 people voted in-person in Milwaukee at five different polling sites during the April election. Milwaukee typically operates 180 polling locations, but like many cities across the state, had to consolidate locations because of the drastic shortage of poll workers. Kowalik said Monday that she expects to know more soon about whether those cases were concentrated at a single location or among a group of people who knew each other.\n\n\"There needs to be a little bit more analysis so we can connect the dots,\" she said. \"That's why case investigation and contact tracing is so important.\" Wisconsin Health Secretary-designee Andrea Palm said state officials had not seen \"indications of an impact from the election,\" but she noted the lag time for symptoms.\n\nWhile the information about virus spread related to the election is being gathered and processed, Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers and Palm on Monday released steps for reopening Wisconsin -- the \"Badger Bounce Back plan,\" as Evers calls it. The steps mostly mirror White House guidelines about phasing in businesses and normal routines, starting with allowing mass gatherings of up to 10 people, opening restaurants in a limited capacity and resuming school in-person.\n\nThe second phase would allow the resumption of mass gatherings of up to 50 people, restaurants in full operation, bars in limited capacity with social distancing and non-essential businesses.\n\nUnder phase three normal business activity with minimal protective and preventative measures would return. Getting through the steps will involve increasing testing, contact tracing, tracking the disease, more PPE and greater healthcare capacity.\n\n\"I'm jazzed and hopeful about this plan,\" Evers said Monday. \"This plan is an all-out war on the virus.\"\n\nWisconsin's \"Safer at Home\" order was extended until May 26 last week, but on Tuesday, Republican leaders in the legislature asked the Wisconsin Supreme Court to block that plan. The order lifted some restrictions on daily life, but shut down schools for the rest of the current school year and kept some businesses closed.\n\nThe GOP legislative leaders slammed Palm for exercising such broad authority. \"Purporting to act under color of State law, an unelected, unconfirmed cabinet secretary has laid claim to a suite of czar-like powers -- unlimited in scope and indefinite in duration -- over the people of Wisconsin,\" the filing said.\n\nThe lawsuit expressed concern that Palm could continue to extend the order without legislative oversight. It also argues that the state could face dire consequences, since restrictions apply not only to cities dealing with a high level of cases, but also to \"rural counties with few or no known cases.\"\n\n\"By the time the Secretary sees fit to lift her decree (be it in five weeks or eight months), many Wisconsinites will have lost their jobs, and many companies will have gone under, to say nothing of the Order's countless other downstream societal effects,\" the complaint says. \"Our State will be in shambles.\"",

    "Auto workers to return to work, providing hope in jobs crisis - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Defying a wave of layoffs that has sent the U.S. job market into its worst catastrophe on record, at least one top industry is making a comeback. Auto factories are set to welcome back tens of thousands of workers after shuttering in mid-March due to fears of spreading the coronavirus.\n\nUntil now, it was mostly hair salons, restaurants, tattoo parlors and other small businesses reopening in some parts of the country. The auto industry is among the first major sectors of the economy to restart its engine.\n\nAbout 133,000 U.S. workers -- just over half of the industry's workforce before the pandemic -- are expected to pour back into assembly plants that will open in the coming week, according to estimates by The Associated Press. In addition, parts-making companies began cranking this week to get components flowing, adding thousands more workers.\n\nLooming in the background is an economy decimated by the pandemic. Nearly 3 million laid-off U.S. workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, raising the total seeking aid in the past two months to about 36 million. Although some states have begun to let selected businesses reopen, workers are still reporting difficulty getting unemployment benefits. Freelance, gig and self-employed workers are struggling.\n\nEven the auto sector won't see a full return to normal yet, and if people don't start buying vehicles again, workers could be sent home. Yet automakers say there's enough pent-up demand, especially for pickup trucks, to get factories humming again.\n\nBut automakers were dealing with issues even before the pandemic shuttered factories. For one, the trade war between the U.S. and China took a toll, while concerns about climate change and auto emissions caused some consumers to back away from vehicles with higher emissions, noted Capital Economics in a Friday research note.\n\n\"It is not clear whether demand for cars will return to its pre-crisis level,\" especially if more people decide to work from home permanently in response to the pandemic, the group noted.\n\nThat could help states slow the drain on their unemployment benefit funds. In Michigan, where over one-third of the labor force sought benefits, the fund fell from $4.6 billion before the pandemic to $4.1 billion on April 30, said Jeff Donofrio, director of the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity. Some returning auto employees could work part-time and get still some unemployment benefits, but federal programs could cover part of their payments, he said.\n\nNearly 3 million Americans filed for unemployment in the last week\n\nAt Ford, where about 47,000 U.S. factory workers will return by next week, there's optimism that consumer demand will accompany them. Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said the company, using data collected from new Ford models from the past two years, is seeing sales recover.\n\nIn Europe, China and the U.S., Ford has found a correlation between the number of trips people take and auto sales, with trips increasing as restrictions eased.\n\n\"We started to see in early April a change where people started to take more trips,\" Farley said Thursday. \"The (sales) decline stopped and our retail sales improved a lot.\"\n\nAuto sales in China, where the virus peaked before the U.S., could be a harbinger of things to come. China sales fell just 2.6% in April from a year earlier, compared with a 48% free-fall in March. Production at many plants is nearly back to normal after being shut down in January and February. Volkswagen, Honda, Mercedes and Ford reported no virus cases among employees since reopening. Fiat Chrysler had two, but said the workers never entered factories.\n\nThings are worse in Europe, where sales plummeted 55% in March and some factories are running at only 40% of capacity. The pandemic has affected over 1.1 million European auto industry workers, almost half the sector's manufacturing jobs. Most are getting paid through government support. A survey of auto parts suppliers shows that a third of executives believe it will take at least two years for the industry to recover.\n\nU.S. sales fell 46% in April as the virus took hold, but analysts are forecasting a smaller decline of 30% in May. Sales have been juiced by huge incentives, with some automakers offering 0% financing for as long as seven years.\n\nPickup trucks are giving automakers the most hope, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president at LMC Automotive, a consulting firm. Through April, total auto sales were down 21%, but pickups were only off 4%, he said.\n\nYet Schuster says automakers could be a little too optimistic about sales overall. \"Those consumers who are still unemployed are not likely to be making auto purchases,\" he said.\n\nSome U.S. automakers, like General Motors, are restarting slowly, only bringing back workers on one shift in factories, some of which ran around the clock before the pandemic. Others, like Subaru in Indiana, have a full complement of employees.\n\nAlthough companies are taking precautions, one big virus outbreak at an auto plant could send the industry back into hibernation. And the industry could face parts supply interruptions from Mexico, where the government wants to reopen factories despite rising virus cases.\n\nAutomakers rethink how to make workers safe\n\nAutomakers in the U.S. are requiring employees to fill out questionnaires daily to see if they have symptoms, taking temperatures with no-touch thermometers before workers enter buildings, and requiring gloves, masks and face shields. They've also tried to keep at least six feet between workers, staggered time between shifts so workers don't interact, and put up plexiglas barriers when possible.\n\nAll the steps were tested on U.S. workers who volunteered to make protective gear and breathing machines while they were laid off. Automakers say they know of no virus cases among workers in the effort.\n\nBut Phil Cuthbertson a worker at GM's transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, who will return Monday, said he has mixed feelings.\n\n\"I just don't want the whole thing to be pushed on us to go back if it's not safe,\" he said.\n\nCindy Estrada, United Auto Workers vice president for Fiat Chrysler, said she's been impressed by the companies' safety commitment. But she's sure some workers, especially in the hard-hit Detroit area, will be fearful because family members or co-workers have had COVID-19. At least 25 UAW members employed by Detroit automakers have died from the virus, although no one is sure if they caught it at a factory.\n\nThe union will be watching in case workers get infected, though there's no magic number for when it will try to close a factory, Estrada said.\n\n\"If something looks like it's becoming a hot spot, then we need to act quickly and make adjustments,\" she said. \"No one wants to see that happen.\"",

    "Big privacy and data security concerns as India forces coronavirus tracing app on millions": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "New Delhi -- The Indian government is trying to address privacy concerns raised by hackers, activists, and political opposition parties over its coronavirus contact tracing app. The app, called Aarogya Setu, (\"A bridge to health\" in Hindi), uses Bluetooth and GPS technology to alert users who may have come into contact with people who've tested positive for COVID-19 or shown symptoms of the disease.\n\nMore than 100 million smartphone users have downloaded the app since April 2, when the government rolled it out to fight the spread of the new virus. Promotion of the app, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was so successful that it reached 50 million downloads in just two weeks -- one of the fastest uptakes for any app, ever.\n\nIndia has an estimated 450 million smartphone users among its population of 1.3 billion. To cover more people, the government launched a version of Aarogya Setu for the roughly 100 million cheaper, but still-internet-enabled cell phones in use in the country.\n\nModi's government has made the app mandatory for people who work in public and private offices, for all train travellers and for people who live in areas deemed high-risk for the spread of the virus. There's even the threat of fines and jail terms for people who refuse to install the app in one Delhi suburb.\n\nSo far, the app has alerted about 140,000 users to a possible COVID-19 infection risk, the Indian government said Monday.\n\nBut while the government insists the app is an important tool in its fight against coronavirus, it has raised concerns over personal privacy and other issues.\n\nConcerns have also been raised over how much data the app collects. It asks its users to share their name, phone number, age, gender, profession, and details of countries visited in the last 30 days.\n\nIn addition, it asks users to self-assess for any possible COVID-19 symptoms and enter that data daily. The app shows users how many people have symptoms in a particular radius, and how many have tested positive. It sends alerts when a new person near you tests positive, or if someone who was near you previously tests positive.\n\nBut the way it does all this has raised concerns.\n\n\"The app collects both people's Bluetooth and GPS [data], which is inconsistent with principles of data minimization. It collects more personal and sensitive personal information than is required,\" the Internet Freedom Foundation, a New Delhi-based advocacy group, told CBS News in a statement.\n\nMishi Choudhary, legal director at the New York- based Software Freedom Law Center, agreed, telling CBS News that collecting GPS data, which records a user's location every 15 minutes, \"along with continuous Bluetooth data is excessive.\"\n\n\"The Government is yet to publish the application's underlying source code. Nor has the government published specifications with regard to Bluetooth, cryptography or other technical features. This contrasts with the approaches in countries like Singapore, Australia, the U.K. or even Israel,\" the Internet Freedom Foundation said.\n\nLast week, an \"ethical hacker\" who identifies himself as Elliot Alderson, an alias inspired by a character in the TV series Mr. Robot, claimed the \"privacy of 90 million Indians is at stake\" due to \"security issues\" with the Indian app.\n\nHe claimed he was able to use the app to see whether anyone was sick in private homes - including the official residence of Prime Minister Modi: \"And yes, yesterday: 5 people felt unwell at the PMO office, 2 unwell at the Indian Army Headquarters, 1 infected people at the Indian parliament, 3 infected at the Home Office,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nSoon after the hacker's claims, the Indian government released a statement thanking him, but insisting there was \"no data or security breach\" and that \"no personal information of any user has been proven to be at risk by this ethical hacker.\"\n\n\"Alderson\" had previously raised red flags over alleged security flaws in India's national biometric identification system -- the world's largest -- which has gradually gone from voluntary to near-mandatory in the country.\n\nChoudhary, of the Software Freedom Law Center, said that while India's government has addressed some concerns, \"several matters remain open,\" including the lack of government liability to protect data gathered by the app.\n\nShe said a clause in the official policy \"exempts the government from liability in the event of 'any unauthorized access to the [user's] information or modification thereof.'\"\n\n\"This means that there is no liability for the government, even if the personal information of users are leaked,\" said Choudahary.\n\nIndia's Communications, Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said Aarogya Setu \"has a robust data security architecture.\"\n\n\"India has no national data privacy law, and it's not clear who has access to data from the app and in what situations,\" researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have said in a review. The team at MIT ranks various COVID tracing tracker apps around the world for their transparency and other factors, and Aarogya Setu met just two of its five criteria.\n\n\"There are no strong, transparent policy or design limitations on accessing or using the data at this point,\" the researchers say, while noting that India is the \"only democracy making its app mandatory for millions of people.\"\n\nSystems being used in Singapore, Australia, Norway, Israel, Czech Republic, Iceland and Austria all scored a perfect 5 on the MIT index, which reviewed apps implemented by a total of 25 countries.\n\nOnly China, which failed to meet any of the criteria due to the complete secrecy of its app, and Turkey, Bulgaria, France, Ghana, Iran, Ireland, and Malaysia -- which all met just 1 of the 5 criteria -- have worse scores than India.\n\nThe U.S. hasn't yet rolled out a national tracking app, but the government is working with technology companies to get one into use.\n\nSome fear India's app could be used in a way that would violate civil liberties, including by helping to build a state surveillance system that could be exploited after the app outlives its coronavirus-tracking purpose.\n\nIndian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has called the app \"a sophisticated surveillance system, outsourced to a pvt [private] operator, with no institutional oversight.\"\n\n\"In Europe, the data has largely been aggregated and anonymized,\" noted the MIT Technology Review.\n\nConcerns that the app could be used as a surveillance tool come with the backdrop of an existing trust deficit between the government and many citizens. Hundreds took part in protests, which turned deadly, against the government's plan to roll out a National Register of Citizens (NRC), along with a new citizenship law widely criticized as racist for singling out Muslims.\n\nAs coronavirus cases in India mount -- over 82,000 cases and 2,600 deaths so far -- the government has tried to address concerns about its tracking app.\n\nOn Monday, the government said it would give users an option to seek deletion of their data within 30 days of making a request. It also issued new data processing \"guidelines\" to various agencies involved in controlling the spread of the virus, banning storage of data for more than six months and warning violators they could face jail time.\n\n\"Lot of work has been done over data privacy. A good privacy policy has been made to ensure that personal data of people are not misused,\" Ajay Prakash Sawhney, an official with India's Ministry of Electronics and Internet Technology, said Monday.\n\nWithout a national data protection law, however, the concerns over the app's privacy and data safeguards -- and its mandatory use for millions -- won't easily be laid to rest.\n\nIndia's parliament has been considering such legislation since last year. The man who wrote the draft, Justice B N Srikrishna, a former Supreme Court justice, told The Indian Express that the government's move to make the app obligatory for so many people was \"utterly illegal\".\n\n\"Under what law do you mandate it on anyone? So far it is not backed by any law,\" said the former judge.\n\nThe New Delhi based Internet Freedom Foundation has challenged the legality of an order by authorities in the Delhi suburb of Noida making installation of the app mandatory for everyone, and threatening violators with possible fines, or even jail.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, is considering expanding the mandate for the app. It already covers all train travelers, and it may also apply to air passengers once the world's biggest COVID-lockdown lifts and flights resume.",

    "Bill Gates is funding an at-home coronavirus test program  --  and it's already testing 300 people per day": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Bill Gates is funding a new program to provide at-home coronavirus testing kits to residents in the Seattle area. The initiative aims to help researchers better understand how COVID-19 spreads through communities.\n\n\"In any fight, it's important to know your enemy. Unfortunately, in our battle against COVID-19, there's a lot that we still don't know,\" the Microsoft co-founder wrote in a blog post on Tuesday. \"More testing, of course, will help us answer them. But with tests in short supply in many parts of the world, including the U.S., it is impossible to test everyone -- at least for now.\"\n\nIn the blog post, Gates also said he is funding a first-of-its-kind disease surveillance program called the Seattle Coronavirus Assessment Network (SCAN) to detect cases of COVID-19 in the greater Seattle area -- the first hotspot of the outbreak in the United States. SCAN allows people to collect their own nasal samples using a self-swab test and then ship them to a lab -- all without ever leaving home. The program is testing both healthy and sick people, Gates said.\n\n\"The key advantage of this at-home testing approach is that people don't need to go to a clinic, where they risk exposing themselves or others to infection,\" Gates said.\n\nThe program is not meant to act as a replacement for medical care, and it doesn't aim to test every single person in the region, Gates emphasized. Instead, he hopes the results, in addition to demographic data like age, race, gender, ZIP code and pre-existing health conditions, will provide a clearer picture of how the virus is \"moving through the community, who is at greatest risk, and whether physical distancing measures are working.\"\n\nGates said that, by testing a large group of both healthy and sick people from diverse backgrounds, researchers will have a better understanding of what groups are at a higher risk of infection and how social distancing has slowed the spread.\n\nAccording to Gates, SCAN is already testing 300 people per day. He said early results have already found many cases of infected people with mild symptoms that would have otherwise gone undetected.\n\nSeattle residents interested in taking part in the program can apply on its website starting Wednesday, May 13. Those chosen will be mailed an at-home test kit and given access to SCAN's online portal to view their results.\n\nGates did not say whether he plans to bring the program to other cities. He is funding it privately, and through his investment firm, Gates Ventures, and foundation. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation previously said it is donating $300 million toward global efforts to combat COVID-19.\n\nSCAN is operating in partnership with the Seattle and King County Public Health Department and five local health institutions: The Brotman Baty Institute, the University of Washington School of Medicine, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the Institute for Disease Modeling and the Seattle Children's Hospital.\n\nThe Gates Foundation has been working in partnership with Seattle public health officials to roll out more testing since early March, when Washington state had the highest number of known cases in the U.S.\n\n\"COVID-19 has started behaving a lot like the once-in-a-century pathogen we've been worried about,\" Gates said back in February, after years of warning about the threat a global pandemic could pose. \"I hope it's not that bad, but we should assume it will be until we know otherwise.\"",

    "CBS News' Seth Doane describes his recovery from coronavirus and 41-day quarantine": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Last month, CBS News foreign correspondent Seth Doane tested positive for coronavirus. He was quarantined in Rome with his husband, Andrea. Now, he just received his second negative test result.\n\n\"Feeling better is a relief,\" Doane said Monday. \"I've never wanted to fail a test, never been so happy for a 'negative' result, as I just got a couple of hours ago.\"\n\nJoining \"CBS This Morning\" from his home in Rome, Doane described his symptoms: \"I had congestion, I had aches, I had fever for one night. I'd say maybe for eight days I didn't feel very well. I had different pains in places I wasn't really used to. I definitely knew I was sick. But I didn't have days where I just couldn't get out of bed. I was lucky to have relatively mild symptoms.\n\n\"And then to test negative, finally, twice, ahhh, such a relief!\"\n\nThe Italians' requirement for a second negative test, Doane said, follows World Health Organization guidelines. \"You need two negative tests separated by 24 hours to be officially freed from quarantine. So, as soon as I was exposed to people who were known to be positive, the doctors said, 'You have to be in quarantine.\n\n\"Then I had the test; it turned out positive. We stayed in quarantine. Today is day 41 - 41 days in the house. I've only been out for about three hours, and that was with a doctor's permission to go to some mobile clinics to have this test. And one of the tests, about 20 days after I first tested positive, was positive again. At that point I had no symptoms, I was feeling much better, and I was surprised, shocked and saddened really to test positive again.\"\n\nCo-host Tony Dokoupil asked, \"What have you been doing to stay sane?\"\n\n\"Zoom!\" Doane replied. \"Zoom everything - Zoom exercise, Zoom Italian classes, Zoom conference calls for work, as you guys know. Zoom dinner parties and drinks. In fact, to change it up at one point, put on a black tie to have a black tie Zoom dinner party, because just the regular Zoom dinner party was getting old after so many weeks.\"\n\nHe also credited the support of family and friends: \"My husband, Andrea, has been incredible through this. I brought this into his life, and he, too, had to be quarantined the whole time. We've been really lucky to have neighbors delivering groceries and helping us out, as we couldn't leave.\"\n\nAndrea is also okay: \"He actually tested negative all three times,\" Doane said. \"There's some different hypotheses there. One is that he could have had it in-between and just not been tested at that right moment. [But] he's well.\"\n\nItaly, one of the hardest-hit countries, has been on lockdown since March 9, and to date has suffered nearly 180,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 23,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nBut the country's one-day coronavirus death toll continued to drop this weekend, with a reported 433 deaths on Sunday.\n\nAsked to describe the current situation today and the prognosis for going forward, Doane said, \"We live right in the middle of Rome, and with the windows open here for the last 40 days, it has sounded more like the countryside. You hear birds and insects. Though recently I have heard more helicopters. I was doing the laundry and hanging up the laundry and a drone buzzed right overhead.\n\n\"The Italians have been cracking down, trying to enforce these stay-at-home orders. The two times that we were allowed out of the house - three times actually to take a test, we're only out for a little bit of time, we went to this mobile clinic - but we saw all sorts of police blockades, roadblocks where they would stop. We had a doctor's permission we had to show that allowed us to be on the streets.\n\n\"Rome seems to be taking this very seriously. Now as you know, Italy is experimenting with this so-called 'Phase II,' starting to open up the country a little bit more to allow some more freedom. Now with my freedom, pretty much all I can do is go to the grocery store and take out the trash. But after 41 days, that's pretty nice!\"",

        "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has added six new symptoms to its list of possible signs of the coronavirus. Previously, the CDC only noted fever, cough and shortness of breath as symptoms.\n\nThe agency has updated its list to include: chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell. Shortness of breath has also been changed to \"shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\" The full list now is:\n\nA runny nose rarely occurs with COVID-19, and sneezing is still not a symptom of the virus.\n\n\"People with COVID-19 have had a wide range of symptoms reported -- ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness,\" reads the CDC's website. Any of the now nine symptoms may appear anywhere from 2-14 days after exposure to the virus, according to the agency.\n\nThe CDC recommends that people seek medical attention immediately if they develop any of these emergency warning signs:\n\nDr. William Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) told CBS News in March that the three most common symptoms were fever, a dry cough and shortness of breath. Medical experts say body aches, sore throat and fatigue sometimes occur with coronavirus, but are more often associated with the flu.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, the most common symptoms are fever, dry cough, and tiredness. \"Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, sore throat or diarrhea,\" reads the WHO's website. \"These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually.

    "CDC report details extent of coronavirus outbreaks in U.S. prisons - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is providing the first snapshot of the extent of coronavirus outbreaks in correctional facilities and detention centers across the U.S., where thousands of inmates and staff have tested positive and dozens have died.\n\nJails and prisons, where social distancing is nearly impossible, have emerged as hotspots for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. For its report released Wednesday, the CDC sought data from health departments in 54 states and territories and heard back from 37.\n\nThirty-two of the jurisdictions that responded reported at least one laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case among detainees or staff members in 420 separate jails and prisons. In those facilities, 4,893 inmates had been diagnosed with COVID-19 as of April 21, and 88 had died. Staff members accounted for 2,778 cases and 15 deaths.\n\nMore than half of the facilities reported positive cases only among staff members. The report notes that many of the facilities don't test employees, making the total tally of cases \"dependent on staff members self-reporting their diagnosis to their employer after being tested by their personal health care providers.\" The report notes that staffers \"might be an important source of virus introduction into facilities,\" since they interact with the prison population as well as the broader community.\n\nThe authors of the report wrote that the findings are limited and don't represent the total number of cases in all U.S. correctional facilities. Some of the limitations: Only 69% of jurisdictions reported data, meaning the findings are unrepresentative of the country as a whole. Some jurisdictions also reported data from state prisons but omitted figures from local, federal and privately-owned facilities. The jurisdictions were asked to include data for those in the custody of state and local corrections, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, U.S. Marshals Service and the federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nThe authors also lacked data about the total number of facilities, inmates and staff in the surveyed jurisdictions, meaning they were unable to determine the proportion of cases in each category. The agency requested only the number of facilities that have reported at least one virus case, the number of confirmed cases among detainees and staff, and the number of hospitalizations and deaths linked to the virus.\n\nThe report outlines the challenges of mitigating the spread of the virus in crowded jails and prisons, where social distancing is difficult, if not impossible.\n\n\"Prompt identification of COVID-19 cases and consistent application of prevention measures, such as symptom screening and quarantine, are critical to protecting incarcerated and detained persons and staff members,\" the report said.\n\nThe authors also said widespread testing could be critical in preventing inmates who are released early during the outbreak from further spreading the virus once they're out.\n\n\"Some jurisdictions have implemented decompression strategies to reduce crowding, such as reducing or eliminating bail and releasing persons to home confinement or community supervision,\" the report found. \"Testing might become an important strategy to include when it is more widely available and when facilities have developed plans for how the results can be used to inform operational strategies to reduce transmission risk.\"\n\nPrison in the time of coronavirus\n\nThe report noted that more research is needed \"to identify differences in disease risk based on demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, and type of correctional and detention setting, and to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation measures.\"\n\nThe CDC outlined six strategies correctional and detention facilities plan can use to slow the spread of the virus, including regular symptom screening, isolating those with symptoms, physical distancing, intensified cleaning, infection control training, disinfection of highly-touched surfaces and cloth face coverings.",

    "COVID-19 patients are \"very willing to help\" contact tracers, Connecticut volunteer says": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As more states work to reopen, knowing who has the coronavirus is key. One way to do that is with contact tracing, which is the process of tracking down anyone who may have come into contact with a person who has tested positive.\n\nNew York City, for example, says it plans to hire 1,000 people to help with that effort by the end of the month. Nationally, experts say it will take an army of people, asking the right questions.\n\nPeople like Melissa Thomas in Connecticut, who is chasing some of the newest cases of the virus every day. Thomas calls people who have tested positive, asks them when they first started feeling ill, and if they had \"prolonged contact\" with anyone outside their house since that time.\n\nHer mission is to break the chain of infection by developing a list of everyone who may have been significantly exposed to a patient and urging them to monitor symptoms and self-quarantine.\n\nThomas said she can usually reach about 60% of the patients she tries, getting all the info she needs in less than 30 minutes.\n\n\"I think the hardest part is getting the people to answer the phone in the first place. For those that we actually reach out and talk to, whether they answer the phone or call us back, they're very willing to help,\" Thomas told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Tony Dokoupil.\n\nContact tracing has helped control diseases like Ebola and SARS. And as of now, it also seems to be working for the New Haven Department of Public Health in Connecticut, where Thomas is a volunteer.\n\n\"We're doing between two to three [calls] an hour,\" Thomas said. \"In New Haven, we've averaged about 100 new cases a day, and with our team, we're able to handle that.\"\n\nBut there's no federal requirement for contact tracing, leaving states and cities to create plans of their own.\n\n\"I think it's important for us to come up with a strategy that says we're not just going to try and mitigate the disaster; we're actually going to try and contain the growth of the virus,\" said Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker.\n\nBaker announced the first statewide contact tracing program last month. It's grown into a 1,000-person team, reaching hundreds of patients a day.\n\n\"People want to talk about what it means to have this virus,\" Baker said. \"They're looking for help with respect to how they isolate, and they're willing to give us their close contacts, which by the way, so far, have not been big numbers.\"\n\nBut those numbers are likely to spike as people return to work. To stay ahead of the pandemic, America will need an additional 100,000 contact tracers, according to Johns Hopkins University. An NPR investigation found states have hired or announced plans to hire about 66,000 so far.\n\nIf there were national standards or rules around contact tracing, \"that could be very helpful,\" Baker said.\n\n\"There is a lot of back-and-forth between states, and people move. I mean, they don't just work; they move,\" he said.\n\nAs more Americans test positive for the virus, researchers say confidentiality is key for contact tracing, which means shielding the identity of every COVID-19-positive patient even from the people they may have infected.\n\nResponding to concerns some Americans may have about their privacy, Thomas said, \"We take confidentiality very seriously.\"\n\n\"That's a big component of what we do, as far as not sharing information of who is a positive test result. That is extremely important,\" she said. \"But also, by notifying people that they may have been exposed, it greatly reduces the spread of the disease, so the more information people can provide, the better and the more effective that this technique will be.\"\n\nTechnology is also expected to play a big role in the effort. Google and Apple this month are expected to debut a tool allowing people to receive an automatic alert if their phone has been near a COVID-19-positive person.\n\nBut for many people, that brings up more privacy concerns. A recent poll found more than half of Americans wouldn't use such an app.",

    "Can bathing in bleach treat COVID-19 symptoms? Doctors say absolutely not": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Several members of the Cuomo family have been in the news recently, and every story has to do with the coronavirus. Weeks after CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, brother of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, tested positive for COVID-19, he announced that his wife, Cristina Greeven Cuomo, tested positive as well.\n\nCristina Greeven Cuomo runs a health and wellness site called \"The Purist,\" where she blogged about her unusual regimen while battling the virus, including bathing in a bleach solution. She said she decided to give it a try as a \"more affordable\" alternative to an IV vitamin drip to purportedly \"neutralize heavy metals\" in the body.\n\n\"While IVs are subject to cost and are not cheap (a vitamin drip ranges around $300 whereas a hospital will charge thousands of dollars for them and for medication that has no proven studies behind them), I wanted to try a more affordable way I heard about to neutralize heavy metals: take a bath,\" Cuomo writes.\n\nShe writes that Dr. Linda Lancaster suggested a bath with \"a nominal amount of bleach,\" and explained that the idea is to \"combat the radiation and metals in my system and oxygenate it.\"\n\nCuomo says since she had no sense of smell or open cuts, she decided to try it. \"So, I add a small amount -- 1/4 to 1/2 cup ONLY -- of Clorox to a full bath of warm water (80 gallons),\" she writes.\n\nHowever, many doctors advise against trying this and warn in stark terms that it could be dangerous. In an email to CBS News, microbiologist Dr. Dean Hart said bathing in bleach is a bad idea.\n\n\"While us in science do not like to speak in absolutism, I have never heard, ever, of a bleach bath being recommended for the treatment of any disease,\" Hart said. \"Don't do that. It is not a good idea, in fact, it's a bad idea. It could hurt you. The air becomes toxic around a bleach or chlorine bath. This has the potential to be very harmful, whether you are observing through your skin or breathing.\"\n\nHart said while bleach is useful in the clothes-washer and chlorine disinfects swimming pools, it's not meant for the body.\n\n\"Dense bleach could kill you. I have never heard of this before and would not recommend it,\" he said.\n\nFor people wondering how to treat coronavirus symptoms, Dr. Hart says simply: \"Stay home. Sleep. Drink lots of fluids. Take Tylenol.\" Call a doctor if more severe symptoms develop.\n\nThe CDC does recommend diluted household bleach solutions to clean and disinfect some surfaces, and the EPA has compiled a list of disinfectants for use against COVID-19 -- as household cleaners, not treatments.\n\n\"When using an EPA-registered disinfectant, follow the label directions for safe, effective use,\" the EPA states. \"Never apply the product to yourself or others. Do not ingest disinfectant products. This includes never applying [disinfectants] directly to food.\"\n\nOn Thursday, President Trump sparked backlash from the medical community when he floated the idea of using disinfectants to treat coronavirus.\n\nThe president said he'd seen a demonstration of \"the disinfectant where it knocks it [coronavirus] out in a minute,\" and continued: \"And is there a way you can do something like that by injection inside or almost a cleaning? As you see, it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs -- so it'll be interesting to check that. ... It sounds interesting to me.\"\n\nAsked about it again on Friday, the president claimed he was being sarcastic.\n\nThe maker of Lysol put out a statement saying \"under no circumstance should our disinfectant products be administered into the human body (through injection, ingestion or any other route).\"\n\nAnd U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams also warned against self-medicating: \"A reminder to all Americans- PLEASE always talk to your health provider first before administering any treatment/ medication to yourself or a loved one. Your safety is paramount, and doctors and nurses are have years of training to recommend what's safe and effective,\" Adams tweeted",

    "Can you get coronavirus twice? \"I don't think we know the answer,\" doctor says": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The World Health Organization warned there's currently no evidence that people who've recovered from the coronavirus are protected from a second infection. More than 260 patients in South Korea have retested positive after it was thought they had recovered, according to the country's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, raising questions about whether the virus can be reactivated.\n\nColorado nurse practitioner Lisa Merck tested positive for coronavirus in March. As a health care worker, Merck gets repeat tests, so she knows when she can safely return to work.\n\nOn day 21 of isolation, she tested negative. But, just seven days later, she got a retest and was shocked at the result.\n\n\"This is really scary to me,\" she said. Merck was once again positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"It's really confusing. It's very frustrating,\" Merck told CBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula.\n\nMerck said she thinks the negative test was a false negative, but said, \"there's no way to tell\" if it was or if she got infected with coronavirus again.\n\nViral PCR tests based on nose and throat swabs like the ones for coronavirus are reliable about 60% to 90% of the time, depending on the test.\n\nAsked if people can get COVID-19 twice, Dr. Stanley Perlman, who has been studying coronaviruses like SARS and MERS for nearly 40 years, said, \"I don't think we know the answer to that yet.\"\n\nPerlman, a professor at the University of Iowa, said about 50% of people who had a SARS infection still have antibodies now, 17 years later.\n\n\"So that would tell you, maybe most of them are protected against SARS again,\" he said.\n\nFor MERS, he said, \"the amount of antibody seems to have declined fairly rapidly if you have mild disease. If you have severe disease, it lasts much longer.\"\n\nJust like with MERS, Perlman believes more severe COVID-19 symptoms may mean longer-lasting immunity.\n\n\"We think that you will be protected at least for some amount of time,\" he said. \"Especially if you had pneumonia. If you have only the upper airway infection, you may get infected again.\"\n\nPerlman said the good news is that COVID-19 is not mutating quickly. \"So, this means that making a vaccine is more feasible because the virus isn't changing,\" he said.\n\nResponding to the data from South Korea about people retesting positive for the virus, Perlman said, \"The question is whether it really is reactivation or it's low-level infection that was not detected for a period of time and now is detected.\"\n\nMartin Hirsch, of Massachusetts General Hospital, agreed. Genetics and several other factors affect immune response, he said.\n\n\"Younger people, healthy people without any underlying conditions are the most likely to develop prolonged antibodies,\" he said.\n\nWith COVID-19, the WHO said it needs more evidence about how effective the antibodies are and how long immunity will last.\n\n\"I think those people who test positive, then negative and then positive within a few days or a few weeks are almost certainly not reinfected,\" Hirsch said. \"I think if you go beyond that ... a few months, a few years, then you can start talking about reinfection.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A restaurant that opened for full service on Mother's Day in defiance of state rules banning in-person dining was ordered closed by state health officials on Monday. A video posted by Colorado Community Media showed people sitting at tables and waiting close together in line at the counter while others lined up outside for a chance to get inside the eatery in Castle Rock about 30 miles south of Denver.\n\nExcept for one person wearing a mask, the scene and the din of people talking appeared like just another busy day at any restaurant before the government limited eateries to all but take out service to stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe Tri-County Health Department said C&C Coffee and Korean Kitchen was ordered to remain closed until the department determines that is in compliance with Democratic Gov. Jared Polis' latest health public health order. If the owners refuse to comply, further legal action would be taken against the restaurant that could include the revocation of its license, the department said.\n\n\"It is disheartening that this restaurant has chosen to move ahead of the public orders and not even consider implementing best practices to prevent the spread of COVID-19. It is not fair to the rest of the community and other business owners that are following Safer at Home and doing their part,\" the department's executive director, John M. Douglas, Jr. said in a statement.\n\nIn a tweet to President Donald Trump, the restaurant's owners said they were standing up for America, small businesses, the Constitution and against Polis' overreach in response to the outbreak.\n\nAfter laying off most of their staff during the outbreak, owner Jesse Arellano told CBS Denver that they wanted to stand up for small businesses and get the attention of lawmakers. He acknowledged they could face sanctions for their actions but said they wanted to know much support they had.\n\n\"We need to start doing something about this before we all crash and burn. I know there's a lot of restaurants here shutting their doors,\" Jesse Arellano told the station.\n\nDespite the support, Arellano told CBS Denver he has also been harassed after reopening.\n\n\"I had one person call me a Nazi and a white supremacist, and I said well I'm not even white so... I'm Spanish and Korean. We've had people say they want to burn the place down and hope we all die from coronavirus,\" said owner Jesse Arellano.\n\nHis opinion of the virus?\n\n\"You know there's lies. Dang lies... it's statistics. The projection said 100,000 people are going to die in April that didn't happen. The numbers you know, they keep going down and you know, we keep getting more restrictive, it seems backwards to me.\"\n\nWhile restaurants in Colorado are not allowed to offer sit-down service under Polis' latest order, the state has allowed restaurants in western Colorado's Mesa County to open tables to customers - though only at 30% capacity - because of its low number of cases.\n\nMesa County has not had any coronavirus deaths. Douglas County, a wealthy county that is a mix of suburban and rural areas, has had 28 deaths due to the virus, about 3% of the statewide count.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Success in the fight against the coronavirus may depend in part on two things: learning who has the disease, and who could get it.\n\nHealth officials use a method called contact tracing to find out who infected patients may have met. After a person who tests positive tells the health department with whom they've been in contact, the health department then alerts those people and asks them to monitor their symptoms and to quarantine if needed.\n\nRight now it is up to city, county and state health departments to coordinate efforts. Health departments are expanding their rosters of tracers, and some of the world's biggest tech companies have also stepped in to help.\n\nIn Salt Lake County, which has more than half of Utah's 3,000-plus COVID-19 cases, they're aggressively stepping up contact tracing. \"We know it's important to not just know who the positive cases [are], but who, in an infectious disease, they have been in contact with,\" said Gary Edwards, executive director of Salt Lake County Health Department.\n\nCBS News national correspondent Jericka Duncan asked, \"Are you testing people in the house as well when you know that someone has tested positive for COVID-19?\"\n\n\"If it is a household, we do want those families tested, yes, because that has been especially close contacts,\" Edwards replied.\n\nContact tracing is expanding across the country.\n\nRhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo asked everyone in the state to keep a personal log of whom they've encountered.\n\nMassachusetts is investing $44 million to hire and train more tracers.\n\nAnd in San Francisco, with more than 1,000 cases, and at least 20 deaths, health care officials use text messaging to communicate with people who've tested positive, and their close contacts most at risk.\n\nDr. Mike Reid, of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said, \"For every new case there are 3-5 close contacts.\"\n\nThe department is calling on everyone from medical students to librarians to help them with contact tracing.\n\n\"The reason we're training people now is so that we're ready 3, 4, 5 weeks' time, whenever the decision is made to end shelter-in-place,\" Reid said.\n\nTech companies are also preparing.\n\nApple and Google recently announced a joint plan to create software for iPhones and Androids that will allow them to keep a record of every other phone they've come in close contact with. The tracking is voluntary.\n\n\"Your phone will know what other phones you have been near for a period of time,\" said Dan Ackerman, senior managing editor for CNET. \"Then if you, let's say, test positive, and you alert the system, it will go and find all of the phones that you have been near over the last 14 days.\n\n\"Of course, there's a lot of issues with that. Just because your phone is within Bluetooth range of another phone doesn't mean you were necessarily in communicable disease range of somebody.\"\n\n\"Americans love their apps, but they also love their privacy,\" said Duncan.\n\n\"When you think about tracking and tracing, all news over the last several years has been negative,\" Ackerman said. \"Now, they're trying to shift it into something being for a greater public good, it may be a hard sell.\"\n\nSouth Korea has also used smartphones to trace the spread of the virus, but that effort is mandatory, not voluntary.\n\nAlso important: contact tracers will never ask for your Social Security number, your financial information, or your immigration status.",

While most kids have milder symptoms than adults, not all do.\n\nKarla Duarte, a 16-year-old high school junior from New York, is one of the relatively few children in the U.S. to have severe complications from COVID-19.\n\n\"I would never, like, picture me having to be intubated and being in the hospital,\" she told CBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula.\n\nAfter she was intubated, \"her numbers were not improving, her oxygen level was not improving,\" Duarte's mom, Ana Tejada, said.\n\nDoctors told Tejada they had one treatment option left: an ECMO machine, which pumps and oxygenates the patient's blood outside the body.\n\n\"When they told me about the machine, they said, 'You know, this is 50/50,'\" Tejada said.\n\nAfter seven days on ECMO and five more on a ventilator, Duarte's condition finally improved. She was sent home after 21 days in the hospital.\n\nDuarte never had any medical problems before this, she said.\n\nSerious cases like hers are rare, complicating the efforts of investigators.\n\n\"We have much less experience because the children are just getting less sick, so there are many fewer children interacting with the health care system and being tested,\" said Dr. Tina Hartert of Vanderbilt School of Medicine.\n\nHartert is leading the new NIH study that is remotely monitoring about 2,000 children and their families in 11 cities nationwide. She said more data should be collected before a decision is made to send kids back to school or summer camp.\n\n\"I think it's really risky to base decisions about this based on the fact that children get less sick from this virus, because that does not equal children being less likely to transmit the virus,\" Hartert said.\n\nDr. Adrianne Randolph, who is leading a separate CDC-funded study at Boston Children's Hospital, said doctors aren't completely sure what the risk factors are for why children get sick with COVID-19.\n\nDescribing the symptoms seen in children with the disease, Randolph said, \"it's scattered reports.\"\n\n\"What they're seeing is cardiac dysfunction -- so that their heart's not working as well as it should,\" she said. \"And abdominal pain is often part of the presentation.\"\n\nJuliet Daly, age 12, went into cardiac arrest at a Louisiana hospital.\n\n\"They had to do two minutes of CPR on her, and then they got her back, thank God,\" her mom, Jennifer, said.\n\nJuliet tested positive for the coronavirus and another viral infection, her mom said. She was in the ICU for 10 days before recovering.\n\nJennifer said she would tell other families to \"be vigilant, be careful.\"\n\n\"It can become very severe in less than a day,\" she said.\n\nThe New York City Department of Health reports that 15 children have been hospitalized with a rare inflammatory syndrome that they're saying is potentially associated with the coronavirus. The condition can involve fever, rash, low blood pressure and inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. The city health department says these cases have features of Kawasaki disease, a condition that has also been reported in a number of children with coronavirus in the U.K.",

        "body": "The number of coronavirus cases has spiked to nearly 4,000 in the Ohio prison system, a number that state officials are attributing to \"aggressive testing.\" The Marion Correctional Institution has become one of the top hotspots in the country, where 2,011 inmates and 154 staffers have tested positive, officials said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there were 3,762 inmates and 319 staffers who tested positive system-wide. Nine inmates and one staffer have died from the virus, according to the state's Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. That's about 30% of all cases in Ohio. There have been 12,516 positive cases total across the state, along with 509 deaths, according to the Ohio Department of Health.\n\n\"A lot of the problems are we don't have a lot of personal protective equipment going into this episode,\" said Christopher Mabe, president of the Ohio Civil Service Employees Association, which represents nearly 8,000 correctional officers. \"It's virtually impossible to social distance in a prison,\" Mabe told CBS affiliate WBNS.\n\nThe state's Department of Rehabilitation and Correction attributed the rapid rise in cases to an \"aggressive\" approach to testing, which includes testing of all staff and inmates at Marion, the Pickaway Correctional Institution and the Franklin Medical Center.\n\n\"Because we are testing everyone -- including those who are not showing symptoms -- we are getting positive test results on individuals who otherwise would have never been tested because they were asymptomatic,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nGovernor Mike DeWine last week approved the release of 105 inmates under the state's emergency overcrowding law and commuted six sentences through the state's parole board, his office said in a statement.\n\n\"While we know coronavirus does pose a specific threat to congregate settings, this comprehensive testing will give us insight on both how to best coordinate response at these facilities, as well as data and insight on how comprehensive testing within a cohort will affect testing numbers,\" DeWine said in a statement Tuesday. \"I want Ohioans to know that these numbers do not necessarily indicate a new problem at these facilities, but simply wider testing.\"",

    "Coronavirus hits Iowa firefighter's family with deadly consequence": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "His mother first fell sick a month ago with an illness she believes she caught at the Iowa egg factory where she works.\n\nHis younger sister, 22, was next -- a new mother who was soon on a ventilator fighting for her life. Then the coronavirus came for his father, Jose Gabriel Martinez, 58, who died Tuesday in the same hospital where he lived his final days near his unknowing daughter.\n\nAfter a month of caring for his virus-stricken family, firefighter Omar Martinez is now planning a funeral for his father, who was a factory worker known for giving his all to provide for his family. He's hoping for the recovery of his sister Evelyn, who is alert after being taken off a ventilator Thursday. He's dreading having to tell her the news about their dad.\n\nOmar, 29, said he's grateful that his mother has recovered and that he, two siblings and his 2-year-old niece have stayed healthy. He's also touched by the support they've received from neighbors in West Liberty, a heavily Hispanic city of 3,800 where his family settled after immigrating from Mexico in the 1990s.\n\nHe wants people to know how easily the virus can spread if they infect others and how quickly that can devastate a family.\n\n\"All it takes is one person to be irresponsible to affect a family that doesn't deserve it,\" Omar Martinez said in an interview. \"I don't wish this upon anybody. I get asked every day how do I do it? I have no answers.\"\n\nThe Martinez family's situation is illustrative of the startling racial and ethnic disparities among those getting infected and dying from the coronavirus.\n\nWhile Latinos make up 6% of Iowa's population, they have accounted for more than 22% of its confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the state Department of Public Health. The disparity widened as more testing was conducted on plant workers, who are disproportionately Latino and account for more than a quarter of Iowa's confirmed cases. State officials say more dense housing environments also play a role.\n\nThe virus has spread faster in Iowa, which now has more than 5,000 confirmed cases, than almost any other state in recent days. In West Liberty, a turkey processing factory that has long attracted immigrants to the area reported that 52 workers had tested positive.\n\nOmar's parents met in their Mexican home town before moving to Dallas and then to West Liberty in the 1990s, when Omar was a child. His father, who went by his middle name Gabriel, became a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe family added two daughters and another son and became a staple of the community, taking part in school activities and attending the Catholic church. Omar worked with his father at a distribution warehouse before he joined the West Liberty Fire Department. Two years ago, Evelyn gave birth to a baby, Maia. Gabriel became a doting grandfather.\n\nThe family still lives together in the one-story home that Omar's parents purchased in the early 2000s for $45,000.\n\nAurelia Martinez, 52, had been a stay-at-home mother as the children grew up. She got a job after Hy-Line North America opened a large egg production plant in nearby Wilton in 2015.\n\nIn late March, Aurelia began feeling tired and sick and isolated herself in one of the bedrooms, Omar said. She tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3, suspecting that a sick coworker passed her the virus. A Hy-Line spokesman confirmed that's the date that the last of six Wilton factory workers tested positive.\n\nEvelyn, a waitress, got the chills, body aches and a fever two days later. Soon, she started suffering from coughing spasms and was unable to sleep or eat. Omar gave her Tylenol and fluids.\n\nThe family persuaded Evelyn to go to Mercy Hospital in Iowa City on April 10 after her coughing got so bad that her face turned purple. That night, she was intubated and put on a ventilator.\n\n\"Her oxygen levels were low. If we would have waited a day she might not have made it,\" Omar said.\n\nThe family patriarch, Gabriel, started showing symptoms two days later. By then, the Procter and Gamble factory where he worked had started making hand sanitizer because demand was surging.\n\nOmar recalled sleeping on the floor of his father's bedroom and giving him Tylenol in the middle of the night. He took Gabriel to the hospital on April 15 when his cough worsened, holding his hand on the way and telling him everything would be okay.\n\nThat night would be his last conversation with his father, who had been healthy just days earlier. On a FaceTime call, Gabriel said the hospital was transferring him to the intensive care unit that was already housing Evelyn. His oldest son and wife told him they loved him. Soon, he was also on a ventilator.\n\nDoctors said Gabriel made steady progress over the next few days and they began turning down the settings on his ventilator. But on Monday night, he started showing irregular heart rhythms. The family stayed up praying, but early Tuesday morning, they were told he had died.\n\nRemarkably, that's when Evelyn's condition started to dramatically improve.\n\n\"She had been very unstable while my dad was doing well. But when he passed, in those next 24 hours she was making big improvements,\" Omar said.\n\nOn Thursday, doctors removed her from the ventilator and reported that she was awake and alert and asking to see her parents and daughter. They are cautiously optimistic that she may soon begin rehabilitation if her breathing keeps improving.\n\nNeighbors have inundated the family with groceries and other offers of help. A local grocery store held a fundraiser for the family. Donors have given more than $23,000 to a GoFundMe account to cover funeral and health expenses.\n\nOmar, choking up, said his father had been touched by the outpouring before his death.\n\n\"Seeing all the groceries, his face would light up with a smile,\" he said. \"The little things like that brightened up his world.\"",

    "Coronavirus: The hidden pain and sorrow of dying at home": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Stories from three grieving families of COVID-19 victims: \"I didn't say goodbye because I didn't think it was goodbye.\"\n\nMany victims of the novel coronavirus take their last breath through a ventilator. Often, they are alone. Their loved ones are prohibited from being with them in person, but if they are fortunate, they might catch a last glimpse through a smartphone screen. In these patients' final moments, it is the doctors and nurses who see the virus's grim toll, bearing witness behind facemasks and protective gear. Roughly 50,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19 in the United States, most of them taking place in the eerie isolation of an intensive care unit.\n\nBut an uncounted number of victims have died in a markedly different way, suddenly robbed of life in their beds or on their couches, in the home where doctors had told them to shelter for safety. Many of their deaths are not factored into the national COVID-19 death toll because medical examiners did not have the capacity to test them for the virus.\n\nWhile family members of those who die at home have seen death's pallor, their grief takes many shades. Some are angry, wondering whether things might have turned out differently if a doctor had directed their loved one to go to the hospital. Some are grateful for the extra moments they could share. Some are left to sort through their loneliness in the very room where the death took place.\n\nHere, three people who watched helplessly as death gave no notice share their loved ones' last days in the place they called home.\n\nPeople like Tim who are dying at home, it's a waste, and it's a tragedy. There are people who have died in New York City. I'm from New York. My heart goes out to the people of New York. The towers coming down was awful. This is worse. This is affecting all of us, whether we're in New York or not.\n\nIt was so insidious. And it snuck up slowly.\n\nWhen news last month indicated COVID-19 had begun spreading throughout the world, Tim Liszewski did not think he had reason to be worried.\n\nThe 60-year-old did not get sick often and had no underlying health issues -- no diabetes, no heart disease. He dealt with two pulmonary embolisms a few years ago, but his fianc\u00e9e Maris Burton said he had recovered well and subsequently had no compromised lung function. He was also physically active. An avid hiker, he had hiked the northern portion of the Appalachian Trail last spring, and he and Burton were preparing to hike Spain's Lighthouse Way for their honeymoon this May. So when he left his Columbia, South Carolina home to fly to Wisconsin for a work retreat on March 9, he joked with Burton about bringing disinfecting wipes to clean his seat on the plane.\n\nWhen Liszewski returned home from the retreat on March 12, he was coughing and sneezing. The next day, Burton said, they took a three-mile walk along the Saluda River, but by that weekend, Liszewski was not feeling well enough for their usual hike. Nor could he muster the energy to perform his weekly service work feeding the homeless and volunteering for the Nickelodeon, a local nonprofit movie theater.\n\nFiguring Liszewski just had a cold, he and Burton two stocked up on over-the-counter medicine and comfort food, including chicken soup and a bag of navel oranges. Liszewski cut one the next day, offering a slice to Burton. \"Man, this is a disappointing orange,\" Burton remembers saying. \"It just doesn't taste right.\"\n\nBy the following weekend, they both felt ill, with temperatures hovering around 100 degrees. Liszewski consulted a doctor who found that his symptoms qualified him for a COVID-19 test, so he got tested that Saturday while Burton stayed in bed, too sick to leave. The doctors told him he would get the results back in two to five days.\n\nWe have our wedding planned for May 23rd. The save the date cards have gone out. We've been following the coronavirus not just with our illness, but we're hearing about in Italy, and France, and China, and out in California and Washington State. This thing is here.\n\nSpain, where we're planning to honeymoon, is making noises about closing it down. So Tim and I starting to talk about, \"You know, I think we're going to have to postpone it, and not just for a couple of months.\" We want people to be able to travel. And we're thinking, you know, \"What's a year? We've waited this long. It's been 15 years, engaged for five. So we'll just plan this for next May 23rd or 22nd to be a Saturday.\" So we're kind of coming to peace at, \"All right. We're not getting married this spring.\"\n\nLiszewski got his first taste of political activism in 2004 when he volunteered for Democratic presidential primary candidate Rep. Dennis Kucinich, who was from his hometown of Cleveland. That year, Liszewski attended the Democratic National Convention, where he was one of 43 delegates who cast their vote for Kucinich, Burton said.\n\nAfter the election, Liszewski was recruited to become director of the Carolina Peace Resource Center, a public interest group in South Carolina that advocates non-violence. A post on the group's Facebook page remembered Liszewski: \"Tim is fondly remembered for, among other things, his kindness and commitment, dry humor, and for quickly organizing a large candlelight rally with Gold Star mothers Cindy Sheehan and Elaine Johnson at Columbia's Martin Luther King Park in 2005 despite only two days' notice, not a small feat.\"\n\nRecently, Liszewski became the Great Plains regional director for Indivisible, a grassroots organization, whose goal is to elect progressive candidates and defeat President Trump's agenda.\n\nTim was an activist, a kind-hearted, gentle man. He loved sports, loved his Cleveland Indians, the Cavaliers, Cleveland Browns. And a lover of life, of music, of literature, nature, and art. He loved to make friends wherever he went, but he was also an introvert. One of the things that we talked about a lot was how his chosen field was being an organizer and a trainer where he had to interact with people on a daily, hourly basis, and then he'd be exhausted. And the end of a conversation or a meeting, he'd come home and just be quiet.\n\nAs Liszewski awaited the results of his COVID-19 test, Burton says his condition got worse. His head hurt; he was nauseated and had no appetite. He tried eating a favorite candy -- jellied fruit slices -- but it suddenly tasted strange to him. When his temperature hit 101.9, he called his doctor, who prescribed Zofran for the nausea and told him to up his dose of extra-strength Tylenol to two pills at a time.\n\nBefore he went to bed on Friday, March 27, his temperature had lowered to 99 degrees.\n\nHe wakes up Saturday morning, 6:30. He's restless, can't sleep, and says, \"You need to sleep. I'm going to go downstairs. I'll just play on the computer or something.\" I go, \"Okay.\" So he goes downstairs, and I go back to sleep and wake up at about 10:00. I see he's not in bed with me. And the house just feels still. I have a parrot and typically when any of us are downstairs, the parrot likes to chat to us. He doesn't talk, but he makes an awful lot of noise. And I hadn't heard any squawking from downstairs. And I go downstairs.\n\nDeath has a stillness. It's more than absence of life. It is ultimate quiet. And he's slumped over on the couch... And I knew he was dead.\n\nFour days after Liszewski died -- and 11 days after he took the test -- the county coroner's office called Burton to confirm her fianc\u00e9 had been infected with COVID-19. Because Liszewski tested positive for the virus, the medical examiner's office could not perform an autopsy on him out of safety for the coroner.\n\nBurton is not sure if receiving the results earlier would have made a difference. Liszewski had a fever, a headache and lost his sense of smell -- not symptoms they likely would have deemed worthy of going to the hospital, she said.\n\nBut she said she is frustrated that doctors might not know how to prevent deaths like Liszewski's in the future. His death certificate lists acute respiratory distress syndrome, pneumonia, and COVID-19 as causes of death; Burton disagrees with that conclusion. Liszewski never complained about shortness of breath or trouble breathing, she explains.\n\nBurton wonders: If the coroner cannot perform an autopsy to determine what happened, how the coronavirus paved its path of destruction, how can doctors prevent deaths like Tim's in the future?\n\nHad he gone into the hospital, he would have been in isolation because he was suspected COVID-19. I'm suspected COVID-19, so I could not have been with him. He would have died in the hospital with not even a nurse around because the sudden death.\n\nI am blessed and grateful that Tim died at home with me. I didn't say goodbye because I didn't think it was goodbye. But we were doing our usual hugging and kissing. He was with me. He was home. He was here. And he was loved.\n\nThis is a hole in your heart that will never be filled again. You know, as time goes on, I'm sure we'll reach a point, my wife and I, that we'll be able to think about him and smile. But my wife lost her father 17 years ago, and she said it was devastating. But it's nothing compared to losing a child.\n\nParents aren't supposed to be burying their children. It's supposed to be the other way around. It was on March 31, so it's still almost surreal. And you have good days and bad days. But it's the little things that will happen or you'll see that really make it hit home that this is real. And those are the times you just break down.\n\nWhen Robert Hirschmann came down with flu-like symptoms last month, he knew he had to isolate from his wife, Denise, and their four children.\n\nA two-time cancer survivor, Hirschmann has used a feeding tube for years because of the long-term side effects of radiation treatments for stage-four neck cancer. The tube has cause him to aspirate, which has led to pneumonia nearly a dozen times, so when he learned about the symptoms of COVID-19, he knew he was high-risk. He confined himself to his bedroom.\n\nElsewhere in Hirschmann's Fraser, Michigan home, his 24-year-old son Ben was quarantined in his own room. The younger Hirschmann began feeling sick around March 19, and when the coughing, headache, and fever persisted for a few days, he decided to seek medical care. Ben couldn't see his primary care physician in person because she was taking all her appointments through telemedicine, Robert said. The hospital system his doctor is with was using the videoconferencing format to protect its healthcare providers and brace for a surge of COVID-19 patients.\n\nOver the video appointment, Ben's doctor told him he probably had the flu, his father said. Ben was prescribed cough medicine and told to take over-the-counter medicine to treat his fever and headache. Then the doctor told him to stay home.\n\nIsolated in their separate bedrooms, Robert and his son didn't see much of each other as they tried to recuperate.\n\nBen, any picture you see of him, there's a smile on his face and a twinkle in his eye. I mean, when he walked into a room, people smiled, and it became a happier place. He loved to dance. He went to his cousin's wedding that was in Jamaica, and he was up on stage in the dance contest. And he won it, of course. He had a heart of gold. He would do anything for anybody.\n\nAs much as a staunch conservative he is, he's not one that hates the other side. If you have different views than him, that was fine. And he could still become good friends with you. You know, a good person's a good person regardless of their political persuasion.\n\nRobert said wherever his son went, friendships followed -- Ben's all-boys Catholic high school, Grand Valley State University, and the rallies he attended in support of President Donald Trump.\n\nBen was an active volunteer for the Michigan Republican Party, and in 2016, even landed a spot in the VIP section behind then-candidate Trump during a speech in Grand Rapids. In 2018, he worked phone banks at the local Republican headquarters to get out the vote during the midterm elections, and earlier this year, he attended anti-impeachment rallies. At each event, he connected with fellow Trump supporters from around the country.\n\n\"A lot of us are from other states,\" Ben told a Buzzfeed reporter at a Trump rally in 2017. \"This is a great way where we can all meet up again and coordinate and see each other.\"\n\nA few years ago, Ben interned for Michigan State Senator Peter Lucido. Lucido remembers an energetic young man who loved politics.\n\n\"At every event he makes the room swell with joy that he's there and anticipation of what's to come,\" Lucido said. \"This young man would have made a very special public servant to the people of Michigan.\"\n\nI know they've said there's cases where people think they'll come on quickly and within a day, and they can crash and burn. The night before, my wife said he still had the cough, wasn't feeling good, and was a little bit weak. He was just taking Nyquil for a headache. But she hadn't heard the rasping in his lungs when he talked. I mean, he was still sick. But not being doctors, we were thinking it was just a flu bug, didn't know the extent. And we don't have a stethoscope here, not that I would know what to listen for anyways.\n\nAs the days wore on, Ben's condition wavered between improving and declining. But by March 30, he still had a cough and a fever and felt it was time to talk to the doctor again. In that second telemedicine appointment, Robert said, Ben's doctor told him he looked and sounded a little bit better. She reiterated that the illness was likely caused by the flu and advised him to keep treating it at home.\n\nThirteen hours later, around 5:00 the next morning, Ben woke up with a terrible headache. He was sweating and shaking. His mom called 911, told Ben to get dressed, and woke up her husband.\n\nWhen Robert came out of his bedroom, he saw his son had collapsed in a chair. He joined his wife in performing CPR until the ambulance arrived.\n\nI'm actually a retired police officer so I understand how this works. And as they were working on him, I realized full well that they weren't going to transport to the hospital unless they got a heartbeat back, just because of the conditions. And they weren't able to bring him back at that time.\n\nThe bitterness we feel is that, you know, there's little doubt in my mind that if he had actually seen his doctor face-to-face, where she could have taken his vitals and listened to his lungs, that he would probably be alive today.\n\nBut for anybody out there that if you have it, or if you think you do and you're self-monitoring, err on the side of caution. And don't hesitate to get yourself looked at.\n\nBen's autopsy revealed his lungs were filled with pneumonia caused by COVID-19, according to Robert, who believes doctors' reliance on telemedicine led to his son's death.\n\nState Senator Lucido said he is now drafting legislation he calls \"Ben's Bill,\" which he said would examine how Michigan uses telemedicine.\n\n\"There is a greater good with telemedicine, but it depends on the case,\" Lucido said. \"In COVID-19, there was no telling what was going to happen and when it was going to happen, which makes the difference.\"\n\nAfter his son died, Robert kept coughing. He went to the emergency room, where doctors performed an X-ray. Even though he was high-risk and had a son who had died from the coronavirus, Robert said the doctors would not test him for COVID-19. Instead, encouraged by his X-ray results, doctors sent him home to stay in quarantine.\n\nWe always said he was the life of the party. Not that he was a wild man, but just because he would brighten up any room he went into. So my advice is to live like Ben. Live it to the fullest and be happy. And spread the happiness -- because you just don't know when you can be taken away.\n\nThis disease is serious. It doesn't discriminate. It snatches you and stops your heart, and you're done. And people not taking it serious are going to be sorry. I didn't know how serious this thing was until I actually experienced it firsthand, and I witnessed this firsthand not once, but twice. This beast right here is really unbelievable. None of us knew.\n\nIt started with a cough.\n\nBy the time COVID-19 ran its course through Joseph Friday's life, it had taken his mother, his brother, and his livelihood. Now he sits alone in the Bronx apartment he used to share with his mother, Yvette Judge, and his brother, Matthew Friday, listening to news about the virus that forever changed his family.\n\nBefore the cough, Joseph's life was that of a caregiver. Matthew had suffered several strokes and had issues with his heart and liver. Judge was a cancer survivor whose left side had been weakened by chemotherapy treatments. Joseph took them to doctor's appointments, washed their clothes, bought their food, and counted out their medicine multiple times a day. Since June, he had been paid to take care of Matthew through New York's Consumer Directed Personal Assistance Program (CDPAP). Funded through Medicaid, the program pays tens of thousands of New Yorkers to care for their ailing loved ones.\n\nSo when he began seeing news articles about the new coronavirus, Joseph knew his brother's and mother's compromised immune systems put them both at risk.\n\nThen, on March 20, Matthew started coughing. Soon, Joseph and their mother were coughing, too.\n\nFour days later, Matthew fell coming out of the bathroom. He told Joseph not to worry; he had only tripped. But the next day, Matthew fell again, this time into the coffee table. As Joseph lifted him into a chair, he saw his brother's hands were shaking. Once in the chair, Matthew could barely move. Joseph called 911.\n\nThe ambulance came and took Matthew to nearby St. Barnabas Hospital, where Joseph said he told staff his brother had been coughing. The next day, just six days after Matthew had begun coughing, hospital staff called Joseph to tell him his brother's heart had stopped -- and that he had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nI was telling my mother that she's looking sickly. She was coughing, and I'm like, oh my God, we both got COVID. And there's nothing I could do at that moment because I know that her immune system was compromised, so I know she didn't have too long. So I was like, let's go to the hospital. Then I thought about it, and I said, well the hospital was crowded. The beds were full. And she was like, \"No, I don't want to go.\"\n\nBack at the apartment, Judge was getting sicker. Two days after her son died, she seemed disoriented. Joseph said he made her a cup of tea, but when he handed it to her, her hands were shaking so badly that she dropped it.\n\nThat night, as Joseph walked by his mother's room, he saw her foaming at the mouth. Her muscles were stiff and she was having a hard time moving, he said, so he dialed 911. But Judge stopped breathing before the ambulance arrived.\n\nJoseph said emergency responders worked on his mother for 20 minutes but were not able to revive her. It would take another eight to nine hours, he said, before the medical examiner's office was able to pick up her body.\n\nAny time I had to pass her, man, I just kept breaking down. This thing was tragedy, man. I know that I lost two family members to COVID. But then, the medical examiner's office called, and they said, \"Oh, she died from something else.\" I said, \"Well listen. Did they do a test for COVID?\" They said, \"No, she died from this and that.\" I mean, why wouldn't they do a test? It's not a waste of money. If you knew that someone in this house that had it, and they both were well until they started coughing, like, come on. Both of them died from COVID. And I had symptoms also.\n\nThe first two weeks were really hard because it's just the memories. I caught myself at first getting up, preparing the medicines, and just started breaking down. I broke down for at least about a week and a half, close to two weeks, I was breaking down.\n\nWhile Joseph mourned his brother and mother, he nursed his own symptoms. He coughed. His muscles ached. He had diarrhea and no appetite.\n\nAlthough his self-quarantine has now elapsed, Joseph mostly stays in his apartment for fear of transmitting the virus to someone else. He also worries about his income. His last CDPAP check arrived on April 10, he said, so his time is now spent trying to apply for unemployment insurance benefits.\n\nHe fills the rest of his days listening to the news. He has heard reports of COVID-19 sweeping through nursing homes around the country, and worries about his brother, Anthony Judge, who lives in a nursing and rehabilitation home nearby. Unlike their mother, Anthony does not have life insurance.\n\nIf COVID takes Anthony too, Joseph said, he would likely need to be buried in a mass grave in New York City's potter's field.\n\nWe didn't know that you could just get it by touching something, or from a train or a bus. But you know, you can't cry over spilled milk. There's nothing you can do about it. The only thing you can do is cover up, try to stay in, try to help prevent the spread of this thing.\n\nEach housing unit should start distributing pamphlets. They should start distributing masks, you know, just to get involved, let people know that this thing is serious. The young generation really don't get the picture here. Some people in the middle-age generation don't get the picture.\n\nThis thing is real.",

There are already more than 50 cases of the illness in New York City alone, according to CBS New York, and the state is investigating approximately 100 total statewide.\n\nTwo children and a teenager have died from the illness in New York State, according to a press release from Cuomo's office.\n\n\"We have been behind this virus every step of the way and even as we are now beginning to see the numbers on the decline, the virus is still surprising us,\" Governor Cuomo said in the release. \"Initially we thought COVID-19 didn't affect children, and now we're dealing with a disturbing issue where we have about 100 cases of an inflammatory disease in children that seems to be created by the virus.\"\n\n\"New York is leading the investigation of this situation and we are advising all hospitals and medical providers to prioritize diagnostic testing for any children that are displaying symptoms of this illness,\" he added.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday that New York has at least 52 cases of the illness, and one of the deaths.

The governor has been criticized for a decision in March, which has since been reversed, to send patients back to nursing homes after they tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nMore than 4,800 people died from COVID-19 in nursing homes in the state between March 1 and May 1, according to a tally released by the Cuomo administration on May 1. Cuomo has called nursing homes a \"feeding frenzy\" for the coronavirus.\n\n\"Despite whatever you do, because with all our progress as a society, we can't keep everyone alive,\" Cuomo said.\n\nThe number of deaths in New York state dropped again Saturday to 139 people. When asked about the nursing home deaths, Cuomo noted the 139 people who died on Saturday and asked who is accountable for everyone who died.\n\n\"How do we get justice for those families of those 139 deaths?\" Cuomo said. \"Who can we prosecute for those 139 deaths? Nobody. Mother Nature, God, where did this virus come from? People are going to die by this virus, that is the truth.\"\n\nWhen pressed further about how some people thought their loved ones would be safe because of Matilda's Law, Cuomo continued to stress the point that older and more vulnerable people were \"always going to die from this virus.\" He said when talking who is accountable for deaths, the most important thing was to make sure \"you can have a situation where everyone did the right thing and everyone tried their best.\"\n\nCuomo said his top priority was making sure the medical system did not get overwhelmed, calling that a \"accountable, avoidable situation.\"\n\n\"That's what we protected against and we did it successfully,\" Cuomo said.\n\nCuomo pushed for all New Yorkers who have symptoms of COVID-19 to get tested. He said New York is now conducting 40,000 tests per day at 700 testing sites.\n\n\"If you think you have symptoms, get a test. It's up to you,\" he said. \"We just don't have enough New Yorkers coming to be tested.\"\n\nIn the middle of the briefing, a doctor with full PPE came out and administered a nasal swap test to Cuomo.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that the number of countries reporting a mysterious illness in children believed to be connected to COVID-19 has nearly doubled in just one week. Only seven countries had reported the illness last Thursday, but now six more are investigating cases.\n\nThe number of states with reported cases also jumped significantly, from 17 this time last week to 25 by Thursday, Cuomo said at his daily update on the state's response to the coronavirus pandemic. New York state is investigating 157 cases as of Thursday.\n\nThe illness, dubbed Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, abbreviated as PMIS and also known as MIS-C, appears to be caused by a COVID-19 infection, but does not present with the same symptoms. Inflammation causes fever, abdominal pain and rash, as well an array of other symptoms. It was not initially connected to COVID-19 because it does not appear to cause respiratory issues -- a telltale sign of the coronavirus, according to Cuomo.\n\nThe governor said Thursday that \"in some ways\" PMIS is \"more frightening\" than COVID-19 because it can cause inflammation of the heart's blood vessels, leading to what is essentially a heart attack in a child.\n\nCuomo reiterated his warning that as more states and countries look out for the syndrome's symptoms, more will likely find cases. \"Tip of the iceberg was right because in one week we doubled the countries that found cases,\" he said.\n\nThere is still more unknown about PMIS than is understood. To heed the unknown, Cuomo said it was still too early to make a determination on whether kids in the state can physically return to school in the fall. As a precaution, the state will issue guidelines in June so schools and colleges can begin plans to potentially reopen in September, he said.\n\nSummer school will be taught through distance learning. \"As a parent, until I know how widespread this is, I wouldn't send my child to day camp,\" he said.\n\nCuomo said Wednesday that the majority of new COVID-19 cases are coming from low-income communities and communities of color.\n\n\"That's where the cases are still coming from, that's where the virus is still spreading,\" he said.\n\n\"You look all across the country, it's lower-income communities, predominantly minority, where we're still seeing an increase in the numbers. We looked at that in New York City, we did a very extensive research project, and it is true,\" he said. \"You can look at where the cases are coming, look at the testing data by geographic area, by ZIP code and find out where the cases are coming from.\"\n\nCuomo said testing has shown that about 27% of New York City's lower-income communities tested positive for the coronavirus, while the general population is about 19%. The Bronx had the highest percentage of positive tests at 34%.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Florida Governor Ron DeSantis on Wednesday criticized an ousted Florida official who questioned the state's coronavirus data. Rebekah Jones, who helped manage Florida's COVID-19 data center for the Florida Department of Health, claimed she was fired for refusing to manually alter data to create support for the Sunshine State's reopening plan. But the governor's office has denied that, maintaining Jones was fired for insubordination and disruptive behavior.\n\nStanding next to Vice President Mike Pence, who was in Florida to highlight the state's reopening, DeSantis criticized Jones in front of reporters.\n\n\"One, she's not a data scientist. She is somebody that's got a degree in journalism, communication and geography,\" DeSantis said in Orlando. \"She is not involved in collating any data, she does not have the expertise to do that. She is not an epidemiologist. She is not the chief architect of our web portal, that is another false statement. And what she was doing was she was putting data on the portal which the scientists didn't believe was valid data. So she didn't listen to the people who were her superiors, she had many people above her in the chain of command. So she was dismissed because of that and because of a bunch of different reasons about how she did.\"\n\nEmails obtained by the Tampa Bay Times show that one day before she lost her position keeping up coronavirus data, Jones objected to a removal of records showing people had positive tests or symptoms before cases were announced.\n\nJones told CBS12 News that her departure was \"not voluntary,\" and said she was removed because she was made to censor some data, but refused to \"manually change data to drum up support for the plan to reopen.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, DeSantis said the state's data is \"transparent,\" and pointed to praise of his state's data from Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Deborah Birx.\n\n\"Our data is available, our data is transparent, in fact Dr. Birx has talked multiple times about how Florida has the absolute best data,\" the governor said.",

    "Detroit man with virus symptoms dies after 3 ERs turn him away, family says: \"He was begging for his life\"": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A Detroit family is mourning a man they say was turned away from getting tested for the coronavirus three times.\n\n\"He was begging for his life, but no one would help him at all. Like they just kept sending him away,\" said Keith Gambrell, the stepson of 56-year-old Gary Fowler.\n\nGambrell said he was concerned his stepfather had coronavirus. He took him to three different emergency rooms and said each time, Fowler was not admitted and not tested, despite having many of the symptoms.\n\n\"I honestly believe it was because my father was black. They didn't honestly take his symptoms serious enough to give him a test,\" Gambrell told \"CBS This Morning\" national correspondent Jericka Duncan.\n\nThe day before Fowler died, his father, David, died from COVID-19. Soon after, Fowler's wife, Cheryl, began having symptoms of her own, landing her in the hospital.\n\n\"They put her on the ventilator. I'm just thinking like, man, this is it. I'm about to lose my mom too,\" Gambrell said.\n\nGambrell was concerned other family members could be next, so he called his cousin, State Representative Karen Whitsett for help.\n\nWhitsett, who visited the White House last week to speak about surviving coronavirus, made sure her family was tested.\n\nAsked if she thinks her family would have been tested if she were not a state lawmaker, Whitsett said, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"And that sickens me to have to use that title to be able to have to get my family tested,\" she said.\n\nGambrell and his brothers Troy and Ross all tested positive, he said.\n\nOn Monday, Michigan's governor created a state task force to investigate racial disparities in the pandemic.\n\nLieutenant Governor Garlin Gilchrist, who is the chair of the task force, said it will address \"the fact that there may indeed be medical bias present when it comes to testing, as in who will even get a test, as well as in how treatment is administered.\"\n\nGambrell, who has mild symptoms, is now focused on caring for his mother, Cheryl. She had been sent home from the hospital but was readmitted late Tuesday night on what would have been her 25th wedding anniversary.\n\nAsked what he would say to people who are losing loved ones back-to-back, Gambrell said, \"Just pray. You just got to continue to fight for them and live the life that they will live and be their voice. Someone has to speak for the people that can't get medical attention the proper way, and I feel like that's my duty now.\"\n\nMichigan says it could perform more than 11,000 tests each day if it had enough tests. State officials claim swabs and reagents are in short supply, so right now they are doing about half of that amount.",

    "Device that checks oxygen could be early warning system in coronavirus patients, doctor says": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A New Hampshire emergency room doctor says simple technology could save lives in the fight against the coronavirus. Dr. Richard Levitan, who has three decades of experience, volunteered last month at Bellevue Hospital in New York City for 10 days and shared what he learned in a New York Times op-ed.\n\nLevitan told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King that people could potentially detect coronavirus earlier by checking their oxygen levels at home with pulse oximeters.\n\nRead part of their conversation below.\n\nDr. Richard Levitan: People were sick for days, and then they only came in with shortness of breath, like, the day they presented. ... And they would arrive with oxygen levels that basically were incredible to us. I mean, almost unimaginable how people could be awake and alert and have oxygen levels that are half normal. ... Normally we are 94% to 100% on these devices, these pulse oximeters that measure how much oxygen we have in our blood. And people were showing up with oxygen levels of 50%. Now, this matches the level of oxygen that we've measured on the summit of Mt. Everest. And it's amazing to me that patients could be sick for days, getting sicker, not realizing it.\n\nGayle King: So they had these very low oxygen levels, but they had no sensation of, \"I can't breathe.\" Is that the point you're making?\n\nLevitan: Yeah. Exactly.\n\nKing: You were surprised that some of them were still talking on cellphones. Why is that significant?\n\nLevitan: You know, what is amazing to me with this disease is people's brains are working fine. ... Their oxygen levels have gone down to scary low levels, but it has happened slow enough that their body has accommodated. So they are not like every other patient we see with serious lung disease ... What I'm saying is this disease kills by silent hypoxia, and patients should understand that shortness of breath is a late sign.\n\nKing: And the reason why it's so important to get this early warning is because it could avoid you being on a ventilator and having to be intubated, right?\n\nLevitan: Absolutely. So, you know, we think this pneumonia basically has two phases. ... This silent hypoxia period, where the oxygen's drifting down, but you feel okay. And then the second part of this disease, the part of this disease that kills, is when all of a sudden your lungs get stiff, carbon dioxide finally starts to build up, you begin to feel short of breath, and those patients are the patients who are presenting with COVID pneumonia.\n\nKing: By then, in some cases, it's too late. By the time you go to the hospital and you can't breathe, it's a very serious, often dire situation.\n\nLevitan: Yeah, but let me just reassure people that what the lessons learned in New York are, are that we don't have to put in breathing tubes, even in most of the people who show up with advanced COVID pneumonia.\n\nKing: We don't?\n\nLevitan: No. ... They did a study of 50 patients, and what we learned is that even people who showed up with significant COVID pneumonia, we could keep off of ventilators three out of four of them. So 75% of patients didn't need ventilators. But they needed oxygen. They needed to do what we call positioning maneuvers. So we put them in different positions to help open up areas of their lungs.\n\nKing: How do you know, Dr. Levitan, when you should even check your oxygen levels?\n\nLevitan: Let's talk about Germany. The Germans have the lowest death rates in Europe. What they do is every patient who has COVID, they visit every day and they check their oxygen and they check their vital signs. And so, what I'm saying to you is if you're having symptoms of viral illness, if you're known to have COVID, you should be checking your oxygen. ... If you don't have an oximeter, increased breathing may be a sign of that, but also just feeling worse.\n\nKing: I think most people listening to you will now think, \"I need to get an oximeter.\" Can you explain exactly what that is and how it works?\n\nLevitan: Basically, you know, you just turn this little button on, and you put it on your finger, and within about 10 seconds or so, it displays your heart rate and your oxygen level. ... I think that oximeters in the midst of a respiratory pandemic, and for the next 12 to 24 months, that the public should think of an oximeter the way they do a thermometer. ... It is a tool that they can have at their home that they can check, and that they can call up their doctor and say, \"Hey, my pulse oximeter is reading consistently at this number. Is that something I need to be concerned about?\"\n\nKing: I think every day we're learning something new about this COVID-19, and it seems to be such a moving target, always changing.\n\nLevitan: What I'm telling you is actually hopeful. What we are learning about this disease is it attacks primarily through one pathway, and that's the lungs. We know when it is going to attack. It is going to attack between five to 10 days after infection. ... And we know we have a way to detect it earlier, and that way is by close monitoring of pulse oximetry. ... And what I'm saying to you is that as the public health messaging shifts, ... we can move the treatment curve earlier and do much better for patients.",

    "Doctor details \"torture\" of watching her 4-year-old son struggling to breathe while battling coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As the coronavirus pandemic spreads throughout the world, countless gut-wrenching stories have emerged of families battling the virus. Some of the most difficult to hear are those which involve children. And Dr. Anna Zimmermann, a neonatologist in Denver, Colorado, just added her son's story to that list.\n\n\"Since March 12th, the kids have not left the house,\" she wrote in a blog post on her website, Mighty Littles. \"My husband went to Costco once. I went to Target once. My kids never went on a playdate. I wouldn't let them go across the street to talk to their neighborhood friends. We adopted the stay-at-home recommendations early and stuck to them. We did everything right. But Lincoln got sick.\"\n\nZimmerman said her son, Lincoln, is four years old. He didn't know what coronavirus was when he was admitted to Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children, where his mother works in the NICU.\n\n\"At the time of admission, he needed 2 Liters (L) of oxygen. That same night, he progressed up to needing 4L. By the next day, he was on 6L and then 9L,\" Zimmermann wrote. \"He was working so hard to breathe - using all of the muscles in his chest, abdomen, and neck to help him breathe. As a doctor, I knew he was working hard to breathe. The medical terms used to describe respiratory distress - seesaw breathing, nasal flaring, grunting, retracting, tachypneic - he had them all. As a mom, it was torture watching him struggle.\"\n\nAt the height of his illness, Zimmerman said her son's coughing spells were constant and terrifying. He lost the desire to eat and drink entirely, and he slept for the vast majority of the day and night.\n\n\"He was probably sleeping 20 to 21 hours a day,\" she told CBS News. \"You know, he would wake up for a couple hours in the morning and maybe an hour in the afternoon, but otherwise he was just sleeping. He couldn't eat. All of his energy was going into breathing. And that was pretty scary to watch.\"\n\nInitially, she said, Lincoln's timeline didn't seem consistent with COVID-19, and neither did his tests. He had had mild symptoms for a week before spiking a fever. His chest x-ray presented like a run-of-the-mill respiratory virus. His CBC blood test didn't show the low white blood cell count or low lymphocyte count that most pediatric COVID-19 patients get.\n\nBut two days later, she said, things took a turn for the worse when she got the news that no parent wants to hear: Lincoln's coronavirus test had come back positive.\n\n\"It was definitely baffling when they said his test came back positive for COVID,\" she said. \"Literally, the things that run through your mind are: How? Why? When? Where? What?! Where could it have come from? And you start going through every little thing that you did. I honestly don't know what the exposure was because nobody that we were around was sick, which means the exposure probably came from some asymptomatic person. We did walk around the block. So, could he have stuck his fingers in the mud and then picked his nose? Yes, absolutely. He's a 4-year-old boy. But honestly, I just don't know.\"\n\nZimmermann said she cried for nearly four hours the night her son was diagnosed. She said she couldn't sleep and her heart broke hearing Lincoln vocalize his pain.\n\n\"'Mama, this isn't worth it,'\" she recalled him saying. \"Mama, when is this going to stop? Mama, I don't feel so good. Mama, it is no use. Mama, I'm not gonna go home.\"\n\nThe reassuring texts she had been receiving from coworkers also dried up, she said, as her fellow doctors ran out of ways to spin the situation in a positive light.\n\n\"I was talking with one of the physicians I work with,\" Zimmermann said. \"And you know, when Lincoln first got sick and had a fever, he would say, 'It's not going to be COVID. There's so many other viruses out there right now.' 'Well, even if it is COVID, kids do really well with COVID.' 'Well, even though you're in the hospital, you're only on two liters.' You know, like trying to give me all these positive reassuring texts. And that Wednesday and Thursday, he told me later, 'Yeah, I didn't have any positive reassuring texts to send back' because we all knew how sick Lincoln was, but nobody was really saying how sick he was. He just kept going up on support. Up and up and up and up.\"\n\nThe isolation took its toll on Lincoln's family, too.\n\n\"It was really hard when you're going through a hospital stay with your child to not be able to give your husband a hug or give your daughters a hug - and not only reassure them, but have that comfort that you're used to having in stressful situations,\" Zimmermann said. \"When I get stressed out, my husband gives me a hug. That's really helpful. And we couldn't do that.\"\n\nBut outside the hospital, the community rallied around her family, she said. His school put together a meal train to deliver nightly dinners to his father and sisters back at home. The family's neighbors dropped off fresh berries at the house and sent Zimmermann a care package with shower wipes and dry shampoo, since she couldn't leave Lincoln's hospital room - not even to shower.\n\nThen, nearly a month after Lincoln got sick, he got better, she said. The support he required decreased enough that Zimmermann could administer the oxygen he required at home for the remainder of the time his body needed to heal.\n\n\"He's doing great,\" Zimmermann told CBS News on Friday. \"He's totally recovered. He's running around the backyard with his sisters, off of his oxygen, back to his normal 4-year-old self.\"\n\nNow, she said she hopes her son's story will serve as both a cautionary tale and a comfort to other families facing the prospect of a coronavirus-positive child.\n\n\"You see news stories: People are angry about being at home. Moms are angry about having to homeschool their kids,\" Zimmermann said. \"We're frustrated to have to stay home. And so I was wanting to write our story to say look, this is why you're doing it. Yeah, it's hard to be at home with your kids 24/7. And yes, it's hard to hold down a job. And yes, we're going to lose some income. But look how sick my son got. And we did everything right. And then followed right after that is: Look how sick my son got and he still recovered.\"",

Over 100 children have been affected in New York alone, three of whom died, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nDoctors had suspected early on that coronavirus played a role in the new disorder by triggering an excessive immune reaction, but there was no clear proof that the two were linked.\n\nReported in The Lancet medical journal, the new evidence comes from doctors in Bergamo, the epicenter of coronavirus infections and deaths in Italy, where the nationwide reported death toll is more than 30,000, behind only Britain and the United States.\n\nDoctors at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital compared a series of 10 cases of the illness with cases of a similar rare condition in children called Kawasaki disease, finding a 30-fold increase in cases of Kawasaki-like disease in patients between February and April.\n\nThe acceleration of cases occurred at a pace of about one every three months, indicating a cluster that was fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, especially, the authors noted, since overall hospital admissions were much lower than usual during national stay-at-home orders.\n\n\"Our study provides the first clear evidence of a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this inflammatory condition, and we hope it will help doctors around the world as we try to get to grips with this unknown virus,\" said Dr. Lorenzo D'Antiga, director of child health at the hospital, in The Guardian.\n\nNone of the 10 children in Bergamo died, but the authors reported that their symptoms were much more severe than those of the children with Kawasaki disease. Heart complications were more common, as were lower counts of platelets. A type of white blood cell typical of coronavirus patients was also more prevalent.\n\nFive of the children experienced shock, which did not occur in any of the Kawasaki patients.\n\nThe researchers also highlighted that eight of the 10 children tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that the children had been infected with the virus weeks earlier. They suspect that the two other children may have been false negatives, due to imperfect tests.\n\nWhile Kawasaki disease tends to strike infants and preschoolers, the 10 children with the mysterious disorder were generally several years older. The average age of the Kawasaki patients was 3; the average age of the children with this condition was 7 and a half.\n\nThe doctors warn that the \"strong association\" between the coronavirus and the inflammatory condition should be taken into account as governments around the world ease lockdown restrictions.\n\nBut they also stressed that the disorder is exceedingly rare, diagnosed in no more than one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus. Only a small fraction require intensive care, and even fewer die.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will soon issue an alert asking doctors to report cases of children with symptoms of the syndrome.",

        "body": "Federal inmate dies after giving birth while she was on ventilator\n\nA pregnant inmate whose baby was delivered by cesarean section while she was on a ventilator after being hospitalized with coronavirus symptoms has died in federal custody, the Bureau of Prisons said Tuesday. Andrea Circle Bear, 30, died on Tuesday, about a month after she was hospitalized while serving a 26-month sentence for maintaining a drug-involved premises.\n\nShe is the 29th federal inmate to die in the Bureau of Prisons custody since late March. As of Tuesday, more than 1,700 federal inmates have tested positive for COVID-19. About 400 of those inmates have recovered.\n\nCircle Bear was first brought to FMC Carswell, a federal prison medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas, on March 20 from a local jail in South Dakota. As a new inmate in the federal prison system, she was quarantined as part of the Bureau of Prisons' plan to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nShe was taken to a local hospital on March 28 for \"potential concerns regarding her pregnancy,\" but was discharged from the hospital the same day and brought back to the prison, officials said. Three days later, prison medical staff members decided she should be brought back to the hospital after she developed a fever, dry cough and other symptoms, according to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCircle Bear was put on a ventilator the same day she arrived at the hospital and her baby was born the next day by C-section, officials said. She tested positive for COVID-19 days later, on April 4.\n\nBOP did not disclose information about the baby's health.\n\nCircle Bear's pregnancy made her high risk for the virus, but she would not be considered priority for release under the Bureau of Prisons and Justice Department guidelines on releasing prisoners to home confinement to help stop the spread. She was already on a ventilator when an expanded home confinement memo was handed down by the Justice Department in early April.\n\nAttorney General William Barr ordered the increased use of home confinement and the expedited release of eligible inmates by the Bureau of Prisons, with priority for those at low- or medium-security prisons - starting with virus hot spots. Under the Bureau of Prisons guidelines, the agency is prioritizing the release of those who have served half of their sentence or inmates who have 18 months or less left and who served at least 25% of their time.\n\nCircle Bear, of Eagle Butte, South Dakota, had been sentenced in January after she pleaded guilty in federal court. The charges stemmed from incidents in April 2018 when she \"unlawfully and knowingly used and maintained a place for the purpose of distributing methamphetamine on the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation,\" the Justice Department said.",

The only prevention is ozone. #coronavirus #ozonetherapy.\" Another read, \"Corona Virus update: ozone eradicates lethal viruses and bacteria. #coronavirus #ozonetherapy.\"\n\nIn a recorded phone call earlier this month, Jean Allen, the owner of Purity Health, told a prospective customer that there was a COVID-19- positive patient in the facility for treatment.\n\n\"When asked how Defendants would stop the transmission of the virus given that patient's positive diagnosis, Defendants offered as the only protective measure the purported fact that ozone would sanitize everything,\" court documents say.\n\nAt the time of publication, there was no attorney of record for Purity Health and Wellness Centers or Allen.\n\n\"Victims suffer financial losses from the wire fraud scheme facilitated by Defendants, and victims further suffer harm via potential exposure to COVID-19 by unnecessarily visiting Purity Health's location for a treatment that does not work,\" the complaint says.\n\nLast week, prosecutors took similar action against a chiropractor who was advertising homeopathic remedies that would provide \"up to 90 percent protection\" against COVID-19. Ray Nannis was touting the products as an effective COVID vaccine and treatment produced by his company, Optimum Wellness Solutions.\n\n\"As I've mentioned before, we do have a homeopathy,\" Nannis told viewers in an April 1 video posted to his company's Facebook page.\n\n\"It works as, based on history of over 20 years, on dealing with viruses that are very similar,\" he said. \"It can help the body up to 90% deal with what's going on with the body. What it does is it gives the body an immunological and a neurological recognition of the energy, of the frequency of a virus, and this specific one being the coronavirus.\"\n\nIn a phone conversation with a U.S. Secret Service special agent, Nannis said that \"if someone became infected with the novel Coronavirus and/or COVID-19, the homeopathy he was offering would minimize any associated symptoms.\" He then offered to sell the product to the agent for $95 per dose and said he would ship it directly if the agent provided his credit card information, according to the complaint.\n\nWhile Nannis said he could not call his product a \"cure\" because of FDA restrictions, he said that it nonetheless \"basically\" was one \"for all intents and purposes,\" according to the U.S. attorney's office. At this time, there are no products approved by the FDA that prevent or treat COVID-19.\n\nThe court granted the temporary restraining order against Nannis and Optimum Wellness Solutions, and ordered that he \"immediately cease offering to treat, cure, prevent, or otherwise mitigate the impact of the novel Coronavirus or COVID-19, including, in particular, in connection with any 'homeopathy' or 'homeoprophylactic.'\"\n\nNannis' lawyer did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nEarlier Friday, President Trump sought to clarify the comments he made at the Coronavirus task force briefing the day before, in which he mused about the possibility of a cure. \"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute,\" the president said Thursday. \"One minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning. Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs. So it would be interesting to check that. So that, you're going to have to use medical doctors with. But it sounds -- it sounds interesting to me.\"\n\nMr. Trump told CBS News' Weijia Jiang in the Oval Office Friday that he \"was asking a question sarcastically to reporters like you, just to see what would happen.\"",

    "Fighting an unseen enemy: How the military is protecting itself from the coronavirus pandemic * EPeak World News": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Anyone joining the United States military takes an oath to defend the country against all enemies foreign and domestic. Safe to say very few of them had coronavirus in mind when they raised their right hand. By latest count, some 60,000 servicemen and women have been sent into action against this new enemy. But the military's number one mission has been to defend its own ranks against infection. It can't protect the nation if it can't defend itself. The aircraft carrier Roosevelt made headlines when the coronavirus ran roughshod through its crew. And there have been other outbreaks that required drastic measures to contain. The U.S. military was up against an enemy it could not see and did not understand.\n\nEverything in the Army starts with basic training. And every day starts before dawn. But it never looked or sounded like this before.\n\nDrill Sergeant David Castelow: Hard surfaces. Everything that your little hands touch. Everything! It's gotta get wiped down. Your beds - everything! If it's a hard surface it collects dust. You're gonna wipe it down. Do you understand?\n\nRECRUITS: Yes, Drill Sergent!\n\nIt's not dust Drill Sergeant David Castelow is worried about. It's coronavirus. And that's why he takes every recruit's temperature first thing.\n\nDrill Sergeant David Castelow: If your organization is infected by something like this, you know, these people, these initial entry trainees, are our combat power. So if they go down, or and if we can't do it safely, then we are rendering ourselves obsolete.\n\nLast month, 63 recruits in a class of 940 here at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, tested positive for the virus and upended basic training.\n\nDrill Sergeant Porter: You're going to do everything that I tell you. You do not move unless I tell you to.\n\nThat's not a recruit he's barking at. It's a four-star general, Army Chief of Staff James McConville.\n\nMcConville took on the role of a recruit to witness the revamped training first hand after the coronavirus had forced the Army to stop taking in new soldiers.\n\nGeneral James McConville: We took a two week pause.\n\nDavid Martin: So for two weeks, you're not taking in any recruits?\n\nGeneral James McConville: I'm not aware of any time - at least, in my 39 years where we stopped taking recruits in. But these are different times.\n\nTraining is still going on at Fort Jackson for recruits who arrived before the two-week pause. But now every soldier is wearing a face mask, loading up on hand sanitizer before moving into firing position and trying to stay six feet apart.\n\nWe call it \"social distancing.\" The Army calls it \"tacticial dispersion.\"\n\nLt. Col. Patrick Collins: We have been executing socially distanced enabled training since week 2.\n\nEither way, Lt. Col. Patrick Collins tells General McConville it's a problem.\n\nLt. Col. Patrick Collins: Day to day our biggest problem is keeping them in that six feet. Because, you tend to tell them, \"O.K. separate. Get your six feet.\" You know, a couple minutes later, you know, just kind of natural human behavior. They start clustering again and you, and you, you've gotta tell them again.\n\nNothing at Fort Jackson is natural anymore. The Army likes to say it has the best dressed soldiers in the world, but tailors who usually alter uniforms for a better fit are now turning out face masks.\n\nGeneral James McConville: These just got here. These are brand new.\n\nDavid Martin: Brand new?\n\nAnd the single most important equipment McConville saw on his tour was a pair of high-speed COVID-19 test machines.\n\nCol. Koenig: That'd give us the ability to test 750-plus in one day with a one-day turnaround. And then they go and we can then test that bubble also. We can continue to expand the bubbles of testing so that we can make sure we can cut it off right at the source, rather than watch it spread through a unit.\n\nThe chief of staff's job is to get the Army ready to fight. But these days, General McConville told us he spends three quarters of his time trying to fight coronavirus to keep his soldiers healthy. Just six weeks ago he was sending heavy armor to Europe for one of the largest exercises since the Cold War.\n\nGeneral James McConville: The toughest decision that- that we had to make was to cancel Defender 20.\n\nDefender 20 meant sending an entire division-sized force and its equipment to Europe, just as the virus was assaulting the continent.\n\nGeneral James McConville: We just started war-gaming what would happen if we had 15,000 or 20,000 soldiers in a very close environment and, you know, and the virus broke out? How would we take care of them? And did we want to put our soldiers at that much risk for a training exercise? And we chose not to.\n\nDavid Martin: You have to curtail training. You have to postpone major exercises. That's got to take a toll on the readiness of the Army.\n\nGeneral James McConville: From where I sit, I'm looking at the long game, and the long game is that we have to protect the force to protect the nation.\n\nDavid Martin: How big a price have you paid so far?\n\nGeneral James McConville: I don't think we've paid a huge price yet. Am I concerned long term? Absolutely.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I'll be honest. It's been a little bit intimidating thinking about it. You train in your career to fight an enemy that you can see. This is one that you can't.\n\nAir Force Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler, a fighter pilot, is about as far removed from basic training as it gets, underneath 1,500 feet of granite at this command post inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is a secure location that we intend to operate out of in wartime.\n\nDavid Martin: Well, this is wartime, isn't it?\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is, but it's really a different kind of war.\n\nCheyenne Mountain was built to withstand a nuclear blast but every time a watch team makes this half-mile walk into the mountain, they risk bringing the virus with them. Which is why each team spends 14 days in quarantine before going on duty. When their watch starts.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: The first step you do is you start wiping down every surface, your computers, your telephones, your desk surfaces, door handles, etc. to make sure that all those are clean as well. It's a bit like an obsessive compulsive disorder (laugh). But we have to be able to make sure that there's no exposure to that virus.\n\nBecause our 60 Minutes team had not been quarantined, our cameras were not allowed inside the mountain. This footage was shot by the military. The interview was conducted from the Pentagon.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: When occasionally we have to bring somebody from outside into our bubble for work on an IT system, for example, we scatter like cockroaches. It's as if this is the most dangerous thing we've ever done in our careers. It's not being shot at. It's not flying combat. It's actually having somebody from outside the bubble arrive inside of here.\n\nThis command center performs what Fesler calls a zero-fail mission: a 24/7 watch against a missile or bomber attack on the United States. Since the pandemic began, Cheyenne Mountain has scrambled jets to intercept Russian aircraft off the coast of Alaska three times.\n\nDavid Martin: You think they were testing you at all to see if anybody was home at Cheyenne Mountain.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I suspect that the way that they look at those sorties probably is related to understanding our ability to operate in a COVID environment.\n\nCheyenne Mountain was ready for the Russians but not for the coronavirus.\n\nBrig. Gen. Pete Fesler: This is something new. This is something that we had to invent on the fly as our adversary was not exactly like the one we had planned to fight.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: There are so many aspects of what's going on now that are not things that we expected that we would be doing.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, head of the U.S. Northern Command, is the man in charge of defending the homeland. He had plans for dealing with all kinds of disasters, including a pandemic, but nothing on this scale.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Often we practice what we call the complex disasters, where we might have an earthquake, maybe, that hit multiple states and we consider those to be complex. And to have a national- actual disasters declared in the 50 states and the responses happening with them, that is unprecedented.\n\nDavid Martin: So, you know the old saying about plans, no plan ever survives first contact with the enemy.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: This plan did not survive contact with the enemy.\n\nDespite all the top secret intelligence he sees, O'Shaughnessy did not have a good understanding of the virus.\n\nGen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Having an enemy that you don't fully understand is always a little bit frustrating.\n\nGen. John Hyten: We still don't fully understand the virus.\n\nGen. John Hyten is the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the number two man in the military. Twice each day he holds a video conference with the pentagon's crisis management team located two floors below in the national military command center.\n\nGen. John Hyten: We had so many assumptions of what a virus would do, what a pandemic flu would do. And then when you actually see what coronavirus does, what COVID-19 does, it's completely different.\n\nThe nastiest surprise was the aircraft carrier Roosevelt. Not only did the virus sideline one of the most important ships in the Navy but the majority of the more than 800 crew members who tested positive had no symptoms.\n\nGen. John Hyten: You think you finally start to understand it, and then you get data off the Theodore Roosevelt, of the very large number of asymptomatic cases. And then you try to understand whether the asymptomatic cases are contagious. How contagious are they? That's medical questions that we still don't fully understand the answers to.\n\nMany of the answers depended on testing and the Pentagon had to use its transport planes to airlift millions of test swabs into the United States from Europe.\n\nDavid Martin: From the outside looking in, it seemed like it was one emergency stopgap shipment of medical supplies after another. Was that what it was like on the inside looking out?\n\nGen. John Hyten: On the inside looking out I'll say it didn't look like an emergency but it was difficult. It was difficult to figure out exactly where to go. And then when we decided to move- we had to move quickly to get it in the right place. But the one thing that we do really well is we move stuff.\n\nGen. John Hyten: We looked at it as the last line of defense.\n\nDavid Martin: Where would the medical personnel to staff all those beds come from?\n\nGen. John Hyten: I have to be honest, we were worried about whether we'd run outta capacity early on when we were lookin' at those big numbers. It was not just space but, we were worried about doctors, nurses, corpsmen, respiratory therapists. We were worried about all those things.\n\nDavid Martin: If this virus had not been slowed by social distancing, would the U.S. military have had the capability and capacity to defeat that virus?\n\nGen. John Hyten: That's what we were worried about. A situation where we woulda been basically mobilizing everything we had. It would been a different world. And I can't tell you right now how we woulda closed that.\n\nIt's a question the American military rarely has to ask itself, but the definition of what it takes to be a superpower has changed forever.\n\nDavid Martin: So what will it take to get the military back to normal?\n\nGen. John Hyten: 2019 normal will never exist again. We have to figure out how to operate and fight through a world where coronavirus exists. If we just wait for what, you know, everybody hopes is gonna happen, which is the disease goes away, and it doesn't, and we haven't planned for the- for the other case, we're in a bad situation.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Two French doctors said Tuesday the coronavirus was in Europe a month earlier than originally believed. Acting on a hunch, they decided to take another look at a number of patients who were treated in intensive care for pneumonia in December and January.\n\nThey ran new tests on old swabs taken from patients in the Paris region. One of them, from a man living in a suburb of the French capital, came back positive for COVID-19. The 43-year-old man was admitted to the hospital on December 27, four weeks before the first three cases in Europe were confirmed.\n\nThe French health minister announced on January 24 what was believed to be the first three cases, all whom had been in Wuhan, China: A couple who had been vacationing in China and a man who was there on business. They had all first shown symptoms mid-January, while still in China, and tested positive for the new coronavirus upon return to France.\n\nThe man who was treated in December for pneumonia told French broadcaster BFMTV that to his knowledge, he had not been to China and was not in contact with anyone who had been there. The only explanation that he could think of was that his wife, who tested negative, works in a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle Airport, where foreign tourists often shop on arrival in France.\n\nHe told French TV that he is now showing no symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nThe World Health Organization said that it is \"not surprising\" that this case has emerged. \"It's also possible there are more early cases to be found,\" WHO spokesman Christian Lindmeier told a U.N. briefing in Geneva. He encouraged other countries to check records for cases in late 2019, saying this would give the world a \"new and clearer picture\" of the outbreak.\n\nThe two French specialists who made the discovery, Professor Yves Cohen and Dr Jean-Ralph Zahar, will publish their findings later this week in the International Journal Of Antimicrobial Agents.",

        "body": "One of the unprecedented effects of the coronavirus pandemic has been a slew of innovation, with people and companies finding inventive ways to uphold public health and safety. CBS News' Charlie D'Agata shares what some of these inventions are, ranging from nifty gadgets to elite technology.\n\n\"People touch their face 23 times per hour. It's an unconscious behavior that just happens,\" Seattle-based inventor Justin Ith said.\n\nThe bracelet can be calibrated to sense when someone is reaching for their nose, mouth or eyes to then vibrate when it feels the wearer reaching for their face. The vibration is meant to alert the person to their unconscious action, and reduce the risk of the coronavirus entering the body through vulnerable points.\n\nTouching a door handle is such a ubiquitous part of life that most could not count how many times they have done it throughout the day. However, with most surfaces now regarded as potential health hazards, door handles pose an unavoidable problem.\n\nBritish furniture designer Steve Brooks sought to fix the dilemma, with a simple device that looks like the top of a coat hanger that extends to a base designed to be gripped. The hook is then used to push, pull or turn a door handle.\n\nBrooks said his idea was to make the lives of health care workers easier.\n\n\"If they change their gloves every time they go to get a cup of coffee, that's a hell of a lot of gloves just to maneuver around the hospital,\" he said.\n\nThough smart technology is not a new concept, it is being repurposed to detect possible virus symptoms in public spaces.\n\nPolice forces in Dubai have recently deployed a thermal imaging smart helmet, designed to detect people running a high temperature -- a common symptom of COVID-19.\n\nSome places in the U.S. are using similar thermal imaging technology in stores, to detect if customers walking in are potentially running a fever.\n\nOther contraptions that are being considered are dividing screens in restaurants, plexiglass cubicles on beaches and mobile barriers for car assembly lines. Watch the video above for more information on this new age of innovation.",

    "Gene Simmons educates fans on coronavirus face masks - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Rock legend Gene Simmons will not stand for coronavirus misinformation among his fans. The KISS frontman took to Twitter this week to call out followers who said that wearing face masks will not help stop the spread of the virus.\n\nThe ongoing discussion began on Saturday, when Simmons retweeted a photo of a 15-year-old fan wearing a \"KISS Army\" bandana as a makeshift face mask. \"Abby, you rock!\" Simmons wrote.\n\nOne Twitter user responded, \"Except those cloth masks don't keep you safe only a medical mask does and a good one at that.\"\n\n\"You are incorrect and misinformed,\" Simmons replied. \"The idea of cloth masks or any other kind of mask, is not to protect you. It's to protect everybody else around you in case you cough or talk.\"\n\nIn early April, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended the voluntary use of non-medical-grade face masks for all Americans. Since then, a number of cities, states and major businesses have adopted requirements for cloth face coverings in public places, along with other social distancing measures.\n\nAfter the initial argument with Simmons, another follower chimed in, saying, \"Face covers don't prevent the spread of viruses. It's more of a psychological thing. It's social pressuring. You are disrespectful if you don't cover your face. It's nonsense.\"\n\nSimmons responded, \"I wish you good health, despite your point of view. Please wear a mask, to prevent your cough, sneeze or other, from infecting people. Be safe, not sorry.\"\n\nAnother fan, whose tweet has been deleted, appeared to argue that there is no need for healthy people to wear masks.\n\n\"You need more information,\" Simmons responded. \"You can show no symptoms and STILL have Covid 19, and STILL be spreading the virus to others. WEAR A MASK!\" His warning echoes those of public health officials, who say there's growing evidence people can spread the coronavirus even if they don't have any symptoms.\n\n\"Sorry Gene, some of us don't have the luxury of mansions, and have to go to work,\" yet another user said, appearing to anger Simmons.\n\n\"This has nothing to do with mansions. Cut it out,\" he replied. \"Just wear masks, to prevent other people from getting whatever it is you may have. And stop the blame game. This affects everyone of us.\"\n\nSimmons has since sent over two dozen tweets throughout this week attempting to educate his followers. Several of his tweets include links to information from health officials. He also related his own childhood experience with polio to today's pandemic, pleading with his followers to keep each other safe.\n\n\"It's not about you. It's about everybody else,\" he said Monday.\n\nKISS is selling official face masks depicting its four band members on its website, with 100% of the profit being donated to the Global Relief Fund for Live Music Crews.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Wall Street on Wednesday cheered another round of positive news on Gilead Sciences' experimental drug remdesivir, which the company says helped some people recover more quickly from COVID-19 than those given regular care. Shares of Gilead jumped as much as 7% as investors embraced optimism that the antiviral treatment might prove effective in fighting the global pandemic that has killed nearly 60,000 Americans.\n\nThe much-watched drug has moved markets before, and its efficacy in early trials remains a matter of debate among experts, but is of particular interest in that there are no approved treatments or vaccines for the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nGilead on Wednesday issued a news release on a study from the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases without elaborating on the findings.The NIAID is running a trial to examine whether remdesivir helped COVID-19 patients get better more quickly with it than without it. Further details could come in the weeks ahead, Gilead said in a statement.\n\nThe market last week fell after seemingly disappointing results from a trial at hospitals in Wuhan, China, were mistakenly published on a World Health Organization web page.\n\nIn addition, the U.K. medical journal the Lancet on Wednesday issued further data on the discouraging results.\n\n\"Treatment with the antiviral drug remdesivir does not speed recovery from COVID-19 compared with placebo in hospitalised patients who are critically ill,\" according to statement from the Lancet, noting that \"more evidence from ongoing clinical trials is needed to better understand whether remdesivir can provide meaningful clinical benefit.\"\n\nFirst developed to treat other novel viruses, remdesivir has not been approved for use anywhere. Delivered through an IV, remdesivir is designed to interfere with an enzyme that is believed to reproduce viral genetic material.\n\nAnother study by Gilead looked at whether a shorter, five-day course of the drug would get similar results as a 10-day treatment regimen used in multiple ongoing studies. It found 62% of patients treated early were discharged from the hospital, versus 49% of those treated later.\n\n\"These data are encouraging as they indicate that patients who received a shorter, 5-day course of remdesivir experienced similar clinical improvement as patients who received a 10-day treatment course,\" Dr. Aruna Subramanian, a clinical professor of medicine at Stanford University's School of Medicine stated.\n\nSubramanian is one of the lead investigators of the study. \"While additional data are still needed,\" the doctor stated, \"these results help to bring a clearer understanding of how treatment with remdesivir may be optimized, if proven safe and effective.\"\n\nIn animal tests against SARS and MERS, diseases caused by similar coronaviruses, the drug helped prevent infection and reduced the severity of symptoms when given early enough in the course of illness. It's farther along in testing than many other potential therapies and the current studies could lead to regulatory approval.\n\nKnown for its H.I.V.-prevention drugs, Gilead has also been the focus of accusations of price gouging. The Trump administration last year sued Gilead for earning billions from research backed by taxpayer funding without paying it back and allegedly infringing on patents owned by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.",

    "Gottlieb alarmed by \"deeply concerning\" mysterious illness among children": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Washington -- Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, called recent reports of a mysterious illness appearing in children that may be associated with the coronavirus \"deeply concerning.\"\n\n\"There appears to be some kind of post-viral syndrome associated with this virus. The WHO and the CDC have now stepped forward and said they've associated with this virus, although it's not definitive, the causal relationship,\" Gottlieb said Sunday on \"Face the Nation.\" \"It appears to be some kind of post-viral immune type phenomena. We see this in other kinds of viruses. What we don't know is the denominator.\"\n\nGottlieb said it remains unknown how many children, who were initially thought to be largely spared from coronavirus symptoms, have been infected, and warned that if as many as 20 million Americans have had the illness, many children likely have as well.\n\n\"We don't know how many kids have actually had the virus. Is it hundreds of thousands or millions of children that have had the virus and we're seeing, you know, maybe 100 or 200 of these cases?\" he said. \"Or have only thousands of kids had the virus, and we're seeing hundreds of cases? That would be deeply concerning if the incidence was that high.\"\n\nHealth care professionals in 20 states and the District of Columbia are investigating at least 200 cases of the mysterious illness, known as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, appearing in children. The cases were first detected by doctors in the United Kingdom in late April, but clusters have since been reported in the U.S. and Italy.\n\nThe Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday issued new guidance urging health care providers to report young patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome to state and local health departments.\n\nThe CDC has come under scrutiny for its handling of coronavirus testing in the early days of the outbreak, and White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said Sunday the agency \"let the country down\" regarding testing.\n\nGottlieb disagreed, though he said the CDC could be a better job at collecting and disseminating information from doctors who have treated patients with the coronavirus.\n\n\"We haven't seen a really definitive, systematic accounting of the collected clinical experience with those patients and their outcomes and what interventions were used on them,\" he said. \"This is what CDC does: puts out this information in setting a public health emergency so it can inform what we're doing.\"\n\nThere have been more than 1.4 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. and nearly 90,000 deaths, and the Trump administration has launched Operation Warp Speed, a public-private partnership designed to speed up development and deployment of a vaccine.\n\nWhile President Trump and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar have set a goal of 300 million doses of a vaccine ready by January, Gottlieb said the number of Americans who would benefit likely has to be halved, as many people may need two doses.\n\n\"Whatever supply we have is probably sufficient to actually dose and inoculate about half the number of people,\" he said. \"I think our expectation should be that we're going to have millions of doses of vaccine available in the fall to do large phase-three clinical trials, maybe low 10s of millions of doses if multiple manufacturers make it through phase one, phase two studies. And we might make them available under an emergency use authorization if we do have outbreaks or an epidemic in the fall for certain high risk groups.\"\n\nGottlieb said that because it's difficult to scale up manufacturing of a vaccine to boost volume, the timeline for inoculating the whole population will likely be longer than predicted by the Trump administration. Still, Gottlieb said he expects a vaccine will be available in the fall to \"ring fence\" a hypothetical outbreak in a large city.\n\n\"I would say that's probably more likely a 2021 event that we're going to have the vaccine available in sufficient quantities to mass inoculate the population,\" he said. \"And remember, there might be 200 million people who want this vaccine who are eligible for it. That might take 400 million doses. And so it's probably a 2021 event.\"",

        "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic is testing the U.S. military readiness to fight, forcing it to cope with a new and potent enemy. The Army was forced to suspend taking in new recruits until it overhauled basic training, major exercises were cancelled and a front-line aircraft carrier was sidelined. The Pentagon had plans for combating a pandemic, but General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, the commander of the military response to coronavirus, told 60 Minutes, \"This plan did not survive contact with the enemy.\"\n\nDavid Martin brought 60 Minutes cameras to witness the military's war on coronavirus for a story to be broadcast Sunday, April 26 at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.\n\nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Hyten is the military's number-two in command. He confers with the Pentagon's Crisis Management Team daily. \"We have to figure out how to operate and fight through a world where coronavirus exists,\" he told Martin. \"If we just wait for what, you know, everybody hopes is going to happen, which is the disease goes away, and it doesn't, and we haven't planned for the other case, we're in a bad situation.\"\n\nMartin went to basic army training at Fort Jackson in South Carolina, where last month, 64 recruits among 940 tested positive for COVID-19. He saw face-masked soldiers struggling to stay apart. \"Day to day our biggest problem is keeping them in that six feet,\" Lt. Col. Patrick Collins said. \"You tend to tell them, 'OK, separate. Get your six feet.' Couple minutes later, they start clustering again.\"\n\nFor two weeks, the Army had to stop taking in new recruits because of the virus. \"I'm not aware of any time, at least, you know, in my 39 years, where we stopped taking recruits. But these are different times,\" Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville said.\n\n\"The toughest decision that we had to make was to cancel Defender 20,\" McConville said. The Army was already sending the necessary tanks to Europe six weeks ago for Defender 20, one of the largest exercises since the Cold War. \"What would happen if we had 15,000 or 20,000 in a very close environment and... the virus broke out? How would we take care of them?\"\n\nNearly 800 sailors aboard the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt tested positive for the virus, but more than half of them had no symptoms. \"We had so many assumptions of what a virus would do,\" General Hyten told Martin, \"and then when you actually see what coronavirus does, what COVID-19 does, it's completely different.\"\n\n\"Having an enemy that you don't fully understand is always a little bit frustrating.\" General O'Shaughnessy said.",

    "How the fight against polio was won": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Sorrow, fear, hospitals overwhelmed, closures - all due to the deadly coronavirus. And all hallmarks of another deadly and mysterious virus that terrified Americans, starting at the turn of the 20th century: Polio.\n\nDuring one huge outbreak in New York City in June 1916, panicked New Yorkers fled town, rushing to piers and railroad stations. As Walter Cronkite recounted in a 1958 CBS News broadcast, that was just the beginning. After World War II, polio became an ever-greater national threat: \"The three-year statistics run 50,000 polio cases, 103,000 cases, 122,000 cases,\" Cronkite said. \"Where will it end?\"\n\nJoanne Yager was a healthy 14-year-old in Denver when she got polio in the summer of 1951. Her symptoms include a high temperature, pain and headaches. \"I could not move. I couldn't stand up or get out of my bed,\" she said.\n\nYager spent three months in the hospital, before the disease started to retreat as mysteriously as it attacked. Like COVID-19, polio had different effects on different people. It left Yager with permanent weakness in her legs; she knew a lot of children who'd died. \"That was brought home real quickly, because on the same floor that the ward was on were the iron lungs,\" she said.\n\nIron lungs were primitive respirators breathing for patients. Like COVID-19, which strikes older adults more frequently, polio had a greater impact on a vulnerable age group.\n\n\"One of the things that tugged at the heartstrings of everyone is that polio, for some reason, targeted young kids,\" said Carl Kurlander. He spent ten years researching and co-producing a documentary about polio, titled \"The Shot Felt 'Round the World.\"\n\nHe told correspondent Rita Braver that one pivotal adult was left paralyzed from the waist down: Franklin D. Roosevelt, who would later become president.\n\nRoosevelt was 39 years old when he contracted the disease. He would help launch the organization that came to be called \"The March of Dimes,\" all in an effort to curb this dreaded disease.\n\n\"With polio there really was no effective treatment, so it was really a sense of helplessness,\" Kurlander said. \"Probably like we're feeling today with coronavirus.\"\n\nThe March of Dimes helped fund a groundbreaking effort, in which Dr. Jonas Salk, the director of the Virus Research Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, and his team spent six years working on a vaccine, conducting a huge nationwide trial on 1.8 million children.\n\n\"No one knew whether it was safe, whether it would be effective,\" Kurlander said. \"But people were so both afraid and believers that they volunteered their school kids to be guinea pigs for this new vaccine.\"\n\nBut in 1955, came success!\n\nDr. Paul Duprex, who holds the Jonas Salk Chair and heads the Center for Vaccine Research at the University of Pittsburgh, said that the march of history gives today's scientists an advantage, using tools that those searching for a polio vaccine did not have. \"We can manipulate, we can alter the genetics, the composition of these viruses, in ways that Dr. Salk could only have but dreamed,\" Duprex said.\n\nSalk, of course, had competition. Dr. Albert Sabin developed an oral vaccine a few years later. Now, Dr. Duprex, who is trying to adapt the measles vaccine to combat the coronavirus, is one of scores of researchers around the world all working toward the same goal.\n\n\"Competition is something which drives innovation,\" Duprex said. \"But there's another 'C.' We need to be collaborative. And that's not just colleagues in the United States, that's colleagues all over the world.\"\n\nThe FDA just approved the drug remdesivir as an emergency treatment for COVID-19. But the greatest hope is for a vaccine. Duprex and his team are already testing theirs on mice. And elsewhere, human trials have begun - several already showing great promise.\n\nBraver asked Duprex, \"Do you feel that the public is really behind scientists in the way they were behind those looking for the polio vaccine?\"\n\n\"I do,\" he replied. \"I think it's hard in an instantaneous world that we live; everything needs to be done yesterday. It's hard to be patient. But I think strong leadership, clarity from scientists, helps the public to understand that we are doing our best to defeat this virus.\"\n\nNeither Jonas Salk nor Albert Sabin and their teams personally profited from their discoveries, as Salk explained to CBS' Edward R. Murrow on April 12, 1955, when he was asked, \"Who owns the patent on this vaccine?\"\n\n\"Well, the people, I would say,\" Salk replied. \"There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?\"\n\nSixty-five years later, with polio all but eradicated, it remains to be seen if the creators of a coronavirus vaccine will feel the same way.\n\nWhen asked what lessons she thinks we can learn from studying the polio epidemic, 83-year-old Joanne Yager, who still lives with the effects of the disease (and who runs a support group for polio survivors in Tucson, Arizona, called Polio Epic Tucson), replied, \"That we can be survivors of some of these illnesses and we can come out as better people.\"\n\nHistorian Carl Kurlander: \"We've gotta have belief in the scientific community. Joni Mitchell and Neil Young had polio. Francis Ford Coppola, Itzhak Perlman, and ordinary people, once they came through this disease, they were able to really become the best they could be.\n\n\"And I think that we're at our best when we work as a country, and as a world, to defeat the unseen enemy.\"\n\nFor more info:",

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell will be announcing draft picks from a TV studio set up in the basement of his home outside New York City instead of from a stage in Las Vegas.\n\nLSU quarterback Joe Burrow, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, is widely expected to be the first name Goodell calls when the Cincinnati Bengals make the top overall selection in the draft.

    "ICE declines to release asylum-seekers amid pandemic - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "At least 28 of Marco's fellow immigrant detainees at a privately operated prison in the outskirts of Monroe, Louisiana, have tested positive for coronavirus. The 30-year-old Cuban asylum-seeker believes he could be next, unless he's released.\n\n\"There's fear among all of us,\" Marco told CBS News in Spanish over the phone, referring to other immigrants who are being detained while judges adjudicate their asylum cases. \"We are not criminals. We're simply scared. We came here because we have a very real fear of returning to our home countries.\"\n\nMarco, who asked for his name to be changed, is one of more than 5,500 immigrants in U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE) custody who have demonstrated to an asylum officer a credible fear of being persecuted or tortured in their home countries. Under a binding 2009 internal directive, ICE is generally supposed to parole immigrants like Marco who asked for asylum at an official border crossing, passed their credible-fear screenings and do not pose a public safety threat.\n\nBut under President Trump, parole approvals have plummeted, prompting one federal judge to rule last year that ICE officials in the Deep South could not deny parole to asylum-seekers without considering each case individually.\n\nEven as coronavirus cases inside the nation's immigration jails continue to grow, ICE is not planning to proactively free asylum-seekers like Marco or additional groups of immigrants from U.S. custody, according to congressional aides briefed by the agency. Marco has been denied parole three times in the past two months, most recently on Tuesday, according to documents and his attorney, Lorena P\u00e9rez McGill.\n\nAt least 287 immigrants detained by ICE have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to agency's latest tally, prompting renewed calls from advocates for the government to oversee a large-scale release of people from immigration detention, which is a civil, not criminal, matter. Monday's spike of 96 cases was followed by 33 new confirmed cases of infected detainees on Tuesday and 34 on Wednesday.\n\nAs of Tuesday, ICE had conducted 425 coronavirus tests among the tens of thousands of immigrants in its custody, agency officials told CBS News.\n\nDetainees have grown increasingly frustrated in recent weeks. In March and April, there were at least 5 incidents in Texas, Georgia, Arizona and Louisiana in which detention center staff used pepper spray on protesting immigrants, according to ICE officials, who said the \"calculated use of force\" mitigates risks of injury for both staff and detainees.\n\nIn a briefing last Friday, acting ICE Director Matthew Albence repeatedly told lawmakers on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform that a review of potentially vulnerable detainees had ended and there are no plans to expand the categories of immigrants who could be freed beyond older immigrants, pregnant women and those with certain medical conditions. Several Democratic congressional aides who were on the call described Albence's comments to CBS News.\n\nEarlier in the month, ICE announced it would consider releasing detainees who were over the age of 60 or pregnant. The agency later instructed officials to also identify detainees with certain underlying medical conditions, like lung disease and severe asthma, for potential release, according to a directive to detention centers. The agency made nearly 700 releases under these guidelines, according to ICE and congressional officials.\n\nAccording to P\u00e9rez McGill and a Cuban medical certificate, Marco suffers from \"bronchial asthma.\" His wife is also in the U.S., which P\u00e9rez McGill said shows he has the community ties required for being paroled.\n\nBut in its last parole denial, ICE said Marco could be a flight risk because he has not demonstrated \"substantial ties to the community.\" In a recent email reviewed by CBS News, an ICE official also said the agency is not releasing \"cases that have appeals pending\" or \"detainees for COVID-19 without significant medical documentation.\" Marco is appealing an asylum denial by an immigration judge, according to P\u00e9rez McGill.\n\nICE's detention population has dropped recently, reaching less 32,000 last week, according to a recent court filing. During the briefing on Friday, Albence said detention space is \"under capacity\" and that the detainee population had plummeted by 65% since March 20, the staffers on the call said. But Albence said the dramatic drop stems from the fact his agency is receiving fewer migrants from border officials and apprehending fewer immigrants in the interior of the country, the aides added.\n\nUnder a temporary public health order that was extended on Monday, border officials have been expelling thousands of unauthorized migrants and asylum-seekers, including unaccompanied children, instead of processing and detaining them under U.S. immigration law. No migrants in Customs and Border Protection custody have tested positive for the coronavirus, a senior agency official told CBS News Wednesday.\n\nICE has also scaled back its immigration enforcement in the interior of the country in response to the pandemic. Albence said Friday his agents are now focusing on arresting \"violent and aggravated felons who pose an immediate public safety risk,\" congressional aides said.\n\nAccording to the aides, lawmakers asked Albence if the agency would consider releasing other immigrants, including the thousands of asylum-seekers who have passed their credible fear screenings. Albence made it clear that no further releases were planned and grouped asylum-seekers with immigrants the agency says it is required to detain under law because of criminal convictions, the congressional aides said.\n\nICE did not respond to multiple requests to provide more details about the agency's current release policy. An ICE spokesperson said one of the agency's main priorities is the well-being of detainees.\n\n\"We have been taking important steps to safeguard all detainees, staff and contractors, including: reducing the number of detainees in custody by placing individuals on alternatives to detention programs, suspending social visitation, incorporating social distancing practices with staggered meals and recreation times,\" the spokesperson said, adding that new detainees are being isolated for 14 days.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge in California ordered ICE to rapidly review the cases of all detainees at increased risk of severe illness or death if they contract the coronavirus and determine whether they should be released. The order expanded the categories of immigrants ICE has already evaluated for release by lowering the age of vulnerable detainees to 55 and defining all the medical conditions that could pose a risk of severe complications.\n\nIt's unclear how many immigrants could be released under this order. An ICE spokeswoman said the agency, as matter of policy, does not comment on litigation. \"However, lack of comment should not be construed as agreement with or stipulation to any of the allegations,\" the spokeswoman added.\n\nDuring last week's briefing, Albence was asked about the relatively low number of tests, according to congressional aides. Albence suggested the agency would be doing more if it had more test kits, the aides said. Advocates have criticized ICE for not testing more detainees, saying the agency would be reporting more positive cases if it was screening more people.\n\nMembers of Congress also pressed Albence last week on the number of migrants who have tested positive for coronavirus after being deported by his agency, according to congressional aides. Albence cast doubt on the reports of large numbers of deportees testing positive in Guatemala, the aides added.\n\nAt least 51 migrants recently deported by the U.S. to Guatemala have tested positive for coronavirus, according to Guatemalan public health ministry officials. Cases among deportees have also been reported in Mexico and Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas. In response to the large number of infections among deportees, which make up more than 16% of the country's total cases, Guatemala has indefinitely suspended deportation flights last week.\n\nAlbence confirmed to members of Congress that his agency is not routinely testing migrants for coronavirus before deporting them, congressional officials said. ICE has said it conducts temperature checks on would-be deportees, not allowing immigrants with a temperature of 99 degrees or higher to board flights and referring them to further medical evaluation, as fever is one of the main symptoms of COVID-19. Before that policy was implemented last week, the temperature threshold was 100.4 degrees. The administration has also tasked a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention team to \"review\" the tests Guatemalan officials are conducting on deportees.\n\nLast week, ICE stopped detaining immigrants at the deportation staging facility in Alexandria, Louisiana, to \"stem potential spread of COVID-19,\" an agency spokesperson said. At least 14 of the 32 direct ICE detention center employees who have tested positive for coronavirus work at the deportation hub in Alexandria. The agency has not been reporting cases among private contractors, who oversee most detention facilities.\n\nThe ICE spokesperson said the agency has been transporting immigrants to the airport in Alexandria and deporting them without holding them at the detention facility there.",

    "ICE detainees clash with Massachusetts jail officials over coronavirus - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A group of immigrants in U.S. government custody clashed with officials at a Massachusetts detention facility late Friday, according to advocates and local authorities, who reported the latest episode of growing dissent and frustration among detainees amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe disturbance at the Bristol County House of Corrections in the town of Dartmouth is at least the ninth instance since President Trump declared a national emergency over the coronavirus in which staff at detention facilities have used pepper spray on protesting U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees, according to statements from the agency to CBS News. It is also at least the tenth incident since then in which detention center personnel have responded to disturbances by immigrants.\n\nThe descriptions by the local sheriff and ICE of what unfolded on Friday were significantly different from those of advocates and family members of detainees. However, all accounts depicted a major escalation.\n\nAccording to the Bristol County Sheriff's Office, Friday's incident started after \"about 10 detainees\" at one of the facilities in the complex reported having symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\n\"The detainees refused to get tested for COVID-19, then when notified they were required to be tested because of reporting symptoms, rushed violently at Sheriff Thomas M. Hodgson and corrections officers, barricaded themselves inside the facility, ripped washing machines and pipes off the wall, broke windows and trashed the entire unit,\" the office said in a statement.\n\nThe sheriff's office claimed that corrections officers, a K9 dog unit and a \"special response team\" were \"attacked\" by immigrant detainees upon entering a detention facility housing area. The immigrants were later restrained, the office added.\n\nThree immigrants were transported to a hospital; \"one for a pre-existing medical condition and another for a medical incident after being removed from the ICE wing. All three are expected to be fine,\" according to the sheriff's office.\n\nSheriff Hodgson, an ardent supporter of Mr. Trump and controversial figure in Massachusetts politics, said the disturbance was sparked after detainees refused to allow a medical team to conduct coronavirus tests. \"Our medical team alerted me, and I advised the detainees that for their health and the health of their fellow detainees and our staff, they needed to be tested at the medical unit. The detainees refused to comply, became combatant and ultimately put the lives of themselves and many Bristol County officers at risk with their reckless actions,\" Hodgson said in a statement.\n\nThe sheriff's office, which confirmed to CBS News that pepper spray was used on Friday, said the disturbance caused $25,000 worth of damage. \"Detainees have been moved to single cells in the special housing unit pending disciplinary action, COVID-19 testing and criminal charges,\" the office added in its statement.\n\nOn Saturday, ICE officials echoed the description offered by the Bristol County sheriff, saying detainees who were \"refusing mandatory testing\" caused \"severe damage to jail property, breaking windows, washing machines and causing other property damage.\" The officials also said 25 immigrants in their custody came in contact with pepper spray during the altercation, and were evaluated by medical staff.\n\nLocal advocates, immigration lawyers and family members of detainees disputed this version of events.\n\nThe sister of a detainee inside the detention center said in a legal declaration prepared by an attorney that her brother called her at around 6:16 p.m. on Friday to tell her that guards had pepper sprayed immigrants who refused to sign papers which said \"everything is okay with the conditions\" at the facility.\n\n\"Officials started grabbing us and pushing us with force and then they started throwing pepper spray. The people on the inside could not breathe and many of us fainted. Our skin started to swell up as if we had an allergy,\" the detainee told his sister, according to the declaration. \"Officials started breaking glass, so they could blame us for causing a disturbance. There were more people outside with dogs.\"\n\nThe detainee later told his sister to \"help them\" and that he had to hang up, according to the declaration. Benjamin Haldeman, the attorney who prepared the declaration, told CBS News the sister and her family requested anonymity.\n\nDuring a phone call Saturday, the sister pleaded for help; her voice breaking at times. \"We are people who come from the countryside, looking for a future for our families, we did not come to harm anyone. We live from our work,\" she told CBS News in Spanish. \"We ask for help, to help us with our relatives who are there inside, who are being mistreated.\"\n\nSasha Wright, a resident of New Haven, Connecticut, said her fianc\u00e9, Conroy Lewis, a Jamaican immigrant held by ICE at the Bristol County House of Corrections, called her at around 5:45 p.m. on Friday to tell her that guards wanted to move him and other detainees to another facility for coronavirus testing.\n\nAt around 6:35 p.m., Wright said Lewis called again and told her an altercation had broken out. During a brief phone call, Lewis said windows were broken and pepper stray was used, according to Wright. \"He was scared and did not know what to do.\"\n\nWright has not spoken to her fianc\u00e9 since Friday evening. \"I don't know what they're doing to them -- and I'm worried right now,\" she told CBS News on Saturday.\n\nThe wife of another detainee at the facility, an immigrant from West Africa, described a similar incident. She requested anonymity to speak freely. According to the woman, her husband told her on Friday evening that the incident started after detainees were told they would be moved to another facility to be tested for coronavirus.\n\nShe said her husband and other immigrants were scared of being moved to an area where detainees may have been exposed to the virus. \"It's not that he was refusing to be tested. It was just a matter of making sure that it was safe to move,\" the woman told CBS News.\n\n\"He told me he was pepper sprayed and that they had all these people there with dogs,\" she added.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the American Civil Liberties Union branch in Massachusetts called for an independent investigation of Friday's incident. \"The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has an obligation to ensure basic human rights of people it holds in detention,\" Carol Rose, the group's executive director, said in a statement. \"During this time of pandemic infection, the state should allow people to safely self-isolate by releasing them or arranging for home confinement.\"\n\nThe Boston-based group, Lawyers for Civil Rights, filed a lawsuit in late March against the Bristol County sheriff and ICE, demanding the release of detainees during the pandemic. So far, it has secured the release of 48 immigrants from the Bristol County House of Corrections, the group said Saturday.\n\nAt least 522 detainees in more than two dozen ICE detention centers across the country have tested positive for the highly contagious coronavirus, according to the agency's latest tally. They make up more than 48% of the 1,073 immigrants in ICE custody who have received testing.\n\nCoronavirus infections inside ICE's sprawling system of private prisons and county jails have increased dramatically in the past two weeks, with the agency reporting 398 new cases since April 17. At least seven detention centers now have more than 20 cases each.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Tokyo -- Japan's prime minister on Monday extended a state of emergency over the coronavirus until the end of May, as the government warned it was too soon to lift restrictions.\n\n\"I will extend the period of the state of emergency I declared on April 7 until May 31. The area covered is all prefectures in the nation,\" Shinzo Abe said after a meeting to discuss the measures.\n\nAbe declared a month-long state of emergency that initially covered Tokyo and six other regions on April 7, later expanding it to cover the entire country.\n\nIt had been due to expire on Wednesday, but the country's minister for the virus response Yasutoshi Nishimura said earlier that new infections were still growing.\n\n\"The number of new cases has declined, but unfortunately the decrease has not reached the targeted level,\" he said during a meeting with an expert panel advising the government on the pandemic.\n\n\"As the healthcare sector remains under pressure, we need continued cooperation from people.\"\n\nJapan's virus outbreak remains comparatively small compared to those seen in parts of Europe and the United States, with over 15,000 infections recorded and 510 deaths.\n\nBut the extension was backed by both experts advising the government and regional governors, with concerns that a sudden spike in cases that would overwhelm healthcare systems remains possible.\n\nThe state of emergency falls far short of the harshest measures seen in parts of Europe and the United States. It allows local governors to urge people to stay at home and call on businesses to stay shut.\n\nBut officials cannot compel citizens to comply, and there are no punishments for those who fail to do so.\n\nThe government is expected to urge residents in 13 high-risk prefectures, including Japan's biggest cities, to continue cutting person-to-person contact by 80 percent and exercise other strict social distancing measures.\n\nBut museums, libraries and some other facilities are likely to be allowed to reopen so long as they take anti-virus measures.\n\nFor the rest of Japan, prefectures will be allowed to loosen restrictions on business closures and small gatherings but residents will still be asked not to travel outside their home regions. Bars and nightclubs will be asked to remain shut.\n\nIt remains unclear when and whether schools, many of which have been closed since March, will be able to reopen, with officials recently suggesting a possible phased reopening with certain key grades resuming before others.\n\nAbe said experts would review the situation around May 14, and the measures could be lifted at that time depending on the situation in a given region.\n\nDespite so far avoiding the devastating tolls seen in places like Italy and New York, there have been persistent fears that Japan's healthcare system could be quickly overwhelmed by a sudden spike in infections.\n\nThere are just five ICU beds per 100,000 people in Japan, less than half the number in Italy, and doctors' associations have warned that hospitals are already stretched thin.\n\nMeasures have been implemented to try to ease the pressure, including sending coronavirus patients with mild symptoms to hotels for quarantine rather than keeping them in overcrowded hospitals.\n\nThe government has also said it is increasing testing capacity but continues to face criticism for the relatively low numbers of tests being carried out, in part because of stringent criteria.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Kroger has had a change of heart over what it recently deemed \"overpayments\" to quarantined workers on COVID-19 emergency leave. The nation's biggest supermarket chain is reversing its previous demand that the employees repay the extra money or face the wrath of bill collectors.\n\nThe snafu is the latest public relations hit for a company already under fire for yanking its so-called \"hero bonus\" of two bucks more an hour for its more than 500,000 employees working on the front lines of the pandemic. Some Kroger employees are also distressed that the retailer isn't doing all they say it can to protect them, including requiring that all customers wear face masks in all Kroger-owned stores no matter what local health regulations do or don't require.\n\nThe company isn't disclosing how many workers received the dditional pay, saying only that it involved associates paid to remain at home after reporting coronavirus symptoms, testing positive for COVID-19 or who were otherwise quarantined.\n\n\"This was an unfortunate payroll accounting error. We've since instructed our payroll department to directly inform the small number of associates affected by the recent overpayments of COVID-19 Emergency Leave pay that we will not seek repayment,\" a spokesperson for Kroger said in an email to CBS MoneyWatch.\n\nThe reversal came following unwanted attention on social media after photos of company letters sent to the workers involved were posted on social media, with the missives stating in bold that \"Failure to repay the overpayment could result in further collection efforts.\"\n\nOf the 3 million grocery workers nationwide, nearly 10,000 have become sick or tested positive for the virus, and at least 65 have died from the coronavirus disease, according to the United Food and Commercial Workers.\n\nKroger recently added more than 100,000 employees to its workforce of more than 460,000 amid a nationwide crush of supermarket shopping. The company operates more than 2,700 stores under a number of retail banners in 35 states.",

    "Leaving Rikers Island and coming home to a pandemic - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Reynaldo Lopez was released from New York City's Rikers Island jail last month after spending two months behind bars on a parole violation. The 50-year-old was greeted with a home-cooked meal -- fried chicken, macaroni and cheese, green beans and cornbread -- but he couldn't hug his wife, Millicent, when she welcomed him back to their home in the Bronx, out of fear that he could expose her to the coronavirus.\n\n\"I didn't want to spread the virus to my family,\" Lopez told CBS News.\n\nJails and prisons, where social distancing is nearly impossible, have emerged as potent breeding grounds for the new coronavirus. More than 1,300 people in the New York City jail system have tested positive for the virus, according to the city's Department of Corrections. Three inmates have died, along with 10 staffers. Raymond Rivera, one of the inmates who died, was also being held on a parole violation at Rikers, by far the city's largest jail complex.\n\nAs the pandemic began to ravage New York last month, the city started releasing inmates who were held on technical parole violations or awaiting trial on minor crimes from Rikers and other facilities. More than 2,200 people have been set free across the city since March 16, according to the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice. But former inmates, health care workers and advocates say the release process is overwhelmed, offering little guidance for some inmates who are suddenly thrust back into society, many of whom may have been exposed to the virus themselves.\n\nLopez, a former social worker who was on parole for a 2004 conviction for armed burglary, is one of 210 people who were released with the help of the Legal Aid Society, which provides legal representation for those who can't afford it. After he was released on March 31, he spent the next 14 days self-isolating away from his family, huddled in a bedroom with his essentials: books, weights, and his cellphone, with no clear cut plan for his future.\n\n\"The whole world is out of work, but I'm happy to be home, I'm grateful,\" Lopez said.\n\nAt Rikers, Lopez was housed in a dorm with other men his age who were also there for parole violations. He said they all developed a bad cough along with shortness of breath. Lopez was frustrated at the release process, calling it \"total chaos.\" He said his final medical screening was rushed and he didn't have a re-entry plan for his life post-incarceration. \"I was never given no type of release plan or an opportunity to see a psychiatrist if I needed it because of what was going on inside. There was no follow-up plan.\"\n\nAnother man who was recently released from Rikers earlier this month also claimed his final screening was rushed, saying he never had his temperature taken and was not given a face mask or gloves before his release.\n\nTwo employees with Correctional Health Services (CHS), the city agency that oversees inmate care, confirmed that many inmates at Rikers can't get the help they need due to the sheer volume of people being released. The employees, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said many health care workers have called out sick or now work remotely, adding further strain to an already stressed system.\n\n\"You have a mass amount of guys getting released when no one is there. So, there's no way for us to plan for them getting out, and there's also no way for us to ensure that their service is in place,\" one CHS employee said.\n\nThe city has prioritized releasing inmates who were being held for violating parole, serving a jail sentence of less than one year or awaiting trial on current charges. Most inmates technically remain in the custody of the city Department of Corrections but are allowed to serve the remainder of their sentence at home.\n\nA CHS spokesperson said people entering and leaving the jail undergo medical and mental health screenings. Prior to an inmate's release, health care workers screen and identify anyone who may have COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and advise them to self-isolate. Anyone who needs to self-isolate but requires special accommodations are referred to hotels and other supportive services, the CHS spokesperson said.\n\nShelters are also overwhelmed, the employees said, and some inmates will ultimately end up on the streets. \"We're releasing them to shelters or programs with no resources,\" a CHS employee said. \"We're not helping them in that way at all right now, so that's just upsetting.\"\n\n\"Sometimes it feels like sending people to their deaths,\" one of the CHS employees said.\n\nThe pandemic has forced the caseworkers tasked with implementing re-entry programs to the sidelines. These programs are meant to help inmates transition back into the community by lining up housing, health care, job training and more. Caseworkers typically work with inmates to develop a personalized plan inside the jail prior to release.\n\nBut many caseworkers have been working from home, making it difficult if not impossible for some patients to get support before they are released. Non-profit organizations that can provide support have set up hotlines, distributing numbers throughout jails, but have found that identifying clients from the outside can be hit-or-miss.\n\n\"That lack of easy communication and connection makes discharge planning, in a systematic and comprehensive way, very challenging,\" said Susan Gottesfeld, executive vice president and chief program officer at the Osborne Association, a re-entry organization that now provides all of its services virtually, including case management, job training, substance abuse treatment and health care.\n\nGottesfeld said those services are still available once someone gets out, but \"it's better when we work with them pre-release so we can make sure there's a plan for them. There are a lot of pieces that need to be coordinated when people are leaving.\"\n\n\"[The pandemic] really shines a light on our willingness to lock up more people than we really need to be and it's testing the way our criminal and legal system makes decisions about who is taken into custody and who can be released in less restrictive supervision in the community.\"\n\nFor those who show symptoms after they're released, Gottesfeld said they may be moved to a hotel for symptomatic people if necessary, where they'll receive medical care.\n\nNew York City operates 11 jails, eight of which are on Rikers Island. It's unclear how many confirmed virus cases are within the complex, but as of Tuesday, there were 1,384 people sickened by the virus in city-run jails, including 1,005 Department of Corrections staffers and 379 inmates. \"People are very aggravated. We're scared of dying here,\" one Rikers inmate said.\n\nThis 2014 photo shows the Rikers Island jail complex in New York City. Seth Wenig / AP\n\nThe man who was released from Rikers earlier this month said it was a relief to be back home with his family members, who are over 60 years old. \"I didn't want them to go out getting groceries, so now I can go and do those things, looking out for them and making sure the house is clean,\" he said. \"This is no joke. My dad just lost his uncle, he was 83. My brother got it. He's feeling better and better. But there's people close to me who are getting it. We're just trying to stay clean and safe here by not going out much and just riding it out like everybody else is.\"\n\nLopez, two inmates currently inside and another person who was recently released, said tensions at Rikers are at an all-time high. Several said blaring alarms that signal fights could be heard at nearly all hours of the day and night. They all independently claimed it was difficult to get medical attention unless you had a fever and displayed several symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\"There was a sense of dread -- that everyone was going to die,\" Lopez said.\n\nA current inmate blamed the fights on the lack of recreation since most dormitories are under quarantine. Several said they watched officers sweep up sick inmates in the middle of the night and discard all of their belongings.\n\n\"I sit in my cell, I write music, I do sudoku puzzles. I study my case. But when I come out and observe, it's a lot, seeing it on people's faces -- the energy,\" said the inmate. \"People knowing their lives are in jeopardy, knowing that somebody just died.\"\n\nBack home, Lopez said his wife began giving him turmeric, red onions, ginger and sea moss twice a day, which he attributes to helping clear up congestion in his lungs. Last week, he left his home for the first time to buy groceries, what he considered a small, but significant milestone. He said without the support of his wife, who maintained contact with his lawyer and produced reference letters for the judge, his release would have been \"impossible.\"\n\nAt his former job, Lopez helped former inmates adjust to life after prison. He said he is enjoying time with his family and hopes to go back to school to earn a master's degree in social work. \"People need help. A lot of people who have been to prison made bad choices, and some people got hurt, but thankfully, these people are gonna come back to the community -- whether we like it or not.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A Michigan inmate who was set to be paroled just weeks from now after serving nearly 44 years behind bars died last week from COVID-19, prison officials said. William Garrison had a chance to be released earlier this year, but decided to complete his full sentence so he'd be free from supervision after his release.\n\nGarrison was 60, and had been in prison since he was 16, according to the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office. He was serving time for first-degree murder during an armed robbery in 1976.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Corrections had already offered to parole Garrison this year, but he \"refused to leave prison,\" department spokesman Chris Gautz said.\n\n\"He did not want to be on parole, he wanted to wait and just walk out completely free from supervision in September,\" Gautz said.\n\nThe department offered him parole once again three weeks ago, since his age made him more vulnerable to coronavirus, and Garrison agreed, Gautz said.\n\nThe department asked for prosecutors to waive the mandatory 28-day waiting period for his release. But Garrison died just five days later, on April 13, before the prosecutor's office responded.\n\nGautz said that Garrison hadn't complained about being ill until shortly before his death, and had not reported any symptoms of COVID-19. A test after his death confirmed that he had the virus.\n\n\"We did everything we could get him out,\" Gautz said.\n\nGarrison's sister, Yolanda Peterson, told the Detroit Free Press she thinks prison staff could have done more to help her brother, and that men in the prison said Garrison's cellmate had been ill for several days before Garrison's death. The Department of Corrections said it checked on inmates cell-by-cell, and that Garrison's cellmate later tested negative for the virus.\n\nAt least 17 inmates in Michigan have died from COVID-19, and more than 520 have tested positive for it, the Detroit Free Press reported. Nationwide, the U.S. has more people behind bars, per capita, than any other nation, and crowded prison facilities are especially conducive to the spread of coronavirus to inmates and staff.\n\nMichigan has confirmed 31,242 cases overall and 2,391 deaths as of Monday morning, according to Johns Hopkins University. Michigan has the nation's third-highest death count from the virus, behind New York and New Jersey.",

    "Michigan struggles despite recent doubling of tests: \"The saddest reality of a country that was under-prepared\"": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "\"CBS This Morning's\" multi-part series, \"State of Testing,\" looks at the state of resources and accessibility to coronavirus testing. In addition, the series will report on how states are responding to testing needs, whether they are developing testing plans, and what testing benchmarks they are looking for as these states make the decision to re-open.\n\nDeborah Gatewood died from COVID-19 after being denied a virus test multiple times at the very hospital where she worked, according to her daughter, Kalia Corrothers. In an interview with CBS News, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer called Gatewood's death \"the saddest reality of a country that was under-prepared for a global pandemic.\"\n\n\"The fact that we've never had enough tests, that the federal government didn't prepare, contributes to the fact that we had to ration tests at the front end of this pandemic,\" Whitmer said. \"And it just breaks my heart.\"\n\nWhitmer has since expanded testing criteria to include those with milder symptoms and all essential workers. The expansion came too late for Gatewood, who was 63 years old.\n\n\"It's just like having your heart ripped from your body,\" Michigan resident Kaila Corrothers told CBS News' Adriana Diaz.\n\nCorrothers' mother worked at a Beaumont hospital, drawing blood for over 30 years.\n\nWhen Gatewood came down with a fever, Corrothers said she tried to get tested at the same hospital but was denied \"four times.\"\n\n\"She got sent home each time,\" she said. \"She lost faith in the whole healthcare system... no one's going to take me. No one's going to test me.\"\n\nBeaumont Health told CBS News in a statement, \"As patients come to Beaumont for care during this pandemic, we are doing everything we can to evaluate, triage and care for patients based on the information we know at the time. We grieve the loss of any patient to COVID-19 or any other illness.\"\n\nThough the state's testing has doubled in recent weeks, shortages of swabs and chemical solution are still impeding testing growth.\n\nWhitmer's goal is to test at least 14,000 people per day. At the time of reporting, they are testing roughly half that amount.\n\nThe Detroit area has been hardest hit, with over 70% of the state's cases and where people of color have been disproportionately affected.\n\nTo try and reach most city residents, walk-up testing has been set up for low-income Detroit residents without cars.\n\nThere are fewer cases on the western side of the state, but there are still spikes in places like Kent County, which includes Grand Rapids.\n\nAt a testing site at Mercy Health in Grand Rapids, one resident said it was significantly easier getting a test \"nowadays\" compared to \"just two, three weeks ago.\"\n\nCherry Health, which runs a nearby site, has seen a 25% increase in testing because of Governor Whitmer's expanded criteria, and more state funding.\n\nCherry Health CEO Tasha Blackmon said her health center has enough testing kids, but other critical shortages persist.\n\n\"We're really short on gowns. We're also short on N95 masks,\" Blackmon said. \"We cannot expand further without any additional personal protective equipment.\"\n\nTo keep up testing, she said her employees have had to rewear gowns multiple times, unless they get soiled.\n\nWhile trying to navigate the health crisis, Cherry Health is also grappling with the financial crisis. They had to lay off 25% of their staff due to the economic shutdown and cancellations of elective procedures.\n\nIt is one of the effects of the state's strict stay-at-home policy. Through executive orders, Governor Whitmer has shuttered most businesses and confined residents largely to their homes. According to the governor, CDC guidelines say they should be testing between 1 to 2% of Michigan's population \"in order to have some confidence to reopen.\"\n\n\"It's going to be a little while before we get there,\" she said.\n\nSome residents disagree, including protesters who gathered at the state capitol on Thursday, some with guns, demanding an end to emergency restrictions.\n\nSheriff Ted Schendel of rural Benzie County thinks the governor's orders go too far. His county has had a handful of cases and no deaths from the virus, and residents are \"desperate\" to get back to work.\n\nSchendel argued that a \"one-size-fits-all kind of approach\" is not working. \"People are just saying, 'hey, look, enough's enough. Let's give us a chance to get out, go back to work, put food on the table for our families.' And we'll follow the CDC guidelines.\"\n\nHe said Whitmer should have more faith in Michigan residents.\n\nBut the governor says testing data, above all else, will help drive her decisions to ease restrictions. She's also considering further opening the economy region by region if the data shows it's safe.\n\n\"Some people would think we should move faster,\" she said. \"I'm going to listen to the public health experts. And I'm going to work with the business side of the equation to make sure that we've got the protocols to keep people safe when it is safe to start to reengage.\"",

    "Mom gives birth in parking lot, dad uses face mask to cut cord - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A Kentucky woman, with the help of her husband, gave birth over Mother's Day weekend in a hospital parking lot just steps away from the entrance. It was the middle of the night, the hospital doors were locked and the couple had to use a handmade face mask to tie off the umbilical cord.\n\nSarah Rose Patrick told her doctor on May 8, one week before her due date, that she was experiencing pressure, but not quite contractions. The doctor told her to go home, but said to return to the labor and delivery ward if the pressure became unbearable.\n\nLast Saturday, at 1 a.m., Sarah Rose woke up with painful contractions, so she and her husband, David Patrick, called David's parents to watch their toddlers. The couple rushed over to Baptist Health Hospital in Louisville, Kentucky, and entered the first set of automatic doors leading to the labor and delivery ward, only to be locked out of the second.\n\n\"We could not believe it,\" David told CBS News, noting a lack of security in the area. After checking two other nearby doors, both of which were also locked, the couple tried to head back to their car so they could drive to the emergency room.\n\nSarah Rose Patrick, 36, and David Patrick, 29, with their newborn son, Navi Bond. Patrick family\n\nAs they attempted to get to the car, their new son decided he couldn't wait any longer. The contractions came \"more frequently and ferociously\" as they walked, and before reaching the car, Sarah Rose's water broke.\n\nShe quickly said a prayer, \"Give me strength, God. Give me focus,\" before nearly collapsing. While on the phone with a 911 dispatcher, David thought the hospital doors would open, but, \"once my wife's groans crescendoed into blood-curdling screams, followed by, 'He's coming! I can feel his head!'\" he knew he would have to deliver their son.\n\nWith the dispatcher guiding him through the process, David helped Sarah Rose deliver their third child, Navi Bond Patrick, in the \"cold, empty parking lot\" outside the hospital. He said he was extremely concerned for his wife's health, unsure of what her symptoms meant.\n\n\"I saw a serpentine trail of blood and water move from my wife's pants, down the incline, and into the nearby storm drain. I'm not a doctor. I didn't know if she was hemorrhaging or if these were 'good' screams or 'bad' screams,\" he explained.\n\nDavid said that once he saw his newborn's head, he was no longer terrified, but instead felt \"gleeful joy and curiosity.\" He delivered their son just seconds later, and the couple tried to keep him warm as they waited.\n\nThey also needed to tie off the baby's umbilical cord, but they were both wearing boots that had no shoelaces or ribbons. So, David improvised, using a hand-sewn cotton face mask made by his grandmother that Sarah Rose had been wearing due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I rolled it up tightly like a tortilla and tied a knot around our son's umbilical cord. The dispatcher congratulated us,\" he said.\n\nAmbulances arrived just a few minutes later and finally helped the couple into the building. They were discharged on Monday, Sarah Rose's 36th birthday.\n\nAfter giving birth, Sarah Rose took off her face mask so David could use it to cut their son's umbilical cord. Patrick family\n\nSarah Rose said they named their newborn after James Bond. \"He sure lived up to his name with his grand entrance into the world -- he does all his own stunts clearly!\" she said.\n\n\"We are extremely grateful,\" David said. \"Everyone is happy and healthy. We consider this the mother of all blessings in our life.\"\n\nIt wasn't at all how the couple thought the delivery would go.\n\n\"We had our hospital bags packed and organized a week or so in advance,\" David said. \"Everything was ready. Totally prepared. And we had a great experience at Baptist Health Women First hospital with the first two deliveries. So we assumed nothing different with this third rodeo.\"\n\nSecurity at the hospital told David that the labor and delivery ward -- not just the ER -- will be open 24 hours a day from now on to prevent other couples from experiencing a similar situation.\n\n\"Patients who come to Baptist Health Louisville, who are pregnant and in labor, can always enter the hospital in the middle of the night through the Emergency Room or enter through the entrance to the Labor and Delivery department,\" the hospital told CBS News on Saturday. \"Both entrances have signage and both entrances are open 24 hours a day and 7 days a week. Other entrances to the hospital are closed after 7 p.m. until 5 a.m.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "More children hospitalized in New York City with rare condition that may be linked to COVID-19\n\nOfficials said on Wednesday that the number of children who have been hospitalized in New York City with symptoms consistent with a rare disease possibly linked to the coronavirus has nearly quadrupled to 64. Health officials said the illness has features of Kawasaki disease, a serious illness previously noted in children with COVID-19 in the United Kingdom.\n\n\"A pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome, recently reported by authorities in the United Kingdom, is also being observed among children and young adults in New York City and elsewhere in the United States,\" said Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, deputy commissioner of the New York City Health Department's Division of Disease Control, in a public letter to colleagues this week.\n\nAccording to Daskalakis, symptoms vary among the children depending on which organ system is affected, but \"include features of Kawasaki disease or features of shock.\" All of the children experienced a persistent fever, more than half reported rash, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea, and less than half experienced respiratory symptoms. He added, however, that \"the full spectrum of disease is not yet known.\"\n\nKawasaki disease is associated with fever, skin rashes, and swelling of glands, and in severe cases, it can inflame blood vessels within the heart.\n\nDr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician in New York City, told CBS News last week that she was \"not surprised\" by the U.K. report showing a possible link between COVID-19 and Kawasaki. According to Hes, children can sometimes develop the disease after a bout with the common cold, which is caused by a different variety of bug in the coronavirus family.\n\nShe added that Kawasaki could pop up \"weeks to months later\" after experiencing some kind of viral infection or \"multiple viral infections.\"\n\nThe cases reported in New York involved children who were hospitalized between April 17 and May 1 with \"illnesses compatible with\" a form of Kawasaki or shock, according to the New York City Health Department. More than half of the children required blood pressure support, and five required mechanical ventilation.\n\nThose who were admitted to pediatric intensive care units required cardiac and/or respiratory support, according to the health department.\n\nOn Tuesday, it was reported that four of the 15 children tested positive for the coronavirus. Ten tested negative, and one was initially indeterminate and then negative. Serology testing showed that six patients with negative results had coronavirus antibodies in their blood, suggesting they had been previously infected.\n\nRegardless of a coronavirus test result, the health department has urged doctors with patients under 21 years old who have symptoms consistent with Kawasaki to immediately report those suspected cases to the health department. Doctors are also instructed to immediately refer such patients to a \"specialist in pediatric infectious disease, rheumatology, and/or critical care.\"\n\nOnly severe cases may have been recognized so far, according to the health department. Daskalakis wrote that \"early diagnosis and treatment of patients meeting full or partial criteria for Kawasaki disease is critical to preventing end-organ damage and other long-term complications.\"\n\n\"We are learning that even though children are by and large mildly affected when it comes to COVID-19 that there can be situations that they are more severely affected,\" New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said Tuesday. \"And thank God in this situation we haven't had any children who have died with this Kawasaki or Kawasaki-like illness.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A mysterious illness affecting children, possibly linked to the coronavirus, is now blamed for at least three deaths in New York, reports CBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula.\n\nNew York State is investigating at least 85 reported cases of what many are calling \"pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrom\" that is potentially associated with COVID-19. Gov. Andrew Cuomo warned, \"This does not present as a normal COVID case. COVID cases tend to be respiratory; this presents as an inflammation of the blood vessels.\"\n\nIn many cases, children did not have respiratory issues; instead they experienced abdominal symptoms, a change in skin color, or chest pain.\n\n\"What we're seeing is, the immune system's actually going into overdrive, impacting the body in a negative way,\" said Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric cardiologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children in New Orleans. \"Some of these patients are having inflammation of their coronary arteries, and you can basically have a heart attack.\"\n\nDr. Kleinmahon has already treated several children for this illness, including 12-year-old Juliet Daly. \"Her heart was not functioning,\" Juliet's mother, Jennifer Daly, said last week. \"Her heart was inflamed so badly that the conduction system was not working in her heart. So, it was barely pumping. She was in heart failure.\"\n\nHospitals in at least six states have reported seeing similar cases. The illness is so concerning that New York City issued a health alert about it last week.\n\nDr. Kleinmahon said, \"If you're not really aware of this syndrome that's being described, it could easily be missed. Fortunately, children overall are very resilient in almost all the cases. And if we're able to knock down the inflammation and get them past the beginning stages of this, they're usually doing very well.\"\n\nExperts say this illness bears some resemblance to a rare condition called Kawasaki disease. Gov. Cuomo said his state's Department of Health will work with the CDC and the New York Genome Center to study the illness.\n\nWhen asked about the symptoms and rarity of the condition, Dr. Narula said, \"I do think it's important to stress that in the grand scheme of the pandemic, this is rare. We're still learning a lot more about it.\n\n\"The important thing for parents is, if their child does have the prolonged high fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, change in the color of their skin, or their lips, or chest pain, that's something they should act on quickly. In many of these cases the kids have decompensated or deteriorated quickly.\"\n\nIf you notice any of those symptoms, Dr. Narula said, call your doctor.",

Ten other cases are pending.\n\n\"It's sobering. It's bluntly frightening, and I want to say to parents out there: If you're hearing this information about pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome and it sounds scary, it does sound scary.

        "body": "Washington -- The U.S. Navy has extended its investigation into an outbreak of the coronavirus among sailors aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt and the events that led to the removal of its captain, Brett Crozier.\n\nActing Navy Secretary James McPherson announced the investigation would be widened in a written statement Wednesday and said he has \"unanswered questions\" stemming from a preliminary inquiry conducted by the Navy that can be answered only with a \"deeper review.\"\n\n\"I am directing Adm. Gilday to conduct a follow-on command investigation,\" McPherson said, referencing Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Michael Gilday. \"This investigation will build on the good work of the initial inquiry to provide a more fulsome understanding of the sequence of events, actions and decisions surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt.\"\n\nGilday ordered an investigation into the ouster of Crozier and the events surrounding the outbreak, and recommended he be reinstated as the commander of the Roosevelt, CBS News confirmed last week.\n\nCrozier was relieved of his command after an urgent memo he sent pleading for sailors to be removed from the aircraft carrier became public. Then-acting Secretary of the Navy Thomas Modly, who has since resigned, said Crozier went outside the chain of command.\n\nThe Navy said that as of Tuesday, there are 940 active coronavirus cases among sailors from the Roosevelt, and 29 have recovered. One sailor is in a naval hospital in Guam for COVID-19 symptoms, and one has died.",

Tyson said 570 employees and contractors out of 2,244 from the Wilkesboro plant who were tested came up positive.\n\nA majority didn't have symptoms and wouldn't have known they were infected if they hadn't been tested, the company added.\n\nThe plant had shut down for five days as a result of a COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nOf the 570, 237 were tested by the Department of Health or their own health care providers. Another 2,007 were tested onsite from May 6 to May 9.\n\nTwo of the three plants at the Tyson complex were shut down for cleaning. The Fresh Plant One facility was closed earlier this month.\n\nOutbreaks at chicken and meat processing plants are among the main virus clusters around the country.\n\nTyson said workers who test positive receive paid leave and only return to work after they meet CDC and Tyson criteria. Company policy requires that all those testing positive or feeling sick be isolated at home.\n\n\"We are working closely with local health departments to protect our team members and their families, and to help manage the spread of the virus in our communities,\" said Tom Brower, Senior Vice President of Health and Safety for Tyson Foods. \"We are using the most up-to-date data and resources to support our team members, and we are committed to ensuring they feel safe and secure when they come to work.\"",

    "New York reports over 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "New York state is reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities as the state faces scrutiny over how it's protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state's nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Governor Andrew Cuomo's administration late Monday that, for the first time, includes people believed to have been killed by the coronavirus before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test.\n\nExactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state's latest disclosure, as the list doesn't nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying. The revised list shows that 22 nursing homes, largely in New York City and Long Island, have reported at least 40 deaths.\n\nParker Jewish Institute in Queens and Isabella Geriatric Center -- one of New York City's largest nursing homes with 705 beds - have reported the highest number of deaths: 71 and 64, respectively.\n\nAudrey Waters, a spokeswoman for Isabella Geriatric Center, said in an email last week, \"Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff. This hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.\"\n\nIn many cases, the state's new figures reveal many more deaths than previously reported at nursing homes: Isabella Geriatric Center had 13 COVID-19 deaths reported as of May 1, and now reports the deaths of 21 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 along with 43 deaths of residents presumed to have COVID-19. And Ozanam Hall of Queens now is reporting a total of 53 deaths, up from just 10.\n\nSeveral veterans' homes have been especially hard-hit by the virus: The Long Island State Veterans Home has reported 53 deaths; including 48 confirmed and five presumed COVID-19 deaths. The New York State Veterans Home at St. Albans in Queens has reported 33 deaths while New York State Veterans Home at Montrose in Westchester says 22 residents have died.\n\nCuomo promised on March 2, when only a handful of coronavirus cases had been reported in New York, to make a \"special effort\" for nursing homes and congregate homes housing senior citizens. The state-directed nursing homes to screen visitors and consider modifying visiting hours on March 6, and later suspended visits to nursing homes statewide March 12.\n\nBut the governor is facing criticism over his administration's role in overseeing and supporting New York's overwhelmed, state-regulated nursing homes as many have struggled to treat COVID-19 patients, amass enough personal protective gear or ensure adequate staffing.\n\nAdvocacy groups for the elderly and family members of nursing home residents have called for greater transparency over COVID-19 cases at each state-regulated nursing home and criticized an April 1 state law granting some immunity to hospitals and nursing homes from civil and criminal liability. They also questioned the state's March 25 policy that says \"no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe governor and his administration have defended that policy as ensuring nursing home residents aren't left lingering in hospitals or without anywhere else to go. Cuomo's spokesman tweeted Monday that the policy follows federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance. But the federal guidance says only that a nursing home \"can accept a resident diagnosed with COVID-19\" so long as the nursing home can follow federal guidance on transmission precautions.\n\nCuomo has also said the state has facilities that can house transferred COVID-19 nursing homes patients, and he recently said that nursing homes that tell the state up-front that they can't care for a COVID-19 patient wouldn't face regulatory scrutiny. His administration hasn't responded to a request for questions on the state's current capacity to care for COVID-19 nursing home residents and whether nursing homes were informed.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "New York's rising cases of mystery illness in children are \"tip of the iceberg,\" Cuomo says\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that the state has now confirmed 137 cases of a mystery illness in children connected to COVID-19. Cuomo said he believes the state's discovery is just the \"tip of the iceberg\" for the illness dubbed Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, or PMIS.\n\n\"The more states that look, the more that find cases,\" Cuomo said at his daily briefing. \"We've given the nation and the world a heads up.\"\n\nAccording to the governor, 90% of the children found with PMIS in New York have either tested positive for the coronavirus or its antibodies.\n\nThe syndrome presents a wide range of symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain and rash, caused by inflammation. It was not initially connected to COVID-19 because it does not appear to cause respiratory symptoms -- a telltale sign of the coronavirus, according to Cuomo.\n\nThe governor did not say how children contracted the virus, which was originally thought to largely spare young people, but urged residents to remain vigilant about masks and social distancing around all age groups and activities. The governor noted that the majority of new COVID-19 cases have been reported in people who are at not working outside their home: \"That's why the personal behavior is so important,\" he said.\n\nWestern New York has begun reopening its economy, as it has met coronavirus containment goals outlined in the state's Regional Monitoring Dashboard. Hospitals in the region will be able to schedule elective surgeries, but gatherings such as church services and sports events will still be banned, Cuomo said.\n\nThe region joins Central New York, North Country, Finger Lakes, Southern Tier and Mohawk Valley Regions in reopening.\n\nAll regions are required to meet seven categories of numerical criteria before reopening. New York City had met four out seven of the criteria last week, but fell behind this week and now only meets three. It has yet to lower its rate of new hospitalizations below two per 100,000 residents, meet the 30% threshold of available total hospital beds and ICU beds, or meet the goal of 30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents.\n\nThe governor said 105 people died of COVID-19 statewide on Monday, down from 106 on Sunday, the lowest number since March 26. Cuomo's own COVID-19 test, taken at his daily briefing on Sunday, was negative, he said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "California is among the states that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic. In Los Angeles County, more than 15,000 people have tested positive for COVID-19, but health officials announced this week that antibody tests show the rate of infection could be 40 times that number.\n\nSerology tests were used in a study conducted earlier in April by the University of Southern California and the LA County Public Health Department. The tests, which detect antibodies in an individual's blood to determine if that person had the coronavirus, showed roughly 320,000 people, or about 4% of Los Angeles' population, have been infected with COVID-19, CBS Los Angeles reports.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, there were 663 coronavirus deaths reported in Los Angeles. More than 45,000 people have died from the virus nationwide.\n\nLos Angeles Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer told reporters Monday that the serology tests provide \"a better understanding\" of how much of the city's populations has been infected with the virus, \"regardless of whether they were ever tested or they even had symptoms.\"\n\n\"So although I report that every day we have thousands of thousands of people who have tested positive, the serology testing lets us know that we have hundreds of thousands of people that have already developed antibodies to the virus,\" said Ferrer. \"Because at some point in time during the last couple of months, they have in fact been infected with COVID-19.\"\n\nAccording to CBS LA, the study was conducted between April 10 and April 14.\n\nWhile many health officials say the blood-based tests are key to re-opening the economy, others say the high demand for the tests has pushed the FDA to favor speed over accuracy, and that many tests on the market are not regulated. As a result, the accuracy of some serology tests has been put under significant scrutiny nationwide.\n\nAccording to Reuters, a high number of false positives from antibody testing kits have been reported. In addition to skewing the data, this could lead some to believe they are immune to the disease when they are not.\n\n\"Even a very small false positive rate could lead to hundreds of thousands of people being told that they're safe when they might not be,\" Dr. Ania Wajnberg of Mt. Sinai in New York told CBS Evening News.\n\nNeeraj Sood, a professor of public policy at USC, and the lead researcher of the Los Angeles study, told Reuters that, by their estimates, \"We might have to recalibrate disease prediction models and rethink public health strategies.\"\n\n\"We haven't known the true extent of COVID-19 infections in our community,\" Sood said, \"because we have only tested people with symptoms and the availability of tests has been limited.\"\n\nNew York Governor Andrew Cuomo also addressed antibody testing in his state Tuesday, stating that such testing would be useful to determine the true number of people were infected with COVID-19 and what the actual mortality rate is.",

        "body": "Broadway actor Nick Cordero suffered a new setback this week in his battle against the coronavirus. The 41-year-old Tony nominee, whose right leg had to be amputated after he suffered complications from the virus, went into septic shock after developing a lung infection.\n\nCordero is in a medically induced coma, and has been on a ventilator for a month.\n\nHis wife, fitness instructor and former Broadway dancer Amanda Kloots, told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Gayle King that Cordero had no fever and no cough when he first became sick, just symptoms of extreme fatigue.\n\nRead part of their conversation below.\n\nAmanda Kloots: We didn't think that it was COVID, yet it was weird that he was sick at the time when this was all happening ... So we took him to the urgent care ... and they said it's pneumonia.\n\nGayle King: So that must have given you a small sense of relief, Amanda, to hear, \"Okay, I don't have COVID\"?\n\nKloots: Yeah. In fact, we were both saying in the car, this is the only time that you're kind of like, \"Woo! It's pneumonia.\" ... We went to pick up his medications, ... and for the next three days ... he just kept getting worse. ... We called a friend of ours who's a doctor at Cedar Sinai and he said, \"Go to the emergency room now.\" ... This is one of the saddest parts. ... We thought I would see him in two hours. You know, I just -- I said, ... \"Call me when ya want me to come pick ya up,\" you know? ... And so I didn't even give him a kiss or a hug because we were also kind of self-isolating from him, 'cause, you know, we have this 10-month-old baby. ... And I got a call from Nick in about an hour, and he said, \"Amanda, they have admitted me. I am now in a bed with oxygen. ... They'll know some things in a couple hours. ... Go home and I'll call you in a couple of hours.\"\n\nKing: Were you worried at that point, Amanda?\n\nKloots: I was getting a little worried at this point, yes. ... It was the next morning, at 4 a.m., he called me and he said, \"Honey, they want to put me on a ventilator.\" ... Again, we were just talking over the phone. We FaceTimed quickly, ... and he's saying, \"I love you. Oh my gosh. Okay,\" and he said, \"I'm a little scared.\"\n\nKing: And that must have scared you, to hear him say that he was scared.\n\nKloots: Oh, it's terrifying. ... And to be honest, Gayle, I didn't even really understand what all of this meant. ... In the meantime, they said, \"We want to start some of the COVID medicines.\" ... They did the deep COVID chest scrape, and it came back positive. ... He started to get better. And we were -- we had plans to take him off the ventilator.\n\nKing: I saw your post, and it was so exciting. ... We're thinking, \"Yay! He's turned a corner.\"\n\nKloots: Yes. ... He turned a corner. And then, I get a phone call that he got an infection. ... His pulse, gone, for two minutes, and they had to resuscitate his heart.\n\nKing: Talk about a roller coaster, Amanda. Two steps forward, and then a step back.\n\nKloots: Yes. ... The call that morning was supposed to be, \"We're taking him off the ventilator today 'cause he's doing so well.\" ... This was a new infection that came in. ... They said, \"Amanda, we are trying to get him onto an ECMO machine as soon as possible. This will save his life.\"\n\nKing: What is an ECMO machine?\n\nKloots: It basically takes over the functions of your heart and lungs to run your heart and lungs outside of your body. ... One of these cannula tubes was restricting blood flow to Nick's right leg. ... And they just said, \"Amanda, unfortunately, ... the body is trying to save this leg, but it's fighting it. And in return could cause a lot of damage to the body.\"\n\nKing: To put it simply ... it sounds like you had to make a decision between saving his leg or saving his life.\n\nKloots: You know, Gayle, yes, he's a dancer, he's an actor, he's a performer. ... It was not an easy decision to make.\n\nKing: So where do we stand today? The doctors have said there's no reason why he can't wake up.\n\nKloots: Well, ... today was supposed to be putting in a trach and a feeding tube. Unfortunately, this morning, his blood count was really, really low. ... Low blood count can mean that he's internally bleeding from somewhere. So ... now, we have to wait.\n\nKing: I can't imagine what it's been like for you. ... Your optimism is so infectious. And because you believe, you give us all reason to believe.\n\nKloots: I feel like there is an army of people behind him, behind us. ... And I just believe -- I get chills saying it -- I just believe that he will wake up.\n\nKing: You've started this social media movement, \"Wake up, Nick,\" #wakeupNick.\n\nKloots: I didn't even plan on it, you know, this way. ... And then, as everything started unfolding. ... I just started this because I thought, you know, Nick would love this.\n\nKing: What would he love about this?\n\nKloots: When he hears that everyone is playing his song every day ... and praying for him, and now it's on the radio, Gayle. He won't believe it. ... I go to the hospital every day. I stand outside of Cedars. I play Nick's song. ... I cheer him on from outside of Cedar Sinai every day.\n\nKing: I just feel so positive, after listening to you. I mean, Nick's song, \"Live Your Life.\" ... \"Who understands how stars -- \"\n\nKloots: \" -- still alive.\" I know. He wrote these words, like, years ago. ... It just resonates with what everyone's going through at this time, you know? Just to live your life and ... just be so grateful for it, you know?",

    "No spike, but no certainty on fallout of Wisconsin election": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Madison, Wisconsin -- Wisconsin's presidential primary election held last month in the face of the coronavirus pandemic drew concern from doctors, voters, poll workers and politicians who warned that having thousands of people leave their homes to cast ballots would further spread the highly contagious virus.\n\nNow well beyond the 14-day incubation period for COVID-19, and with a Tuesday special congressional election in northern Wisconsin looming, it remains largely unknown just how many people contracted the virus at the polls on April 7.\n\n\"We lack the scientific tools and infrastructure to really measure the impact reliably,\" said Kristen Malecki, an epidemiologist at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health. \"If we were able to test everybody, then we would absolutely be able to say whether (there was a surge) or not.\"\n\nA team of epidemiologists and public health experts who examined the potential impact of the election on the spread of COVID-19 in Milwaukee released a study Wednesday that drew no conclusions, in large part because of the lack of widespread testing and contact tracing.\n\nNearly 411,000 people showed up statewide to vote, some waiting in lines for hours in Milwaukee, many of them wearing masks and voicing anger at Republicans in the legislature who refused to delay the election. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, who worked the polls in a mask, gloves and protective gown, was widely derided for reassuring voters that it was \"incredibly safe to go out.\"\n\nIt will likely never be known just how safe, or not, it was to vote, public health leaders said.\n\nMalecki and other health experts said it's nearly impossible to quantify the impact COVID-19 had on those who showed up at the polls because of a lack of testing and contact tracing, the work of determining who an infected person has been around. In addition, some people are infected but have no symptoms and therefore don't get tested at all.\n\nSixty-seven people who tested positive for COVID-19 since April 7 reported that they had been at the polls, but state health officials have warned against assuming that's how they became infected since many of them had also been other places where they could have been exposed.\n\nThe state intends to stop asking people who tested positive after Thursday whether they were at the polls because the 14-day incubation period of the virus has long since passed. They are also not counting anyone who was at the polls but who didn't show symptoms until after April 21.\n\n\"It's safe to say (the election) didn't help,\" said Dr. Nasia Safdar, medical director of infection control and prevention at UW Health, the University of Wisconsin-Madison's medical arm. \"But whether it actively hurt people, it's very likely but not possible to really prove it.\"\n\nFor example, a voter or poll worker may have contracted the virus on the bus or while grocery shopping before the election, she said.\n\nFive National Guard members who worked the polls reported having symptoms consistent with COVID-19, but only one was tested. That test came back negative. Doctors would not give the other four tests.\n\nThe number of infections linked to the election pales in comparison to the outbreaks seen at meatpacking plants in Wisconsin. More than 500 cases have been tied to plants in and around Green Bay.\n\nUniversity of Wisconsin researchers who are using cellphone data to track the mobility of Americans in the middle of the pandemic said the data show people moved around more on the April 7 election day than they did in the days leading up to the vote. That bolsters concerns raised before the election that holding the vote would lead more people to be out than otherwise would have been.\n\nA bitter legal battle over changes to the election unfolded days before Wisconsin voters headed to the polls and ended with an 11th-hour ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court that curtailed extended absentee voting in the state. Alongside the efforts to give voters more time to submit their absentee ballots, Democratic Governor Tony Evers attempted to delay the primary, though the Wisconsin Supreme Court blocked the effort.\n\nAs it was on April 7, Wisconsin remains under a stay-at-home order designed to limit movement and the chances of the virus spreading.\n\nWhile more than 1.1 million people voted absentee, nearly 411,000 voters cast ballots in person. Many complained that they were forced to do so after their requests for absentee ballots went unfulfilled.\n\nWisconsin stood alone last month in carrying out its election as the coronavirus was spreading. While Alaska, Wyoming, Hawaii and Louisiana were all pushing back their elections or shifting to mail-only, Wisconsin's Republican-controlled Legislature -- with the help of the conservative-controlled state Supreme Court -- resisted Evers' request to do the same.\n\nWith confirmed cases of the coronavirus continuing to rise in some states, voting rights groups are urging states to embrace vote-by-mail.\n\nOnly five polling places out of nearly 200 opened in Milwaukee due to a shortage of people willing to work at the polls. Evers called out the National Guard to help.\n\nWisconsin is about to hold more in-person voting next week, to fill a vacant congressional seat in the northern part of the state. Evers has made no attempt to stop it, in part because of the more rural population and lower infection rates. Nebraska is also holding a statewide election Tuesday with in-person voting.\n\nEvers has also been working to increase testing and contact tracing as part of his plan to reopen the state.\n\nRamping up contact tracing will help in identifying future cases but not tell the story of what happened during the election, said Brian Yandell, interim director of the American Family Insurance Data Science Institute.\n\nIn the absence of greater testing and tracking now, Yandell said, \"we largely are flying blind.\"",

    "Nursing home in New York City reports 98 deaths linked to coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A New York City nursing home reported on Friday the deaths of 98 residents believed to have had the coronavirus, a staggering death toll that shocked public officials.\n\n\"It's absolutely horrifying,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \"It's inestimable loss, and it's just impossible to imagine so many people lost in one place.\"\n\nIt is hard to say whether the spate of deaths at the Isabella Geriatric Center, in Manhattan, is the worst nursing home outbreak yet in the U.S., because even within the city facilities have chosen to report fatalities in different ways. An official state tally of nursing home deaths listed only 13 at the home as of Friday.\n\nBut officials at the 705-bed center confirmed that through Wednesday 46 residents who tested positive for COVID-19 had died as well as an additional 52 people \"suspected\" to have the virus. Some died at the nursing home and some died after being treated at hospitals.\n\nThe number of bodies became so overwhelming the home ordered a refrigerator truck to store them because funeral homes have been taking days to pick up the deceased.\n\n\"Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff,\" Audrey Waters, a spokeswoman for the nursing home, wrote in an email. \"This hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.\"\n\nIsabella also encountered staffing shortages, prompting it to hire from outside agencies and early challenges securing personal protective equipment for employees. Waters said the home finally is \"getting more access to testing\" now.\n\nThe nursing home's death toll was first reported by local cable news station NY1.\n\nNursing homes have been known since the earliest days of the outbreak as a trouble spot. They have been particularly hard hit in New York, which has had at least 3,065 nursing home deaths - by far the most in the nation - as of Thursday, according to an Associated Press count.\n\nThe state Department of Health said it has received \"outbreak reports\" from 239 nursing homes, including at least six facilities with death tolls of 40 patients or more.\n\n\"The one thing we now know about the nursing homes is the status quo cannot continue to say the least,\" de Blasio said. \"Something very different has to happen.\"\n\nCity officials are \"trying to provide help in every way we can,\" the mayor added, saying the city had delivered thousands of respirator masks to the Washington Heights facility.",

    "OSHA meatpacking guidelines aren't enforceable: \"OSHA is hiding\"": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Federal recommendations meant to keep meatpacking workers safe as they return to plants that were shuttered by the coronavirus have little enforcement muscle behind them. That's fueling anxieties that working conditions could put employees' lives at risk.\n\nExtensive guidance issued last month by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that meatpacking companies erect physical barriers, enforce social distancing and install more hand-sanitizing stations, among other steps. But the guidance is not mandatory.\n\n\"It's like, 'Here's what we'd like you to do. But if you don't want to do it, you don't have to,'\" said Mark Lauritsen, international vice president and director of the food processing and meatpacking division for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.\n\nDozens of meatpacking workers have died of COVID-19, leading to lawsuits from families of those workers who are accusing the companies of ignoring safety guidelines. In one suit, a Pennsylvania family sued beef processor JBS over the death of Enock Benjamin, a 70-year-old man who died April 30 after contracting COVID-19 at the company's Souderton plant.\n\nThat lawsuit accuses JBS, the second-largest meat processor in the U.S., of ignoring recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in early March that meat companies position plant workers at least six feet apart and provide them with gloves. Experts say OSHA should make the guidelines mandatory.\n\nThe pandemic is \"the most massive workers' safety crisis in many decades, and OSHA is in the closet. OSHA is hiding,\" said David Michaels, an epidemiologist who was the agency's assistant secretary of labor under President Barack Obama. Michaels called on OSHA to make the guidelines mandatory and enforceable, which would include the threat of fines.\n\nOSHA's general guidance plainly says the recommendations are advisory and \"not a standard or regulation,\" and they create \"no new legal obligations.\"\n\nBut the guidance also says employers must follow a law known as the general duty clause, which requires companies to provide a workplace free of recognized hazards. Critics say that rule is unlikely to be enforced, especially after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April aimed at keeping meat plants open.\n\nAlready, examples have emerged of questionable enforcement efforts and pressure to keeping plants running:\n\n-- Shortly before Trump's order, state regulators in Iowa declined to inspect a Tyson Foods pork plant despite a complaint alleging workers had been exposed to the virus in crowded conditions. Documents obtained by The Associated Press show it took the Iowa division of OSHA nine days to seek a response from Tyson and eight more to get a reply. The state agency ultimately found Tyson's voluntary efforts to improve social distancing at the Perry plant were \"satisfactory\" and closed the case without an inspection. A week later, 730 workers -- almost 60% of the workforce -- had tested positive.\n\n-- In Kansas, the state softened its quarantine guidelines after industry executives pushed to allow potentially exposed employees to continue going to work, according to emails and text messages obtained by The Kansas City Star and The Wichita Eagle. The state had previously advised such employees to quarantine for two weeks, before conforming to the more lenient CDC guideline, which allows employees to continue working if they have no symptoms and use precautions. The move came after Tyson raised a concern with the state of rising worker absenteeism.\n\nAfter Trump's executive order -- developed with input from the industry -- the Labor Department and OSHA said OSHA would use discretion and consider \"good faith attempts\" to follow safety recommendations. Employers would be given a chance to explain if some are not met. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue made clear in letters earlier this month that the Department of Agriculture expected state and local officials to work with meat plants to keep them running. And he said any closed plants without a timetable to reopen had to submit protocols to the USDA.\n\nThe USDA did not respond to repeated requests to provide those company plans to the AP. When asked how guidelines would be enforced, a USDA spokesperson said enforcement was up to OSHA.\n\nMajor meatpackers JBS, Smithfield and Tyson have said worker safety is their highest priority. They provided the AP with summaries of their efforts to improve safety, but the plans themselves have not been made public. Tyson said because the temporary suspension of its operations was voluntary and the company was already meeting or exceeding federal guidance, it was not required to submit a reopening plan to the USDA.\n\nOne plan obtained by the AP, for the reopening of a JBS pork plant in Worthington, Minnesota, details multiple safety improvements, including installing physical barriers, increasing spacing between workers and requiring protective equipment. The plan includes photos. It says employees will be screened for health issues, but it makes no mention of requiring testing.\n\nJBS spokesman Cameron Bruett said the plan \"demonstrates the extraordinary measures\" the plant has taken \"to keep our team members safe as they provide food for the country.\"\n\nIn an emailed response to questions about how guidance would be enforced and what role OSHA would play in protecting workers, the Department of Labor said OSHA received 55 complaints in the animal-processing industry and opened 22 inspections since Feb. 1.\n\nEchoing language from the general duty clause, the agency also noted longstanding rules that require employers to provide a safe workplace.\n\n\"OSHA's standards remain in place and enforceable, and they will continue to be as workers return to their workplaces,\" a labor spokesperson said.\n\nMichaels, the former OSHA official, said the clause has no preventive effect and is generally enforced only after a worker is injured. He said it's effective only in cases in which OSHA conducts an inspection and issues citations and the employer agrees to fix the problem -- so any impact is felt months or years later.\n\nMichaels said OSHA will not issue citations if employers are doing their best to eliminate a hazard but find it's not feasible.\n\nJeffrey Lancaster, founder and CEO of Lancaster Safety Consulting in Wexford, Pennsylvania, said violations of the general duty clause can get expensive, especially if companies are found to be repeat violators, have a willful violation, or fail to fix an issue.\n\n\"The laws have been in place,\" he said. \"It's just a new ballgame - a new hazard.\"\n\nMinnesota is one of 22 states or territories with worker-protection agencies that cover private and government workers, and the state OSHA has the power to enforce the CDC and state Department of Health's COVID-19 safety guidelines under the general duty clause, spokesman James Honerman said.\n\nThe agency has two open investigations into the meatpacking businesses -- one at a JBS plant in Worthington and one at a Pilgrim's Pride plant in Cold Spring, said Honerman, who could not discuss the investigations because they are pending.\n\nLauritsen, with the food workers' union, said OSHA has not done enough to hold employers accountable. The union is advocating for access to daily testing for all meat-production workers, personal protective equipment if necessary and paid sick leave.\n\n\"By and large, if our members are healthy enough, if they are not sick or on quarantine, they are going to show up to do their job,\" Lauritsen said. \"But that doesn't mean that they're not anxious or not nervous.\"",

        "body": "Pediatrician explains why she's \"not surprised\" the coronavirus is being linked to a rare disease in children\n\nDoctors in the U.K. are warning that the coronavirus could be linked to Kawasaki disease, a rare but serious illness in children. Dr. Dyan Hes, a pediatrician in New York City, told CBS News she was \"not surprised\" to hear about the possible link.\n\nNormally, \"it's not fatal, it's very treatable,\" Dr. Hes told CBSN actors Vladimir Duthiers and Anne-Marie Green. \"You can get it [Kawasaki disease] after flu. You can get it after multiple viral infections.\"\n\nBritish doctors rang alarm bells over Kawasaki disease after a number of children diagnosed with COVID-19 died despite having no underlying health issues, according to U.K. Health Secretary Matt Hancock.\n\nThe exact cause is unknown, but Kawasaki disease is associated with fever, skin rashes, swelling of glands and in severe cases it can inflame blood vessels within the heart. The U.K.'s National Health Service says it normally affects about 8 in every 100,000 children each year, mostly under the age of 5.\n\nHes said she was \"not surprised\" by the report because children can sometimes develop Kawasaki disease after a bout with a common cold, which is caused by a different variety of bug in the coronavirus family. She added that Kawasaki could pop up \"weeks to months later\" after experiencing some kind of viral infection or \"multiple viral infections.\"\n\nExperts in Italy and Britain are looking into the possible link after doctors in hard-hit northern Italy reported \"extraordinarily large numbers\" of children under age 9 with severe cases of what looks to be Kawasaki, according to Reuters.\n\nResearchers are now investigating whether clusters of infants arriving at hospitals in those two countries with high fevers and signs of inflammatory illness can be traced back to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nDr. Hes said the ongoing research was \"not published yet in peer review journals,\" but pointed out that not all of the children studied who had Kawasaki were diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nHowever, she noted the rapidly-changing nature of information doctors are learning about the coronavirus.\n\n\"I think that what we're learning more and more is that COVID-19 can cause just about any symptom and attack any part of the body, but particularly the vasculature, it causes a lot of inflammation,\" she explained.\n\nSuch cases have not been seen in otherwise healthy children in New York City, according to Hes, who noted that she \"just got off of the grand rounds\" at New York Presbyterian Hospital.\n\n\"The children that we're seeing that have been critically ill, have been children who already have been critically ill with either kidney transplant or heart transplant,\" Hes said. \"They are kids who are already immunosuppressed in some way.\"",

    "Pennsylvania doctor takes state's COVID-19 testing problem into her own hands": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "\"CBS This Morning's\" multi-part series, \"State of Testing,\" looks at the state of resources and accessibility to coronavirus testing. In addition, the series will report on how states are responding to testing needs, whether they are developing testing plans, and what testing benchmarks they are looking for as these states make the decision to re-open.\n\nThe state of Pennsylvania has tested less than 2% of its 12.8 million population for coronavirus. For many in Philadelphia, testing can be hard to find. Pediatric surgeon Dr. Ala Stanford took matters into her own hands to get much-needed tests to the residents of the local community.\n\n\"Every time someone got turned away, I would get a call,\" Dr. Stanford told CBS News' Jericka Duncan.\n\nHer solution? To pay for the tests herself.\n\nStanford said she and her team of volunteers have been able to test over 1,600 people in three weeks. When CBS News caught up with her Friday, they had given diagnostic tests to over 200 people in a Philadelphia church parking lot.\n\nLike in many other communities around the country, tests began to run out, with nearly 100 people still waiting in line. Luckily a local hospital eventually stepped in and donated more tests.\n\nPhiladelphia has been testing 1,500 people per day on average, but health officials say they need to test at least five-to-ten times that amount before they can safely consider reopening.\n\nThe state's health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, said it has gotten \"easier\" to get a COVID-19 test, but that \"some of it depends on where you live.\"\n\n\"I think it's really important to have a steady supply chain that we can count on in terms of testing, and it seems like that is developing,\" Dr. Levine said.\n\nPennsylvania as a state has the sixth highest number of reported coronavirus cases in the country, and ranks fifth highest in number of COVID-19-related deaths. The state Health Department claimed it has tested at least 40,000 people in the last week.\n\nLevine said the state's goal was to be able to test every resident who was showing coronavirus symptoms.\n\n\"We're working toward that,\" she said.\n\nWhile harder-hit places like Philadelphia and other southeast parts of the state will remain closed, northern counties with lower COVID-19 cases per capita are among those that could be the first to reopen.\n\nSome businesses will reopen on May 8, though restaurants will still remain curbside only across the state. Places like movie theaters will remain closed.\n\nAndrew Brum, a resident of rural Lycoming county, said he is preparing to reopen the historic Otto Bookstore.\n\nAsked what made him feel safe to reopen before getting tested, Brum said that he has been \"very cautious to any exposure,\" but the worry remained.\n\n\"In terms of just general safety, I'm not going to say there isn't some concern, especially having a young daughter,\" he said.",

    "Psychiatric hospital a \"haven\" for spread of coronavirus, say employees": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The coronavirus, which has impacted nursing homes, is also hitting patients and staff at psychiatric facilities across the U.S.\n\nThere have been 34 confirmed cases (28 staff and 6 patients) at Western State Hospital, just outside Tacoma, Washington, which is one of the largest psychiatric hospitals west of the Mississippi.\n\nThe state's epidemiologist called the outbreak at Western State \"serious\" but also gave the hospital credit for taking early action that may slow infections.\n\nIt's one of nearly 2,000 inpatient psychiatric facilities in the U.S., and caring for this population comes with unique challenges during a pandemic.\n\n\"We are a hospital, too,\" said social worker Maria Claudio, who works at Western State. It is the state's largest psychiatric hospital with over 800 beds. According to the union, about 25 percent are elderly patients. \"We are not a medical hospital, but these are patients, and just because they have a mental condition and some of them are violent, they're still human beings.\"\n\nCBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge asked, \"Are there any special measures being taken to protect these patients on the high-risk wards?\"\n\n\"No,\" Claudio replied. \"Nothing.\"\n\nCBS News spoke to more than a half dozen Western State employees who worry the hospital isn't taking COVID-19 seriously. They say administrators are floating staff between wards, potentially spreading the virus, and have abandoned temperature-screening workers.\n\nWhen asked if she believe the hospital offers the virus a safe space to spread, Claudio replied, \"Oh, it's a haven. I do believe that there's going to be a lot of deaths.\"\n\nStaff told \"CBS This Morning\" social distancing isn't a viable option, because many patients require hands-on care.\n\nOne worker, who asked us to shield her identity for fear of retaliation for speaking out, told Herridge, \"We are fighting a war, and we are not given any tools to protect anybody, let alone ourselves. So, it's like we're doing a suicide mission.\n\n\"I think we have it worse than a traditional hospital because our patients can at any given time become violent. You know, we have patients that don't understand or grasp of coughing into your arm or sneezing into your arm.\"\n\nNurse Sharon Bethard told CBS News the hospital only recently provided some protective equipment, after weeks of forbidding staff from bringing their own, according to internal hospital emails.\n\n\"At that time, nobody was allowed to wear masks,\" Bethard said. \"If they see you wearing masks, they will tell you to take it off.\"\n\nMaria Claudio's family bought a used RV, anticipating she will need to self-isolate away from them in the weeks ahead.\n\nLike her coworkers, Claudio said she is committed to the patients who are among society's most isolated. \"They rely on us for everything,\" she said. \"They are locked in there. We have the keys. We have all the power. So, we have the responsibility to take care of them.\"\n\nIn response to staff claims, spokesperson Kelly Von Holtz emphasized to CBS News that Western State Hospital took early action to protect their high-risk population.\n\n\"We understand the geriatric population is particularly vulnerable,\" Von Holtz said. \"In fact, most of our patients meet several of the high-risk categories for COVID-19. We have taken several precautions hospital-wide, even before we had our first case of COVID-19. This includes increasing ward cleaning to every four hours, and increased cleaning on high-touch areas. We have been screening patients for symptoms every shift, and increasing awareness for the need to use good hand sanitization.\"\n\nOn staffing procedures, the spokesperson for the hospital said, \"We began decreasing movement across wards on March 13, 2020 - that movement became more restrictive on April 4, 2020 after receiving recommendations from the Department of Health.\"\n\nAddressing their previous policy that prohibited staff from wearing their own PPE, the hospital pointed to DOH guidance, saying, \"Since the beginning of the pandemic, public health guidance has changed quite a bit. In the beginning, PPE from home was restricted based on those guidelines. We are evolving as the recommendations from our public health experts do. On March 31, 2020, notification was sent to all staff who work in our 24/7 facilities that they could bring masks from home and the facilities would continue to provide PPE, as appropriate and designated by our state's Department of Health for staff when caring for patients and residents who are on droplet precautions.\"\n\nAsked about the DOH's change in guidance, the spokesperson pointed to a DOH document in mid-April that stated, \"The Washington State Department of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommend that people wear cloth face coverings when they are in public settings where they cannot maintain 6 feet of distance from others.\"\n\nAn internal email reviewed by CBS News suggests Western State Hospital changed policy on staff wearing their own PPE less than an hour after AFSCME Council 28 (the union representing many of the staff there) said they would be instructing their members to wear their own masks despite hospital policy.\n\nCBS News went back to the staff we interviewed, who said the changes don't come close to addressing their ongoing concerns.",

    "Q&A: Why contract tracing will be key to fighting the coronavirus - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Washington -- As governors in some states begin rolling out plans to ease restrictions on residents' activities and allow some businesses to open their doors again, experts and state leaders say broad testing is a key step in the road to recovery from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut in addition to ramping up testing, public health officials say that a robust contact tracing system will be crucial to allowing Americans to safely get back to work and school.\n\nSome states, like Massachusetts, have begun beefing up their public health workforces to conduct contact tracing and are rolling out their own programs as they look to reopening.\n\nAt the federal level, Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, and Congressman Andy Levin, a Democrat from Michigan, released a proposal last Thursday for a federal contact tracing program, which they want included in the next emergency relief package from Congress.\n\nMore than a dozen public health experts, led by former Acting Administrator for Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Andy Slavitt and former Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, sent a letter to congressional leaders Monday recommending they allocate $12 billion to expand the U.S. contact tracing workforce by 180,000. The letter was first reported by NPR.\n\nBut what is contact tracing, and how can it prevent the spread of the coronavirus? Dr. Marcus Plescia is the chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), a group that represents public health agencies. He contributed to a recent report from ASTHO and Johns Hopkins University outlining a nationwide plan for contact tracing, and spoke to CBS News about how contact tracing could be key to combating the virus. The following transcript has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nCBS News: How does contact tracing work, and why is it important?\n\nDr. Marcus Plescia: Contact tracing is a core approach to controlling any kind of infectious disease outbreak, and I think contact tracing is particularly important in the case of COVID because across the nation now we have states and communities that are really wanting and needing to move out of these very restrictive strict stay-at-home orders and trying to get society and the economy back going again.\n\nThe concerns we have though is that if we start to back out of these stay-at-home orders and other mitigation strategies, the virus is just going to start to spread again as we've recently experienced. We've got to do other things in place of the stay-at-home, stay-away-from-other-people approach.\n\nOne thing that's very, very effective is contact tracing. We know this because we've used it effectively in the past but also in the cases of COVID, we've looked at how some other countries who are a little ahead of us on the outbreaks, we've looked at how they've responded to COVID, how they've used contact tracing and disease containment very effectively to keep the numbers down.\n\nSo you really can start to reopen and let people move around a little bit more, but you have some way of tracking and tamping down clusters of infections as soon as you identify them.\n\nA smartphone belonging to Drew Grande, 40, of Cranston, Rhode Island, shows notes he made for contact tracing Wednesday, April 15, 2020. Steven Senne / AP\n\nHow it works is, first of all, it requires very aggressive testing. The minute somebody starts to have symptoms that might be consistent with COVID, we want them to be able to be tested, whether that's going to their doctor's office, going out to a testing site in the community, even maybe having somebody come to them.\n\nYou identify people who might have COVID very quickly and then you find out who those people have been in contact with in the last two, three, four days and then, it'll further depend on the protocols, but who are their recent contacts who might have gotten sick from being in close contact with them over a recent period?\n\nHow does this work in urban areas where people rely on public transportation and are in close quarters with people on the train or subway?\n\nPrograms are going to define what they think of as a \"close contact\" differently. One of the definitions that I've seen is being within six feet of the same person for 15 minutes. I guess if it was really packed on the Metro, but generally people get on and off, generally there's not the same person right next to you. With that kind of movement, then the fact that you're standing very close to somebody from one stop to another and then people shift around, that's probably going to be OK.\n\nIt's really more if you got on the Metro and ran into a friend who was going a similar distance and you stood next to each other and kind of talked back and forth to pass the time, that person potentially would be at risk because we know that respiratory droplets can be spread when people are having conversations when they're standing close to each other.\n\nNow, if you're actively coughing or sneezing, then we would hope that if you had those symptoms you would stay at home because it might be COVID. But if the coughing or sneezing cropped up on the Metro, that would be more challenging because that's a more aggressive form of respiratory droplets and more people would get exposed. There are some cases where we just might not be able to track down every person who might be at risk.\n\nBut most of it's going to be close contacts. You'll remember that you rode on the Metro with somebody you knew and you were talking to them a couple of days before you got sick, and that's somebody that we would follow up with with the contact tracing.\n\nAs we look toward a reopening of the economy, is the U.S. at this point prepared to launch a nationwide contact tracing program?\n\nWe're not prepared right at this moment. Our feeling is that we could get this up to scale pretty quickly.\n\nWe do contact tracing in all state and local health departments, so we have some core staff who do that, we know how to do it. We have people who can supervise and train other people. And a lot of the basic contact tracing work, you don't have to be a highly qualified public health person. We can hire lay people from communities. We can hire people who are out of work right now who are looking for something else to do.\n\nHow many people would need to be hired?\n\nWe're estimating 100,000 people across the nation. Our estimates are based on looking at the ratio of contact tracers to population in other countries that have done this effectively.\n\nThe most aggressive other nation is Wuhan City in China. If you use their ratio, we would need 300,000 people, so we think that's probably not the level that we're going to operate with.\n\nIs it the responsibility of state and local health departments to hire and pay contact tracers?\n\nWe represent state and public health departments, so we really think that's the place to build this capacity. We already have capacity there. We have people who know how to do this, who are experienced. Most importantly, we have the people who can supervise a so-called army of contact tracers. We would have to augment that supervision a little bit but that's probably more modest.\n\nThe big hiring would be more in the core contact tracers. But there are other models. There's a model to hire a big national corps that could be sent out. I think there are some logistical problems that would be challenging with that but there's a variety of different ways to do it and maybe ultimately it'll be a hybrid of different approaches.\n\nDo contact tracers require special skills?\n\nSome of it is pretty straight forward. You do have a script with pretty specific questions, but they do need some training. They need training in different ways of finding people because ideally you can call people and get them on the phone and talk to them but that's not always going to work. There are other ways to track people down.\n\nThen they need some skills in basic communication of how to broach this subject with people. When somebody calls you who you don't know, your first reaction is often you're a little suspicious about, is this real or is it a hoax? There's some training to do to that helps people break through that potential barrier and reassure the person they're talking to that this is legitimate and that they need to be attentive so it.\n\nMedical student Rebecca DeCarlo talks on the phone conducting a follow-up interview with a person being monitored by the Georgia Department of Public Health for infection or exposure to the coronavirus at the state agency's district office in Savannah, Georgia, on Wednesday, April 22, 2020. Russ Bynum / AP\n\nThey also need to learn some basic diplomacy, because if I tell that you you ran into somebody and talked to them on the Metro for 15 minutes and now you're going to have to stay at home until you get sick or 14 days pass, you may not be very excited to hear that.\n\nIf it's explained well to people and they understand that everybody wants to get this under control, there is a way to convey that so most people will accept it and see it as doing their part. But a contact tracer would need some training to really be good at that particular piece, because ultimately this is really going to depend on people being willing to cooperate. We can't go and force everybody to do this.\n\nThen there are privacy and confidentiality issues. We always want to be clear on that, and so we would spend quite a bit of time training and making sure that the contact tracers understand the ethics of what they're doing and how important it is that you keep people's personal business confidential.\n\nIf I'm called by a contact tracer because my friend, for example, had tested positive, what will I be asked?\n\nYou would probably be informed that we had been told by a specific person -- and we would probably not tell you their name -- that we have learned that person has COVID and we have been informed they had some close contact with you. Then we would probably say, here's what this person relayed about the contact the two of you had.\n\nThen we'd want to get your story. The contact tracer will be looking to confirm that the story that we have is consistent with what you've experienced. Then we'd go from there. You'd be asked if you've had any symptoms, you'd be asked who else you've been around.\n\nUltimately the idea would be to gauge, was this an interaction that put you at significant risk that you might get sick yourself? Most people are going to be pleased to have this information because if they're at risk that they could get COVID, most people want to know that. I think people would cooperate with what we ask them to do, but people would also be concerned about their family and not wanting to expose other people.\n\nYou may also have questions about, well, what does this mean, and how likely am I to get sick? The contact tracer will be able to give you some guidance on that as well.\n\nWhat if I'm the person who tests positive for the virus? Am I responsible for reaching out to the state or local health department, and what can I expect to be asked?\n\nThe idea would be to make it as easy as possible to make sure everybody knows, \"Here are the symptoms, if you get these, you've got to get a test.\"\n\nThen when you got tested, they would collect some information from you. Ideally we'll get to a place where we can use these point-of-care tests, where you give the sample and then they can test it almost immediately, so within a few minutes, or 15, 20 minutes you've got the results so you don't go home and wait around for somebody to call you. You can just stay there and you know what the deal is.\n\nIf you tested positive, they would probably right then and there try to get the information from you or try to get you on the phone with one of the contact tracers so right away they can get the information from you about who you've been in contact with.\n\nIn this April 20, 2020 photo, Catherine Hopkins, director of community outreach and school health at St. Joseph's Hospital, handles test samples at her desk in a COVID-19 triage and testing tent in Yonkers, New York. John Minchillo / AP\n\nWho you've been in contact with would require you to recall the last three days to really think through, what was I doing those days and who did I spend time around? A good contact tracer would have some questions that would help prompt you to remember things or bring up situations that we often see people in to help prompt their memory. Did you ride on the Metro? If so, were you with any person for a prolonged period of time talking to them?\n\nWe would probably want to find out if you were in close contact with anybody who might be at more significant risk if they got COVID. If you were around somebody who is older than 60 or who you knew had chronic medical conditions, those would be particularly important contacts for us to know about so we can keep a very close eye on those people.\n\nIn Massachusetts, they are reaching people by phone, while Apple and Google are developing contact tracing technology. Is one better than the other?\n\nIn the ideal situation, there would be a mix. There would be some good technology that might do some of the contact tracing without even having to talk to somebody. In other countries, they've been able to use people's cellphones to track. They know Cellphone No. 3 was right next to Cellphone No. 6 for 30 minutes last Friday. There is the capacity to do that. In our society, you would opt-in to that. People aren't just going to start monitoring and following your cellphone. You would have to agree that that is OK.\n\nI think a lot of people would agree with that. People want to get through this. People are willing to pitch in. People want to know if they might have gotten somebody else sick. But there is a big \"if\" there. People also want their privacy.\n\nWith some of the most advanced technological solutions, you can really sort out a lot of who somebody's been in contact with purely through technology. I don't know that we're really in that scenario. I think we're probably in more of a mix, and a lot of the technology would just be about having a data system. So if I collect information about your contacts and then somebody is trying to do some follow-up somewhere else, like when you get tested, that quickly goes into a database that I as the contact tracer can instantaneously see and maybe even react so I can call while you're still there and talk to you.\n\nIs there the possibility for partnership across the levels of government on a strategy for contact tracing?\n\nYes, there definitely is. I suspect that what we'll end up with is a bit of a hybrid response. I think the federal government is already moving to begin to put together teams of more highly trained people who can help with this -- people who have public health backgrounds, who have epidemiology training, who really understand infection control. You don't need a lot of those people. They're really just running the system, but every state and local community is probably going to need a few of those people, and those people are going to be harder to find because they're highly trained.\n\nWe at ASTHO think the actual hiring and coordination of this larger workforce that is going to do the contact tracing makes more sense at the state or local level and is built into their existing infrastructure. We want to make use of the infrastructure that's there, and in our nation the public health system is state-based. If you come in with a federal approach, it's just going to be hard to get all that to work in the amount of time that we have.\n\nHas contact tracing been done in the U.S. on this scale before?\n\nWe've obviously not seen anything like COVID in this country ever, and who would have ever thought that people would have been asked to and would have complied with staying at home for a month now?\n\nThere are a couple of examples. First of all, about a year ago there were these big measles outbreaks in the Pacific Northwest and in New York state. That was all handled through contact tracing. We tamped that down very quickly. It never got out of control. But that was because there was a very good contact tracing system put into place and people identified who might be sick and this whole system fell into place, but in a very defined area.\n\nThe other example was the big Ebola outbreak in West Africa. At that point in time we were very concerned because people were still traveling back and forth from Africa to the United States. Every single person who came to the United States from any of those endemic countries, public health departments made contact with and monitored for a period of time to make sure they didn't get sick. That was across the entire nation, those were pretty significant numbers. It definitely taxed the public health system to be able to do that but we pulled it off with the number of people we had.\n\nNow obviously the numbers are way bigger in what we're dealing with now and we're going to have to have more people and train more people, but we're not starting from scratch.\n\nIs there anything else that would be important for readers to know?\n\nEverybody is going to be relieved when some of the social and physical distancing interventions get relaxed. Hopefully states are not going to relax too many things too quickly or we're going to get back into trouble.\n\nThe problem is, you finally get back to where you can start doing things that you want to do and the next thing you know, somebody calls you and says, \"Were you in contact with so-and-so?\" And you're like, \"Yeah, we hung out for 45 minutes, we had a really good chat.\" And then I tell you, \"Well, I'm really sorry but you're going to have to remain at home now either until you develop symptoms or you're going to have to just do 14 days to make sure that you don't.\"\n\nThat's going to be hard for people because they think finally they've been able to get back at it. There's going to be a significant number of people who are going to find themselves in that situation. Now, that's better than having everybody stay at home, which is what we're doing now. But people have to get ready for that, because I think for some people, it's going to be very disappointing that they thought they were in the clear and back to normal, and now they're being told, \"Well, it's not really any different than it was last week.\"\n\nI think if people are prepared for that, it will be OK. If that catches people by surprise, that's going to be more challenging.\n\nHow do you prepare people for the possibility they may have to quarantine again?\n\nBeing very, very clear on what the system is and what it means is helpful for people. Having trusted voices talking about this is helpful.\n\nI think there are a lot of governors and higher level state leadership, a lot of elected officials who gained the public's trust recently. They've really been out there trying to let people know what's going on. Governor [Andrew] Cuomo comes to mind.\n\nIf Governor Cuomo says, \"Hey, look, we've really got to do this,\" that's going to be effective. That's one of the things we've really been trying to message is that our leaders -- and it doesn't have to be an elected leader, it could be a faith-based leader, it could be your boss who you really respect, but people saying, \"We've got to do this and we're in this together,\" I think that'll really help people a lot.\n\nWe started to have some stuff put in place with the congressional acts. People have got to be able to be off work and have something, whether it's unemployment compensation, because otherwise they're stuck at home worried about how they're going to make ends meet. We've got to have unemployment or sick benefits for people, and that's got to be universal. Otherwise you're just asking too much of somebody.\n\nThe number one thing here is we want people to stay at home if we think they might have been in contact, but we must have people stay at home when they're sick now.\n\nWe're not used to doing that in this country. It's not our social norm. It's almost expected, you're kind of a wimp if you've got a cold and you don't come in. I'm a physician -- my profession is one of the worst. There's a very strong peer pressure that you don't not show up, because that means there's somebody else who has to carry the burden. We've got to change that.\n\nIf you're sick, we want you to stay at home and we will support you in staying at home. That's the right decision. That's going to require some changes in how we think about things.",

        "body": "Queen and Adam Lambert release music video honoring \"Champions\" of the coronavirus fight\n\nQueen and singer Adam Lambert have a message for workers on the frontline of the COVID-19 fight: \"You Are the Champions.\" Brian May, Roger Taylor and Lambert recently gathered virtually to record a new version of the Queen classic, \"We Are the Champions.\"\n\n\"You Are the Champions\" was released early Friday on all streaming and download services, with proceeds going to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.\n\n\"I thought, this is a great way to use the legacy that we have to do some good in the world,\" May said.\n\n\"You know, we don't really need to make money anymore. We don't need to be any more famous. We need to use what we have in the best possible way.\"\n\nFor May the release comes at a time of great sadness. The guitarist earlier this week lost a friend who he likened was like a brother to him, to the virus.\n\n\"That's the closest it's come to me physically,\" he said, adding it's given real meaning to the death tolls broadcast daily on TV.\n\n\"Each one of those is a family tragedy,\" May said. \"Each one of those people lose a loved one.\n\n\"I think psychologically the human race is going to be very damaged.\"\n\nFor Taylor, the song also has personal significance as his daughter Rory Eleanor Taylor works as a doctor in a London hospital.\n\n\"She's actually in the video with her little cards, displaying advice about isolating, etc.\"\n\nThe music video shows caregivers and frontline workers from across the world as well as empty city scenes and the band performing in their homes.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe or fatal illnesses, including pneumonia.",

        "body": "Quest Diagnostics is selling a direct-to-consumer antibody test that the coompany says will make it easy for people to check whether they may have been exposed to the coronavirus. After ordering the $119 test online, consumers must make an appointment at one of the 2,200 blood-draw centers Quest operates in the U.S.\n\nConsumers can receive the results in one to two days after a blood draw, the company said in a statement. The test is designed to shed light on whether Americans have antibodies to the virus, although Quest notes that it's unclear whether antibodies can provide protection against reinfection or how long any protection might last.\n\nEven as Quest rolls out the service, scientists have raised questions about the accuracy of antibody tests. On Friday, the World Health Organization noted that \"no study has evaluated whether the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity to subsequent infection by this virus in humans.\"\n\nStill, it's likely that many Americans will want to check whether they were exposed to the virus that's caused a global pandemic and led to nearly 60,000 deaths in the U.S.\n\n\"Quest is making it easy for people to access quality testing for antibodies to the virus which causes COVID-19, with access to physician interpretation and steering into needed care,\" said Jay Wohlgemuth, M.D., chief medical officer for Quest, in a statement.\n\nQuest cautioned that the test isn't intended for people who are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. As a result, consumers who suspect they have active infections may not visit the Quest blood-draw locations, the company said in the statement. Instead, they are \"strongly encouraged to contact their health care provider.\"\n\nPeople who have experienced symptoms of the disease shouldn't schedule a blood draw until they've been symptom-free for at least 10 days. Customers must also wear a face mask and pass a contact-less temperature check to get the blood draw, it added.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The American Civil Liberties Union, ACLU, is cautioning against the widespread use of technologies intended to detect fevers in people from a distance. The organization said in a report Tuesday the coronavirus pandemic has flooded the market with these devices, many of which produce unreliable readings.\n\nThe ACLU also said temperature screenings raise privacy issues.\n\n\"We don't want to wake up to a post-COVID world where companies and government agencies think they can gather temperature or other health data about people whenever they want,\" it said.\n\nAirports, stores and a number of other high-traffic locations have shown interest in using thermal devices as a safety measure to help reopen the economy. If a fever -- a common coronavirus symptom -- is detected, a business could require further screening or deny the person entry altogether.\n\nThe ACLU argued that \"temperature screening should only be done if, where, and in ways that public health experts believe will actually meaningfully contribute to combatting the pandemic.\"\n\n\"Currently, experts say that there are sharp limits to its potential usefulness in detecting COVID-19,\" it said.\n\nThe Food & Drug Administration has allowed thermal cameras to be used as unapproved fever detection devices, even though the agency considers them to be medical devices, according to the ACLU. The FDA cautioned, however, that readings from \"non-contact infrared thermometers,\" NCITs, can be disrupted by many factors, including head covers, environment and positioning on forehead.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, thermal cameras that are most accurate can cost two to four times as much as a typical $15,000 system, and are designed to scan only one person at a time, at close range while standing still.\n\n\"However, there is a veritable gold rush of companies scrambling to put 'fever detectors' on the market and cash in on the crisis. The result is accuracy levels that appear to be all over the map and a certain degree of snake oil,\" it wrote in its report.\n\nThe ACLU said false positives or negatives could create \"a false sense of security, lulling people into complacent sloppiness about more effective measures such as social distancing.\"\n\nAnd while fever is a common symptom of coronavirus infection, no one has a complete understanding of the disease, and fever can indicate numerous other illnesses, it said.\n\nThe ACLU urged people and regulatory agencies to \"skeptically scrutinize\" the use of any mass thermal screening devices.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, one manufacturer said it believes \"the demand for viable solutions like these will last far longer than most people think. Just like 9-11 and how it impacted and changed air-travel forever, this too will change the way we live and work for a long time to come.\"\n\nThe ACLU said that is \"precisely what (they) do not want to see.\"\n\n\"They should be adopted only where their accuracy, and thus their benefits against COVID-19, are reasonably high,\" it wrote. \"And where they are not likely to outlast the disease.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "They are our friends, our neighbors; people of renown, and just regular people. \"Sunday Morning\" takes a moment to remember just a few of the victims of the COVID-19 pandemic:\n\nRaymond Copeland (1973-2020)\n\nA member of \"New York's Strongest,\" sanitation worker Raymond Copeland raised three girls as a single father after the death of their mother. He and his fianc\u00e9e, Tameka Robinson, who also worked in the city's Sanitation Department, had planned to buy a house together. Copeland became the first Sanitation Department employee to die of coronavirus in New York City.\n\nA former school bus driver, Copeland grew ill after returning from a vacation in Aruba. His stepdaughter, Naeemah Seifullah, told The New York Times that his family planned to bring his ashes to the island.\n\nMike Huckaby (1966-2020)\n\nThe DJ and music producer was a pioneer in promoting techno artists in his native Detroit. While working as a buyer for a local record store, his superior taste in electronic, techno and house music extended his influence to international customers.\n\nHe also ran workshops and seminars. \"This was a quintessential quality of Mike: He was ready to teach anyone who would listen,\" DJ Daniel Bell told The New York Times.\n\nBelow: A Mike Huckaby \"strictly vinyl\" set at The Lab in New York City, 2019:\n\nLuis Sep\u00falveda (1949-2020)\n\nThe Chilean novelist and journalist was imprisoned for two-and-a-half years and tortured during the Pinochet dictatorship; he was later placed under house arrest, before escaping, finally landing in Ecuador. There, the former leader of the Communist student movement directed theatrical productions, and worked to raise literacy among Andean peasants.\n\nHe later joined a militant group in Nicaragua; traveled to Europe, where he worked as a journalist; and served as a crewmember on a Greenpeace ship, before settling in Spain.\n\nHe wrote more than a dozen novels and children's books (including \"The Old Man Who Read Love Stories\") and wrote or directed five shorts and feature films, including \"Nowhere,\" about a nation ruled by a dictator, starring Harvey Keitel.\n\nKaty and Emma Davis (c. 1983-2020)\n\nKay and Emma Davis were twin girls who lived together, who both became nurses, and who both contracted coronavirus.\n\n\"All they ever wanted to do was to help other people,\" their sister, Zoe, told BBC News. \"Ever since they were young ... they'd pretend they were doctors and nurses caring for their dolls.\"\n\nThey were among the more than 50 U.K. nursing staff members who have died from COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nJohn Pfahl (1939-2020)\n\nA graduate of Syracuse University School of Art, Pfahl worked as an assistant for advertising and architectural photographers, before teaching at the Rochester Institute of Technology. He then embarked on a career that captured nature in stirring landscape images that were by turns formal and whimsical.\n\nThe conventions of landscape photography were humorously upended with his series titled \"Picture Windows,\" for which he shot views through the windows of strangers' homes. \"While making my 'picture window' photographs, I came to think that every room was like a gigantic camera forever pointed at the same view,\" he wrote in an artist's statement. And what of the homeowners' reactions to his odd request? \"They expressed their desire to share their view with others, as if it were a nondepletable treasure,\" he wrote.\n\nSometimes the whimsy had a corrosive tint: nature cloaking the cloud-spewing stacks of power stations and nuclear plants, or the detritus of a compost pile.\n\nHis work is in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Modern Art; the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston; and the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, among others.\n\nMartin Douglas (1948-2020)\n\nA steel-pan drummer and mentor to fellow Brooklyn musicians, Martin Douglas was the founder of the Crossfire Steel Orchestra, and president of the United States Steelband Association. Born in Trinidad, he worked in the Metropolitan Transit Authority and was a respected union member. But his most noted imprint was musical, working to expand the popularity of steel-pan music.\n\n\"He would start playing any time -- it could be midnight, middle of the day, middle of the night,\" his youngest son, Jevon, told The New York Times. \"Sometimes you would get mad: 'Don't you see what time it is?' He would do it his way.\"\n\nAnn Sullivan (1929-2020)\n\nThe animation artist first joined Walt Disney's animation paint lab in the 1950s, before leaving to raise four children. But after returning to work at Hanna-Barbera and Filmation studios, Sullivan rejoined Disney, where she worked on such classics as \"The Little Mermaid\" and \"The Lion King.\"\n\nOther film credits include \"Cool World,\" \"Pocahontas,\" \"Hercules,\" \"Tarzan,\" \"Fantasia 2000,\" \"The Emperor's New Groove,\" \"Lilo & Stitch,\" and \"Treasure Planet.\"\n\nChaplain Dina Kuperstock, at the Motion Picture and Television Fund retirement home (where Sullivan resided), told the Hollywood Reporter that the woman nicknamed \"Giggles\" had the best laugh of any person she'd ever known: \"Ann didn't just laugh with a sound. When she giggled, her whole body would shake and light up with joy, and it was contagious for everyone in the room.\"\n\nJun Maeda (1941-2020)\n\nMaeda worked with experimental theater companies in his native Japan and, later, New York City, designing the sets of productions by such directors as Peter Brook, Thadeus Kantor, Ellen Stewart and Harvey Fierstein. The resident designer at La Mama Experimental Theatre Club, Maeda won the Obie Award in 1981.\n\n\"Maeda was one of a kind,\" director Andrei Serban told Deadline. \"Since he arrived at La Mama, soon after me, he seemed from the beginning a mystery man and somehow remained so and now took that mystery away with him. But no one was more dedicated, more modest, more unobtrusive. No one was more gifted ... He could have been one of the anonymous genius craftsmen who built the Pyramids.\"\n\nFred the Godson (1985-2020)\n\nThe DJ, rapper and lyricist (born Frederick Thompson) entered the Bronx rap scene in 2010, and the following year was named to the XXL Freshman Class list of rising stars. He would collaborate with such artists as Diddy, Lil' Kim, Pusha T, Mill, Jeremih, and \"SNL\" cast member Jay Pharoah.\n\nIdris Bey (1959-2020)\n\nA former Marine, Bey was an 27-year veteran of the New York City Fire Department, serving as an EMT and, later, an instructor. His ambulance was destroyed by the collapsing Twin Towers as he answered the calls on 9/11.\n\nA voracious reader, Bey was also a devout Muslim. And for nearly two decades he taught classes at the Fire Department's training academy. \"He was spontaneous, charismatic and hilarious,\" Sasha Gomez, a former student who later became an instructor, told The New York Times.\n\nTakuo Aoyagi (1936-2020)\n\nThe Japanese engineer (whose cause of death has not been announced) designed a device to measure and calculate blood oxygen levels, called a pulse oximeter. The device, which clips onto a patient's finger to measures oxygen levels in the blood, has become an indispensable medical tool, particularly important in helping diagnose coronavirus patients whose other symptoms might not be so easily detected.\n\nIn 2015 Aoyagi became the first Japanese recipient of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers' medal for innovations in health care technology.\n\nBruce Stern (1939-2020)\n\nA podiatrist who lived in West Orange, N.J., Bruce Stern was also a lifelong Yankees fan, an enthusiast of Sunday morning softball and tennis, and both a teacher and student at Fairleigh Dickenson University's FILL program for lifelong learning.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Carson city officials Monday opened the first COVID-19 testing site in Southern California that is free to all residents, including those who are asymptomatic, CBS Los Angeles reports.\n\n\"Whether you're rich or poor, you can be tested. Whether you're insured or uninsured, you can be tested. Whether you're a resident of Carson or a non-resident of Carson, you can be tested. But, the priority is Carson residents,\" said Carson Mayor Albert Robles.\n\nRobles said the free drive-through screening at the Congresswoman Juanita Millender-McDonald Community Center is not just for people who show symptoms.\n\nPeople who may have been exposed to the virus can also get tested. The mayor said the city council has been asking LA County for a testing site because of the high infection rate among its population.\n\n\"Latinos and African Americans are dying at a much higher rate. These two population groups are disproportionately impacted,\" said Robles.\n\nThe first step is to register online and get an appointment date and time. When residents show up, they need a valid ID. Once that's confirmed, they receive a testing kit and self-administer inside their car.\n\nTorrance resident Roland Nguyen said the whole process is quick and is grateful he's able to take the test.\n\n\"I just wanted to get tested to confirm if I have coronavirus. I have my mother living with us so I'm concerned. I don't have any symptoms whatsoever so this is like a peace of mind,\" he said.\n\nTest results are available 36 hours after testing.\n\nThe city of Carson partnered with U.S. Health Fairs, a Los Angeles-based non-profit, to open up this testing site at no cost to the patient or to the city.\n\nTesting is by appointment only.

    "States begin easing social distancing restrictions as nationwide debate rages": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Federal stay-at-home guidelines will expire on Thursday night as 35 states begin loosening social distancing restrictions. There is still a divide in this country about whether we are moving too quickly -- or not fast enough -- to reopen.\n\nSome restaurants are beginning to serve customers again. In other states, including New Jersey and California, there are increases in coronavirus infections and deaths.\n\nFor most of the day, California was bracing for the worst. After reports Governor Gavin Newsom would close all beaches statewide, he announced Thursday that the closures are targeted only in Orange County where there's the fourth-highest number of COVID-19 cases in the state and the sight of crowded beaches rang alarms.\n\n\"My job as governor is to keep you safe,\" Newsom said. \"And when our health folks tell me they can't promise that if we promote another weekend like we had, then I have to make this adjustment.\"\n\nLos Angeles County reported a record increase of more than 1,500 new cases on Wednesday. The City of Los Angeles is offering free COVID-19 tests to anyone, whether they have symptoms or not.\n\nNationwide, the debate on loosening restrictions continues. Anti-stay at home protesters -- even some who were armed -- marched on Michigan's state capital demanding the state reopen.\n\nBy Friday, at least 35 states will have relaxed their lockdowns, some allowing movie theaters and restaurants to open with capacity restrictions and retailers with limits on customers. Macy's said it will reopen 68 stores around the country, while NASCAR said it will restart races May 17, but without fans.\n\nYet, hotspots remain. At least four states saw single-day death records, including Illinois. Chicago surgical tech Juan Martinez was supposed to officially retire Thursday. He died Monday after testing positive three days after his 60th birthday.\n\nIn the COVID-19 epicenter of New York, deaths and hospitalizations continued to decline. The Navy hospital ship Comfort departed the city after treating 182 patients during its 30-day mission.\n\nOn Thursday, after heavy criticism of the homeless fleeing to the subways, the governor is shutting down overnight service for thorough cleaning. \"It makes sense if you don't want the infection rate to go up in your society,\" Governor Andrew Cuomo said.\n\nAt 12 a.m. Friday, Georgia's stay-at-home order will expire, but they are asking people at risk to stay home. And in California, a group that wants all restrictions lifted now is planning protests across the state Friday.\n\nNationwide, there are more than 1.067 confirmed cases of the virus, with nearly 63,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 4 million more Americans filed for unemployment in the last week alone, pushing the total number out of work past 30 million.\n\nThere is some new hope, though, about getting the pandemic under control. The president said he is launching an ambitious program to fast-track a vaccine by January -- something top experts say could be possible.",

Meanwhile, the World Health Organization is warning officials that they should not use these tests to provide so-called \"immunity passports.\"\n\nFinding out who has been exposed to the coronavirus has been identified as a key to reopening the country. But there are problems.\n\nThe WHO said there's no guarantee of immunity after infection but here in the U.S., medical experts overwhelmingly agree that the antibodies that remain give some level of protection.\n\n\"So the tests that we have now on the market ... Don't tell you individually whether you have the neutralizing antibodies, whether you have the antibodies that can prevent you from getting an infection again,\" CBS News medical contributor Dr. David Agus said.\n\nOf the more than 160 antibody tests flooding the market, the FDA has only given emergency authorization to seven.\n\nBioengineer Patrick Hsu from U.C. Berkeley and colleagues set out to see how many are accurate. Results so far are mixed.\n\n\"There are definitely some that are better than others,\" Hsu explained. \"We see out of the 10 we tested ... I think that's three that after two weeks were 90% positive.\"\n\nAlong with new symptoms, there are new clinical trials.\n\nThe Feinstein Institute at Northwell Health is quietly testing the acid reflux medication Pepcid, also known as famotidine, to see if it blocks the virus from replicating.\n\n\"We don't know if taking famotidine causes more harm than good,\" Dr. Kevin Tracey, president of the Feinstein Institute, told CBS News. \"We will be studying hundreds of patients who are hospitalized, receiving intravenous famotidine.\n\nResearchers are currently studying whether acid reflux medication helps treat the coronavirus. Right now, there's no evidence that it does. Doctors stress the potential dangers in misusing drugs -- prescription or over the counter. Bottom line: always consult your physician.",

    "Study shows cats can easily spread coronavirus to each other - here's what that means for cat owners": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A team of researchers studied the transmission of the coronavirus between cats and found that felines are capable of infecting each other with the virus. There have not been any known cases of a cat spreading COVID-19 to a person, but the scientists say it's possible felines could be \"a silent intermediate host\" for the virus, and they believe more research is needed.\n\n\"This is of particular importance given the potential for SARS-CoV-2 transmission between family members in households with cats while living under 'shelter-in-place' orders,\" they write in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday.\n\nThe research team, lead by Yoshihiro Kawaoka, professor of pathobiological sciences at the University of Wisconsin School of Veterinary Medicine, inoculated three cats with the virus, and then introduced three other uninfected cats to the group. In five days, three previously uninfected cats had caught the virus.\n\nThey note that none of the cats ever showed any signs of illness.\n\nThe researchers say recent reports of COVID-19 transmission from humans to pet cats and between big cats at the Bronx Zoo, coupled with their recent data, shows \"there is a public health need to recognize and further investigate the potential chain of human-cat-human transmission.\" Previous studies have shown that cats and ferrets are susceptible to the virus, but dogs less so.\n\nBoth Kawaoka and Peter Halfmann, a research professor at University of Wisconsin-Madison who helped lead the study, advise people with COVID-19 symptoms to avoid contact with cats. They also say cat owners should keep their pets indoors to limit the interaction their cats have with other animals and people.\n\n\"It's something for people to keep in mind,\" Halfmann said. \"If they are quarantined in their house and are worried about passing COVID-19 to children and spouses, they should also worry about giving it to their animals.\"\n\nWhile the cats in the study did not show any symptoms, a tiger at the Bronx Zoo tested positive for the virus last month after developing a dry cough and decrease in appetite. Zoo officials believe the tiger was likely infected by a human caretaker. Three other tigers and three African lions also developed symptoms and all were expected to recover, the zoo said.\n\nAccording to the CDC, there is still much to learn about this virus, \"but we know it is primarily spreading from person-to-person and it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations.\" The CDC has issued guidelines for pet owners regarding COVID-9.\n\nWhile the CDC says there is \"there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19,\" there have been instances where other viruses spread that way. In 2016, an H7N2 influenza outbreak in cats at a New York City animal shelter infected a veterinarian, a case that \"highlighted the public health implications of cat-to-human transmission to workers in animal shelters,\" according to the authors of the new study.\n\nThe researchers say that, given the need to stop the coronavirus pandemic, studying the role cats may play in the transmission of the disease to humans is needed.\n\nDr. Ann Hohenhaus, an internal medicine and small animal veterinarian at New York City's Animal Medical Center, spoke to CBS News about what the study means for pet owners.\n\n\"Is there a hard-and-fast study that says cats can absolutely not spread this to humans? No,\" said Hohenhaus, who was not part of the study. \"But we also have no evidence of the converse, which is that cats are spreading it to people. This study doesn't change that.\"\n\nHohenhaus said there are millions of people worldwide infected with COVID-19 but only a \"smattering of reports of cats.\" She also explained how cats could potentially catch the virus from humans but might not be able to transmit it back to them.\n\n\"How a virus works is that the virus gets to your body, and then your cells have to have a receptor that the virus plugs into, and then that receptor drags the virus into the cells,\" Hohenhaus said. \"So, it's kind of like an outlet and a plug on a cord: If you've got a three-prong cord and a two-prong outlet, then the virus won't get in. So, cats clearly have a receptor that matches the virus.\"\n\nHohenhaus also said cats might not replicate the virus in their cells as well as humans do. She explained that when people have a \"high viral load\" in their bodies, they appear to get sicker with COVID-19 than people with lower viral levels. \"So, since cats don't seem to get very sick, maybe they don't have a very high virus level. And therefore, they don't make enough virus in their cells that when they sneeze it back out their nose there's not enough virus to make people sick.\"\n\nIt's not unheard of for an animal to transmit a virus to humans, Hohenhaus said. However, she wants to remind pet owners that \"this new article highlights what veterinarians think, and that is: more research is necessary.\"\n\n\"It does not change our recommendation that if you are sick, social distance your pets, quarantine yourself away from everyone in the family -- that includes the pets,\" she continued. \"And if you've got COVID-19 and your pet is acting sick, please call your veterinarian and talk about what's going on so a safe plan for everyone can be made for your pet.\"",

    "The race to find a coronavirus vaccine: How other viruses put researchers ahead": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "More than 100 potential coronavirus vaccines are being tested at record speeds. Drugmaker Moderna got FDA approval last week to start a second round of clinical trials and Pfizer began human trials of its vaccine candidate in the U.S.\n\nKizzmekia Corbett, who leads the National Institutes of Health coronavirus vaccine collaboration with Moderna, told CBS News at the start of the outbreak in January that the SARS vaccine gave researchers a huge head start.\n\nIt would take just two months to bring their COVID-19 vaccine to human trials.\n\n\"We actually changed the genetic code for the spike protein based on our knowledge that we gathered from designing vaccines for other coronaviruses in the past,\" Corbett told CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook.\n\nThat spike protein is the key the coronavirus uses to unlock and invade a body's cells. Moderna's vaccine uses genetic material known as messenger RNA to instruct cells to make spike proteins that trigger an immune response to fight the virus.\n\nAs one of the first American volunteers for Moderna's trial, 61-year-old Carol Kelly received her first dose in late April. She was told a potential risk was that she might have flu-like symptoms.\n\n\"The ultimate bad symptom was I could get really, really sick,\" Kelly said.\n\nBut, with so many people suffering from the coronavirus, Kelly wanted to help.\n\n\"I thought, here is an opportunity that just presented itself and I need to do what I can,\" she said.\n\nAt Johnson and Johnson, researchers are using a different approach. They take a piece of coronavirus DNA and place it inside a weakened cold virus, triggering an immune response.\n\n\"We have used this so many times before that we know what we have to do in order to get very quickly to a vaccine,\" said Dr. Paul Stoffels, Johnson and Johnson's chief scientific officer.\n\nStoffels said the company can have 1 billion doses ready by next year.\n\nResponding to possible concerns that accelerating the vaccine timeline could jeopardize safety, Stoffels said, \"It's a biological vector, which has been used a lot in animals and in people ... from small kids to elderly, from people who are healthy to people who are very sick like an HIV, so we have been testing that in a very controlled way already.\"\n\nHarvard immunologist Dr. Barry Bloom said compressing the process does not mean safety measures are being cut.\n\n\"I don't think anybody is thinking about compromising in any manner, shape or form, but we will only know that after the initial safety studies when there's nothing obviously wrong,\" Bloom said.\n\nBut even if there is a successful vaccine by early next year, Bloom said it will likely take several years before enough people are immunized to create widespread protection.\n\n\"It's going to make a difference in two to three years, a real difference. And not just in the U.S., but hopefully in many other countries,\" he said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Way too many hospital visits during the coronavirus crisis have been a one-way trip. Dr. Michael Saag has seen it: \"The patient is dying alone. There is no family nearby,\" he said.\n\nSo has his son, Dr. Harry Saag: \"No question over the past two weeks I've had the hardest conversations I've ever had with families.\"\n\nBut that reality makes it all the more rewarding when a COVID patient is released - and, ultimately, joins the ranks of the \"recovered.\"\n\nSurviving this coronavirus is another thing this father-and-son have in common, after Harry unknowingly infected his dad.\n\n\"Both of us knew, you know, where the road could go if things go downhill,\" Harry said.\n\nCorrespondent Seth Doane - who himself had tested positive for coronavirus - asked Michael Saag, \"We are all part of this group now of 'coronavirus survivors.' How is it to be on the other side of this?\"\n\n\"First thing we feel is gratitude that we made it,\" Michael replied. \"And then the second thing is, from those video games, it's almost like, 'I have a cloak of invincibility!' But the truth is, we don't know that.\"\n\nDr. Saag has dedicated much of his career to studying AIDS at the University of Alabama, and sees questions about potential immunity through the lens of an infectious disease researcher. \"There are some viruses, like measles, mumps, rubella, that once you have it you don't get it again,\" he said. \"But there's other viruses, like Dengue fever, that you can not only get a second time, but the second time the infection and the disease is much worse.\"\n\nAs Doane found after battling the coronavirus for weeks, and finally testing negative more than a month later, initial relief gives way to a new set of questions.\n\nFiona Lowenstein, who was hospitalized for COVID-19 back in March, said, \"We don't even know anyone who's had this virus and survived, you know, six months down the line. So, we have no idea what it's gonna look like to have survived this virus a year out from getting it, or two years out.\"\n\nLowenstein started a support group for thousands of other coronavirus survivors.\n\n\"The number one kind of shared experience is that symptoms are lingering for a long time,\" she said. \"There are also a lot of people having similar mental health issues. There's a lot of people saying, 'My employer doesn't understand why I'm still not feeling well. My family doesn't understand. My friends don't understand, and I feel really alone.'\"\n\nSo, a recent article in The New York Times, featuring stories of emboldened survivors throwing dinner parties and traveling, left her wondering: \"I think that there were a lot of people who saw it and were like, 'Who are these superheroes that are doing this? 'Cause that's not me!'\" Lowenstein said.\n\nSurvivor Jacob Brown is still cautious after the virus took so much. \"I wear a mask all the time when I'm in public,\" he said. \"You know, my knuckles are still so dry from washing my hands all the time.\n\n\"I had, like, a part-time restaurant job. I lost that, obviously. But, yeah, then I got laid off from the full-time job.\"\n\nThis former New York software designer is now in North Carolina helping his family's struggling toy business. He's hoping that by donating blood and his antibody-rich plasma, some good can come from this.\n\n\"I have this rare opportunity to try and help with research or, you know, donate blood,\" Brown said.\n\n\"You see having had COVID-19 as a rare opportunity?\" asked Doane.\n\n\"If I can help, in some sort of way, save a life, I'm glad to do it.\"\n\nDr. Michael Saag is also donating blood plasma; and he and his son always suit up in full protective gear, when they each volunteer to help COVID-19 patients.\n\nDoane asked, \"Are you surprised that at this point we still know so little about this virus?\"\n\n\"No - it's kind of the opposite!\" he laughed. \"I'm stunned that we know so much as we do. Let's look at AIDS. AIDS first was described in early 1981. It wasn't until two-and-a-half years later that we found the cause, a virus. And it wasn't until a year after that that we had a test. And it wasn't until two or three years after that that we had our first drug. That's six years.\n\n\"We're less than six months into this.\"\n\nAnd while key questions about immunity remain, COVID survivor Dr. Saag is optimistic: \"My personal belief, as a researcher, a virologist, an infectious disease provider, and a former patient, I really believe that the antibody will be protective and people will not be re-infected. And that gives me hope for a vaccine.\"\n\n\"So, is it fair to say that there's a cautious sigh of relief, maybe?\" asked Doane.",

The cameras are used to scan temperature from a safe distance, and if a fever -- a common coronavirus symptom -- is detected, the company could require further screening or deny the person entry altogether.\n\n\"What we're seeing is there will be a new normal that will involve thermal screening as a frontline tool,\" Chris Bainter, director of global business development at FLIR Systems, told CBS News' Jericka Duncan. FLIR has been producing thermal imaging cameras since the SARS epidemic in 2003, when it gained widespread use in Asia.\n\nSince the outbreak, companies like Flexible Systems, Thermal Guardian, CrowdRx and many more have begun manufacturing the cameras for use in airports, healthcare centers and even apartment buildings in New York, where the pandemic has hit particularly hard.\n\nA store in Georgia, City Farmer's Market, has already set up thermal imaging cameras to scan customers as they enter the store.\n\nIf a customer's temperature is above 100.4 degrees, they are given a flyer that asks them to leave to protect others, and offers that the store does their shopping for them.\n\n\"The key is that application is not about an absolute temperature measurement. It's more about detecting those individuals with elevated body temperature higher than the last 10 people that had been screened,\" Bainter explained.\n\nBainter, who predicted the camera could play \"a critical role\" in reopening the economy, dismissed any privacy concerns or worries that this specific technology could be a gateway to \"surveillance culture.\"\n\n\"If you've seen a thermal image... you can't really detect exactly who that individual is,\" he said. \"We aren't really focused on collecting data of any sort, it's more about as a screening tool.\"\n\nHowever, he cautioned the screening tool \"doesn't detect coronavirus,\" and called for further precautions to be taken before businesses could be deemed safe.\n\n\"Thermal solutions for elevated body temperature are only one part of what needs to be a comprehensive environment health and safety program for these businesses,\" Bainter said.",

        "body": "This Florida man thought coronavirus was a \"fake crisis\" until he was hospitalized with it. Now, he's warning others.\n\nA Florida man who initially downplayed the coronavirus crisis is now warning others to take it seriously after he and his wife were hospitalized with the virus. Brian Hitchens documented his battle with the coronavirus on Facebook after admitting he had previously considered it a \"fake crisis\" that was \"blown out of proportion.\"\n\nThe rideshare driver said in early April that he was observing safety guidelines during the pandemic but wasn't afraid of the virus itself. \"I'm honoring what our government says to do during this epidemic but I do not fear this virus because I know that my God is bigger than this Virus will ever be,\" he wrote.\n\nIn another post on May 12, he reflected on how his life and views about the pandemic started to change soon after.\n\n\"Many people still think that the Coronavirus is a fake crisis which at one time I did too and not that I thought it wasn't a real virus going around but at one time I felt that it was blown out of proportion and it wasn't that serious,\" he wrote. \"I still thought it was being blown out of proportion until about 4 and 1/2 weeks ago when I started to feel sick.\"\n\nHe developed symptoms and stayed home -- and then his wife Erin fell ill, too. After a few days, he wrote, their condition started to get worse. Hitchens said he had \"had just enough energy\" to drive them to Palm Beach Gardens Medical Center, where they were both taken to the ICU.\n\n\"I started feeling better within a few days but my wife got worse to the point where they sedated her and put her on the ventilator,\" he wrote. \"As of today [May 12] my wife is still sedated and on the ventilator with no signs of improving.\"\n\nAccording to the post, his wife of eight years suffered from different physical ailments and doctors told him they were having a tough time improving her condition.\n\n\"I have come to accept that my wife may pass away... but I also do believe in miracles and I'm holding on to the chance that she may get healed,\" he wrote.\n\nIn two more posts over the next few days, he thanked the doctors and nurses \"that are working so hard to try and help my wife get better\" and asked people to \"keep praying for her.\"\n\nHitchens also reflected on not wearing a mask early on during the coronavirus pandemic and urged others to not follow his example.\n\n\"Looking back I should have wore a mask in the beginning but I didn't and perhaps I'm paying the price for it now,\" he said. \"So just think about what I said and if you have to go out please use wisdom and don't be foolish like I was so the same so the same thing won't happen to you like it happened to me and my wife.\"\n\nOn Monday, he posted an update addressed to \"all you haters out there\" who had sent him \"nasty messages\" -- \"I AM NEGATIVE\"! \"PRAISE THE LORD!\" he wrote.",

    "Thousands of \"Dreamers\" are health care workers on the front lines - but fear they could soon face deportation": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Thousands of \"Dreamers\" are health care workers on the front lines - but fear they could soon face deportation\n\nLorena Espinoza de Pi\u00f1a is one of America's front-line health care workers, risking their lives and the health of their family in the fight against the coronavirus. She is also a \"Dreamer,\" brought to the U.S. as a child by undocumented immigrant parents, whose future remains uncertain.\n\nAcross the United States, about 27,000 health care workers like her are in legal limbo as they anxiously await a decision by the Supreme Court on the program known as DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. If the court sides with the Trump administration, they could be deported.\n\nEspinoza de Pi\u00f1a is a 26-year-old registered nurse who has been working on the neuro floor of SSM Health in the St. Louis, Missouri, area for three years. She mainly works with stroke and seizure patients, but since the coronavirus outbreak began she has been rotating on the isolation floor tending to COVID-19 patients.\n\n\"I've been exposed. Luckily I'm fine because it was a couple days ago. I haven't been feeling any symptoms or anything, but it's just scary,\" she said.\n\nHer health isn't her only worry. The Supreme Court is expected to decide sometime in the next few weeks -- by June at the latest -- whether to end the DACA program, created by the Obama administration in 2012, which allows undocumented \"Dreamers\" like her to study and work without the constant fear of having immigration officers turning up at their doors. The Trump administration is set on ending the program, and could begin deporting DACA recipients if the court clears the way.\n\n\"I'm exposing my life every day and exposing myself. I'm exposing my family, people around me, you know, and it's like they don't see that. They don't value that,\" Espinoza de Pi\u00f1a told CBS News in regards to the administration wanting to end the program.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court granted a motion to allow a supplemental brief after oral argument, filed by DACA recipient plaintiffs who argue that terminating DACA during a national emergency would be \"catastrophic,\" since DACA recipients make up a large number of essential health care providers on the front lines battling COVID-19.\n\nThe motion urges the court to consider \"the significant adverse consequences\" of terminating DACA for health care and other essential service providers and all those who \"rely on and benefit from the work of DACA recipients.\"\n\nJos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, the national communications manager at United We Dream, said the immigration network, which was instrumental in pushing for DACA in 2012, is concerned that if the Supreme Court were to side with the Trump administration, recipients would lose their work permits and ability to work. He warned that would \"put a strain on so many of the systems that are really overwhelmed in the middle of this pandemic.\"\n\nMu\u00f1oz also noted that such a decision would have dire consequences for families who have been living in the U.S. for a large portion of their lives.\n\n\"While some of the immediate consequences are obviously losing a work permit, there is also the very real reality of the potential for deportation and another wave of family separation for DACA recipients and their families,\" he said.\n\nFrancisco Javier Matias is 27 and works as medical assistant at two clinics in Seattle, evaluating patients for COVID-19 both in person and via video. He sees up to 14 patients a day, with the risk of potentially infecting himself and his family.\n\n\"I'm helping people that are not DACA recipients here in the United States through my job. And there is definitely that fear, if this DACA gets to end and I'm like, so all of these years here have been for nothing -- or probably my time and my health and my family's health that I am putting at risk right now,\"he said.\n\nMatias came to the United States when he was 11 years old with his parents and two other siblings from Oaxaca, Mexico. He fears that with the end of DACA, he and his parents and two out of his three siblings who were also born in Mexico could be sent back to a country where he doesn't feel like he belongs.\n\n\"Seattle is my home. I feel like being here, it's like a safety net. It's a safe place to be a part of. I'm also an LGBTQ person. So it kind of makes me feel safe,\" he said.\n\nEspinoza de Pi\u00f1a says the possibility of DACA ending is something she thinks about every day.\n\n\"I have two kids. They're both U.S. citizens here. I would lose my family. I would lose, you know, my license, probably -- I wouldn't be able to take care of patients. I would go to a country that I barely remember.\"\n\nAlso a student trying to finish her bachelor's degree with aspirations of one day becoming a nurse practitioner, Espinoza de Pi\u00f1a wonders why DACA recipients can't be offered a path to something more permanent.\n\n\"We receive DACA. But, you know, we're also giving back a lot ... helping, taking care of these patients, being there with these patients, because they're there by themselves. They're in this scary virus that they don't know if they're going to come out of the hospital alive or dead.\"",

    "Tiny blood clots may make coronavirus more deadly, doctors say": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The COVID-19 coronavirus appears to promote blood clotting throughout the body, which might help explain why it is so much more deadly than other members of its viral family, experts say.\n\nSome people severely ill with COVID-19 develop blood clots in their lungs and other major organs, doctors have observed.\n\nDoctors suspect these small blood clots are one reason why COVID-19 patients struggle for breath, said Dr. Hooman Poor, a pulmonary and critical care doctor with Mount Sinai Beth Israel in New York City.\n\n\"We see not just the possibility of blood clots in the lungs,\" Poor said. In COVID-19 patients who require dialysis because of kidney failure, \"their catheters are clotting off every second.\"\n\nThese tiny blood clots could also be responsible for one of the unique symptoms of COVID-19: a sudden loss of smell, said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a professor of infectious diseases with the University of Alabama at Birmingham. It also might explain why patients who seem to be doing well suddenly crash.\n\nClotting associated with COVID-19 is so pronounced that \"some people are beginning to say, 'Look, anybody that comes to the hospital needs to be put on'\" blood thinners at the start of their treatment, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, a professor of infectious diseases at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nPoor recently treated five critically ill COVID-19 patients with tPA, a clot-busting drug normally used on stroke patients, according to a new preliminary case report from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.\n\nThe five patients had respiratory failure early in their disease, along with blood oxygen levels and clot-related protein markers that indicated that lung blood clots could be robbing them of breath, Poor and his colleagues noted.\n\n\"The first patient I gave it to had a dramatic, immediate response, indicating that blood clots were definitely playing a role in why she was so sick at that time,\" Poor said.\n\nAll five showed immediate improvements in their blood oxygen levels, but ultimately they did not have good outcomes, Poor said.\n\nHowever, he believes more research is needed before regularly treating COVID-19 patients with either blood-thinning or clot-busting drugs.\n\n\"These are both very dangerous medicines,\" Poor said. \"It would be a shame to administer these medicines inappropriately and then have a bad outcome, like a catastrophic bleed.\"\n\nPoor and his colleagues suspected that blood clots might be contributing to people's acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) because the lungs of COVID-19 patients do not develop the kind of stiffness usually seen in other viruses that hamper breathing.\n\n\"When you have these abnormalities in oxygen and carbon dioxide with lungs that are not particularly stiff, the first thing that jumps to mind is there's something wrong with the blood vessels of the lungs,\" Poor said.\n\nOthers have also observed clots with COVID-19. Dutch researchers found that about a third of 184 patients in intensive care with coronavirus had a complication associated with a clot -- in the lungs or the legs, or even as severe as a clot-caused stroke or heart attack, according to their report in the April 10 Thrombosis Research.\n\nLung blood clots usually occur because a large blood clot in the leg -- a deep vein thrombosis -- breaks free and travels up into the lungs, Marrazzo said.\n\nBut it's not unusual for viruses to promote blood clots, del Rio said. For example, HIV can promote clotting in patients.\n\nWhy the new coronavirus might promote blood clotting is still up for debate.\n\nPoor and Marrazzo speculated that the virus somehow damages human cells in a way that promotes clotting. Poor noted that COVID-19 patients have elevated levels of D-dimer, a small protein fragment produced by blood clots.\n\nAnother recent study in the journal Physiological Reviews noted that people with already high levels of plasmin, a key enzyme that breaks down blood clots, tend to have more severe COVID-19 infection.\n\nPlasmin appears to help the novel coronavirus more readily bind with human cells, said lead researcher Dr. Hong-Long Ji, a professor of cellular and molecular biology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Tyler.\n\nIf this is true, then using clot-busting drugs to treat COVID-19 might backfire by enhancing the patients' infection, Ji said.\n\n\"If you give the patient plasmin or other kinds of proteins to remove the clots, then the problem is this patient still has a virus in their body and they also have a problem with bleeding in every kind of important organ,\" Ji said.",

    "Transcript: Dr. Michael Osterholm speaks with Michael Morell on \"Intelligence Matters\"": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In this episode of \"Intelligence Matters,\" host Michael Morell speaks with top infectious disease epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm, who is also director of the Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Minnesota, about the world's past, present and future handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Osterholm and Morell discuss the essential, still unanswered, questions surrounding vaccine and antiviral production and their manufacturing and distribution to the cities and countries that need them most. Osterholm explains why this virus is unlike any predecessor, and why so many mysteries about its transmission remain. He also explains how China's early handling of the outbreak may or may not have affected the effectiveness of other countries' responses. \"Intelligence Matters\" has dedicated a series of episodes to understanding the fundamentals and national security implications of COVID-19.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDr. Osterholm, welcome to Intelligence Matters. It is great to have you. I know you're extremely busy, so we appreciate you taking the time with us. I'd love to start with a paper that your institute published on April 30th titled, \"The Future of the Kovik 19 Pandemic. Lessons Learned from Pandemic Influenza.\"\n\nI'm going to ask you a couple of questions about that paper? Why did you choose to look for lessons in past influenza pandemics rather than in past coronavirus outbreaks?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM:\n\nWell, first of all, thank you, Michael, it's great to be with you today. There are actually several reasons for why we did this. Number one, is let's just take coronaviruses in general and the family of coronaviruses, which, of course, the SARS-CoV-2 is one member.\n\nIt turns out that the two models that we have looked at in the past with coronaviruses are ones of a seasonal type of virus. Ones that typically cause a common cold or in one instance, it can cause some pneumonia. And those are, in fact, seasonal only and not one that at all mimics what we're seeing with the current coronavirus. The second model is the SARS and MERS version. This severe acute respiratory distress syndrome, which first emerged in China in the fall of 2002, made its way out of China by the Guangdong Province into Hong Kong in 2003 and this spread around the world. MERS, which emerged in 2012 on the Arabian Peninsula and again, has continued to be a problem in that area with humans.\n\nIn both instances, those diseases were very different. Number one, is while the SARS disappeared from - you might say temporarily at least, we hope - in terms of the disease problems because we recognize what the animal reservoir was, where the source of the virus in the markets of Guangdong province and those were eliminated. And then humans that turned out were really most infectious in day five, six or seven of their illness, not earlier. And so once we understood that, we can identify potentially infected individuals, isolate them and really bring transmission to zero, and that eventually resulted in the elimination of SARS as we know it.\n\nMERS is a bit more complicated because that virus actually is in dromedaries or camels. There's about one point seven million camels on the Arabian Peninsula. No one is going to put down camels like that. And so the virus continues to pain humans on the Arabian Peninsula. But again, like SARS, one is not infectious really till the fifth or sixth day. And so by early identification of patients, we get them isolated and again, stop ongoing transmission.\n\nWith the virus we're dealing with now, the SARS-CoV-2, it appears to have taken on many of the properties of influenza. One is likely most infectious before onset of symptoms and maybe in the first day or two of illness. And that is very much like flu in that regard, in that you're not going to stop it the same way you would MERS or SARS, because it's got later transmission.\n\nThe way that it began transmission in Wuhan and Hubei province was very much like influenza with relatively high transmission of anyone infected, individuals to others. And so we immediately began to think of it like influenza.\n\nBased on that concept or model, our group actually called it on January 20th and said that this was likely going to be a worldwide pandemic, that the transmission would be very much like influenza, and that by late February, early March, you'd see it around the world. And, of course, that's exactly how it unfolded.\n\nBut now we're at a point where the question is, will it be like previous influenza pandemics going forward as a coronavirus? And that's where the paper that we've published from our center was really all about. It was saying, if it's like an influenza pandemic, we would expect to see activity around the world potentially in this first wave, it would be sporadic, meaning it would occur in some locations, not others. And some of the locations that did occur could be serious, like we saw in New York and places like Italy, but that it wouldn't occur widely.\n\nAnd unfortunately, so far, this virus has been acting like that. And so we surely can consider the possibility that it might then therefore over the summer actually begin to become much less of a problem like we would see with an influenza pandemic within this large wave that would occur five to six months or later after introduction. And that's what we worry about.\n\nSo we added to other models and said if it's not influenza, what might it look like? And we said, what if it's just a whole series of kind of smaller outbreaks that just keep occurring over and over again or that it is a virus that's just a slow burn. But the key underlying feature, all of these models or scenarios, is that we are currently in this country somewhere between five to 20 percent of the population are infected. Only in very few locations is it as high as 20 percent like New York. Most of the countries have five percent. For this virus to develop what we call herd immunity, where there's enough transmission in the population with people becoming infected and develop what, we hope, is long term immunity - we don't know that yet. It takes 60 to 70 percent of the population for that to happen with before the virus transmission will slow down. Now, we can get there also by vaccine, but I think none of us at this point are going to make that assumption, at least for the next 12 months, that we're going to have a vaccine.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, Doctor, are the total number of deaths roughly the same in your three scenarios? And do you all have a sense of what that total is going to look like by the time we get to the end of this thing?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM:\n\nWell, I think the first thing to do is just to add perspective for those who may doubt that this is a serious challenge.\n\nWhen you think about in the last hundred years, this virus has done something that no other disease has done since 1918 and the major Swine Flu pandemic of 1819 and 1820. Some sixty five days ago, this virus, SARS-CoV-2, was not even in the top 100 causes of death in this country. Within short order, it became the number one cause of death in this country. No other diseases have done that. This is remarkable. And so, yes, at the outset, we have to understand this is a real problem.\n\nIn terms of how we get to that 60 or 70 percent, as I mentioned a moment ago, if we have a vaccine that can shortcut getting to that number and higher with a vaccine, then obviously we're going to reduce the number of cases or deaths. But if not, we have to anticipate that those 60 to 70 percent of people will include a lot of deaths.\n\nWell, how many? Well, right now we're seeing increased number of deaths, particularly in what we call people with high risk co-morbidities, meaning underlying heart disease, kidney disease, certain blood cancers, certain lung cancers, and, of course, being overage. And then one that is more unique to the United States than it was, for example, in China, is obesity.\n\nAll of these play a role in what the actual mortality rate is or how many people die from this virus. You'll see lots of debates about, is it 1 percent or 0.1 percent, whatever. None of us know. I can only say that if you look at just a population of the United States and say, 330 million people, if let's say 50 percent get infected, which is lower than actual herd immunity, you're now talking about 165 million people. That's a lot of infections.\n\nIf you look at that population and just take what we have now for understanding of the clinical disease and these are data combined from China, from what we saw in Europe and what we see in the United States today is about 80 percent of those people will actually have very mild to hardly noticeable illness. If the remaining 20 percent of that 165 million, if you look at that, about 10 percent will seek medical care, but not need hospitalization. About 10 percent or half of that will need hospitalization. So now you're talking about 16.5 million people.\n\nOf that 5 percent that will need not just hospitalization, but intensive care medicine, of that anywhere from 1.5 percent to 1 percent will die, or basically somewhere in the neighborhood of 800,000 to about 1.6 million people. That's where the number comes down by the time this thing is over with.\n\nNow, hopefully with drug therapies that could become available before then, that could reduce the mortality rates. That would be great. Again, we can't count on that yet. And this gives you a sense of potential - We're seeing it when you look at what's happened. I mean, again, come back to that 5 to 20 percent with most of the country in the 5 percent. Think how much suffering, pain and death, as well as economic disruption has occurred with just 5 to 20 percent of the population impacted. And you can see that just even given the number of guests today, you know, well over 70,000 and marching north quickly, that at that 5 to 15 percent, that's not a hard stretch to imagine what it might be like if, in fact, you know 165 million people get infected.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, Doctor, you have a 18 to 24 month timeline to get to herd immunity. And I'm wondering what that timeline assumes about shutdowns and social distancing. And I'm wondering if we end up doing more social distancing. Could that push that 18 to 24 month timeline out even further?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM\n\nYou know, Michael, we're really in this kind of, you might say, guard rail situation where on one side we're talking about locking down the country, much like was done in China with Wuhan and Hubei province. Which I think we all agree would be almost a death toll for society as we know it. It would be a major challenge. And I don't think sustainable for 18 months or more.\n\nOn the other side, you have if we do nothing, this virus will run rampant. It will basically threaten our health care system. We know that many, many deaths -- and in addition, not just among those with this virus infection, but people who have heart attacks, strokes, etc, who can't get medical care because our health care system is literally down.\n\nIn addition to that, the number of health care workers who will continue to be exposed and develop infection as a result of their work will only grow in leaps and bounds. So if you have those two extremes and we say, 'Well, you know what? Those are not going to work, either one.' We have what I think is this middle ground, what I consider threading the rope through the needle, where basically, 'How do we release society back into its everyday life by minimizing the number of people who might have severe disease, people who will go on to be more, much more likely to die?'\n\nUnfortunately, about 40 percent of our population of adults have either heart disease, renal disease, have had one of these cancers or are obese. And that's a challenge. So we're trying to figure that out because, again, we can't live on either guardrail. And so the question is, what will happen if we put social or I like to call physical distancing in place, is that we have to figure out how do we integrate with people at the lowest risk of having infection back in society. Once they get infected, if they have durable immunity, meaning it's going to last for more than a couple of weeks, that's a great way to slow down transmission because they no longer can get infected if they're exposed, and they will no longer transmit to others.\n\nAnd so we don't know how we'll get to that 60 or 70 percent in terms of can we change the outcome of deaths so we don't let people who, in that 60 or 70 percent get infected represent the population of at-risk people for severe disease. Or is that just going to be impossible? Will we regardless end up infecting many? And we just don't know.\n\nI think the thing that if I had to leave your listeners with, one very important point, this virus acts under a very, what I would say, is essential law of physics, and that is viral gravity, just like physics, gravity. If you drop a book, you'll hit the floor. This virus is going to keep going. It's going to keep being transmitted by people until it basically runs out of people to infect and until there are so many people who have been previously infected that they're like rods in the virus transmission reaction. We slow that down and that's what herd immunity gives us. So we just have to count on this virus continuing to transmit.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nOne last question, Doctor, about the virus itself, and that's -- looking out even further, what happens to the virus and the disease on the other side of that 18 to 24 months? On the other side of the pandemic. We we hear that over time, the virus will evolve to be less virulent, less deadly. Is that true? If so, how does that happen? How long does it take? I guess what I'm asking is even after herd immunity drops the case load, you know, significantly. Are we looking at a future in which this virus is as deadly as the one today? And will it remain a mortal threat to those people with vulnerabilities, or is it going to evolve?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM\n\nWell you are asking the multitrillion dollar question, and there are several issues there that we don't yet understand that are critical to giving you a final and correct answer. Number one, will the virus mutate or change and become less of a risk, meaning that it's a milder disease?\n\nWe don't know that. We don't have an experience like that would occur with a coronavirus. If it were flu, I can surely say yes that would happen. But that doesn't mean that it would go away, it becomes a seasonal flu virus and can still kill many thousands of people every year, even during the flu season. With the coronavirus, we're just in uncharted territory. We have to admit we don't know.\n\nSecond of all, can we make a vaccine against it? Will, in fact, what we can do actually cause individuals to develop immunity. And then how durable is that immunity? Does it last for a long time? Is it highly protective? We don't know that. We don't also know a third piece, which is. 'If I get infected with the virus, will I develop that same durable immunity that I might get from a vaccine? And if so, how long does it last? How protective is it?'\n\nSo we just have to be honest and say we don't know these answers yet. We have data in a limited way suggesting, number one, that there is at least short-term immunity. People get better. So your body must be fighting off the virus, and some successfully.\n\nNumber two is we've had several animal studies done where certain monkey species, which mimic what we see in humans in terms of infection and disease have been given the virus. They've recovered after having been ill and then they've been challenged again and they were protected. The same thing is true with two of the vaccines that are being evaluated right now. The monkeys were vaccinated and then subsequently they were challenged with the virus and they showed protection. So that's good news. But the long and short of it is we don't know how long that protection might last and what it means.\n\nSo to say what it's like on the other end, you have laid out a very important scenario that we all don't want to think about, but must think about it. And that is, 'What if we can't get long term protection? What if this virus doesn't change and become a more muted or a virus that doesn't causes severe disease?' And we just don't know what the answers are to those yet. But they're absolutely critical questions we have to have answered.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, Doctor, maybe we can keep with the vaccine theme here. How do you think about a vaccine from the perspective of of actually getting to one? And then how long that would take? What's your sense?\n\nDR. MICHARL OSTERHOLM\n\nWell, there's actually a series of steps here that all are critical, and if all of them are not in place, we don't have a successful vaccine.\n\nNumber one is we have to figure out, with the more than 100 vaccine candidates we have today that represent different kinds of vaccines. Do any of them work? And what do I mean by work? Well, that's a challenge because we haven't really defined that yet. And what if we get a vaccine that only protects about 20 percent of the people? Is that one we're going to make and distribute worldwide?\n\nSurely it's better than nothing. But is that an international enterprise that will roll? What if we get a vaccine that, of course, protects people 95 percent of the time, but we're not sure if it's long term immunity? We'll have to figure that out or we might be back that vaccinating people literally every year like we do for influenza.\n\nThe second piece, after if we get that, we still have to show that it's safe. And there are challenges with this kind of a virus vaccine, because we know that coronaviruses in general and specifically the SARS virus from 2003 actually can cause a condition when you're vaccinated for that virus and you get infected with the real virus, of what we call \"antibody dependent enhancement.\"\n\nThis is a condition where you make a little bit of antibody as a result of the vaccine, and then you get infected, you may get this over-vigorous immune response enhancement kind of picture that can cause a shock-like condition and actually can be fatal. We saw that with the vaccine several years ago, a new one that had come out that caused children in the Philippines who were vaccinated to actually have very severe life-threatening infections, literally because of the vaccine. That vaccine obviously is not on the market anymore.\n\nSo we have to be certain that this vaccine is safe also. And how much safety will we demand of the vaccine is a question as to, well, what's the other side of the coin with the number of deaths that the disease itself will cause? So if we have a vaccine that one out of 100,000 people have a bad event with it, we surely may decide to go for it. This is still a much, much better option than X percent of people getting this infection and dying.\n\nThe other challenge we have, which we haven't really addressed yet at all, is critical. And that is how will this vaccine be manufactured and distributed? So let's just say we have a vaccine in the United States or we have one in China ore have one in Europe. If, in fact, the first parties to get these vaccines and get them made, how are they going to share the vaccine? Are they are they going to make it available to low and middle income countries? if China gets a vaccine first, will the U.S. have access to that?\n\nIf we get a vaccine first, will we share with the Chinese and Europeans? I can guarantee you that we will not have nearly enough in the earliest years, not just days of this pandemic, just in terms of manufacturing, distribution.\n\nAnd so we need to come up with an international scheme that we all buy into that says this is how the vaccine that will made and distributed.\n\nAnd then even within a country, we need to decide who gets it first. For example, in the United States, I could very strongly argue that the first group of people that should get this vaccine are health care workers. They're putting their life on the line every day, trying to provide the care to these patients and putting themselves at risk. Well, if we say health care workers are first in line, I can tell you there'll be a general outcry from many in the public saying, 'Wait a minute, they're taking care of their own first. That's not right.'\n\nAnd so many medical, legal, ethical issues that are going to come up around this have to be addressed. Now, I don't want to see us get to a point where we have a vaccine, we can make it, and as the vial comes off the machine, we have no idea how or where it's going to be used. And we're going to be in a debate with that for some time. That would be really a truly tragic situation.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nJust one more quick question on on a vaccine. Are there differences between vaccine development for influenzas and for coronaviruses that make the latter more or less challenging?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM:\n\nWell, in fact, there are substantial differences between what we do currently for influenza vaccine and for coronavirus vaccine. Within the influenza vaccine area, we actually have really two large categories of vaccines. One is what we call egg-based production. We're actually growing the virus in chicken eggs and then harvesting that virus and then adding it to our vaccines.\n\nThe second one is where it's grown from the cell culture, meaning much like we do other traditional vaccines. And in some cases, there are things called adjuvants, chemicals to boost the response. There are different kinds of presentations. So that's the case there. We also have a number of different ways that we're looking at with regard to coronavirus. And one of the key ways that's being done right now is actually inserting genetic material into the hole, which is the vaccine.\n\nAnd actually that genetic material then gets inside the human cells and it produces part of the virus in a way that that's what induces the immune response -- is to the actual particle production by your own cells in your body.\n\nSo that's one way, there's other ways that also being looked at that represent, you know, really the cutting edge of new modern vaccines. One day we hope the flu vaccine improves and gets to a similar place. So, yes, there are differences and the experimentation we're doing right now with the vaccines and the coronavirus are really very, very critical because they're not only going to teach us about what we can do with the coronavirus, but even modernizing all of our vaccine production one day down the road.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, Doctor, thoughts on antiviral development?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM:\n\nRight. If we can't get a vaccine. Of course, the next best thing is let's hopefully reduce the severity of disease and of course, deaths.\n\nNow, one of the challenges we have with this virus infection that I mentioned earlier is that people are most infectious, literally in the days before they become ill, if they become ill at all, right up and through the earliest stages of illness. And that is what's driving the pandemic, that kind of transmission.\n\nSo we don't expect a drug to have any impact on that. So in other words, the cases will continue to occur. The point being, though, is among those who become ill, who is it that's going to more likely become seriously ill and then ultimately die? If we can find a drug that can be given to patients early on in their illness, that prevents them from becoming severely ill or dying, that would be still a major, major game changer.\n\nAnd so that's what we're working on right now, are drugs like that. Now - the disease is very complicated. The more we learn about it, the more we realize how little we know about it. And there appears to be two totally different parts of this virus infection picture that have to be considered. One is the growth of the virus itself. And clearly, that's what we talk about, when we talk about antiviral drugs, we're trying to hold down that virus reproduction as if that's the primary reason why we're sick.\n\nBut we also have increasing data that it's also the immune response to the host. One of the key components is what we call acute respiratory distress syndrome, ARDS, which is an immune response that basically causes the shock-like picture in the individual. As well as we're seeing now, a type of inflammation, particularly inside of the blood vessels, which again, is an immune response that is actually causing blood clots to form and strokes to happen.\n\nSo the drug picture really is pursuing two totally different approaches. One is trying to deal with the virus itself, and one is trying to reduce the negative impact of the human immune response. What we'll have eventually, we don't know. And again, as I've shared with the vaccine itself, we also have to understand, when treatments do become available, if they do, how will they be distributed globally, how they can be distributed in the United States.\n\nIn the earliest days of the first drug that we've seen, come forward as a possible drug there've been great challenges in how it's been distributed. A lot of outcry from hospitals that they did not have access to the drug when others did. And so, again, we have the same challenges with drug manufacture and distribution we're going to have with a vaccine.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, Doctor, kind of maybe this is an unfair question, but maybe the bottom line on vaccines and antivirals, should we be optimistic or pessimistic? What's your sense of the probability that we will get something in terms of a vaccine or an antiviral that will significantly shorten that 18 to 24 month time period that you're talking about?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM:\n\nWell, first of all, it's not an unfair question; we're all asking the same question ourselves. So let me just say I hope we have both and soon, but we both also realize that's not a strategy.\n\nAnd so I think that the likelihood of finding antivirals and immune suppressing drugs that will be helpful is real. I think we're going to find some of those. The question is, how much impact will they have? How many patients will actually have access to these drugs?\n\nI can assure you that most of the world will not, because what's going to happen is going to occur largely in the next 12, 18 months, and just ramping up production of the drug and making it available worldwide would take far, much more time than that that we have. So I'm more optimistic on this side of the house. But again, I don't know how much impact it might have or not have.\n\nAs far as vaccines, the same is true. As I mentioned, we have data from at least early vaccine studies in subhuman primates, monkeys, that there may be some protection. What we don't have any clue on is how long that might last, how complete that protection might be, and just how safe the vaccines will be. So I think that's all possible.\n\nI do think that the vaccine availability is not going to occur anywhere near where some of the very optimistic estimates have been of early next year. I think to get an effective vaccine, even with all the the possible shortcuts that we can take without challenging safety or to determine how well it works means that we're well into next year at the earliest before we have a vaccine. And of course, this pandemic may have played itself out largely before that could even happen.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDoctor, there's a there's a lot of politics, as you know, swirling around early missteps by the Chinese, by perhaps our own government. But if I'm reading your institute's paper correctly, that this has to go through a certain percentage of the population before it's over, then I'm wondering how serious at the end of the day, from a public health perspective, were the consequences of those early missteps? You know, if the Chinese, for example, had handled this perfectly, would we be in a fundamentally different place today than we are or not? How do you think about that?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM:\n\nWell, you know, I've said over and over again, we're not driving this tiger, we're riding it. And what I mean by that is, is that when you have a respiratory transmitted virus like this, it clearly is a situation where what humans can do to limit transmission short of a globally available vaccine is very limited.\n\nNow, the Chinese clearly suppressed information of what was happening in Wuhan in December of last year. And despite that, information got out. Our center began following this unfolding scenario in December, and we were able by, in the early part of January, to determine that this was not SARS or MERS, that it was acting much more like a flu virus transmission pattern - it was just generally available, public information.\n\nOn January 20th, I put out a statement that actually said that this was going to cause a pandemic globally and that transmission would occur around the world, but would not likely be detected until enough cases surfaced probably till the end of February, early March.\n\nYou know, we didn't need any classified information. We just had general source information to be able to determine that. So I don't think any other country can use as an excuse that we didn't have that information.\n\nThe Chinese really started to change course right around the first of the year and did provide much more information. Actually, on January 11th, they published the entire sequence of the virus so that any nation, any government, any private entity could begin working on a test for the virus. They could begin working on a vaccine.\n\nIn what I would call the fog of a serious outbreak or an epidemic, that was pretty fast to get that kind of information out. So I don't think that they hid any information that would have had a substantial impact on how we respond.\n\nI think what we had was a warning at that point that we needed to gear up around the world and look at how well we were prepared to respond to a pandemic, how many N95 respirators we had, et cetera. I think, unfortunately, our government and others too squandered that time because they didn't go forward and really do the kind of preparedness work that I think most of us would do. I have a current article out in Foreign Affairs which actually goes into some detail and discusses that.\n\nI think what did happen as I mentioned on January 20th, I came forward with a statement to this effect that it would cause a pandemic. In conversations with senior leaders at 3M, one of the largest N95 respirator manufacturers in the world, shared this information, said, you know, we really need to have all hands on deck for manufacturing these. And in fact, on the morning of January 21st, 3M went forward full bore, 24/7, full production and by more than almost six weeks beat the first request from the U.S. government for increased production.\n\nSo, you know, I think we'll go back in time and and consider who should have done what, when and where. But two points: One is this virus is going to largely do what it's going to do. And I don't believe we could ever have stopped it from transmission in our borders, even in a major way. And number two is that we did squander early time trying to get better prepared. And that's what we're hoping right now we don't continue to do in anticipating a potentially future bigger wave of this or just additional cases that will get us to that 60 to 70 percent infection level.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, Doctor, that's actually a great transition to to another kind of thought here, which is in 2017, you wrote what I thought was a terrific book called \"Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs,\" in which you outlined a strategy for addressing infectious disease threats, and what I'm wondering is, what could we have done in the years before this pandemic to have mitigated the risk of it happening and to have better prepared for it if that mitigation failed? And what should we be doing now to better mitigate and prepare for the next pandemic down the road?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERHOLM:\n\nWell, first of all, let me say that this should never been a surprise. In fact, in 2005, I wrote pieces in Foreign Affairs and in the New England Journal of Medicine and other venues about why we weren't prepared for an influenza pandemic or a virus like an influenza that would cause this worldwide outbreak of a respiratory transmitted agent. And I must say, I wish we were back in 2005 because frankly, we were more prepared back then than we were today. And I'll point out why in a moment.\n\nBut I think the challenge we have is kind of the creative imagination to think that this can happen. You know, people such as myself have been really pretty much labeled as scaremongers, you know, as people who just, you know, 'You're scaring the hell out of us. Why?' And, you know, I've always subscribed to the idea that my job is not to scare people out of their wits but into their wits.\n\nAnd I think people are now beginning to realize that in the book that you mentioned just now, in Chapter 19, there was an influenza pandemic scenario started in China in which I detailed what it would look like. And if you just take the word influenza out and corona virus in, it's exactly what's happened and unfolded, just as we said. And of course, we still have months to go.\n\nSo I think now people begin to realize that, you know, infectious diseases can do what even militaries can't do to the world, and that we now have to have a whole new respect, and understanding of what this means.\n\nCould we have done more? Absolutely. In terms of the vaccine world, we would not have had a vaccine specifically for this virus. But how do we invest in, much like the Department of Defense does in weaponry, a whole series of different vaccine platforms through ways that we can look at this, including coronavirus? Remember, after SARS and MERS, we knew we had to be prepared for them and we still had not developed the vaccines. We've put so little resources into this that basically we could have been much, much further along in jumpstarting vaccine work.\n\nThe same thing is true with antivirals. We could have known much more, in a much more conclusive way what might work against a coronavirus. And I could lay out the other kinds of infectious agents we need to know about. So that's number one, there's no doubt about the fact that we have to prioritize how we prepare for infectious diseases.\n\nThe second thing is these are going to happen. I'm not suggesting we can stop them. But when an animal virus emerges into a human, we've got to pick it up quickly and we have to be prepared then to minimize its impact. And today, I mean, the strategic national stockpile, we have likely somewhere around 35 million in N95 respirators for the country when in fact the estimates are we'd need between 3.5 and 5 billion of them and they wouldn't materialize overnight. It wasn't like their supply chains or machines that can make them and we just didn't envision this. So we are now way behind the eight ball and protecting our basic health care workers -- that we could have done, and I could go through a list of other products like that, the testing reagents, etc.\n\nBut I think the other piece of it is, and a really very important one, is we didn't understand the vulnerability of our supply chains. For example, we've been studying for the last year and a half critical drug shortages in the United States, which are being accentuated, by the way, with this pandemic in a big way. And we brought together a world renowned group of doctors to understand what drugs are needed every day by people, what's on the crash cart, what's in the emergency room, what's in intensive care. And we came up with 156 drugs that if you don't have with an hour, people die or they're severely injured without having those drugs. One hundred percent of them are generic, 62 are already on short status, meaning that there weren't enough already in this country before the pandemic. And as generic drugs almost always remain offshore, most of them in China and India. And that vulnerability we have today not only is for the American public, but our own Department of Defense, all the critical drugs they need are coming from China.\n\nNow, imagine if we outsource all our munitions production to China. People would say, well you can't do that. If the very basis of keeping our troops healthy or needing treatments are in the hands of these countries.\n\nSo I think that this pandemic is just accentuated all the supply chain challenges that have developed over the last ten to fifteen years and we haven't even thought about when we moved all of our manufacturing offshore and in particular to certain countries in the world. So I think that these are all things we can do in the future in a very different way. And I hope that we learn lessons from this pandemic that minimize the risk for pandemics in the future. And if they do occur, that will allow us to also limit the impact that they have.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nSo, Doctor, you've been terrific with your time. I just want to finish with one more question. So as I read about the virus, as a as a nonmedical person, I'm struck by how little we know. Even after four months and and more than four million confirmed cases worldwide, there is still so much that we don't know. And what I'm wondering is, as a medical expert, are you seeing about the level of knowledge that you would expect to see at this point or not? And how do you think about that question of how much we know and how much and how long it's going to take for us to know that?\n\nDR. MICHAEL OSTERM\n\nWell, we do have a lot yet to learn. One is just about the disease itself. As I mentioned earlier, we're learning a lot about the many facets of the disease picture. It's not just a simple, straightforward disease. We are learning more about the virus all the time. And, you know, What made it get to this point? It does what it does. We're learning about how it's changing as it transmits around the world.\n\nI think the level of new knowledge and information is overwhelming right now. I've never seen a proliferation of scientific information so quickly. The international response for vaccine research and looking at how vaccines might work here, looking at drugs, again, is unprecedented. I think our country and our government has done a lot to fast fastforward that.\n\nSo I do think that almost all the things that we need, we are getting done in terms of information. The challenge is, again, we're on virus time, not human time. And what we need are answers yesterday, not tomorrow. We will get answers. But I think the challenge we have is understanding, for example, certain drugs are going to work. Why would they work based on what we know about the disease? Well, we are learning things about this disease literally within the last week that we didn't know a month ago.\n\nSo I think that it's just the fact that we're digesting lots and lots of information quickly. But I I'm impressed by the body of knowledge. And if anybody is trying to stay current in this field, it is a real challenge given the number of publications and the number of different studies that are coming forward every day.\n\nMICHAEL MORELL:\n\nDoctor, thank you. Thanks so much for joining us. I want to tell my listeners that they should look for your Foreign Affairs article out this week and they should also spend some time on your institute's website. I do several times a week and I find it incredibly useful. So, again, thank you for joining us. And it was great to have you.",

    "Transcript: Scott Gottlieb discusses coronavirus on \"Face the Nation,\" May 10, 2020": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The following is a transcript of an interview with former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb by CBS News' Margaret Brennan that aired Sunday, May 10, 2020, on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Welcome back to FACE THE NATION. We go now to Westport, Connecticut, and former FDA commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb. Good to have you back with us.\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Thank you.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We heard from the FDA that they have given emergency use authorization for the first antigen test to discover COVID-19, so that's any substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies against it. How significant is this authorization? How will this work?\n\nDR. GOTTLIEB: Well, I think this kind of technology is a real game changer, and this test was authorized by the FDA under the leadership of Jeff Shuren who runs that device center in 24 hours from receiving the application. What it is it's a very rapid test that could be used in a doctor's office. Doctors now have about 40,000 of these Sofia machines already installed in their offices. And you do a simple nasal swab and the test itself scans for the antigens that the virus produces. The test is about 85 percent sensitive. So let's say a hundred people come into a doctor's office who have COVID-19, 85 of them are going to be able to be tested positive with this test very quickly. It's a cheap test. It'll probably be about five dollars a test and you can get a result within five minutes. For the other 15, the doctors are going to have to have an index of suspicion that the patient may have COVID-19 and send off one of the PCR-based tests, which take about 24 hours to get the result back. But for those 85 patients that you could screen out right away, you're getting a very fast result and you can start to take action immediately. The company itself said that they're going to be able to produce about 200,000 of these tests starting right away. But in several weeks they'll be able to produce up to 1.5 million a week. So this dramatically expands our testing capacity as long as doctors are able to run these tests in their offices.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: As long as they can run them. How different is this kind of testing from what we've heard so much about where states are struggling to get capacity and they're looking for, you know, reagents and cotton swabs? Does this solve those challenges?\n\nDR. GOTTLIEB: Well, it helps solve the challenges. I mean, every test paradigm is a little bit different, has pros and cons. The PCR-based tests, where the states have struggled to get the testing supplies, those are more accurate, but they also take more time and they cost more to perform. The reimbursement is about a hundred dollars. Maybe if you do that at scale, you can get the cost down to fifty dollars. There is point-of-care-based systems like the Abbott machine that the White House is using or the GeneXpert, which is very reliable. Those take a little longer to get a result. Their sensitivity isn't as good as the PCR-based machines, with the exception of the GeneXpert, which is very accurate. These antigen based tests aren't as reliable, meaning they're not as sensitive. So they're going to miss some patients who have COVID. But in the hands of a doctor who already has a high index of suspicion that the patient may have the disease, and if they get a negative test and they still think the patient may be infected, they'll send off a PCR-based test. They allow you to dramatically expand testing. And they're very cheap. They're very easy to perform. And again, most doctors have these machines already in their offices. They're using them for strep throat and flu. The challenge is going to be what the guidance is from the CDC and public health agencies about how doctors test in their offices. If turning over a positive case in your medical office means that you have to do a deep cleaning and quarantine your nursing staff and close your office, doctors aren't going to be testing. And that would be unfortunate because there's a big, installed base of these tests already in place. So CDC has to come out with flexible guidelines on how doctors can protect their offices and protect their staff and also be testing in the community. Because if we can't do that, then we're not going to have access to tests. And the challenge won't be the platforms. There'll be plenty of capacity to perform tests. The challenge will become where can you go get the test?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You said this could be more accurate than the testing system the White House is currently using. Let me ask you about these aides who have been testing positive at the White House. Our top three medical officials in the U.S. government are now in self-quarantine because of possible exposure. They work in a White House that's a fortress. But the virus has still made it inside. I want to play for you what President Trump said this week when he revealed one of Vice President Pence's aides tested positive.\n\n[CLIP BEGINS]\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP: She tested positive out of the blue. This is why the whole concept of tests aren't necessarily great. The tests are perfect, but something can happen between a test where it's good and then something happens. And all of a sudden she was tested very recently and tested negative. And then today, I guess for some reason, she tested positive.\n\n[CLIP ENDS]\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: The president seems to be doubting the value of testing in the workplace. What's your view?\n\nDR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think testing has value in a workplace, especially when you're dealing with places where there's people who are at higher risk of getting infected. So you think about people who work on a shop floor or in a grocery store. The machine- the antigen-based tests that we're talking about here that was just approved is actually less sensitive than a machine that the White House is using. They're using an Abbott platform. But that flat- platform also has false negatives, meaning that sometimes patients- people are going to have the virus. But the test is going to say they don't. There's machines that are more accurate than that Abbott machine, like the GeneXpert. They take a little longer to perform the test. The reason why the White House prefers the Abbott machine is it gives a result in five to 15 minutes. GeneXpert takes about 45 minutes. And so I think that's why they prefer that platform. But this is why we need to have testing out in the community. This is why we need very accurate tests if we're going to be testing asymptomatic people. In the setting of a doctor's office where someone is symptomatic, using a test that doesn't have very high sensitivity might be OK because the doctor's going to run a confirmatory test anyway. But in the setting of where you're testing people who are asymptomatic, as the White House is doing, and you're trying to catch that- those people who don't have any symptoms, you want a very sensitive test for that kind of a purpose. And that's what we should be using out in the employment setting as well.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We've talked a lot about remdesivir. We interviewed the CEO of the company that makes that drug last week. He told us at that time the government would be deciding who the drug gets to and where. The rollout this week was pretty chaotic. Yesterday, HHS revealed its new plan for distribution. What does this indicate to you about how things will work in the future with other drugs or potentially a vaccine?\n\nDR. GOTTLIEB: Well, look, I think we need to get a better system in place. If the government's going to take control of the supply of these kinds of therapeutics and they don't necessarily have to do that, they chose to do that, they need to have a good system in place for allocation. Here, in this case, Gilead gave a half a million doses to the federal government. They distributed initially about 4,000 in New York City, which is the city that I'm familiar with. I think they should've been trying to push out as many doses as fast as possible because more supply is coming into the market. There's no reason to hoard it or hold onto it. And so hopefully when they start to contemplate the next therapeutic and there will be more therapeutics in the fall or a vaccine and how they allocate that, they're going to have a better system in place based on clinical need.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: All right. Thank you very much for your insight, Dr. Gottlieb.",

    "Two states will soon hold special elections  --  the latest tests of voting amid coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "There will be two House special elections on May 12, one for former Representative Katie Hill's seat in California and one in northwest Wisconsin for former Congressman Sean Duffy's seat. Both are seen as tests of how the coronavirus pandemic could influence elections going forward.\n\nIn Hill's county, California's 25th District, the race could give an early snapshot into the impact the coronavirus can have on a competitive race. Republicans, who long held the seat, are hoping to gain back one of their losses from the 2018 midterms and flip a seat in the state for the first time since 1998.\n\nIn northwest Wisconsin, the short gap between the presidential primary and this election could show how poll workers are having to adjust to the new normal of increased absentee ballots ahead of a crucial swing state election in November.\n\nIn 2018, Hill flipped the northern Los Angeles county seat by 8 points after Hillary Clinton's 7-point win in 2016. Democrats were just starting to cement their hold on a district that from 1992 until Hill's win, was held by a Republican.\n\nDemocratic Assemblywoman Christy Smith, who has been endorsed by Hill, won the most votes in the March 3 jungle primary with an 8% gap between her and Republican candidate, veteran Mike Garcia. But overall ballots cast for Democrats outnumbered those for Republicans by just over 2,000 votes, despite a nearly 30,000 Democrat registration advantage.\n\nAs a result, both sides considered this race competitive, even before the pandemic fundamentally changed both campaigns.\n\nSmith became a state assemblywoman in 2018, and her district overlaps with over half of this Congressional district. A moderate Democrat who previously served on a local school board, she racked up support from unions and California Democrats early on in the primary race.\n\nIn the March primary, Garcia beat out Steve Knight, who previously held this seat. A former Navy fighter pilot billed as a fresh \"political outsider,\" Garcia had already filed and raised nearly $500,000 to challenge Hill before she resigned in late 2019 due to an affair with a campaign staffer.\n\n\"You've got somebody who's got a Latino last name, has served the military and who Trump is promoting. I think when you're going up against that, in terms of demographics, I could see how that would give our candidate a little bit of, 'Okay, well she's got to prove otherwise,\" said L.A. county Democrats chair Mark Gonzalez..\n\nThe height of President Trump's involvement came in April, when Republicans jumped on a town hall clip of Smith making a joke about Garcia's military record. \"Did you guys know he's a pilot?\" she joked.\n\nSmith has apologized, but Mr. Trump brought up the issue in a tweet promoting Garcia: \"Now she's mocking our Great Vets! We need Navy Fighter Pilot Mike Garcia in #CA25!\"\n\n\"It is a matter of fact that Donald Trump has failed to meet this moment\" Smith told CBS News. She linked Garcia to Mr. Trump, saying he'll serve as a \"rubber stamp\" for the president. \"When voters look at what is happening in Congress right now, it is clear to them who is and who isn't looking out for them and their families.\"\n\nWithin the same week of Mr. Trump highlighting the race, Smith received last-minute endorsements from Clinton and former President Obama. Mail ballots have been sent out since April 13, though there have been in-person voting centers open.\n\nGarcia's campaign said it is hoping the endorsement by Mr. Trump motivates the Republicans to vote, but has mainly kept the focus on Smith's vote for Assembly Bill 5, a gig-work bill that Garcia has called \"unsustainable\" and has connected to jobs leaving the state.\n\n\"I don't want my nation to become what this state has become, which is a victim of poor policy and poor execution,\" Garcia said in an April Zoom debate.\n\nWhile the election has switched to an all-mail format, the specific topic of ballot collection or \"harvesting\" has also been a point of political contention. The state's Republican Party sued Governor Gavin Newsom over the practice, saying it's in direct conflict with his social distancing and \"stay at home\" order.\n\nEarly absentee ballot returns show a much higher turnout than expected for a special election, according to Paul Mitchell, vice president of the bipartisan Political Data Inc. company. It also shows a 10,000 vote lead for Garcia, a gap Mitchell attributes to older, conservative voters tending to vote first.\n\n\"Our voter intensity is always higher,\" said Ventura County Republican Chair Mike Osborn. \"Considering all the stuff that's going on right now, I don't see the Democrats getting real excited about this.\"\n\nAfter a request from the L.A. Democratic Party, the county registrar opened an additional voting center in the most diverse part of the district late Friday night. The move was immediately criticized by the National Republican Congressional Committee and Mr. Trump, who tweeted on Saturday that Smith and the Democrats are trying to \"steal\" the election by abruptly announcing the new centers in a Democratic-heavy area. Smith pointed to the agreement from Lancaster Mayor Rex Parris, a Republican, in opening a center. While every registered voter was mailed a ballot, features at these locations allow voters to change their party registration or request a new ballot.\n\nIf the coronavirus pandemic stretches on until the fall and California is under a modified stay-at-home order, Mitchell says this will be the race to look at for a baseline in pandemic-era elections, and if the electorate expands in any way.\n\n\"In an environment where people are ostensibly without work filling their days, they're at home as opposed to always being out and about, are less likely voters turning out voting? Potentially, simply because they're stuck at home with their ballot staring at them all day?\" Mitchell said.\n\nThe money race reflects the toss-up nature of this election. Both have raised more than $2.2 million according to their latest FEC filings, and the Republican and Democratic House campaign arms have spent more than a million a piece on this race.\n\nAny recent momentum from Garcia was supported by $600,000 in mailers and attack ads from the House GOP-backed Congressional Leadership Fund. Their Democrat counterparts, the House Majority PAC, have lain low since the March 3 primaries. They've instead kept their powder dry for November, where they say Smith is expected to have the advantage in a more Democrat-friendly electorate.\n\nBut Smith said it is urgent to fill this seat now. \"There are trillions of dollars being spent on public health safety and economic recovery and my district currently lacks a voice in Congress fighting for it's priorities,\" she told CBS. \"The urgency of this moment cannot be overstated.\"\n\nRhineland City Clerk Valerie Foley said she hasn't had a break since the April 7th presidential primary. For her and other clerks in the massive northwest congressional district, they've had to immediately shift focus to the May 12th special election.\n\n\"We're not even done with this other one, we had to wait a whole week before we could finish up elections and get results,\" she said. \"So it's hard on the officials, the clerks, it's hard on everybody.\"\n\nWisconsin Governor Tony Evers held firm on going ahead with the May 12th primary date, anticipating that the nature of a special election and the rural spread of the district won't result in the same long polling lines the state saw in April.\n\nRepublican state Senator Tom Tiffany and Democrat Tricia Zunker are running to fill this seat, left vacant by Congressman Sean Duffy, who resigned for family reasons.\n\nZunker, a local school board president and justice on the Ho-Chunk Supreme Court, previously considered running for this seat in 2018. After Duffy's resignation, Zunker said she saw an opportunity to bring back the work of Democratic Congressman Dave Obey, who held the seat for 40 years.\n\n\"The amazing constituency services that Congressman Dave Obey had here... that pretty much were eliminated with his successor... I felt a duty and an obligation to give back,\" she told CBS News.\n\nFollowing some newly-drawn district lines, Duffy took the Congressional seat in 2010, the same year Tiffany began serving as a state senator. Tiffany's experience has been crucial in his pitch to voters, emphasizing that the district needs someone to hit the ground running.\n\n\"I came in during a very difficult time in 2010, our state unemployment was almost 10%, $3 billion deficit, I came in and made the hard decisions to turn our state around. And that's the commitment I make to the voters now,\" he told CBS.\n\nWhile other local issues like gun control, rural healthcare and redistricting have come up during their debates, their splits on how the government should respond to the coronavirus mirrors the larger debate nationwide.\n\nOn how to reopen the state, Tiffany proposed a regional approach while Zunker warned, \"Unfortunately, coronavirus does not stop at the county line.\" On what Congress should prioritize next, Zunker talked about making sure there are enough tests and PPE for medical workers, while Tiffany kept his focus on helping struggling agriculture businesses and dairy farmers.\n\nPolitically, this is a red district. Mr. Trump won by over 20 points here, leaving Tiffany confident about his chances to win or hold the seat in November. However, Zunker has received local and national support from Senators Tammy Baldwin, Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker, and if elected, would be the first Native-American to represent the state.\n\nMore than 69,000 ballots, or about 58%, of requested absentee ballots, have already been returned and the Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) is expecting a higher overall turnout in the district than in April. More than 93,000 votes were cast in this district during the presidential primary, over 104,000 have been requested for this special election.\n\nElection clerks in the 7th District have been finding workarounds for those unable to request and send in mail ballots, such as curbside voting or scheduling early vote times to cast your ballot in person. While a drop of poll workers is expected, the WEC said 240 National Guard members will be available to help.\n\nPresident of the Wisconsin Municipal Clerks' Association Diane Coenen said she preferred an all-mail ballot election, pointing to the health risk for poll workers and voters. Health officials in Milwaukee County released a report on Wednesday that found 54 people who either voted in-person or worked the April 7 election and were diagnosed with COVID-19. Twenty-six voters were potentially infected while voting, based on when they showed symptoms, but overall the study was \"inconclusive in determining a relationship between election participation and COVID-19 spread.\"\n\nHowever, Coenen said clerks feel prepared for the May 12 election, leftover sanitation and protective equipment being provided. Still, both her and Foley described the task of balancing the absentee ballot requests and regular clerk work, such as handling liquor licenses and records requests, \"exhausting.\"\n\n\"This whole year is going to be exhausting and it has not started out very well,\" she told CBS News. \"It is truly an overwhelming year, but they're up for the challenge.\"\n\nMusadiq Bidar and Adam Brewster contributed reporting",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The U.S. military is banning enlistment for anyone who was been hospitalized for COVID-19, a Pentagon official told CBS News' David Martin. There is also new guidance for examining an applicant's history with the disease during the screening process.\n\nA Pentagon official said this is \"interim guidance\" that will remain at least until more is known about the damage that the virus does to the lungs.\n\nPeople already in the military who are hospitalized with COVID-19 will not automatically be disqualified from further service, the official said. Depending on the lasting effects after treatments, they could return to duty or take a less physically demanding job. Recruits with more severe effects will go before a medical board to determine if they can continue serving.\n\nU.S. Military Entrance Processing Command issued a memo this week detailing new procedures for applicants during the coronavirus pandemic. The memo, first reported by the Military Times, says that during the prescreen process, an applicant's reported history of confirmed COVID-19 \"will be annotated as 'Considered Disqualifying.'\"\n\nThe memo initially said that a confirmed history of COVID-19 from a lab test or clinical diagnosis would be \"permanently disqualifying.\" But the guidance has since been updated to allow recruitment of people who weren't hospitalized.\n\nThe 65 Military Entrance Processing Stations across the country will take temperatures and ask questions about symptoms and potential contact with the disease. An applicant who fails screening will not be tested, but can return in 14 days if they do not show COVID-19 symptoms. Anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 must wait 28 days after diagnosis before reporting to a processing station.\n\nPotential recruits can apply for waivers for any disqualifying medical condition, but the memo does not give guidance for what would lead to an exemption for someone diagnosed with COVID-19.",

    "Vaccine skeptics are already casting doubt on one for the coronavirus. But it doesn't exist yet.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A coronavirus vaccine is still months or years away, but groups that peddle misinformation about immunizations are already taking aim, potentially eroding confidence in what could be humanity's best chance to defeat the virus.\n\nIn recent weeks, vaccine opponents have made several unsubstantiated claims, including allegations that vaccine trials will be dangerously rushed or that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, is blocking cures to enrich vaccine makers. They've also falsely claimed that Microsoft founder Bill Gates wants to use a vaccine to inject microchips into people - or to cull 15% of the world's population.\n\nVaccine opponents in the U.S. have been around for a long time. Their claims range from relatively modest safety concerns about specific vaccines or the risk of side effects to conspiracy theories that border on the bizarre.\n\nThe movement is receiving renewed attention, especially as it aligns itself with groups loudly protesting restrictions on daily life aimed at controlling the spread of the virus. Health professionals say vaccine misinformation could have lethal consequences if it leads people to opt for bogus cures instead.\n\n\"Only a coronavirus vaccine can truly protect us from future outbreaks,\" said Dr. Scott Ratzan, a physician and medical misinformation expert at the City University of New York and Columbia University. \"But what if the effort succeeds and large numbers of people decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children?\"\n\nWhile vaccines for diseases such as polio, smallpox and measles have benefited millions, some skeptics reject the science, citing a distrust of modern medicine and government. Others say mandatory vaccine requirements violate their religious freedom.\n\nRita Palma, the leader of the anti-vaccine group in Long Island called My Kids, My Choice, is among those who say their families won't get the coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\"Many of us are anxiety stricken at the thought of being forced to get a vaccine,\" Palma said. \"I will never choose to have a COVID-19 vaccine. I don't want the government forcing it on my community or my family.\"\n\nFrom the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, vaccine skeptics have tailored several long-standing claims about vaccine safety to fit the current outbreak. When the first U.S. case was announced in January, some alleged the coronavirus was manufactured and that patents for it could be found online.\n\nMore than 200,000 deaths later, vaccine opponents are endorsing unapproved treatments, second-guessing medical experts and pushing fears about mandatory vaccinations. They've also latched onto protests against stay-at-home orders in the U.S.\n\n\"The coronavirus has created this perfect storm of misinformation,\" remarked David A. Broniatowski, an associate professor at George Washington University's school of engineering and applied science who has published several studies on vaccine misinformation.\n\nLast week, an anti-vaccine activist was arrested in Idaho after repeatedly refusing police orders to leave a playground closed because of the pandemic. The woman, who was there with other families, is affiliated with two groups that protested at the Idaho Statehouse against stay-at-home orders.\n\nFacebook groups formed to organize the protests have been peppered with vaccine hoaxes and myths. Perhaps no one is a bigger targrt for conspiracy theorists than Gates, who is funding vaccine research. The online movement has centered concerns around a COVID-19 vaccine on false claims that Gates is planning to microchip people with the vaccine or use it to reduce the world's population.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic who helped popularize unsubstantiated claims that vaccines can cause autism, said Gates' work gives him \"dictatorial control of global health policy.\" Roger Stone, a former adviser to President Trump, went further on a New York City radio show, saying Gates \"and other globalists\" are using the coronavirus \"for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people.\"\n\nSuch wild theories can have real-world effects. False rumors that Gates hoped to test an experimental vaccine in South Africa became mainstream after a news site erroneously reported the claim. One of the country's political parties then sent a letter to President Cyril Rampahosa demanding answers about \"deals\" struck with Gates.\n\nIn fact, Gates and his wife are financing a vaccine trial in Philadelphia and Kansas City, Missouri, not South Africa. He also suggested creating a database of people immune to the virus, not implanting microchips.\n\nOn Monday, during remarks recognizing World Immunization Week, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus criticized vaccine skeptics for spreading misinformation at a time when many families are delaying or skipping routine childhood immunizations because they're afraid of COVID-19 exposure in doctors' offices.\n\n\"Myths and misinformation about vaccines are adding fuel to the fire,\" he said.\n\nHealth experts have repeatedly said there is no evidence the coronavirus was intentionally created or spread. They also insist that vaccines are not only safe, but essential to global health.\n\n\"Vaccine researchers and anyone who is a vaccine advocate care deeply about vaccine safety,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children's Hospital of Philadelphia physician and co-inventor of a vaccine for rotavirus, which kills hundreds of thousands of children annually.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death for some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.\n\nThe vaccine debate is fertile ground for groups looking to sow discord in the United States. Russia seized on it to create divisions before the 2016 U.S. election, and appears to be at it again.\n\nA report from a European Union disinformation task force found numerous conspiracy theories in English-language Russian media, including state-run RT, claiming an eventual vaccine will be used to inject nanoparticles into people.\n\n\"When pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets spread anti-vaccine tropes, they become responsible for those who will hesitate to seek professional medical care,\" the EU report said.",

    "View from the front lines: The lives impacted by coronavirus in New York City": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "CBS News spent seven days at the Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx section of New York City, from April 16-22. It was the height of the coronavirus pandemic in one of the hardest-hit communities in the nation. Watch the CBS News special, \"Bravery and Hope: 7 Days on the Front Line\" Friday, May 15, at 9 p.m. ET/PT on CBS, re-airing Saturday and Sunday at 10 p.m. ET/PT on CBSN.\n\nBy mid-April, the coronavirus had killed more people in New York than anywhere else, and of the city's five boroughs, the Bronx was the hardest hit. Very few journalists had spent time in hospitals on the front lines, and I had just signed up for seven days and nights inside a COVID-stricken hospital to document what the health care workers on the front lines were experiencing.\n\nI was not just making a decision about putting my own health at risk. I was making a decision for my wife and two young children, too. My wife and I talked it through. A lot. And she saw it clearly: \"This is your job. To go and tell their stories, accepting the risk just like they do.\"\n\nBefore dawn on Day 2, I drove out to Fort Totten in Queens where EMS crews of the New York City Fire Department assemble first thing in the morning, preparing to fan out across the city and respond to emergency calls. That's where I met Chris Feliciano, a paramedic who had recovered from coronavirus himself and was now back to work.\n\n\"This is worse than 9/11,\" Feliciano told me. \"I say that because 9/11 was just one day and unfortunately over 3,000 people died in that one day but we're seeing numbers well above that and this is continuous. This is not just one day, this is daily and the bodies keep piling up.\"\n\nThe calls never stopped. Within 10 minutes of treating one patient the ambulance lights would flash, the siren would blare, and we would be racing again through the streets of the Bronx.\n\nShortness of breath was the most common symptom from patients. They were scared and said as much. And they faced a grim reality: going to the hospital could be more dangerous than trying to recover at home.\n\n\"Because the hospitals are so overwhelmed, it's a mass casualty incident at the moment with the city,\" Feliciano said. \"We would generally get cardiac arrests about once or twice a week. But now it's just happening at all hours of the day.\"\n\nAt a small row house later that morning, we arrived too late for the elderly man inside. He was pronounced \"D.O.A.\" -- dead on arrival.\n\nThe volume of calls forced FDNY to put a new protocol in place. \"We will try for 20 minutes to resuscitate a patient,\" Feliciano said. \"If there's no response to our interventions, we would have to pronounce on scene.\"\n\nOverwhelmed with patients, Montefiore Medical Center, the largest hospital in the Bronx, transformed a giant meeting hall into a COVID-19 ward. The moment I walked in for the first time, a young doctor said to me, \"There's a 22-year-old ambulance worker here, you should talk with him.\"\n\nIn one of the dozens of makeshift rooms, I pulled back the curtain and found Cristian Camas. He lay on his hospital bed, working hard to breathe. A rosary hung on the bedside railing. Sweat beaded down his forehead. \"It was like a buffalo was on my chest,\" he kept saying, describing how the disease had overcome him. Telling his story, he echoed a haunting refrain he repeated again and again: \"I didn't think I was going to make it.\"\n\nCamas worked for a private ambulance company and likely contracted the virus while helping to save the lives of others.\n\nWe FaceTimed with Cristian's father who lived in the South Bronx. Despite everything that was happening, he invited me to their home.\n\nCristian's mother explained that an uncle had recently died. Cristian's 13-year-old brother Erik was worried about the rest of the family.\n\n\"There was a moment here where I was by myself, because my mom, she started feeling sick, too,\" said Erik, Cristian's 13-year-old brother. \"I imagine myself without any of them, and I knew that I couldn't do anything without them. It was horrible.\"\n\nBefore a table bearing a bible and a candle, Erik led the family in prayer, asking God for Cristian to come home safely.\n\nThree days later, his prayers were answered. Cristian was one of the 314 patients discharged from the hospital over the week we were there.\n\nThe last night of shooting was a Wednesday near the end of April. It was chilly and clear out. I went into the hospital to follow Dr. Michelle Gong, chief of critical care, for one more night shift.\n\nI geared up -- full-body Tyvek suit, surgical gloves, N95 covered with a surgical mask, full-face plastic shield -- and it took less than 10 minutes for a \"code\" to come. It was an urgent call for rapid response to a patient in distress.\n\nA team of doctors swarmed a crashing patient, more human bodies in a single patient's room than I imagined was possible. Nurses scrambled for supplies, wrappers and plastic gloves flipped into the air, left scattered on the hospital floor like emergency detritus. I sweat through my PPE as I shot video of Dr. Gong as she climbed onto the bed so she could push down on the patient's chest, a procedure to determine if his body could handle being turned over. They got the patient to the ICU.\n\nIn the week we spent at the hospital, COVID took the lives of 70 people.\n\nFor seven days, I'd been pointing a camera at countless medical professionals as they raced to save lives, strained to protect themselves from the virus. As they laughed and celebrated small victories, as they broke down and wept over endless death that had overwhelmed their lives.\n\nWhat I didn't know was that, for just a moment, a colleague snapped a photo of me at work. In all my time at Montefiore, I never thought I felt afraid.\n\nThen I saw the image. It's undeniable what filled my eyes: a new kind of fear.",

    "What Kawasaki Disease can tell us about the coronavirus-linked MIS-C illness in kids, and vice versa": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Tokyo -- Doctors and scientists in the U.S. and Europe have called a mysterious new pediatric illness that appears linked to COVID-19 \"deeply concerning.\" Instead of attacking the lungs like the new coronavirus disease does in adults, this syndrome, while seemingly very rare, can trigger serious, even deadly cardiac complications in kids.\n\nThe emerging disorder, dubbed Multisystem Inflammatory Illness in Children, or MIS-C, presents some of the classic signs of a well-known disorder discovered more than half a century ago in Japan. The symptoms of MIS-C (sometimes referred to as PMIS) are so similar to Kawasaki Disease that doctors are debating whether there could be a connection.\n\nKawasaki Disease (KD) is a rare and seldom fatal non-contagious vascular illness primarily in children of Asian descent. It generally causes symptoms including a high fever, red eyes and rash. It can also trigger heart failure, but that complication is seen in very few Kawasaki sufferers.\n\nDr. Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration, told CBS' \"Face the Nation\" on Sunday that MIS-C, \"appears to be some kind of post-viral immune type phenomena associated with\" COVID-19, though he stressed that any \"causal relationship\" remained unclear.\n\n\"We see this in other kinds of viruses,\" Gottlieb said. \"What we don't know is the denominator.\"\n\n\"Maybe it's a totally different disease,\" Dr. Mamoru Ayusawa, who's devoted his career to diagnosing and studying Kawasaki Disease, told CBS News. He added, however, that COVID-19 could emerge as a new trigger for KD.\n\nWhile both KD and MIS-C both attack children, KD sufferers are overwhelmingly preschoolers and infants, while MIS-C strikes older children well into their teens.\n\nCBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula notes that many of the treatments long used for KD patients have proven helpful and effective in treating children with MIS-C, including intravenous immunoglobulin (injecting antibodies from healthy blood plasma). Steroids, used for only the most serious KD cases, are also often prescribed for MIS-C.\n\nUnaddressed, KD can lead to coronary damage, but with prompt treatment most patients go on to lead normal lives.\n\nKD occurs worldwide and can leave patients with effects that last a lifetime. It's the leading cause of acquired heart disease in the U.S. and Japan.\n\nBut for reasons still unknown, Japan is a KD hotspot. Japanese children suffer it at a rate of 359.1 per 100,000, by far the world's highest, although other Asian countries including South Korea, China and Taiwan also report significant numbers of cases.\n\nIn the U.S., with a rate of about 20 per 100,000, the disease presents mostly among Asian-Americans. While extremely rare in Caucasians, Ayusawa said KD has been known to afflict blacks and Hispanics.\n\nThat draws a stark differentiation with MIS-C: So far, not a single case of the new syndrome, seen mostly in Western Europe and the U.S., has been documented in the populations primarily affected by KD.\n\nAyusawa said none of the nearly 600 juveniles diagnosed with the new coronavirus disease in Japan have any history of KD, and of a sampling of the 134 KD patients seen so far this year, none have tested positive for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\"In Japan and neighboring countries at this time, no information strongly suggests a link between COVID-19 and KD,\" the Japan Society for Kawasaki Disease said in a recent statement.\n\nAs Gottlieb said on Face the Nation, and as an Italian study has shown, coronavirus is strongly suspected of a link with MIS-C, however.\n\n\"Obviously there's guilt by association,\" Dr. Jane Burns, director of the Kawasaki Disease Research Center at UC San Diego, said in a recent video posted online. The new syndrome, she said, could even provide insights into KD.\n\n\"If COVID can be one of the triggers [of MIS-C], that's going to teach us a lot about Kawasaki Disease and lead us to better understanding of how it can be so detrimental to the heart,\" she said, adding that her hospital is seeing not just MIS-C patients, but a \"remarkable rise\" in Kawasaki Disease.\n\nIt was Japanese physician Tomisaku Kawasaki who first observed the unusual disorder among his pediatric patients in the 1960s. He called it \"acute febrile mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome,\" but the illness came to bear his own name.\n\nAyusawa said KD is suspected when healthy children suddenly develop a fever and at least some of the other classic symptoms, such as rabbit-like pink or bloodshot eyes, red-rouge lips and strawberry-red tongue; swollen lymph nodes; rash or swollen hands and feet. Most improve after just a day or two of treatment.\n\nThe most recent annual survey by the Japan Kawasaki Disease Research Center, in 2018, showed that Japan logged 17,364 cases that year, a record high attributed to better surveillance and monitoring.\n\n\"We've aggressively moved to identify even mild cases,\" Ayusawa said from his office at Tokyo's Nihon University hospital, which has treated 2,500 of the total 395,238 KD patients seen in Japan as of 2018.\n\nFrom a \"double-digit\" fatality rate in the early days, KD now is easily treatable, even at small hospitals throughout the country. Patients are concentrated among children 4 years of age or younger, disproportionately occurring in males about one year old.\n\nWhile major strides have been made in diagnosing and treating KD over the last 60 years, doctors remain baffled by what causes it -- just as they do with the new syndrome seen in the U.S. and Europe.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A recent investigation showed that dozens of people were infected with the coronavirus during what is known as a \"super-spreading\" event. After a choir practice in Washington state in March, 52 out of 61 attendees became ill, 32 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19 and 20 had symptoms consistent with the virus, according to Skagit County Public Health.\n\nThe investigation determined that only one person at the practice had \"cold-like symptoms\" beginning a few days prior to the practice. That individual was later confirmed to have COVID-19, Skagit County Public Health said.\n\nThe choir practice is not the only super-spreading event that has happened during the coronavirus pandemic, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the potential for these events \"underscores the importance\" of social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what these events are and how they happen.\n\nSuper-spreading events \"occur when a single person infects a large number of other people -- sometimes 10, 20, sometimes even more in one setting,\" said Dr. Justin Lessler, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\nOther examples of super-spreading events during the coronavirus pandemic include 15 cases stemming from one person at multiple family gatherings in Chicago and more than 100 cases tracing back to multiple South Korean nightclubs that were visited by a man who later tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe term \"super-spreader\" refers to a person who spreads a disease to a large number of people.\n\n\"It's kind of different for different diseases whether it's a person or an event, but for COVID, it would be more like an event,\" said Dr. Jaline Gerardin, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.\n\nThe \"world's most famous super-spreader\" was Mary Mallon, known as \"Typhoid Mary,\" Lessler said. She infected many people with typhoid fever over several years in the early 1900s.\n\nThese events happen because of \"a combination of biology and setting,\" Lessler said.\n\nAn infected person has to be at a point in their illness when they are very transmissible and they have to be in a place where they can infect a lot of other people.\n\nPlaces where people are densely packed and engaging in something that involves a lot of breathing, like singing or talking, are particularly risky for super spreading, Gerardin said.\n\nYes, the person could be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, the doctors said.\n\n\"They may not feel sick, but the infection has spread enough in their body that they're shedding virus and they're putting enough virus out there to infect other people,\" Lessler said.\n\nDoctors have said they believe the number of people that one person with coronavirus typically infects is two to three. That number, however, is considered \"over-dispersed,\" Lessler said.\n\n\"When we say over-dispersed, what we mean is there are super-spreading events, so the average might be two, let's say, but most people are infecting one or no people and then a very few people are infecting 8 to 10 or even more people,\" he said.\n\nThe number of typical infections also varies by the density of an area and whether or not people are staying home.\n\nThe social distancing guidelines many places have adopted help reduce super-spreading events, the doctors said.\n\n\"We can either prevent them entirely by limiting the size of gatherings or we can mitigate a lot of the risk through good prevention,\" such as having everyone wear masks and being somewhere that's well ventilated, Gerardin said.",

    "What parents should know about a mysterious illness in kids - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "It's been dubbed Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, abbreviated as PMIS or PIMS. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory to doctors about it Thursday afternoon, referring to the condition as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nSymptoms of the syndrome have been compared to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic-shock syndrome. PMIS, however, is being recognized as a \"new entity,\" according to Dr. Luiza Petre, a cardiologist and professor of cardiology at Mount Sinai's School of Medicine in New York.\n\nKawasaki disease is a rare but serious illness believed to be triggered by the immune system's response to infection, but an official cause is unknown.\n\nChildren with Kawasaki experience a prolonged fever lasting several days, a skin rash and swollen lymph nodes in the neck; affected children can also develop redness in their eyes, lips, mouth, as well as the palms of their hands and soles of their feet, according to the National Institutes of Health. Most children recover, but if left untreated, Kawasaki can cause cardiac issues and become life-threatening. Toxic shock also causes fever and a decrease in blood flow, but is triggered by a bacterial infection.\n\nKawasaki disease mostly occurs in children under the age of 5, while a study of PMIS cases in Italy found an average age of 7\u00bd.\n\nWhile an understanding of PMIS is still evolving, children with the syndrome also experience a prolonged fever, rashes, change in the color of their skin or their lips, swollen glands and red eyes. What differentiates PMIS from Kawasaki appears to be complaints of abdominal pain, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and chest pain.\n\n\"What we're seeing is the immune system is actually going into overdrive, impacting the body in a negative way,\" Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric oncologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children, in New Orleans, who has treated several children for the illness, told CBS News. \"Some of these patients are having inflammation of their coronary arteries, and you can have basically a heart attack.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Sean O'Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, the level of inflammation in the heart tends to be higher with PMIS, as compared to Kawasaki disease.\n\nAll together, the syndrome has shown to be more severe than Kawasaki. \"That's what's concerning,\" Petre told CBSN. \"And a lot of (PMIS) cases do require ICU, almost 80% of them.\"\n\nPMIS has been reported in over 100 children in New York, the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak. CBS News has tallied about 200 cases under investigation in 19 states and Washington, D.C., and cases have also been reported in at least six other countries.\n\nDoctors in Italy published a study Wednesday documenting numerous cases of PMIS linked to the coronavirus. Eight out of 10 children they studied with PMIS had antibodies to COVID-19, indicating that they had been infected.\n\nThe fact that the syndrome is appearing in places where coronavirus is prevalent suggests that there could be a correlation, O'Leary said. He cautioned, however, that it's still too early to say anything for certain: \"Some of the things I tell you will be true tomorrow, but some of them may not,\" he said.\n\nCBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula said, \"It's important to stress that in the grand scheme of the pandemic, this is rare. We're still learning a lot more about it.\"\n\nNew clues in mysterious illness potentially linked to COVID-19 in children\n\nA majority of the children with PMIS symptoms reported in New York have also tested positive for COVID-19, but others have not. \"That is something we doctors don't have an explanation for,\" Petre said.\n\n\"If we talk about the frequency of Kawasaki disease, even the specialists in this disease say they've never seen more than five cases at once in one hospital,\" she said. \"So that's something definitely suspicious about the timing between COVID and these cases.\"\n\nAccording to O'Leary, PMIS cases seem to appear about a month after a peak of COVID-19 cases in an area. If the syndrome is brought on by a COVID-19 infection, the lag time for PMIS symptoms is a curious feature, he said. \"It's almost more surprising that most of these kids are (COVID-19) positive.\"\n\n\"That's the mystery, it's a lot like a delayed reaction,\" Petre said of the symptoms' onset.\n\nIf a child does present with PMIS symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor. According to Petre, if a child has a fever that doesn't go down and is resistant to medication for more than a day, a doctor should be contacted.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines for parents earlier this week advising them to call their pediatrician if they notice any of the following symptoms:\n\n\"In this syndrome early intervention is critical as children can decompensate very quickly, and they should seek medical attention immediately,\" Petre said.\n\nAccording to Petre and O'Leary, if a child is admitted for PMIS, their primary treatment will be supportive care. Fluids and medication would likely be administered to maintain blood pressure, as well as anti-inflammatory medication like steroids or immunoglobulin (IVIG).\n\n\"If you're not really aware of this syndrome that's being described, it could easily be missed,\" said Kleinmahon. \"Fortunately children overall are very resilient. And almost all of the cases, if we're able to knock down the inflammation and get them past the beginning stages of this, they're usually doing very well.\"",

        "body": "It's been dubbed Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, abbreviated as PMIS or PIMS. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory to doctors about it Thursday afternoon, referring to the condition as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).\n\nSymptoms of the syndrome have been compared to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic-shock syndrome. PMIS, however, is being recognized as a \"new entity,\" according to Dr. Luiza Petre, a cardiologist and professor of cardiology at Mount Sinai's School of Medicine in New York.\n\nKawasaki disease is a rare but serious illness believed to be triggered by the immune system's response to infection, but an official cause is unknown.\n\nChildren with Kawasaki experience a prolonged fever lasting several days, a skin rash and swollen lymph nodes in the neck; affected children can also develop redness in their eyes, lips, mouth, as well as the palms of their hands and soles of their feet, according to the National Institutes of Health. Most children recover, but if left untreated, Kawasaki can cause cardiac issues and become life-threatening. Toxic shock also causes fever and a decrease in blood flow, but is triggered by a bacterial infection.\n\nKawasaki disease mostly occurs in children under the age of 5, while a study of PMIS cases in Italy found an average age of 7\u00bd.\n\nWhile an understanding of PMIS is still evolving, children with the syndrome also experience a prolonged fever, rashes, change in the color of their skin or their lips, swollen glands and red eyes. What differentiates PMIS from Kawasaki appears to be complaints of abdominal pain, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and chest pain.\n\n\"What we're seeing is the immune system is actually going into overdrive, impacting the body in a negative way,\" Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric oncologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children, in New Orleans, who has treated several children for the illness, told CBS News. \"Some of these patients are having inflammation of their coronary arteries, and you can have basically a heart attack.\"\n\nAccording to Dr. Sean O'Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, the level of inflammation in the heart tends to be higher with PMIS, as compared to Kawasaki disease.\n\nAll together, the syndrome has shown to be more severe than Kawasaki. \"That's what's concerning,\" Petre told CBSN. \"And a lot of (PMIS) cases do require ICU, almost 80% of them.\"\n\nPMIS has been reported in over 100 children in New York, the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak. CBS News has tallied about 200 cases under investigation in 19 states and Washington, D.C., and cases have also been reported in at least six other countries.\n\nDoctors in Italy published a study Wednesday documenting numerous cases of PMIS linked to the coronavirus. Eight out of 10 children they studied with PMIS had antibodies to COVID-19, indicating that they had been infected.\n\nThe fact that the syndrome is appearing in places where coronavirus is prevalent suggests that there could be a correlation, O'Leary said. He cautioned, however, that it's still too early to say anything for certain: \"Some of the things I tell you will be true tomorrow, but some of them may not,\" he said.\n\nCBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula said, \"It's important to stress that in the grand scheme of the pandemic, this is rare. We're still learning a lot more about it.\"\n\nA majority of the children with PMIS symptoms reported in New York have also tested positive for COVID-19, but others have not. \"That is something we doctors don't have an explanation for,\" Petre said.\n\n\"If we talk about the frequency of Kawasaki disease, even the specialists in this disease say they've never seen more than five cases at once in one hospital,\" she said. \"So that's something definitely suspicious about the timing between COVID and these cases.\"\n\nAccording to O'Leary, PMIS cases seem to appear about a month after a peak of COVID-19 cases in an area. If the syndrome is brought on by a COVID-19 infection, the lag time for PMIS symptoms is a curious feature, he said. \"It's almost more surprising that most of these kids are (COVID-19) positive.\"\n\n\"That's the mystery, it's a lot like a delayed reaction,\" Petre said of the symptoms' onset.\n\nIf a child does present with PMIS symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor. According to Petre, if a child has a fever that doesn't go down and is resistant to medication for more than a day, a doctor should be contacted.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines for parents earlier this week advising them to call their pediatrician if they notice any of the following symptoms:\n\n\"In this syndrome early intervention is critical as children can decompensate very quickly, and they should seek medical attention immediately,\" Petre said.\n\nAccording to Petre and O'Leary, if a child is admitted for PMIS, their primary treatment will be supportive care. Fluids and medication would likely be administered to maintain blood pressure, as well as anti-inflammatory medication like steroids or immunoglobulin (IVIG).\n\n\"If you're not really aware of this syndrome that's being described, it could easily be missed,\" said Kleinmahon. \"Fortunately children overall are very resilient. And almost all of the cases, if we're able to knock down the inflammation and get them past the beginning stages of this, they're usually doing very well.\"",

    "Why experts aren't too worried about COVID-19 patients retesting positive for the coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Seoul -- South Korea has managed to keep its coronavirus outbreak relatively under control, with about 10,700 confirmed cases and only 1,600 patients still being treated today. So it has prompted concern around the world that officials say 292 of the patients who've recovered from the disease and been discharged from hospitals have since retested positive.\n\nAmong the key questions researchers are still grappling with on COVID-19 is the extent to which survivors will have immunity to the coronavirus that causes it, and whether it can flare up again in a patient who appeared to recover.\n\nBut the head of South Korea's Central Clinical Committee on New Infectious Diseases (KCDC) has downplayed concerns that those 292 test results suggest a worrying trait of the disease. Dr. Myoung Don Oh and his team say there's a \"high possibility\" the new positive tests are due to the limitations of the tests themselves, rather than COVID-19 reinfections.\n\nThe widely-used \"PCR\" tests are designed to detect even tiny quantities of virus in a patient's nose or throat, but they can't differentiate between dead virus and live, infectious virus particles.\n\nMyoung, who spoke at a conference Wednesday, said tests on animals have suggested COVID-19 patients could have some immunity to the virus for at least a year from the time of infection. The KCDC has repeatedly said more research is required, but it isn't sounding alarm bells.\n\n\"The virus can be detected (even in discharged patients) but this does not mean it is an infectious level,\" Dr. Jeffri Choi, Division Chief of Infectious Disease at Seoul Medical Center, told CBS News recently.\n\nChoi added that some recovered patients may even continue to show some respiratory symptoms and test positive for the disease, but that \"does not mean reactivation\" of the virus: \"We think it is a reconfirmed case, not reinfection or reactivation.\"\n\nHe said in such cases, the virus lingering in a patient's body appears not to be at an \"infectious level.\"",

    "With concern of a coronavirus second wave, testing and surveillance are \"critical,\" FDA commissioner says": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Following CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield's warning that a second wave of the coronavirus in the winter could be worse than the current outbreak, the FDA commissioner said the whole White House Coronavirus Task Force is concerned about a resurgence of the disease. Dr. Stephen Hahn said on \"CBS This Morning\" Wednesday that because of that possibility, surveillance and testing will be \"critical.\"\n\n\"Dr. Redfield's concern is that there also might be flu at the same time,\" Hahn said. \"But that's why we have built into the plan the surveillance mechanisms to look for the respiratory illnesses and then do the appropriate testing at that time. That's going to be a critical part of the reopening plan to allow us to move forward.\"\n\nThe United States is currently doing fewer than 200,000 new coronavirus tests per day, according to the COVID Tracking Project, but experts have said that number needs to at least double or triple for social distancing measures to be lifted safely.\n\nOn testing, Hahn said \"there is unlocked capacity in the country.\"\n\n\"We're working very closely with the governors and the state public health officials to make sure that the adequate supplies and the information about where those tests are available are made known to folks so that they can actually unlock that capacity,\" he said.\n\nHahn said he believes doubling the country's testing \"could be done this week if the appropriate identification occurs at the state level and then the supplies are there for them.\"\n\nThe FDA has issued 59 Emergency Use Authorizations for tests, Hahn said. Four are for antibody tests, and the rest are for diagnostic tests.\n\nIt also authorized the first at-home diagnostic test that will be made available to health care workers and first responders. If they have symptoms, they can fill out an online questionnaire and if they meet the CDC guidelines, they will be sent the nasal swab kit developed by LabCorp.\n\n\"It's very easy and safe to perform,\" Hahn said. \"Our data show that it's as accurate as having it performed in the doctor's office or in a clinic.\"",

    "Worker who died was never moved into new role, away from sick inmates - WCBI TV | Your News Leader": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "After a 39-year-old federal prison employee died and later tested positive for the new coronavirus, employees are speaking up about what they said are unsafe conditions at the facility where she worked.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons on Friday confirmed its first staff death potentially due to COVID-19. Robin Grubbs, a caseworker at the United States Penitentiary in Atlanta, was found dead in her home Tuesday and posthumously tested positive for the virus,\n\na BOP spokesperson said.\n\nCBS News spoke with four correctional officers at USP Atlanta who complained of insufficient access to protective equipment and inconsistent communication about how many staff and inmates were infected at any given time.\n\n\"Already, it's a stressful job. Already, you don't ever know what you're walking into, but to add this on, this pandemic, where it could jump on you and just take your life away like that, it's mind-boggling. It's terrifying,\" said one correctional officer who was a close friend of Grubbs.\n\nGrubbs's office, employees said, was located in the \"Baker 3\" unit, a previously empty area where the facility had begun to house inmates who were sick or exposed to the coronavirus. One friend said Grubbs had talked about not being provided with equipment to stay safe and that she was trying to get out of the unit.\n\nGrubbs was most recently a case manager and employees remembered her as a hard worker who just last month had scored a promotion to a job helping released inmates transition back into society. The position would have landed her an office in a different building. As the illness spread, she told friends she repeatedly asked to assume her new position and move to her new office but was never able to start her new job.\n\nTaneka Miller, Grubbs's colleague and executive secretary of the union representing USP Atlanta employees, said she spoke to Grubbs last week. \"She was like, 'Girl. Oh my God, they won't let me go for whatever reason. I'm so ready to go. I'm so ready to go,\" Miller said.\n\nJacquetta Rosemond, union treasurer and paint worker supervisor at USP Atlanta, was surprised that Grubbs hadn't moved to a different floor. As a case manager for the Baker unit, Grubbs would have been assigned to work with inmates on the first two floors of the building, but not with the sick and isolated inmates in Baker 3, Rosemond said.\n\n\"She didn't even get to go to her new job,\" Rosemond said. \"There was really no reason for her to stay on that unit... Those particular inmates in that unit were not on her caseload.\"\n\nA former colleague said that when the illness first hit the federal prison system, Grubbs tried to purchase her own mask. \"All she kept telling me was that she didn't want to catch the COVID-19. So she personally bought some masks, but, you know, everything was on backorder,\" the colleague said.\n\nRobin Grubbs Robin Grubbs/Facebook\n\nMiller said even surgical masks weren't readily available until last week when the prison began providing them weekly to each staff member. Three employees who ran into Grubbs in other units in the facility the week before she died said they saw her wearing either no mask or a surgical mask, and none said they had seen her with an N-95 mask.\n\nEmployees said that each USP Atlanta staff member would have had access to at least one N-95 mask starting around the end of March, but they needed to be fit-tested first. But Rosemond and Miller said that some officers weren't tested until April, while others were unwilling to reuse their single N-95 mask day after day.\n\nWhen asked about the availability of masks, claims of inconsistent communication and when Grubbs was scheduled to assume her new role, a Bureau of Prisons spokesperson on Sunday sent the following statement: \"We can acknowledge the death of an employee at USP Atlanta, however, there is no information or evidence relating to a cause of death.\" The agency declined to comment on the specific concerns raised by staff.\n\nRosemond and Miller told CBS News in March that Atlanta employees -- many of whom are charged with patting down hundreds of inmates per day -- could not reliably access gloves. Some staff members would purchase and wear their own gloves, Miller said, but many didn't own their own gloves and would use bare hands to pat-search inmates.\n\nRosemond and Miller said management distributed more PPE this month, but access remains inconsistent and many staff wished it had come sooner.\n\nFor weeks, Atlanta employees have told CBS News they wished management would notify them more frequently about the number of staff and inmate cases at the facility.\n\n\"The communication is horrible. It's late, it's last minute, and it's not full information,\" Miller said. \"It's like they're sitting on the information.\"\n\nMiller said 13 days after she was allegedly exposed to the virus on the job, a member of the medical staff contacted her and informed her that she'd been exposed. Because the incubation period was only 14 days and she hadn't experienced any symptoms, the staff member told her that she should come back to work for her next shift.\n\n\"I was highly pissed off,\" Miller said. \"I come home to a 2-year-old every day who does not have the best immune system.\"\n\nAfter the Georgia Bureau of Investigation Medical Examiner's Office informed BOP that Grubbs had posthumously tested positive for COVID-19, Woods sent a memo Friday to notify staff.\n\nA BOP spokesperson said that Grubbs's official cause of death has not yet been determined, as her autopsy is not yet complete.\n\nPrior to last week, three staff members told CBS News they were only officially informed of one inmate and two staff cases of COVID-19 at the Atlanta prison. On Thursday, Woods said in an email to staff that the facility had \"six staff and 12 inmate positive cases for COVID-19.\" On Friday, the BOP publicly reported three staff and eight inmate positive cases.\n\nAtlanta employees said they were confused by the discrepancy. Other than those two emails, Rosemond said, \"everything else was word of mouth.\"\n\n\"I don't feel safe,\" another correctional officer said. \"We're not being informed of how the numbers have changed.\"\n\nWhen asked about the discrepancy, a BOP spokesperson said, \"The positive test numbers are based on the most recently available confirmed lab results involving open cases from across the agency as reported by the BOP's Office of Occupational Health and Safety. BOP field sites may report additional updates throughout the day. Data on the dashboard is subject to change based on additional reporting by field sites.\"\n\nAs of Sunday, the Bureau of Prison said 495 federal inmates and 309 staffers have tested positive for COVID-19 nationwide. A total of 155 inmates and 29 staff have recovered from the disease, while 21 inmates have died. Since Attorney General William Barr encouraged the use of home detention on March 21, a total of 1,280 inmates have been sent to home confinement.\n\nRosemond said that as a case manager, Grubbs was at level 11 in the federal service pay scale, which would have put her annual salary somewhere between $67,437 and $87,667.\n\nEarlier this month, the union that represents prison staff, as well as 700,000 other federal employees, filed a class-action lawsuit against the BOP and other agencies for Hazard Pay, which would increase their hourly wage by up to 25%. The BOP declined to comment on the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges a pattern of employee exposure to COVID-19 due to lax safety standards. The complaint highlights the case of one BOP employee at FCI Oakdale who was given only gloves to wear as personal protective equipment while escorting an inmate to a nearby hospital. The employee later learned the inmate was sick with COVID-19.\n\nGrubbs's colleagues described her as someone who savored life. She was a passionate Atlanta Falcons fan and loved trying new restaurants, a work friend said, especially if seafood was involved. She traveled often and was constantly looking forward to her next trip, according to the friend, who said they'd recently fantasized about taking a trip to Belize this fall after the pandemic calmed down.\n\nGrubbs was an Army veteran and leaves behind her brother, parents, two grandmothers, and her beloved Yorkie named Louie.\n\nOn April 10, she posted a video of her parents after they had dropped off a \"Corona Care Package\" filled with cough medicine, ginger ale and hand sanitizer. She wrote, \"Airhugs because Corona is everywhere at this point... How did I get so lucky?\"",
